<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A non-linear power equation may be solved in linear form by locking a variable or variables and iteratively solving to provide a Web service for accurately and quickly estimating optimized power solutions for hydroelectric power stations. Additionally, these iterative calculations may provide for long term water resource planning and more accurate estimation models. Further, such optimized power solutions may be usable to create accurate and timely water management models for the operation and planning of hydroelectric power stations.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Hydroelectric power generation generally involves harnessing the force of moving water to generate electricity. In most cases, an electric generator generates electricity from the potential energy of dammed water that drives a water turbine. Often, a hydroelectric power station may generate electricity for an entire area; however, some hydroelectric stations are controlled by and for a single entity, such as a factory. There are many factors involved in the operation of hydroelectric power stations. For example, constraints such as reservoir volume, the difference in height (i.e., the head) between the reservoir (forebay) and the water's outflow (tailrace), turbine efficiency, water flow rates, and even water rights can each have effects on the amount of power generated at any given time.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Managers and operators of hydroelectric power stations are often confronted with difficult operational and planning decisions. For example, determining appropriate flow rates through each turbine or combinations of turbines, pumped-storage times and volumes, and turbine replacement options are all decisions that may face each hydroelectric power station manager or operator. Additionally, these operators may need to evaluate operational policy, optimize the system, administer water rights and accounting, and prepare long-term resource plans. Unfortunately, current products do not provide accurate or efficient solutions for handling today's highly competitive water resources needs.</p>

<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to, among other things, providing optimized hydroelectric solutions for managing and/or operating hydroelectric power stations or other types of water management systems. As an overview, hydroelectric power may be generated by harnessing the potential energy contained in dammed water that drives a turbine or water wheel, with the aid of an electric generator for converting the mechanical energy of the turbine into electricity. Mechanical gates or sluices may control the flow rate of the dammed water through the turbine. In some instances, pumps may channel the water back to the reservoir to store energy for peak hours. Station operators and managers generally face a myriad of challenges when controlling the flow and storage of water while attempting to optimize power production. This is due to the fact that many factors affect power output, such as turbine efficiency, head, and flow. Additionally, each of these factors may affect the other, such that the equation for calculating power,
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Power=(1/11.82)&#xb7;&#x3b7;&#xb7;<i>h&#xb7;Q</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equation 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where &#x3b7;=efficiency, h=head, and Q=flow rate, is a non-linear, multi-variable equation. For example, an increase in flow may directly affect efficiency and/or head; however, the relationships may not be linear. Additionally, other factors, such as water rights (e.g., tribal fishing rights, conservation and environmental regulations, etc.), private licenses, public grants, reservoir size, and rainfall can indirectly affect the power output by directly affecting the equation variables. For example, rainfall may affect head while licenses and grants may require changes in flow rate.
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some instances, a system of the present disclosure may receive hydroelectric power station data from a local data store, or from a remote server, for calculating an optimized power solution. Additionally, or in the alternative, the system may form optimization models for optimizing power over an extended period of time. The system may use an iterative process to calculate the optimized power solution linearly. As such, a variable of the power equation (Equation 1) may be locked with an estimated value to create a linear estimation. In some instances, the locked variable may be the head variable, while in other cases, the flow or the efficiency variables may be locked. Locking a variable entails setting a particular variable to a predetermined or estimated value so that it is no longer an unknown. As such, a solution to a single non-linear equation may be computed linearly. In some examples, based on locking a variable and solving linearly, a solution that historically would have taken hours, may now be returned in less than 60 seconds, or sometimes less than 10 seconds, depending on the sample size of data, the accuracy of the desired solution, and the speed of the computing system used to compute the solution. Multi-year studies that historically were impossible to solve may now be completed in hours or a few days.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, the head variable may be locked with an estimated head value. The system may then solve the equation for power using the estimated head value and known efficiency and flow data. Additionally, the known efficiency and flow data may be accessible, or extrapolated, from an efficiency curve for a particular turbine. Alternatively, the efficiency and flow data may be calculated based on historical data from a known power station, or it may be received from the remote server that provided the power station data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the head value is locked with an estimated head value, the system may then calculate an actual head value based at least in part on other information known about the power station. In one aspect, this other information may be flow and efficiency data from an efficiency curve, data from a historical spreadsheet, or measured data for a particular point in time. The calculated head value may then be compared to the estimated head value used in calculating the optimized power solution. In one aspect, if the difference is outside a predetermined tolerance threshold, and/or an iteration threshold has not been reached, the system may re-solve the equation for power using the calculated head value. Additionally, the system may iteratively repeat these calculations and comparisons until the head value difference (between the previously locked head value and the next calculated head value) is within the predetermined tolerance threshold or until the iteration threshold is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some aspects, the optimized power solution may be made up of each calculated power solution and/or data from each iteration. For example, the optimized power solution may include one power solution for a given time, a combination of power solutions for different respective times, or a combination including one or more power solutions and the associated variable inputs that formed each respective power solution for one or more respective times. The system may then populate a spreadsheet or database with the data, provide the data to a local user of the system, or provide the data to a remote server.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, the described techniques may also be used on water management systems that are not designed to generate power such as water storage reservoirs for flood control. Alternatively, or in addition, the described techniques may also be used for providing solutions to systems that both provide power generation and water storage.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The discussion begins with a section entitled &#x201c;Illustrative Architecture,&#x201d; which describes a non-limiting environment in which optimized power solutions may be iteratively calculated and provided. Next, a section entitled &#x201c;Illustrative Data&#x201d; follows and describes example data for implementing the described calculations. Finally, the discussion concludes with a section entitled &#x201c;Illustrative Processes&#x201d; and a brief conclusion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">This brief introduction, including section titles and corresponding summaries, is provided for the reader's convenience and is not intended to limit the scope of the claims, nor the proceeding sections. Furthermore, the techniques described above and below may be implemented in a number of ways and in a number of contexts. Several example implementations and contexts are provided with reference to the following figures, as described below in more detail. However, the following implementations and contexts are but a few of many.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Illustrative Architecture</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an illustrative architecture <b>100</b> in which techniques for iteratively calculating and providing optimized hydroelectric power solutions may be implemented. In architecture <b>100</b>, one or more users <b>102</b> may utilize local server <b>104</b> to access a system (or website) <b>106</b> for iteratively calculating and providing optimized hydroelectric power solutions. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more users <b>108</b> may utilize a remote server <b>110</b> to access the system <b>106</b> via a network <b>112</b>. Network <b>112</b> may include any one or a combination of multiple different types of wired or wireless networks, such as cable networks, the Internet, local area networks (LANs), and other private and/or public networks. While the illustrated example represents users <b>108</b> accessing system <b>106</b> over network <b>112</b>, the described techniques may equally apply in instances where users <b>108</b>, or users <b>102</b>, interact with the system <b>106</b> over the phone, via a kiosk, or in any other manner. It is also noted that the described techniques may apply in other client/server arrangements (e.g., via a dedicated terminal, etc.), as well as in non-client/server arrangements (e.g., locally-stored software applications, etc.) such as when users <b>102</b> access the system <b>106</b> via the local server <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As described briefly above, system <b>106</b> may allow users <b>102</b> or <b>108</b> to provide hydroelectric power station data <b>114</b> (&#x201c;hydro data&#x201d;) to system <b>106</b>. In some aspects, the users <b>102</b> may provide the hydro data <b>114</b> directly to the system via a data receiving module <b>116</b> to be stored in memory <b>118</b> of the local server <b>104</b>. In other aspects, however, users <b>108</b> may provide the hydro data <b>114</b> to the remote server <b>110</b>. Here, the remote server <b>110</b> may provide the hydro data <b>114</b> to system <b>106</b> via the network <b>112</b>. As noted above, system <b>106</b> may be implemented as a website <b>106</b> for interacting with users <b>108</b> over the network <b>112</b>. System <b>106</b> may additionally, or alternatively, be implemented as a Web service, or other application programming interface (API) that allows communication between the system <b>106</b> and users of computing devices other than local server <b>104</b>. In yet other examples, users <b>108</b> may provide hydro data <b>114</b> in any digital manner known, such that system <b>106</b> may receive it at the local server <b>104</b>. For example, users <b>108</b> may provide the hydro data <b>114</b> to system <b>106</b> via email, text message, compressed file, Hypertext Markup Language (&#x201c;HTML&#x201d;) file, Extensible Markup Language (&#x201c;XML&#x201d;) file, data stream or feed, etc. Additionally, in one example, the hydro data may be collected by a sensor network and received by system <b>106</b> in real-time or substantially real-time.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some examples, users <b>108</b> may provide data to system <b>106</b> and receive power solutions in exchange for fees. The fees may be one-time fees, fees based on a subscription basis, fees based at least in part on the granularity of the optimal power data, an amount of exchange of the optimal power data, fees based on a frequency of exchange of the optimal power data, fees based on a speed with which the optimal power data is provided, fees based on a number of clock cycles to determine the optimal power data, fees based on a number of computations to determine the optimal power data, and/or fees based on a power savings achievable using the optimal power data. Additionally, in some examples, optimal power data may be provided to remote server <b>110</b> in the form of potential profit estimates for a hydroelectric power station, results of a potential turbine comparison, results of a power savings analysis, and/or in the form of peak shaving data. Hydro data may also include a recommendation to make a change, perform an act (e.g., maintenance or replacement of turbines, open or close sluice gates), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, as noted briefly above, hydro data <b>114</b> may comprise hydroelectric power station data from a hydroelectric power station (or system) such as hydro-system <b>120</b>. In one aspect, hydro-system <b>120</b> represents a hydroelectric power station with one or more dams, reservoirs, turbines, generators, and/or transformers. The hydro data <b>114</b> may be data corresponding to an entire hydro-system made up one or more of each of the elements listed above, may be data corresponding to a hydro-system such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (i.e., hydro-system <b>120</b>) made up of a single reservoir, dam, turbine, generator, and transformer, or may be data corresponding to a hydro-system of any configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As noted above, local server <b>104</b>, or multiple local servers perhaps arranged in a cluster or as a server farm, may host system (or website) <b>106</b>. Other server architectures may also be used to host the system <b>106</b>. System <b>106</b> is capable of handling requests from many users and serving, in response, various user interfaces that can be rendered locally by a display device of the local server <b>104</b> or at user computing devices, such as remote server <b>110</b>. System <b>106</b> can be any type of software system or website that supports user interaction, including interaction with operators, managers, contractors, or other types of users, and so forth. However, as discussed above, the described techniques can similarly be implemented without a website altogether.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Taken together, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> allows users <b>102</b> and/or users <b>108</b> to request that optimized power solutions be calculated based on provided hydro data <b>114</b>. To illustrate, envision that user <b>108</b> accesses system <b>106</b> via network <b>112</b> and provides hydro data <b>114</b> corresponding to at least flow data, head data, and efficiency data for hydro-system <b>120</b> over the previous six months. In this example, the hydro data <b>114</b> may be provided in a spreadsheet file, database file, or other type of file for organizing data, with each respective value corresponding to a particular time of day for the six month period. In other examples, however, the system <b>106</b> may provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to user <b>108</b> (including text fields for entering data), displayed by the remote server <b>110</b>, which provides a method for manually entering the hydro data <b>114</b> or a method for uploading a file containing the hydro data <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates local server <b>104</b> and remote server <b>110</b> as personal computing devices, other types of computing devices may include laptop computers, portable digital assistants (&#x201c;PDAs&#x201d;), mobile phones, set-top boxes, game consoles, mainframe computers, super computers, data centers, and so forth. In each instance and as illustrated, each server is equipped with one or more processors <b>122</b> and memory <b>118</b> to store applications and data, such as the data receiving module <b>116</b> that enables hydro data <b>114</b> to be provided to system <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Once the data is received by system <b>106</b> via the Internet or other network connection, such as network <b>112</b>, the system <b>106</b> may iteratively calculate optimized power solutions based on the hydro data <b>114</b> and provide the optimized power solutions to the users <b>108</b> via the network <b>112</b>. In some instances the power solutions may be provided based on iteratively calculating, at a predetermined time interval granularity (e.g., one week, one day, or even one minute), until a tolerance percentage is reached, until an iteration threshold is reached, and/or until a predetermined time period has elapsed. In one some examples, the tolerance percentage may be 1%, 0.05%, or any other percentage based on the intended use of the solution.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further illustrates local server <b>104</b> having processing capabilities and memory suitable to store and execute computer-executable instructions. In this example, local server <b>104</b> includes one or more processor(s) <b>122</b>, communications interface(s) <b>124</b>, and memory <b>118</b>. Depending on the configuration of local server <b>104</b>, memory <b>118</b> is an example of computer storage media and may include volatile and nonvolatile memory. Thus, memory <b>118</b> may include, but is not limited to, random-access memory (&#x201c;RAM&#x201d;), read-only memory (&#x201c;ROM&#x201d;), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (&#x201c;EEPROM&#x201d;), flash memory, or other memory technology, or any other non-transmission medium which can be used to store digital items or applications and data which can be accessed by local server <b>104</b>. Computer storage media, however, does not include any data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave or other propagated transmission medium.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Memory <b>118</b> may be used to store any number of functional components that are executable on processor(s) <b>112</b>, as well as data and content items that are rendered by local server <b>104</b>. Thus, memory <b>118</b> may store an operating system and several modules containing logic.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As noted above, a data receiving module <b>116</b> located in memory <b>118</b> and executable on processor(s) <b>122</b> may facilitate receiving hydroelectric power station data, such as hydro data <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Memory <b>118</b> may further store variable locking module <b>126</b> to lock a variable of the non-linear, multi-variable power equation <b>128</b> (Equation 1). In one aspect, variable locking module <b>126</b> may be configured to lock the head variable by setting the &#x201c;h&#x201d; variable of the power equation <b>128</b> to an estimated head value. In some examples, the estimated head value may be selected from the hydro data <b>114</b>, from historical data of another power station, randomly, or in a pseudo-random fashion. In another aspect, however, variable locking module <b>126</b> may be configured to lock the efficiency variable or the flow variable by setting the &#x201c;&#x3b7;&#x201d; or &#x201c;Q&#x201d; variables to estimated values, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Memory <b>118</b> may also store linear estimation module <b>130</b> and iteration module <b>132</b>. Linear estimation module <b>130</b> may be configured to calculate a linear estimation of the non-linear power equation <b>128</b>. In other words, by locking a single variable, the non-linear power equation <b>128</b> becomes a linear equation and may be solved much faster and much less computationally demanding. While the solution is an estimate, the iteration module <b>132</b> described will generally converge on a solution that is more accurate than the original estimated solution. In one example, once the variable locking module <b>126</b> locks the head variable, and flow and efficiency data for a given time period are received from the hydro data <b>114</b> spreadsheet, the linear estimation module <b>130</b> may calculate an estimated power solution linearly.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Memory <b>118</b> may also store variable calculation module <b>134</b>, which may be configured to calculate an actual value for the variable that was previously locked by the variable locking module <b>126</b>. That is, in the example, where the head value is locked prior to the linear estimation, the variable calculating module <b>134</b> will calculate an actual head value. In some aspects, variable calculation module <b>134</b> may calculate the actual value based on an efficiency curve <b>136</b> for a particular turbine. In other examples, the actual value may be calculated based on other data from the hydro data <b>114</b> spreadsheet or other data known about the hydro-system <b>120</b>. Additionally, in some examples, the efficiency curve <b>136</b> may chart turbine efficiency against flow. This data may be provided by the manufacturer of the turbine, may be known from trials, or may be determined from historical data.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Iteration module <b>132</b> may be configured to iterate to within a tolerance and/or until an iteration threshold is reached. Iteration module <b>132</b> may also be configured to operate the linear estimation module <b>130</b> and the variable calculation module <b>134</b> repeatedly until such tolerance or threshold is reached. For example, until the tolerance or threshold are reached, the iteration module <b>132</b> may continue to instantiate the linear estimation followed by the variable calculation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, memory <b>118</b> may further store a tolerance checking module <b>136</b> configured to check whether the linear estimation module <b>130</b> has estimated the power solution to within the tolerance or whether the iteration threshold has been reached. In one example, an iteration threshold of 5 iterations may be pre-selected by users <b>102</b> or <b>108</b>. In this case, the tolerance checking module <b>136</b> will determine after the fifth iteration, that the condition has been met. The tolerance checking module <b>136</b> will then instruct the iteration module <b>132</b> to stop iterating. In another example, a tolerance of 1% may be pre-selected by users <b>102</b>, <b>108</b>, or by another user of system <b>106</b>. In this example, the tolerance checking module <b>136</b> will determine if the difference between the calculated actual value for the locked variable is within 1% of the value used for that variable in the last estimation iteration. If so, the tolerance check module <b>136</b> will instruct the iteration module <b>132</b> to stop iterating. In the alternative, the iteration module <b>132</b> will continue iterating until either the tolerance or the iteration threshold is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some instances, memory <b>118</b> may also store a solution providing module <b>138</b> configured to provide the optimized power solutions to users <b>102</b>, users <b>108</b>, or some other users who have requested the data. In some examples, providing optimized power solutions involves, storing the solutions in memory <b>118</b> or some other memory, displaying them to users <b>102</b> of the local server <b>104</b>, transmitting them over network <b>112</b> to remote server <b>110</b>, or preparing them for display to users <b>108</b>. Additionally, in some aspects, the optimized power solutions may be formatted such that they accurately may be represented or displayed within a spreadsheet application.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one general, non-limiting example, the following calculations may be performed by several of the afore-mentioned modules:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0035">An estimated head value of 20 meters is selected from a table of historical data and a tolerance of 1% is selected.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0036">Based on an appropriate efficiency curve, efficiency and flow values of 50% and 2 cubic feet per minute (&#x201c;CFM&#x201d;) (for example) are calculated and entered into to the power equation (Equation 1) along with the estimated head.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0037">An estimated power of 20 kW may be solved for based on the above values.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0038">Based on calculated forebay and tailrace changes that occurred in response to the flow of 2 CFM, an actual head may be calculated.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0039">In this example, the actual head is calculated to be 19.5 meters; thus, the percent difference is (20&#x2212;19.5)/20=0.025 or 2.5%.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0040">When 2.5% is compared against the selected 1% tolerance, the system determines that the estimated value is not within the tolerance and another iteration may be performed.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0041">During the next iteration, the calculated head value of 19.5 meters will be used as the head value.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0042">This process may continue until the head value converges to within the selected tolerance or until an iteration threshold is reached.</li>

<p id="p-0037" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an illustrative spreadsheet document of hydro-system data <b>200</b> for use by the system <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In one aspect, the hydro-system data <b>200</b> includes data collected over a period of time at a hydroelectric power station. In another aspect, the hydro-system data <b>200</b> includes iteratively created estimations of power solutions for a given turbine or a system of turbines. In yet another aspect, the hydro-system data <b>200</b> may be a combination of historical data and iterative calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">In one example, column A of the hydro-system data <b>200</b> may represent theoretical turbine efficiency for a given turbine for each flow. Additionally, column B of the hydro-system data <b>200</b> may represent each potential flow rate for the power station from 0 to 9,000 cubic feet per minute (CFM). In one example, column C may represent a benchmarked efficiency which is calculated by dividing the power curve efficiency (column A) by some historical data regarding the actual turbine or the actual efficiency at each given flow.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">In one aspect, column D of the hydro-system data <b>200</b> may represent the calculated power solution based on an estimated head value.

<p id="p-0041" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> are flow diagrams showing respective processes <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, and <b>500</b> for iteratively calculating and providing optimized power solutions for hydroelectric power stations. These processes are illustrated as logical flow graphs, each operation of which represents a sequence of operations that can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. In the context of software, the operations represent computer-executable instructions stored on one or more computer-readable storage media that, when executed by one or more processors, perform the recited operations. Generally, computer-executable instructions include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, and the like that perform particular functions or implement particular abstract data types. The order in which the operations are described is not intended to be construed as a limitation, and any number of the described operations can be combined in any order and/or in parallel to implement the process.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example flow diagram of process <b>300</b> for iteratively estimating optimized power solutions, and may, but need not, be implemented using the systems, architecture, and data of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0050">Process <b>300</b> includes receiving a tolerance threshold and data as inputs for making a power calculation at <b>302</b>. In one aspect, a user of a local computing device may provide the data. In other aspects, the data may be provided by a user of a remote computing device accessing process <b>300</b> over a network such as the Internet. Further, the tolerance threshold may be selected by a user through a GUI, pre-selected based on operational criteria, or set to a standard value. At <b>304</b>, process <b>300</b> may set one of the variables of the power calculation to an estimated value. In one aspect, process <b>300</b> may set the head variable to an estimated head value; however, other variables may be locked. At <b>306</b>, process <b>300</b> may solve for an optimal power solution linearly using the estimated value and the data received at <b>302</b>. For example, when the head variable is locked with an estimated head value, values for flow and efficiency may be selected from the received data for calculating the estimated power.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0051">Process <b>300</b> may also include calculating an actual value for the locked variable at <b>308</b>. In the above example, when the head variable is locked (i.e., set to an estimated value), the process <b>300</b> may calculate an actual head value here. At <b>310</b>, process <b>300</b> may determine a difference between the estimated value and the calculated value. That is, by way of example only, process <b>300</b> may determine the percentage difference between estimated head value and the calculated head value. In other aspects, however, estimated and calculated head values may be used, along with the flow and efficiency data used to solve the optimal power solution, to determine estimated and actual power. The estimated and actual power may then be used, along with market rate information, to determine an estimated dollar value and an actual dollar value for electricity at each time period. In some aspects, at <b>310</b>, process <b>300</b> may determine a percentage difference between the estimated dollar value and the actual dollar value.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0052">At <b>312</b>, process <b>300</b> may determine whether the percent difference is greater than the tolerance threshold received at <b>302</b>. If the percent difference is within the received tolerance threshold, process <b>300</b> may provide the optimal power solution at <b>314</b>. Optionally, at <b>316</b>, process <b>300</b> may store the optimal power solution as well. Alternatively, if the percent difference is less than the received tolerance threshold, process <b>300</b> may set the previously locked variable to the most recently calculated actual value for that variable at <b>318</b>. Following the same example as above, at <b>318</b>, process <b>300</b> may lock the head variable by setting it to the most recently calculated actual value. At <b>320</b>, process <b>300</b> may, once again, solve for optimal power linearly, this time using the most recently calculated actual value.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0053">At <b>322</b>, process <b>300</b> may calculate a next actual value for the newly locked variable. Process <b>300</b> may then determine the difference between the calculated actual value from <b>320</b> and the next actual value calculated at <b>322</b> to determine a percent difference. Again, process <b>300</b> will determine whether the difference (this time between the calculated actual value from <b>320</b> and the next actual value from <b>322</b>) is greater than the received tolerance threshold. As seen here, process <b>300</b> iterates from <b>318</b> to <b>324</b> and back to <b>312</b> until the desired tolerance is reached. In this way, both speed and accuracy can be controlled by selecting appropriate tolerance and iteration thresholds.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example flow diagram of process <b>400</b> for an alternative implementation for iteratively calculating an optimized power solution for a hydroelectric power station and may, but need not, be implemented using the systems, architecture, and data of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0055">Process <b>400</b> includes receiving inputs to a non-linear equation for calculating power at <b>402</b>. At <b>404</b>, process <b>400</b> may set the head variable to an estimated head value. Process <b>400</b> may solve a linear equation to produce a power solution based on the estimated head value at <b>406</b>. At <b>408</b>, process <b>400</b> may calculate an actual head based, at least indirectly, on the estimated head. In one example, the actual head is calculated by determining a flow rate and turbine efficiency for the original estimated head. In another example, however, the actual head is calculated by using historical data from a hydro-system. At <b>410</b>, process <b>400</b> may compare the calculated head to a predetermined tolerance threshold. In one aspect, this comparison involves determining a percent difference between the estimated head and the actual head and comparing the difference against the tolerance threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0056">At <b>412</b>, process <b>400</b> may determine whether the calculated head is within the predetermined threshold. Generally, being within a threshold implies that the percent difference between the actual and estimated head values is less than the tolerance threshold when the tolerance threshold is represented as a percentage. If, at <b>412</b>, process <b>400</b> determines that the calculated head, or percent difference, is within the tolerance threshold, process <b>400</b> may provide the power solution at <b>414</b>. On the other hand, if the calculated head, or percent difference, is still greater than the tolerance threshold, process <b>400</b> may iteratively re-calculate the power solution using the previously calculated head value at <b>416</b> and return to <b>408</b> for calculating a next actual head value based at least in part on the most recently calculated head. Here, as in process <b>300</b>, the iterative process may continue until the tolerance threshold is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example flow diagram of process <b>500</b> for an alternative implementation for iteratively calculating an optimized power solution for a hydroelectric power station and may, but need not, be implemented using the systems, architecture, and data of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0058">Process <b>500</b> includes receiving a request to calculate an optimal power solution for a hydroelectric turbine at <b>502</b>. At <b>504</b>, process <b>500</b> may begin an iterative estimation process for calculating an optimal power solution. Iterative estimation, at <b>506</b>, may include determining a first estimated power based at least in part on a first estimated head value at <b>508</b> and determining subsequent estimated power solutions based at least in part on a calculated head value at <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0059">At <b>512</b>, process <b>500</b> may decide whether the percent difference between the estimated value and the calculated value is within a tolerance. If not, at <b>514</b>, process <b>500</b> may determine whether an iteration threshold has been reached. If the percent difference is not within the tolerance at <b>512</b> and the iteration threshold is not reached at <b>514</b>, process <b>400</b> may return to <b>506</b> to implement another iterative estimation. On the other hand, if either the percent difference is within the tolerance at <b>512</b> or the iteration threshold is reached at <b>514</b>, process <b>500</b> may end the iterative estimation at <b>516</b>.</p>
