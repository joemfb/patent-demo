<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of streaming media using Internet Protocol (IP). More specifically, the present invention is related to monitoring and/or enhancing the quality of IP streaming media as seen by an end user.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Throughout this application, various publications, patents and published patent applications are referred to by an identifying citation. The disclosures of the publications, patents and published patent applications referenced in this application are hereby incorporated by reference into the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Streaming Video-over-IP is a technology which allows the end user to watch video content over an IP network. Examples of Video-over-IP include Video on Demand (VoD), and IPTV (Internet Protocol Television). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a Video-over-IP network may include a service provider network <b>134</b> including one or more remote video servers <b>1</b>, a core network (e.g., Internet) <b>3</b>, and a local hub/edge switch <b>5</b>, such as a CATV hub or DSLAM. This network <b>134</b> is then coupled to customer premises equipment (CPE) such as a set top box (STB) <b>7</b> and television <b>9</b> (often including various other home networking equipment), via a Network Interface Device (NID) typically located at a consumer's home. In addition to delivering streaming media to the consumer's home, the Video-over-IP technology allows the consumer to control the stream through the STB, enabling features such as channel changes (by selecting the particular stream(s) to be delivered), fast forward, pause, and rewind.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A disadvantage of conventional streaming media is that the quality of the IP stream may be degraded as it travels over the network before arriving at the end point (e.g., a consumer's television <b>9</b>). Service providers may place monitors at various points along the network <b>134</b> to measure the Quality Of Service (QOS) of the streams. In this manner, service providers can relatively easily measure QOS at points between server <b>1</b> and local hub <b>5</b> to isolate network problems occurring therein. However, the QOS of ultimate concern is that experienced by the consumer at the video destination or end point, such as the consumer's television <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When responding to a customer complaint of poor video quality, a service provider may initially check network <b>134</b> for QOS issues. In the event an acceptable QOS is detected at hub <b>5</b>, service providers generally have no choice but to send a service technician to the consumer's premises to attempt to isolate the problem within the CPE. As many QOS problems are transient, a service technician may be required to make repeated visits to a consumer's home, at various times of day, in order to locate and properly diagnose the problem(s). It has been estimated that in many instances, the total cost to a service provider of sending a service technician to a consumer's home is at least $1,000.00 per visit. The service provider's inability to remotely monitor the quality of service from outside the consumer's home thus tends to be responsible for relatively high customer service costs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, a need exists for a relatively low cost system and method which would allow one to remotely monitor the QOS of streaming media within a user's customer premises equipment.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized. It is also to be understood that structural, procedural and system changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. For clarity of exposition, like features shown in the accompanying drawings are indicated with like reference numerals and similar features as shown in alternate embodiments in the drawings are indicated with similar reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Briefly described, embodiments of the present invention include a system configured for placement within a customer's local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), for monitoring QOS thereat and reporting back to a remote location (e.g., to the service provider). For example, the system may be installed in line between a Network Interface Device (NID), which typically serves as a gateway between the service provider's network and the user's Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). The system receives and processes an incoming packet stream, such as by making a copy of the stream and sending the copy (e.g., via backhaul stream) to the remote location for analysis, while forwarding the original incoming packet stream to the CPE for viewing. Thus, once installed at a user's premises, the system may be used by service providers to conveniently (and remotely) identify and resolve QOS problems existing within the user's CPE.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, or alternatively, the system may itself perform an analysis of the incoming stream. Exemplary methods usable by these embodiments for analyzing media streams include those disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/396,753, entitled System and Method for Analyzing the Performance of Multiple Transportation Streams of Streaming Media in Packet-Based Networks, filed on Apr. 3, 2006; application Ser. No. 10/604,997, entitled System and Method for Analyzing the Performance of Multiple Transportation Streams of Streaming Media in Packet-Based Networks, filed on Aug. 29, 2003; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/257,183, entitled System and Method for Creating Multiple Transportation Streams of Streaming Media Network Test Traffic in Packet-Based Networks, filed on Oct. 24, 2005, the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. Embodiments of the system may also take steps to remediate any detected errors in the incoming stream, such as by the use of conventional Forward Error Correction techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The system may thus be conveniently installed at the user's premises upon a report by a user of a QOS problem. In this regard, because the system simply connects in-line between common network elements using standard connectors, it may be delivered to the user, e.g., via mail or overnight delivery, for self-installation. Alternatively, it may be delivered and/or quickly installed by a service technician who may happen to be in the neighborhood. Once installed, the system may monitor the media stream(s) passing therethrough for extended periods of time to enable even infrequent, transient QOS problems to be identified. The system may also be left installed at the user's premises for extended periods of time, such as in the event it is more cost effective to simply correct errors in the stream, than to address the source of the errors.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Embodiments of the invention may also capture data associated with user's actions, which may prove useful to the service provider or third party in diagnosing QOS issues and/or to otherwise enhance the customer's experience. For example, the system may capture user commands to the STB, such as channel changes, and then compute statistics associated with this captured data. For example, the system may compute and record the time elapsed between when the channel change command is entered, and when the selected channel begins streaming through the user's STB. Various other aspects of the invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the appended Figures.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the term NID may include any number of common gateway devices such as a Residential DSL Gateway, and a Service Area Interface. Similarly, the term CPE (customer premises equipment) includes nominally any network devices or elements and communication media located at a customer's premises, through which streaming media may flow, including Local Area Networks (LANS) formed by structured wiring (e.g., CAT5x), Wi-Fi or other wireless links, coaxial cable, telephone wiring, electrical power wiring, etc., such as may be defined by various standards organizations such as the Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MOCA), which recommends specifications for networks using coaxial cable, and the Home Phoneline Networking Alliance (HPNA), which recommends specifications for home networks using telephone jacks and telephone wire. Examples of such network devices include routers, switches, Set Top Boxes (STBs), bridges, switches, hubs, repeaters, multilayer switches, protocol converters, digital media receivers, proxies, firewalls, multiplexers, network cards, modems, ISDN terminal adapters, line drivers, and display devices such as computers, televisions, monitors, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), Smart Phones, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Turning now to the Figures, various embodiments of the present invention will be described in greater detail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an embodiment of the present invention includes a system <b>310</b> having a video source-, or network interface device (NID)-side port <b>101</b>, and a video destination-, or Set Top Box (STB)-side port <b>103</b>. Port <b>101</b> is configured for communicably coupling (directly or via other network elements) to an NID <b>102</b> e.g., for receiving an incoming packet stream <b>104</b> from provider network <b>134</b>. Port <b>103</b> is configured for communicably coupling (directly or via other CPE network elements) to a video destination <b>108</b> such as an STB 7, TV 9, personal computer, etc., for transmitting the incoming packet stream thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The incoming stream <b>104</b> may be in nominally any desired format suitable for transmission over a packetized network. In exemplary embodiments, stream <b>104</b> is in the conventional MPEG-2 TS (Motion Pictures Expert Group-2 Transport Stream) format, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. As shown, the content may be contained in a series of 188-byte MPEG-2 packets <b>11</b>, which are encapsulated in a UDP (User Datagram Protocol) datagram and IP headers <b>13</b> and <b>15</b>. The completed MPEG-2 TS packet includes provisions for a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) <b>17</b>, and the Ethernet protocol <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As also shown, system <b>310</b> includes a compute engine <b>110</b> communicably disposed between ports <b>101</b> and <b>103</b>. Engine <b>110</b> is configured to receive <b>112</b> the incoming packet stream <b>104</b>, process <b>114</b> the incoming packet stream <b>104</b>, and then forward <b>116</b> the post-processing packet stream <b>106</b> to the destination <b>108</b>. In addition, system <b>310</b> includes a transmission module <b>122</b> configured to communicate to an optional remote monitoring or controlling station <b>128</b>, via network <b>134</b> (e.g., through port <b>101</b> and NID <b>102</b> as shown) or optionally, any other suitable communications (e.g., cellular) link <b>136</b>. The data <b>107</b> generated by processing module <b>114</b> may thus be transmitted by module <b>122</b> to remote station <b>128</b> (or elsewhere) for analysis, and/or for further remedial action, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As mentioned hereinabove, the processing module <b>114</b> may effect any number of operations useful in determining the QOS of incoming stream <b>104</b>. For example, this processing may include calculating the MDI of stream <b>104</b>. Alternatively, processing module <b>114</b> may simply make (and optionally store) a copy of stream <b>104</b> for later review and analysis. The processed data may be stored within an optional memory or database <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for later retrieval, such as upon return of system <b>310</b> to the service provider. Alternatively, the processed/captured data may be transmitted (e.g., streamed) to a remote location or to the service provider for analysis, as will be discussed hereinbelow with reference to alternate system <b>310</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Still further, streams <b>104</b> that have been identified as suffering impairments may be &#x201c;repaired&#x201d;, such as by an optional error correction module <b>105</b> associated with processing module <b>114</b>. Module <b>105</b> may thus include any of various error correction means, such as conventional Forward Error Correction (FEC) algorithms. Module <b>105</b> may then operate in concert with conventional upstream equipment which may add repair information (e.g., FEC flows), which may then be used by module <b>105</b> along with the original stream to reconstruct the unimpaired flow. FEC flows thus may be provided by the service provider in a conventional manner, e.g., using some bandwidth that may otherwise be available for other services provided to the user, such as high speed data or voice services. Error correction module <b>105</b> may then use the FEC flows to repair any impairments at the user's premises. It is expected that in many applications, repairing the streams <b>104</b> in this manner may be more cost effective than eliminating the source of the impairments, such as by replacing wiring or other facilities at the user's premises.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Embodiments of the invention may thus transmit information regarding the quality of the incoming stream to remote (e.g., upstream) locations, while simultaneously repairing the stream. Moreover, the stream repair may be effected dynamically, e.g., when the incoming stream quality drops below a predetermined threshold, as determined by either the processing module <b>114</b>, or by the remote monitoring station <b>128</b>. Such dynamic repair may also be used to dynamically control the FEC flow, e.g., to eliminate the FEC flow (and thus free up bandwidth for other services) when the quality of the incoming stream is satisfactory. Thus, by tracking the dynamic performance of a video flow through its Quality of Service parameters, these embodiments may request the additional repair flow dynamically and thus impact the other services only if needed. Processing options will be described in greater detail hereinbelow with respect to various optional embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown as system <b>310</b>&#x2032;, which includes the components and basic functionality provided by system <b>310</b>. As a further option, compute engine <b>110</b>&#x2032; may capture <b>118</b> user data <b>124</b> from destination <b>108</b> (e.g., from the user's television or cable box remote control). Examples of such user data <b>124</b> include user commands such as selection of video content (i.e., channel changes) along with the delay experienced by the user from the moment he presses the channel change button on his remote to the time the channel starts streaming to STB <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Data <b>124</b> may also include the user's use of so-called &#x201c;trick mode&#x201d; commands such as rewind, fast forward, pause, stop. User data may also include a log of use of a user input device such as button <b>306</b> described hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">This user data is processed (e.g., captured) by processing module <b>114</b>, and may then be stored in optional non-volatile memory or database <b>170</b>, such as in the form of a log. In addition, or alternatively, this user data may be forwarded via transmission module <b>122</b> to remote monitoring station <b>128</b> as discussed hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">While remote station <b>128</b> has been described as receiving data forwarded by transmission module <b>122</b>, the communication may be two-way, or duplex, to permit data transfer to be initiated either by compute engine <b>110</b>&#x2032; or by station <b>128</b>. For example, data transfer may be initiated by engine <b>110</b>&#x2032;, in which data is forwarded automatically, e.g., at a predetermined interval or upon a triggering event such as receipt of a particular user command at module <b>114</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, data transfer may be initiated by remote station <b>128</b>, such as by polling system <b>310</b>&#x2032;. This polling ability may also be used to effect various other actions, such as reprogramming or rebooting system <b>310</b>&#x2032; remotely.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As a further option, a video test clip <b>132</b> of known quality parameters may stored within system <b>310</b>&#x2032; for forwarding by transmission module <b>116</b> to another system <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>&#x2032;, located within the customer's LAN (e.g., at a location closer to destination <b>108</b>) as described in greater detail hereinbelow with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The quality of the video clip <b>132</b> may then be monitored by the other system <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>&#x2032;, to help determine whether QOS problems lie in the CPE disposed between the two systems.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning now to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, some of the operations effected by processing module <b>114</b> are shown in detail. Parameters associated with the incoming stream <b>104</b> may be measured/analyzed <b>164</b>. The parameters may include any of those parameters disclosed in Technical Report 101 290 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), including the quality parameters discussed hereinbelow with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Some of these parameters are listed in the following Table 1. Parameters listed under Priorities 1 and 2 relate to the packet stream, and parameters under Priority 3 relate to specific applications associated therewith.</p>

Data on the measured parameters <b>160</b>, <b>164</b> may be stored <b>166</b> (e.g., in optional database <b>170</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for future access, and/or forwarded at <b>106</b> to destination <b>108</b> as described above.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Processing module <b>114</b> may also generate <b>140</b> a copy of the incoming stream, as discussed above, optionally stamping <b>146</b> the copied stream, e.g., with a time stamp and/or stream identification, and storing <b>148</b> the copied stream in optional database <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for future reference. Alternatively, or in addition, the copied stream may itself be streamed to remote monitoring station <b>128</b> by replacing <b>150</b> the destination information in the IP headers of the copied stream's packets with destination information (e.g., an IP address) associated with remote station <b>128</b>.

This screen <b>200</b> may be viewed in monitoring station <b>128</b> on a display <b>308</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, discussed below) within system <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>&#x2032;, and/or on a local display device such as a PDA or Smart Phone. These parameters may include the MDI value <b>202</b>, which includes the Delay Factor (DF) <b>203</b> and the Media Loss Rate (MLR) <b>204</b>. This information may prove valuable to a service provider. For example, if the DF <b>203</b> is high and the MDR <b>204</b> is zero, then packets have not been lost even though significant packet jitter is present on the network. If the DF <b>203</b> is low but MLR <b>204</b> indicates packet loss, then the MPEG Transport Stream may be corrupted. If the MLR <b>204</b> indicates packet loss and DF <b>203</b> is high, packets are likely being lost in the network path.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Also displayed in this embodiment are the Bitrate <b>206</b>, the Average Rate <b>208</b>, and the Deviation <b>210</b> (Dev) from the MPEG encoded bit rate, all in Megabytes per second (Mb/s). The Average Rate <b>208</b> indicates whether the stream conforms to the specified rate over a measure of time. A relatively large Dev <b>210</b> may indicate server configuration problems or stream encoding problems. The measured minimum packet size <b>212</b> (Min Pkt Size) and maximum packet size <b>214</b> (Max Pkt Size) may be checked to confirm that the expected packets and only the expected packets are being received. For example, an MPEG-2 constant bit stream with seven 188 byte Transport Stream packets per Ethernet packet with UDP/IP encapsulation should result in the stream's constant packet size of 1362 bytes. Packets of mixed sizes may indicate the presence of a misaddressed or non-MPEG stream. The Instantaneous Flow Rate (IFR) <b>216</b> and the Instantaneous Flow Rate Deviation (IFRD) <b>218</b> confirm a stream's nominal flow rate. As discussed above, nominally any parameters may be measured and displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an exemplary GUI screen <b>220</b> displays the derived video stream at remote station <b>128</b>, which as described hereinabove, is a copy of nominally identical quality to that passing to video destination <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, system <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>&#x2032;, may be enclosed in a housing having ports <b>101</b>, <b>103</b>, an optional display or screen <b>308</b>, as discussed above, and an optional user actuatable input device such as a button <b>306</b>. This button, for example, may be actuated by the user when experiencing problems with the quality of video. The compute engine <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032; may store as user data, a log of the times and conditions under which the button <b>306</b> was pressed within database <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Screen <b>308</b> may display various QOS information such as the measured quality and security parameters, allowing the user direct access to the benefits of system <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>&#x2032;. The display screen may also be helpful in the event the user is speaking over the telephone with a service technician, who may direct the user to read the information on the display screen <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a method of use <b>400</b> associated with an embodiment of the present invention. In step <b>402</b>, an incoming packet stream is received through an NID. Next, in step <b>404</b>, the received packet stream is processed. Step <b>404</b> may include the optional steps of Measuring quality parameters <b>406</b>, Repairing the incoming stream <b>407</b>, e.g., with FEC, Generating a copy of the incoming packet stream <b>412</b>, and Measuring security parameters <b>408</b>. Next are the optional steps of Storing data <b>414</b> and Transmitting data to a remote location <b>416</b>, such as for dynamically signaling a service provider to start and stop the FEC as desired. The step of Measuring security parameters <b>408</b> may lead to the step of Discarding packets which do not meet security requirements <b>418</b>. Step <b>420</b> includes forwarding the incoming packet stream to video destination <b>108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, optional method <b>500</b> associated with embodiments of the present invention includes capturing <b>502</b>, user data from the customer premises equipment. The user data is then processed <b>504</b>. Step <b>504</b> may include the optional steps of Storing <b>506</b> the user data, Maintaining <b>508</b> a log of user commands, and Maintaining <b>510</b> a log of QOS Problems. Data may then be transmitted <b>512</b> to a remote location.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, as mentioned above, multiple instances of system <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>&#x2032; may be deployed at various locations within the CPE forming a user's LAN or home network <b>600</b>. As mentioned hereinabove, service providers generally have no oversight on such end user's home networks, and they often include components and cabling of various types. For example, networks are often formed not only with traditional computer networking wiring, but with legacy wiring such as Coaxial cable, telephone wire, and even home power lines. Moreover, networking devices of various types, construction, and function are often connected. As such, these home networks often vary widely in quality. These networks often may not meet applicable specifications, such as the MOCA specifications recommended for coaxial cable, and the HPNA specifications for networks connected with telephone wire and telephone jacks.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It may therefore be useful to place additional systems <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>&#x2032; at various locations, such as shown by way of example, within representative home network <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Such placement of <b>310</b> at various points of the network may be used to pinpoint problems along the network. For example, as discussed above, an optional video clip <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) with known parameters may be sent over the home network and analyzed at various points along the network. A drop in quality between two systems <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>&#x2032; may indicate problems with the connections or other network elements disposed therebetween. For example, shielding on coaxial cable linking Computer Networking Devices could degrade, leaving the cable prone to electrical interference. Users may have installed less expensive older style RG-59/U cable instead of more robust RG-6/U cable. Problems could also arise from improper installation of a home network, such as the improper use of splitters with coaxial cable and/or wiring of jacks. The problem may also be pinpointed to a faulty computer networking device.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It should be understood that any of the features described with respect to one of the embodiments described herein may be used with any other of the embodiments described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the preceding specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims that follow.
