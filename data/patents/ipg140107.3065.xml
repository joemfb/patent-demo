<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0011197, filed on Feb. 8, 2011, entitled &#x201c;Printed Circuit Board&#x201d;, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, a trend of multifunctional and high-speed electronic products has progressed at a rapid speed. In order to cope with this trend, a heating element such as a semiconductor chip and a printed circuit board mounted with the heating element connecting the heating element to a main substrate have also been developed at a very rapid speed. This trend is closely related to the trend of high-speed and high-density printed circuit boards. In order to satisfy them, significant performance improvement and development with respect to the slimness and lightness, the fine circuit, the high reliability, and the high-speed signal transfer structure of the printed circuit board are demanded.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, in accordance with the development of the printed circuit board, more electronic products are mounted on the printed circuit board. A considerable amount of heat is generated in the printed circuit board due to the increase in the number of the mounted electronic products and the density thereof. Therefore, research into a printed circuit board capable of rapidly radiating heat generated from the heating element, etc., has been conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The printed circuit board according to the prior art has been basically configured of a base substrate including an insulating layer and an inner circuit layer, and a heating element mounted on the base substrate. In this configuration, heat generated from the heating element was radiated to the outside through the base substrate. Therefore, the heating element formed on the base substrate was not applied with high heat, thereby making it possible to prevent the performance of the heating element from being degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the case of the printed circuit board according to the prior art, the heat generated from the heating device was conducted to the base substrate in direct contact with the heating element and was then radiated to the outside of the printed circuit board. That is, the heat generated from the heating device was radiated through only a single moving path. Taking into consideration of the trend of slimness and lightness of the printed circuit board and the trend of increasing the number and density of electronic components mounted on the printed circuit board, there was a limitation in heat conduction capability of the base substrate, which has an influence on the circuit layer and the heating element formed on the printed circuit board, thereby deteriorating the entire reliability of a product.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made in an effort to provide a printed circuit board in which a coating material having heat radiation characteristics is applied to an outermost circuit layer to prevent short-circuit and corrosion of the outermost circuit layer of the printed circuit board and a radiation path of heat generated from a heating element is additionally provided to thereby further improve heat-radiation performance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a printed circuit board including: a base substrate; a circuit layer formed on one surface of the base substrate and including an opening formed therein; and a heat radiation coating material applied to the opening to thereby radiate heat generated from the base substrate to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The printed circuit board may further include a heat sink attached to the other surface of the base substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The printed circuit board may further include a heating element attached to one surface of the base substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The base substrate may include: a core layer; and an insulating layer formed on one surface or both surfaces of the core layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The core layer may be made of a metal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The core layer may be made of a ceramic.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The heat radiation coating material may be made of an organic material and a ceramic filler.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The ceramic filler may be made of alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), a carbon nanotube (CNT), boron nitride (BN), or a combination thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Various objects, advantages and features of the invention will become apparent from the following description of embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The terms and words used in the present specification and claims should not be interpreted as being limited to typical meanings or dictionary definitions, but should be interpreted as having meanings and concepts relevant to the technical scope of the present invention based on the rule according to which an inventor can appropriately define the concept of the term to describe most appropriately the best method he or she knows for carrying out the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In the specification, in adding reference numerals to components throughout the drawings, it is to be noted that like reference numerals designate like components even though components are shown in different drawings. Further, when it is determined that the detailed description of the known art related to the present invention may obscure the gist of the present invention, the detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a printed circuit board according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A printed circuit board <b>100</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is configured to include a base substrate <b>111</b>, a circuit layer <b>130</b> formed on one surface of the base substrate <b>111</b> and including an opening <b>170</b> formed therein, a heat radiation coating material <b>160</b> applied to the opening <b>170</b> to thereby radiate heat generated from the base substrate <b>111</b> to the outside, and a heat sink <b>150</b> formed on the other surface of the base substrate <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The base substrate <b>111</b> is configured of a core layer <b>110</b> and an insulating layer <b>120</b> formed on one surface or both surfaces of the core layer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The core layer <b>110</b>, which is a basic component of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, basically improves the strength of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>. The core layer <b>110</b> may be made of various metals such as copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), hafnium (Hf), zinc (Zn), etc., or a ceramic such as aluminum nitride (AlN), etc. However, the material of the core layer <b>110</b> is not specifically limited. Meanwhile, the insulating layer <b>120</b> is formed on one surface or both surface of the core layer <b>110</b>. The insulating layer <b>120</b> may be made of an insulating material generally used for the printed circuit board <b>100</b>. As the insulating material, for example, a complex polymer resin such as prepreg (PPG), an epoxy based resin such as FR-4, BT, etc, an Ajinomoto build-up film (ABF), etc., may be used. However, the material of the insulating layer is not specifically limited thereto. That is, all insulating materials known in the art may be used. Meanwhile, the insulating layer may be made of a liquid state insulating material or a film type insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, the core layer <b>110</b> configuring the base substrate <b>111</b> according to the present invention may be made of aluminum (Al). In this case, the insulating layer <b>120</b> may be made of alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). The alumina is an insulating material formed to be closely adhered to a surface of aluminum by an anodizing reaction of aluminum. The aluminum is a light material, thereby making it possible to reduce the entire weight of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Meanwhile, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a case in which the base substrate <b>111</b> is configured of the single core layer <b>110</b> and the insulating layer <b>120</b>, the present invention is not limited thereto. The base substrate <b>111</b> may also be configured of a build-up layer including a plurality of insulating layers <b>120</b>, a circuit board <b>130</b>, and a via (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The circuit layer <b>130</b> is formed on the insulating layer <b>120</b> configuring the base substrate <b>111</b> and has a predetermined pattern. The circuit layer <b>130</b> has the opening <b>170</b> formed therein, and includes a pad part <b>135</b>. The pad part <b>135</b> is a portion on which a heating element <b>140</b> is mounted. The heating element <b>140</b> may be mounted on the pad part <b>135</b> or may be in direct contact with the insulating layer <b>120</b> exposed by the opening <b>170</b>. The circuit layer <b>130</b> may be made of an electrical conductive metal such as gold, silver, copper, nickel, etc., and may be generally made of copper without being specifically limited.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The heat radiation coating material <b>160</b> is applied to the opening <b>170</b> in the circuit layer <b>130</b>, thereby making it possible to simultaneously perform a solder resist function and a heat radiation function. That is, the heat radiation coating material <b>160</b> has both of the insulation and the heat radiation characteristics. The heat radiation coating material <b>160</b> is made of an organic material and a ceramic filler. Here, the ceramic filler is made of alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), a carbon nanotube (CNT), boron nitride (BN), or a combination of at least one thereof. The carbon nanotube (CNT) has excellent thermal conductivity to thereby serve to improve the heat radiation characteristics of the heat radiation coating material <b>160</b>. In addition, the boron nitride (BN), which is a material having excellent thermal conductivity, heat resistance, etc., is added to components of the heat radiation coating material <b>160</b> to improve the heat radiation characteristics of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>. Further, the heat radiation coating material <b>160</b> has a property in which it does not react with various chemical substances (for example, lead) and has excellent insulation characteristics, such that it may be substituted for a solder resist protecting the printed circuit board <b>100</b> and insulating between portions in the circuit board <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The heat radiation coating material <b>160</b> is formed on the insulating layer <b>120</b> or the pad part <b>135</b>, and is applied around the heating element <b>140</b> to electrically insulate the heating element <b>140</b> from the circuit board <b>130</b> and to radiate heat generated from the base substrate <b>111</b> or the heating element <b>140</b> to the outside of the printed circuit board <b>100</b> through heat conduction or heat radiation, thereby making it possible to improve the performance or the lifespan of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>. Since the heat radiation coating material <b>160</b> is in direct contact with the heating element <b>140</b> or is in indirect contact with the heating element <b>140</b> in the vicinity of the heating element <b>140</b> through the pad part <b>135</b>, it has higher heat radiation efficiency, as compared to heat conduction and heat radiation through the heat sink <b>150</b> described below. That is, a portion of heat conducted to the core layer <b>110</b> is discharged to the outside of the printed circuit board <b>100</b> through the heat radiation coating material <b>160</b>, thereby making it possible to supplement a limitation in heat radiation of the heat sink <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The heat sink <b>150</b> is attached to the other surface of the base substrate <b>111</b> to radiate the heat generated from the heating element <b>140</b> or the base substrate <b>111</b> to the outside of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>. That is, the heat generated from the heating element <b>140</b> is conducted to the base substrate <b>111</b>, and the heat sink <b>150</b> radiates the heat conduced to the base substrate <b>111</b> to the outside of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>. Therefore, heat exchange may be smoothly performed between the printed circuit board <b>100</b> and the heat sink <b>150</b>. The heat sink <b>150</b> may be formed to include a flat plate shaped base part <b>153</b> and a heat radiation pin <b>155</b> formed to protrude in a protrusion shape on one surface of the base part <b>153</b>. The heat sink <b>150</b> having this shape increases an exposure area, thereby making it possible to improve heat radiation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The heat generated from the heating element <b>140</b> is conducted through the pad part <b>135</b> (or the insulating layer <b>120</b> in the case in which the heating element <b>140</b> is directly mounted on the insulating layer <b>120</b>), and the heat conducted to the insulating layer <b>120</b> through the pad part <b>135</b> arrives at the core layer <b>110</b> (shown as a solid line). The printed circuit board <b>100</b> according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention radiates the heat through the following path.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">First, as described above, the heat conducted to the base substrate <b>111</b> is radiated to the outside of the printed circuit board <b>100</b> through the heat sink <b>150</b> attached to the other surface of the base substrate <b>111</b> (shown in a solid line). The heat is more effectively radiated through the base part <b>153</b> configuring the heat sink <b>150</b> and the protrusion-shaped heat radiation pin <b>155</b> extended and protruded from the base part <b>153</b> to have a wide surface area.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Meanwhile, the heat conducted to the base substrate <b>111</b> is radiated through the heat radiation coating material <b>160</b> applied to the opening <b>170</b> in the circuit layer <b>130</b> (shown as a dot line). A heat radiation path through the heat radiation coating material <b>160</b> corresponds to a technical characteristic of the present invention. A portion of the heat conducted to the base substrate <b>111</b> is radiated to the outside of the printed circuit board <b>100</b> through the heat radiation coating material <b>160</b>, thereby making it possible to supplement a limitation in heat radiation of the heat sink <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the present invention, the heat radiation coating material is applied to a portion of the circuit layer formed on an outermost portion of the printed circuit board, thereby making it possible to improve the heat radiation performance of the printed circuit board</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, according to the present invention, the heat radiation coating material also serves as the solder resist, thereby making it possible to insulate and protect the printed circuit board without a separate solder resist.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail, they are for specifically explaining the present invention and thus a printed circuit board according to the present invention is not limited thereto, but those skilled in the art will appreciate that modifications and alteration are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Accordingly, such modifications and alterations should also be understood to fall within the scope of the present invention and a specific scope of the present invention will be defined by the following claims.</p>
