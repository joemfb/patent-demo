<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the Figures in which like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Passive transponder systems are used worldwide for many identification purposes. Standard frequencies are generally 125 kHz (low frequency) and 13.56 MHz (high frequency). Additionally, new frequencies in the range of 900 MHz (ultra-high frequency or UHF) (e.g., 915 MHz for USA, 868 MHz for Europe), and 2.45 GHz (microwave frequency) are also used.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Passive transponder systems have no power supply within the transponder, and are considerably less expensive than active transponders which contain other components, including a battery for power. The passive transponder is powered by an electromagnetic field of the reader. Typically a single internal antenna of the transponder is used for both data transmission and energy transmission between the reader and the transponder, using the same frequency for the data and energy transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, passive transponder systems are capable of &#x201c;read only&#x201d; or &#x201c;read/write&#x201d; memories, and are thus often used to perform read and write cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Passive transponder systems may have multiple transmission channels, and the same frequency (e.g., 125 KHz or 13.56 MHz) is generally used for all transmissions. The maximum read/write distance of these systems is limited by the limits of data transmission and energy transmission. The energy transmission channel usually has the same frequency as the data transmission because the energy and the data are transmitted simultaneously. For example, the write channel and the energy transmission channel can use the same frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Depending upon application requirements, certain operating frequencies offer advantages over other frequencies. Ultra high frequency systems, using a frequency of 915 MHz, provide a read distance that is longer than low 125 KHz or high 13.56 MHz frequencies (e.g., 5 meters v. a few feet). High frequency 13.56 MHz systems offer the security of limited broadcast range when writing sensitive data to a transponder memory. Low and high frequency systems also allow greater field penetration of fluid-containing objects, such as the human body, while ultra-high frequencies are generally blocked by these objects.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention includes a radio frequency identification device that uses different operating frequencies (e.g., the most effective frequencies for different types of transmissions) in one identification device, thereby combining the respective advantages of each frequency. In one embodiment of the present invention, one frequency (e.g., a frequency such as 868 MHz or 915 MHz to 2.45 GHz) is used for data transmission, and another frequency (e.g., a low frequency such as 125 kHz) is used for proximity detection, such as in an electronic article surveillance device. In another embodiment, one frequency is used for reading information received from the identification device, and another frequency is used for writing to the identification device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the identification device utilizes one antenna for all frequencies. In another embodiment, the identification device utilizes two or more antennas for different frequencies, and one common memory. In other embodiments, one or two digital parts, one or two analog parts, and one or two antennas can be used in conjunction.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention utilizes the advantages of a device (e.g., a semiconductor chip) that is frequency-independent. In one embodiment, all transponder functions, such as encode/decode, modulate/demodulate, digital and analog functions, and memory, are embodied in this single device or chip. However, these functions can also be embodied in multiple chips. In one embodiment, the present invention combines the secure and proximity features of 13.56 MHz with the long read range feature of 915 MHz or 2.45 GHz. In an additional embodiment, it is possible to utilize different security levels on different channels.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment, the present invention integrates two high frequency (HF) or two ultra-high frequency (UHF) interfaces on one chip. These two interfaces are connected to two different antennas. Each antenna is tuned to its ideal working frequency. Thus, for example, one digital part of the chip is provided that has an ability to communicate via two HF channels through two antennas. Both channels handle the data coming from the same memory. The chip detects which field the transmission is in and automatically switches the communication to the active channel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other embodiments of the present invention (e.g., for multi application systems), different memory areas are used for the different frequency channels.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Multi-Frequency Identification Device</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates multi-frequency identification device <b>100</b>, according to one embodiment of the present invention. An example of a use of the present invention is vehicle registration. This example is used merely to illustrate the architectural overview of the present invention. Those experienced in the relevant art(s) will see that multiple other embodiments and uses are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Electronic vehicle registration allows integration of a passive identification device into a license plate (e.g., on the license plate or on a sticker on the license plate) of a vehicle. To identify the vehicle on the road using the identification device, in some embodiments, it is preferable to have a read distance of more than 3 meters, which can be only achieved with an ultra-high frequency (e.g., 915 MHz) system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For the write cycle to program the license plate, however, a shorter distance is sufficient, because the write cycle is typically performed only by local authorities in a nearby office. The write cycle, using 13.56 MHz, will be more secure than the read cycle in order to prevent illegal changing of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The multi-frequency identification device <b>100</b> comprises: a base layer; and at least one radio frequency device comprising at least one chip and at least one antenna disposed on the at least one base layer, wherein the at least one antenna is in electrical communication with the at least one chip. In one embodiment, the chip can be a frequency-independent chip.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a method of use <b>400</b> for the multi-frequency identification device <b>100</b>, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In step <b>405</b>, a first transmission at frequency 915 MHz takes place. Thus, for example, when a vehicle approaches a reader, the first transmission takes place. In step <b>410</b>, the antenna <b>106</b> of the 915 MHz system <b>105</b> receives the first transmission. Thus, for example, the antenna <b>106</b> of the 915 MHz system <b>105</b>, which is embedded on the vehicle license plate, receives the transmission from the reader. In step <b>415</b>, the first transmission powers the multi-frequency identification device.

In step <b>420</b> (e.g., when the vehicle is closer to the reader), a second transmission at frequency 13.56 MHz takes place. Thus, for example, when a vehicle approaches a reader, the second transmission takes place. In step <b>425</b>, the antenna <b>107</b> of the 13.56 MHz system <b>110</b> receives the second transmission. Thus, for example, the antenna <b>107</b> of the 13.56 MHz system receives information (e.g., authorization to pass a border) from the reader/writer and stores it.</p>
