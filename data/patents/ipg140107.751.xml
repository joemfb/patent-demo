<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Transducers are used for many applications, including applications in non-destructive testing at ultrasonic frequencies. In ultrasonic non-destructive testing, ultrasound is caused to propagate through a workpiece, and is detected.

<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The structure may be formed at the surface of the workpiece or within the workpiece. The structure may be formed by modifying the workpiece to create absorption contrast. The material of the workpiece may be modified. Modification may be permanent. Modification may be by etching. The structure may be formed by applying additional material to the workpiece. The additional material may be applied to the surface of the workpiece, or there may be a coupling layer between the structure and the workpiece. The additional material may be applied by printing or by coating or by attachment of a pre-formed structure, which may be self-adhesive. The additional material may be removably applied.</p>

Stress may be created by a thermo-elastic, ablative or electro-strictive mechanism. The structure may be operable to provide spatial contrast when illuminated by electromagnetic radiation, visible light, laser light, microwave or radio illumination.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a workpiece <b>10</b> in which ultrasound is generated and detected, for example for non-destructive testing purposes. A generator structure <b>12</b>, to be described in more detail below, is provided at the workpiece <b>10</b> to provide, when illuminated, spatial contrast in the absorption of illumination <b>14</b> by the workpiece <b>10</b>. This creates ultrasound <b>16</b> within the workpiece <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A detector structure <b>18</b>, to be described in more detail below, is provided at the workpiece <b>10</b> and is illuminated at <b>20</b>, during use. The detector structure <b>18</b> interacts, in use, with the ultrasound <b>16</b> to provide detectable modulation of the illumination <b>20</b>, indicated generally at <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this specification, the term ultrasound is used in relation to elastic waves with frequencies above about 20 kHz, and includes all wavemodes of elastic wave, such as Rayleigh waves, longitudinal, shear, Love and Lamb waves, surface acoustic waves (SAWs), leaky SAWs, and surface skimming bulk waves (SSBWs).</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">Generator</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The generator structure <b>12</b> is illustrated in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The generator structure <b>12</b> has alternating linear regions <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. The regions <b>24</b> are relatively absorbing of the illumination <b>14</b>. The regions <b>26</b> are relatively non-absorbing of the illumination <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The difference in the absorption characteristics of the regions <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may be created in many different ways. For example, the material of the workpiece <b>10</b> may be modified at or near its surface, to create absorption contrast. This may be by increasing the reflectivity of regions <b>26</b>, or by decreasing the reflectivity of regions <b>24</b>, or by increasing the absorption characteristics of regions <b>24</b>, or by decreasing the absorption characteristics of regions <b>26</b>. Etching may be used to create the absorption contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The regions <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may be formed within the body of the workpiece <b>10</b>, if the material of the workpiece, and the nature of the illumination are such as to provide the absorption contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In other examples, the structure <b>12</b> may be formed by applying additional material to the workpiece <b>10</b>, preferably at the surface. This may be applied as a coating, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in which areas <b>24</b> are formed by additional material deposited either directly on the surface <b>28</b> of the workpiece <b>10</b>, as shown, or over a coupling layer (not shown) between the structure <b>12</b> and the surface of the workpiece <b>10</b>. The additional material may be deposited by a coating technique, a printing technique or by attachment of a pre-formed structure, which may be in the form of a structure pre-formed on a self-adhesive substrate, for attachment to the workpiece <b>10</b>. The method of attachment may be removable, to allow the structure <b>12</b> to be re-used at a different location on the same or another workpiece, or to be disposable. The structure <b>12</b> may be covered with a layer providing protection and/or retention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the generator structure <b>12</b> is illuminated at <b>14</b>, the spatial contrast in the absorption of the illumination <b>14</b> by the workpiece <b>10</b> gives rise to mechanical effects within the workpiece <b>10</b>. For example, the absorption of the illumination <b>14</b> may give rise to localised heating within the workpiece <b>10</b>, there being a spatial variation in the localised heating, by virtue of the form of the structure <b>12</b>. This creates expansion of the workpiece <b>10</b>, which is not uniform across the workpiece <b>10</b>. Accordingly, strong, pulsed illumination <b>14</b>, such as from a laser, can create rapid, localised expansion in the regions <b>24</b>. This creates mechanical disturbance within the workpiece <b>10</b>, which results in ultrasound <b>16</b> being created to propagate through the workpiece <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Other mechanisms may contribute to the creation of the ultrasound <b>16</b>, such as thermo-elastic, ablative or electro-strictive mechanisms. The effective mechanism will vary according to the material chosen for the workpiece, the nature of the generator structure <b>12</b>, and the nature of the illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The type of the illumination <b>14</b> can be selected according to the material of the workpiece <b>10</b> and the mechanism for absorption. The illumination <b>14</b> is envisaged to be a form of electromagnetic radiation, which may be visible light, such as laser light, or may be microwave or radio illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The generator structure <b>12</b> and the illumination system <b>14</b><i>a</i>, including a source of the chosen type of illumination, together form a transducer system. In use, the illumination source <b>14</b><i>a </i>is used to illuminate the generator structure <b>12</b>. This creates spatial contrast in the absorption of the illumination <b>14</b> by the workpiece <b>10</b>, which in turn creates ultrasound by virtue of the absorption mechanisms described.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The ultrasound created from the generator structure <b>12</b> propagates through the workpiece <b>10</b>, possibly encountering one or more faults <b>32</b> within the body of the workpiece <b>10</b>, until reaching the detector structure <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">Detector</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The detector structure <b>18</b> is illustrated in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The detector structure <b>18</b> is formed, in this example, as a grating structure. The structure <b>18</b> is provided at the surface of the workpiece <b>10</b> and is therefore mechanically disturbed by the passage of ultrasound <b>16</b> through the workpiece <b>10</b>, in the vicinity of the structure <b>18</b>. This disturbance of the detector structure <b>18</b> is used to provide detectable modulation of the illumination <b>20</b>, as will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the structure <b>18</b> is formed by applying additional material to the workpiece <b>10</b>, preferably at the surface. This may be applied by a coating technique, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in which elongate regions <b>34</b>A are formed by additional material deposited either directly on the surface <b>28</b> of the workpiece <b>10</b>, as shown, or over a coupling layer (not shown) between the structure <b>12</b> and the surface of the workpiece <b>10</b>. The additional material may be deposited by a coating technique, a printing technique or by attachment of a pre-formed structure, which may be in the form of a structure pre-formed on a self-adhesive substrate, for attachment to the workpiece <b>10</b>. The method of attachment may be removable, to allow the structure <b>18</b> to be re-used at a different location on the same or another workpiece, or to be disposable.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The regions <b>34</b>A are separated by elongate regions <b>34</b>B. The resulting surface profile has regions <b>34</b>A raised above regions <b>34</b>B, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The steps formed between the regions <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B alter the complex reflectivity between the regions by introducing a phase shift in the illumination <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This change in reflectivity may alternatively be achieved by changing the absorption or reflection coefficients of the regions <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B. The contrast between the regions <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B may be achieved by etching, printing, machining, laser marking or other techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As an alternative to a phase grating, an amplitude grating could be used. An amplitude grating may be formed, for example, by providing contrast in the absorption or reflection characteristics of the regions <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The regions <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B may be formed within the body of the workpiece <b>10</b>, if the material of the workpiece, and the nature of the illumination are such as to provide the absorption, reflection or phase contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this example, the detector structure <b>18</b> is illuminated at <b>20</b> by incident laser illumination. This reflects from the grating structure <b>18</b> as a diffracted beam <b>36</b>, having various diffraction orders as illustrated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When ultrasound <b>16</b> passes the grating structure <b>18</b>, the size, relative size, position or relative position of the elements <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B forming the grating structure <b>18</b> will change in response to the ultrasound <b>16</b>, which will in turn cause changes in the diffracted beam <b>36</b>. In particular, the height h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the grating elements <b>34</b>A will change in response to the ultrasound <b>16</b>. The grating height h is a factor determining the energy distribution between the various orders of the diffracted beam <b>36</b>. Accordingly, the interaction of the grating structure <b>18</b> with the ultrasound <b>16</b> results in a change of the distribution of energy among the diffraction orders. This modulation can be observed by an appropriate sensor <b>38</b>, for example by observing a selected order of the diffracted beam <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, the zero order of the diffracted beam <b>36</b> may be chosen for observation. It can be shown that if the height h corresponds to one eighth of the optical wavelength, 50% of the energy of the illumination <b>20</b> will be directed to the zero order. The strength of the zero order will then change, i.e. be modulated, as the grating height changes upon interaction with the ultrasound <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The sensor <b>38</b> may be a photo-diode forming, with the detector structure <b>18</b> and the illumination source <b>30</b>, a transducer system for detecting the modulation of the illumination <b>20</b> arising from interaction with the ultrasound <b>16</b>, at the grating.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It is to be particularly noted that the zero order of the diffracted beam <b>34</b> arises from direct specular reflection. Accordingly, the direction of the zero order does not change as a result of modulation, thus simplifying the requirements for monitoring the diffracted beam <b>36</b> by the sensor <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">System</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the two transducer systems in more detail. Many features illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> correspond with features described above and are therefore given the same reference numerals. In the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the workpiece <b>10</b> carries a generator structure <b>12</b> and a detector structure <b>18</b> at its surface. The illumination source <b>14</b>A for the structure <b>12</b> is in the form of a q-switched Nd:YAG laser emitting at 1064 nm with a pulse duration of 20 ns. This type of laser is readily available, on a commercial basis.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this example, the output of the laser <b>14</b><i>a </i>passes through a beam expanding system <b>40</b> and may be directed to the generator structure <b>12</b> by a mirror <b>42</b>, if required.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Pulses from the laser <b>14</b><i>a </i>create ultrasound <b>16</b> within the workpiece <b>10</b>, as has been described. These travel through the workpiece <b>10</b> towards the detector structure <b>18</b>, and may encounter faults <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The detector structure <b>18</b> is illuminated by the source <b>30</b> which is, in this example, a HeNe laser emitting at 633 nm. This type of laser is readily available, on a commercial basis. Accordingly, for this example, the height h of the grating elements <b>34</b>A is chosen as approximately 79 nm, to be one eighth of the optical wavelength. The emission of the laser <b>30</b> passes through a second beam expanding system <b>44</b>, in this example, and may be directed by a second mirror <b>46</b>, if required, to illuminate the detector structure <b>18</b>. The diffracted beam <b>36</b> illuminates an iris <b>48</b> which separates out the zero order of the diffracted beam <b>36</b> to illuminate the sensor <b>38</b>, through an optional lens system <b>50</b>. The output of the photo-diode sensor <b>38</b> is applied to circuits <b>52</b> for signal treatment and analysis. In particular, the intensity of the zero order of the diffracted beam <b>36</b> is observed to recover information about the modulation provided within the detector structure <b>18</b> by the interaction with ultrasound <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Selection Characteristics</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It can be shown that the bandwidth of the generated ultrasound <b>16</b> is set by the number of elements of the generator structure which are contributing to the effects, that is, the number of elements being illuminated. Increasing the number of illuminated elements reduces the bandwidth of the created ultrasound <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">At the detector structure <b>18</b>, the grating form of the structure <b>18</b> results in the ultrasound <b>16</b> being filtered, so that the modulation in the diffracted beam <b>36</b> arises from the ultrasound <b>16</b> as filtered by the grating structure <b>18</b>. It can be shown that the detection bandwidth of the structure <b>18</b> becomes narrower as the number of grating elements increases.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In both cases, the grating spacing allows for frequency selection.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The mode of the ultrasound generated in the structure <b>12</b> is influenced by the form of the structure <b>12</b>, as has been described. In the examples described above, the structures <b>12</b> have been line gratings. Other forms of gratings could be used. For example, circular gratings could be used. Changing the shape of the grating elements forming the structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> allows different modes of ultrasound propagation to be stimulated and detected within the workpiece <b>10</b>, thus allowing additional information to be recovered in relation to the workpiece <b>10</b>. It is envisaged that appropriate design of the structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> will allow substantially any desired wavemode of elastic wave to be generated and detected, such as Rayleigh waves, longitudinal, shear, Love and Lamb waves, SAWs, leaky SAWs and SSBWs.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The form of the structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> also affects their directional selectivity, allowing testing to be carried out in preferred directions chosen by appropriate orientation of the structures.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Accordingly, appropriate selection of the dimensions of the structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> allows the frequency and bandwidth of ultrasound generation and ultrasound detection to be controlled, each factor being controllable substantially independently of the others.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Multiple Transducers</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The frequency and bandwidth behaviour can be used in a manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which illustrates the surface of a workpiece <b>10</b>A. The surface of the workpiece <b>10</b>A is provided with three generator structures <b>12</b>A <b>12</b>B, <b>12</b>C and three detector structures <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that the dimensions of the elements forming the structures <b>12</b>A, <b>18</b>A are relatively fine, the dimensions of the structures <b>12</b>C, <b>18</b>C are relatively coarse, and the dimensions of the structures <b>12</b>B, <b>18</b>B are intermediate those of the structures <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>C, <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In one example, we have formed a workpiece <b>10</b>A having structures <b>12</b>A, <b>18</b>A formed to operate at 20 MHz, structures <b>12</b>B, <b>18</b>B formed to operate at 10 MHz and structures <b>12</b>C, <b>18</b>C formed to operate at 5 MHz. Many other frequencies and combinations of frequencies could be chosen, as could the number of pairs of structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The provision of multiple structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>, in the manner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, allows ultrasound to be generated and detected at multiple frequencies, either simultaneously by illuminating more than one generator structure, and the corresponding detector structures, or selectively, by illuminating a selected generator structure and the corresponding detector structure. At each of the frequencies in use, bandwidth in the generation and detection can be controlled, and frequency, mode and direction can be selected, by using the effects described above. This, for example, allows the workpiece <b>10</b> to be tested at various different ultrasound frequencies <b>16</b>, allowing more information to be recovered about the state of the workpiece <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Sequential Workpieces</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically illustrates how the principles and examples described above can be applied for non-destructive testing of a plurality of workpieces. For example, the workpieces <b>10</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may be manufactured items passing along a path <b>60</b>, for example as part of a manufacturing process. Each workpiece <b>10</b>B is provided with a generator structure <b>12</b> and a detector structure <b>18</b>. In this example, the structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> are positioned on opposite faces of the workpieces <b>10</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">An illumination source <b>14</b> is provided at a position along the path <b>60</b>, so that the workpieces <b>10</b>B will sequentially pass the source <b>14</b>, as they move along the path <b>60</b>. An illumination source <b>20</b> is also provided, generally at the same region of the path <b>60</b> as the source <b>14</b>. A sensor <b>38</b> is also provided in the region of the source <b>20</b>. The illumination sources <b>14</b>, <b>20</b> and the sensor <b>38</b> are arranged so that each workpiece <b>10</b>B will sequentially arrive at a test station illustrated at <b>62</b>, at which the generator structure <b>12</b> is illuminated by the source <b>14</b>, to create ultrasound within the workpiece <b>10</b>B. The ultrasound <b>16</b> passes through the workpiece <b>10</b>B. The detector structure <b>18</b> is also illuminated, by the source <b>20</b>, so that the sensor <b>38</b> is able to observe the modulation provided by the ultrasound received at the detector structure <b>18</b>, as has been described. Accordingly, each workpiece <b>10</b>B can be individually tested in this non-destructive manner, with appropriate action being taken in response to a finding of abnormal modulation sensed at the sensor <b>38</b>, indicative of an abnormality within the workpiece <b>10</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one example, the workpieces <b>10</b>B may be containers of a foodstuff. For example, they may contain milk or other dairy product. We envisage that changes within foodstuffs, as they lose freshness, will give rise to detectable changes in behaviour under the ultrasound testing which has been described. Accordingly, freshness of the contents of each container <b>10</b>B can be assessed individually. Containers with contents which are not fresh can be rejected.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">It is envisaged that each workpiece <b>10</b>B can also be provided with a machine-readable code, such as a bar code, there being an appropriate reading arrangement provided in the path <b>60</b>, preferably in the region of the test station <b>62</b>. This allows each test result to be associated with the unique identifier of the corresponding workpiece <b>10</b>B, providing a test record specific to the particular workpiece <b>10</b>B.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Pipelines</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The arrangements described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> relate to individual testing of discrete items. In a further example, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, continuous testing is provided for material flowing along a pipe <b>64</b>, which may be conveying a foodstuff. In this example, a generator structure <b>12</b> is provided on the wall of the pipe <b>64</b> to create ultrasound <b>16</b> within the bore <b>66</b> of the pipe <b>64</b>, when illuminated at <b>14</b>. A detector structure <b>18</b> is provided on the wall of the pipe <b>64</b>, to detect the ultrasound <b>16</b> when illuminated at <b>20</b>, to provide a modulated, reflected beam <b>22</b>. This arrangement allows continuous monitoring of the material flowing through the pipe <b>64</b>, so that appropriate action can be taken in the event that an unacceptable change is detected, which might arise from lack of freshness of a foodstuff, incorrect processing or formulation in a prior processing step, or the like.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Periodic Testing</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The workpieces <b>10</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are described as carrying generator structures and detector structures. Accordingly, they can be tested again, at any time, by provision of appropriate illumination and sensor arrangements. In the case of foodstuffs, for example, they could be tested at various stages of production, delivery and storage, providing a consistent set of data from which the current freshness or other condition of the contents can be assessed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">This principle of periodic testing of a workpiece can also be used in relation to other types of workpiece, such as components of a machine. Any component which requires periodic testing can be provided with a generator structure <b>12</b> and a detector structure <b>18</b> at an appropriate position. The structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> create negligible disturbance to the workpiece <b>10</b>, being surface formations. Thus, the structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> may remain in place during periods of normal use of the workpiece. At intervals, the structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> may be used to generate and detect ultrasound within the workpiece, to provide a non-destructive test result relating to the performance and/or condition of the workpiece. Since the structures <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> can remain on the test piece between testing episodes, each testing episode is consistently executed, so that the results of the periodic testing episodes can be related to each other, without additional calibration being required.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Remote Testing and In Situ Testing</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the arrangements described, the generator and detector structures are illuminated. Illumination of the complete structure <b>12</b> or <b>18</b> is required. It is envisaged that this will be possible, in many applications, by using an illumination source which is remote from the structure <b>12</b>, <b>18</b>. This facilitates testing in hostile environments, or within operating machines, for example. Continuous testing, within an operating environment, is also envisaged.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Other Materials</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Various references have been made above to foodstuffs. Other materials could be tested, such as chemical products, drugs, human or animal tissue or any other material which supports elastic waves. Materials in liquid, solid or gas phase can be tested.</p>
