<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This U.S. National stage application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-169599, filed in Japan on Jun. 27, 2008, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semimolten or semisolid molding method and a molding apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the conventional art, a scroll member that has a scroll shaped portion, such as a fixed scroll or a movable scroll of a scroll compressor, is molded by a semimolten or semisolid molding method. For example, a scroll member is cast using a scroll casting apparatus, which is described in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application Publication No. H8-155626.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such a scroll casting apparatus, when a cavity, which is a casting space inside the forming mold, is filled with molten metal, namely, when it is supplied with melt, the cavity is filled from the circumferential edge of an end plate, which is a flat plate portion of the scroll member (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the semimolten or semisolid molding method using horizontal delivery, namely, when the cavity is filled with semimolten or semisolid cast iron, from the circumferential edge of the end plate, the shape of the pouring gate is widened and, consequently, the cross sectional length (and the circumferential length of the cross section) thereof is enlarged to secure the cross sectional area of the pouring gate needed to fill the scroll shaped portion of the scroll member. As a result, the semimolten or semisolid metal that fills the cavity during molding tends to cool, which can cause problems such as molding failures of the scroll member, for example, misruns in the thin scroll tip part, air inclusions, and cold shuts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide a semimolten or semisolid molding method and a molding apparatus that can prevent misruns, air inclusions, and cold shuts during molding.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A semimolten or semisolid molding method according to a first aspect of the present invention is a semimolten or semisolid molding method for casting a molded article, which comprises a flat plate portion and a projected portion that projects from one surface of the flat plate portion, with a semimolten or semisolid metal. This molding method comprises the step of: filling a cavity, which is a casting space of the molded article formed inside a forming mold, with the semimolten or semisolid metal in plate thickness directions of the flat plate portion starting from an other surface on the opposite side of the flat plate portion to a one surface wherefrom the projected portion projects.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Here, because the cavity is filled with the semimolten or semisolid metal in the plate thickness directions of the flat plate portion starting from the other surface, which is on the opposite side of the flat plate portion to the one surface wherefrom the projected portion projects, the entire cavity can be smoothly filled with the semimolten or semisolid metal. As a result, it is possible to prevent misruns, air inclusions, and cold shuts.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A semimolten or semisolid molding method according to a second aspect of the present invention is the molding method according to the first aspect of the present invention, wherein the aspect ratio of a passageway cross section of a runner, which is a passageway for filling the cavity with the semimolten or semisolid metal, is less than 1:3.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Here, because the aspect ratio of the passageway cross section of the runner is less than 1:3, the cross sectional length of the passageway of the runner is reduced. Thereby, it is possible to reduce cooling of the semimolten or semisolid metal at the runner portion, which improves the fluidity of the melt. Consequently, the melt tends not to cool and misruns can be prevented, which improves yield.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A semimolten or semisolid molding method according to a third aspect of the present invention is the molding method according to the first or second aspects of the present invention, and comprises the steps of: inserting an insert or slide mold, which is separate from the forming mold, between the cavity and a runner, which is a passageway for filling the cavity with the semimolten or semisolid metal, from a direction different from the directions in which the runner extends; and subsequently filling the forming mold with the semimolten or semisolid metal.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, an embodiment of the semimolten or semisolid molding method and the molding apparatus of the present invention will be explained, referencing the drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&#x3c;Configuration of a Semimolten or Semisolid Molding Apparatus <b>1</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A semimolten or semisolid molding apparatus <b>1</b> (hereinbelow, called a molding apparatus <b>1</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a molding apparatus for molding a movable scroll of a scroll compressor, namely, a scroll member <b>50</b> that comprises: a scroll shaped portion <b>51</b>; a plate shaped end plate <b>52</b>, which is formed on a base side of the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b>; and a columnar boss <b>53</b>, which is formed on the opposite side of the end plate <b>52</b> to the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The molding apparatus <b>1</b> comprises a scroll member forming mold <b>2</b> (hereinbelow, called a forming mold <b>2</b>), scroll ejector pins <b>3</b>, an insert or slide mold <b>5</b>, a material filling mechanism <b>6</b>, an ejector pin drive mechanism <b>7</b>, and a base frame <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the molding apparatus <b>1</b>, the material filling mechanism <b>6</b> fills, while applying pressure, the interior of the forming mold <b>2</b> with a semimolten or semisolid metal material C, which is a ferrous semimolten or semisolid metal material, and thereby the scroll member <b>50</b> can be molded.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After the scroll member <b>50</b> has been molded, a driving means (not shown) pulls one of the molds that constitute the forming mold <b>2</b>, namely, a movable mold <b>11</b>, along the base frame <b>8</b> away from the other mold, namely, a fixed mold <b>12</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The scroll member <b>50</b> can then be removed from the interior of the movable mold <b>11</b> by the ejector pin drive mechanism <b>7</b> pushing the scroll ejector pins <b>3</b> and a supplementary ejector pin <b>9</b> into the movable mold <b>11</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The forming mold <b>2</b>, the scroll ejector pins <b>3</b>, and the insert or slide mold <b>5</b> are described in greater detail in separate sections below.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">&#x3c;Configuration of the Scroll Member Forming Mold <b>2</b> and the Insert or Slide Mold <b>5</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the forming mold <b>2</b> comprises a movable mold <b>11</b>, which reciprocatively moves along the base frame <b>8</b>, and the fixed mold <b>12</b>, which is fixed on the base frame <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, the molding apparatus <b>1</b> further comprises the insert or slide mold <b>5</b> in order to form a runner <b>54</b>, or passageway, for filling a casting space&#x2014;namely, a cavity <b>13</b>, which has the shape of the scroll member <b>50</b> that is formed when the movable mold <b>11</b> and the fixed mold <b>12</b> are joined&#x2014;with the semimolten or semisolid metal material.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The insert or slide mold <b>5</b>, which is a separate member from the movable mold <b>11</b> and the fixed mold <b>12</b> of the forming mold <b>2</b>, is disposed between the cavity <b>13</b> and the runner <b>54</b> and is detachably attached to the fixed mold <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The insert or slide mold <b>5</b> is disposed between the cavity <b>13</b> and the runner <b>54</b> in order to form the runner <b>54</b>, which is a passageway for filling the cavity <b>13</b> with the semimolten or semisolid metal in the plate thickness directions of the end plate <b>52</b> starting from a second surface <b>52</b><i>b</i>; note that the second surface <b>52</b><i>b </i>is on the opposite side of the end plate <b>52</b>, which is a flat plate portion, to a first surface <b>52</b><i>a </i>wherefrom the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b>, which is a projected portion of the end plate <b>52</b>, projects.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, the slide mold <b>5</b> can move reciprocatively along directions different from those in which the runner <b>54</b> extends, namely, in the present embodiment, the directions perpendicular to the paper plane in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and orthogonal to the directions in which the runner <b>54</b> extends; thereby, the slide mold <b>5</b> is inserted into and removed from the interior of the fixed mold <b>12</b>. In addition, the insert <b>5</b> may be inserted into the fixed mold <b>12</b> either along the directions perpendicular to the paper plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and orthogonal to the directions in which the runner <b>54</b> extends or from the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, a bent part of the runner <b>54</b> can be provided with a scale trap in order to eliminate any decarburized layer, oxide scaling, or the like. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a scale trap S is provided such that it projects linearly or arcuately from a material residuary part <b>55</b>, but the present invention is not limited thereto; for example, the position and the shape of the scale trap may be modified in a variety of ways.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, within the cavity <b>13</b> for forming the scroll member <b>50</b>, the movable mold <b>11</b> has a scroll shaped groove <b>13</b><i>a</i>, which is for forming the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b>, and a flat plate shaped groove <b>13</b><i>b</i>, which is for forming the end plate <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, within the cavity <b>13</b> for forming the scroll member <b>50</b>, the fixed mold <b>12</b> has a columnar groove <b>13</b><i>c </i>for forming the columnar boss <b>53</b>. Furthermore, the fixed mold <b>12</b> has a runner groove <b>13</b><i>d </i>for forming the runner <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The movable mold <b>11</b> is fixed to a movable platen <b>21</b> and moves reciprocatively together with the movable platen <b>21</b> on the base frame <b>8</b>. The fixed mold <b>12</b> is fixed to a fixed platen <b>22</b> and is stationary on the stage <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">&#x3c;Configuration of the Scroll Ejector Pins <b>3</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The scroll ejector pins <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are attached to the ejector pin drive mechanism <b>7</b> such that they pass through through holes <b>15</b> formed in the movable mold <b>11</b> and can appear and disappear to the tip of the scroll shaped groove <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the cavity <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">After the scroll member <b>50</b> has been molded, the scroll ejector pins <b>3</b> can eject the scroll member <b>50</b> from the movable mold <b>11</b> by pressing against a tip <b>51</b><i>a </i>of the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b> of the scroll member <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">&#x3c;Overview of the Semimolten or Semisolid Molding Method&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the semimolten or semisolid molding method of the present embodiment, the cavity <b>13</b>, which is the casting space of the scroll member <b>50</b>&#x2014;namely, the molded article formed inside the forming mold <b>2</b>&#x2014;is filled with the semimolten or semisolid metal in the plate thickness directions of the end plate <b>52</b> starting from the second surface <b>52</b><i>b</i>, which is on the opposite side of the end plate <b>52</b> to the first surface <b>52</b><i>a </i>wherefrom the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b> projects. Consequently, because the melt is supplied not from the circumferential edge of the end plate <b>52</b> but rather from the rear side surface, whereon the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b> is not formed, namely, the second surface <b>52</b><i>b</i>, it is possible to smoothly fill the entire cavity <b>13</b> with the semimolten or semisolid metal and, as a result, to prevent misruns, air inclusions, or cold shuts.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the scroll member <b>50</b> molded in the present embodiment is a movable scroll that comprises the columnar boss <b>53</b> that projects from the second surface <b>52</b><i>b</i>, which is on the opposite side of the end plate <b>52</b> to the first surface <b>52</b><i>a </i>wherefrom the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b> projects. Accordingly, the semimolten or semisolid metal fills the cavity <b>13</b> of the forming mold <b>2</b> of the scroll member <b>50</b> from the portion of the boss <b>53</b> positioned at the center of the end plate <b>52</b> and through the runner <b>54</b>, which is a passageway for filling the cavity <b>13</b> with the semimolten or semisolid metal.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus, filling the cavity <b>13</b> starting from the boss <b>53</b> of the scroll member <b>50</b> makes it possible to smoothly fill the entire cavity <b>13</b> (particularly the entire flat plate shaped groove <b>13</b><i>b </i>wherein the end plate <b>52</b> is formed) with the semimolten or semisolid metal.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, after molding, one end of the runner <b>54</b> is connected to the boss <b>53</b>, and the other end of the runner <b>54</b> is connected to the material residuary part <b>55</b> on the material filling mechanism <b>6</b> side. Accordingly, after molding, the scroll member <b>50</b> is removed from the forming mold <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and the runner <b>54</b> and the material residuary part <b>55</b> are then cut off.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, in order to eliminate any decarburized layer, oxide scaling, or the like on the surface of the semimolten or semisolid metal material C immediately after the semimolten or semisolid metal material C comes out of the material filling mechanism <b>6</b>, the material filling mechanism <b>6</b> is disposed spaced apart from, but not immediately behind, the boss <b>53</b> by a distance commensurate with a dimension of the runner <b>54</b>. Thereby, because the scale eliminated from the surface of the semimolten or semisolid metal material C principally accumulates in the scale trap (not shown), which is configured along the material residuary part <b>55</b>, the runner <b>54</b>, or the like, contamination of the scroll member <b>50</b> by impurities is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the aspect ratio of the passageway cross section of the runner <b>54</b> (i.e., the ratio of a longitudinal length t<b>1</b> to a transverse length t<b>2</b> of the passageway cross section of the runner <b>54</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), which is a passageway for filling the cavity <b>13</b> with the semimolten or semisolid metal, is t<b>1</b>:t<b>2</b>&#x3c;1:3 (specifically, for example, t<b>1</b>:t<b>2</b>=1:2.99-1:1). Furthermore, for the sake of convenience in the explanation, the longitudinal length t<b>1</b> and the transverse length t<b>2</b> of the passageway cross section of the runner <b>54</b> are defined only in terms of being vertical and horizontal, and the filling of the semimolten or semisolid metal is not particularly affected even if the vertical and horizontal directions are switched.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Because the aspect ratio of the passageway cross section of the runner <b>54</b> is less than 1:3, the passageway of the runner <b>54</b> is not flat but rather has, for example, a somewhat square or circular cross sectional shape. Thereby, the reduced cross sectional length of the passageway of the runner <b>54</b> (as well as the circumferential length of the pouring gate cross section) reduces cooling of the semimolten or semisolid metal at the runner <b>54</b> portion, which improves the fluidity of the melt.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, there is a relation expressed as equivalent hydraulic diameter=4A/L, wherein A is the cross sectional area of the passageway and L is the cross sectional length (or the circumferential length of the pouring gate cross section). Here, the equivalent hydraulic diameter refers to the diameter of a tube of equivalent cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, in a concrete example wherein the aspect ratio of the passageway cross section of the runner <b>54</b> is less than 1:3, if the passageway cross section of the runner <b>54</b> is a square cross section of 30&#xd7;30 mm (i.e., with an aspect ratio of 1:1), then an equivalent hydraulic diameter D<b>1</b> is calculated by D<b>1</b>=(4A/L)=(4&#xd7;30&#xd7;30)/(4&#xd7;30)=30 mm, and therefore a passageway equivalent to a passageway with a circular cross section of 30 mm can be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">However, in a concrete example wherein the aspect ratio of the passageway cross section of a runner <b>154</b> is 1:10-1:7, as shown in a comparative example discussed below (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), if the passageway cross section of the runner <b>154</b> is a flat rectangular cross section of 10&#xd7;90 mm (i.e., with an aspect ratio of 1:9), then an equivalent hydraulic diameter D<b>2</b> is calculated by D<b>2</b>=(4A/L)=(4&#xd7;10&#xd7;90)/(2&#xd7;(10+90))=18 mm, and therefore the passageway is extremely narrow even though the cross sectional area (i.e., 900 mm<sup>2</sup>) is the same as that of the abovementioned square cross section of 30&#xd7;30 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The aspect ratio of the passageway cross section of the runner <b>54</b> should be less than 1:3, and thereby the runner <b>54</b> is formed with an easy-to-design rectangular cross section, as shown representatively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In addition, various cross sectional shapes can be adopted as long as the aspect ratio is less than 1:3; for example, as modified examples of the present invention, a semidomed mold cross section of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a circular cross section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or an elliptical cross section (not shown) may be adopted. In these cases, too, the cross sectional length of the passageway of the runner <b>54</b> can be shortened, and therefore the melt tends not to cool and yield improves.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, in the present embodiment, the insert or slide mold <b>5</b>, which is separate from the forming mold <b>2</b>, is inserted between the runner <b>54</b> and the cavity <b>13</b> from a direction different from the directions in which the runner <b>54</b> extends, and the forming mold <b>2</b> is subsequently filled with the semimolten or semisolid metal. Thus, the insertion of the insert or slide mold <b>5</b>, which is separate from the forming mold <b>2</b>, into the fixed mold <b>12</b> makes it possible to extend the runner <b>54</b> to the center of the cavity <b>13</b> (in particular, to the end plate <b>52</b> portion), and thereby to effectively prevent misruns, air inclusions, or cold shuts.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">&#x3c;Procedure of the Semimolten or Semisolid Molding Method&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, the semimolten or semisolid molding method, which uses the molding apparatus <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, will be explained, referencing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">First, starting from an initial state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the movable mold <b>11</b> is moved along the base frame <b>8</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which couples the movable mold <b>11</b> and the fixed mold <b>12</b> to form the cavity <b>13</b> (i.e., in a mold clamping process).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the semimolten or semisolid metal material C is loaded into the material filling mechanism <b>6</b> (i.e., in a material pouring process).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a plunger <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the material filling mechanism <b>6</b> is moved by hydraulic pressure or pneumatic pressure, which applies pressure to the semimolten or semisolid metal material C and fills the interior of the forming mold <b>2</b> with the semimolten or semisolid metal material C (i.e., in a filling process). At this time, a semimolten or semisolid metal M, which is in the process of filling the cavity <b>13</b>, passes through the runner groove <b>13</b><i>d </i>and fills the cavity <b>13</b>. Because the runner groove <b>13</b><i>d </i>has a rectangular, nearly square cross section, as mentioned above, the semimolten or semisolid metal M can reach the cavity <b>13</b> without tending to cool inside the runner groove <b>13</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the filling of the entire cavity <b>13</b> with the semimolten or semisolid metal M has completed and the semimolten or semisolid metal M has subsequently cooled and solidified, the molded scroll member <b>50</b> is molded inside the cavity <b>13</b> (which marks the completion of filling). The molded scroll member <b>50</b> is connected to the runner <b>54</b>, which is formed inside the runner groove <b>13</b><i>d</i>, and the material residuary part <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the movable mold <b>11</b> is moved along the base frame <b>8</b>, which separates the movable mold <b>11</b> from the fixed mold <b>12</b> and opens the forming mold <b>2</b> (i.e., in a mold opening process). At this time, the insert or slide mold <b>5</b> is in a state wherein it is interposed between the scroll member <b>50</b> and the runner <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, if an insert is used as the insert or slide mold <b>5</b>, then driving the ejector pin drive mechanism <b>7</b> causes the scroll ejector pins <b>3</b> to project into the inside of the scroll shaped groove <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the movable mold <b>11</b>, and thereby the scroll ejector pins <b>3</b> press against the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b> of the scroll member <b>50</b>. In addition, driving the ejector pin drive mechanism <b>7</b> also causes the supplementary ejector pin <b>9</b> to project from the movable mold <b>11</b> and press against the material residuary part <b>55</b>. Thereby, the molded scroll member <b>50</b>, the runner <b>54</b>, the material residuary part <b>55</b>, and the insert <b>5</b>, which have become integrated, can be ejected from the interior of the movable mold <b>11</b> (i.e., in an ejecting process). In addition, simultaneous with the ejecting process, the plunger <b>6</b><i>a </i>returns to its initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">However, if a slide mold is used as the insert or slide mold <b>5</b>, then, prior to driving the ejector pin drive mechanism <b>7</b>, the slide mold <b>5</b> is opened using a slide mold drive mechanism (not shown) or the like, which is provided to, for example, the movable mold <b>11</b>, to divide the slide mold <b>5</b> in two and move the two parts away from one another along the directions perpendicular to the paper plane in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Subsequently, the ejector pin drive mechanism <b>7</b> can be driven to eject only the molded scroll member <b>50</b>, the runner <b>54</b>, and the material residuary part <b>55</b>, which have become integrated, from the interior of the movable mold <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the molded scroll member <b>50</b>, the runner <b>54</b>, the material residuary part <b>55</b>, and the insert <b>5</b>, which have become integrated, are removed from the interior of the forming mold <b>2</b> (i.e., in a molded article removing process). At this time, the scroll ejector pins <b>3</b> and the supplementary ejector pin <b>9</b> return to the initial state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The molded scroll member <b>50</b> is cut at the boundary portion between the runner <b>54</b> and the boss <b>53</b> and separated from the runner <b>54</b> and the material residuary part <b>55</b>. In addition, the insert <b>5</b> interposed between the scroll member <b>50</b> and the runner <b>54</b> is separated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">With regard to the final finishing of the scroll member <b>50</b>, the scroll member <b>50</b> can be surface finished to the dimensions and surface roughness required of the finished article using end milling, wheel mounted grinding, aero lapping, and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Here, as a comparative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in a scroll casting apparatus <b>101</b>, which is recited in the abovementioned Patent Document 1 and used in the conventional art, when a cavity <b>113</b>, which is a casting space inside a forming mold <b>102</b>, is filled with molten metal, namely, when it is supplied with melt, the cavity <b>113</b> is filled from a circumferential edge of an end plate <b>152</b>, which is a flat plate portion of a scroll member <b>150</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In a molding method wherein the cavity <b>113</b> is filled with semimolten or semisolid cast iron in the scroll casting apparatus <b>101</b> according to the comparative example, a so-called horizontal delivery method is adopted wherein the cavity <b>113</b> is filled with the melt starting from the circumferential edge of the end plate <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Furthermore, as in the molding apparatus <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the scroll casting apparatus <b>101</b> according to the comparative example likewise comprises the scroll ejector pins <b>3</b>, the material filling mechanism <b>6</b>, and the base frame <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this comparative example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-16</figref>, the shape of the pouring gate of the passageway of the runner <b>154</b> is widened in order to secure a pouring gate cross sectional area needed to fill the scroll shaped portion <b>151</b> of the scroll member <b>150</b>. Furthermore, a symbol <b>155</b> is a material residuary part on the material filling mechanism <b>6</b> side. Consequently, the cross sectional length of the passageway of the runner <b>154</b> (as well as the circumferential length of the pouring gate cross section) is enlarged. In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the aspect ratio of the passageway cross section of the runner <b>154</b> is t<b>3</b>:t<b>4</b>=1:10-1:7.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As a result, the semimolten or semisolid metal, with which the cavity <b>113</b> is filled during molding, tends to cool inside the flat runner <b>154</b>, whose cross sectional length is large. Consequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, there is a risk that molding failures will occur in the scroll member <b>150</b>, for example, a misrun at the tip part of the thin scroll shaped portion <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the insufficient filling of the interior of the cavity <b>113</b> (particularly the end plate <b>52</b> portion) with the molten metal creates the risk of air inclusions in a portion D inside the cavity <b>113</b>. In addition, there is a risk that a defective article will be produced owing to the enfolding of the molten metal from two directions at the end plate <b>52</b> portion, which causes the molten metal flows to overlap at a tip portion E and create seams, namely, cold shuts.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Moreover, because the shape of the runner <b>154</b> is also wide, the scroll member <b>150</b> cannot be finished with a lathe after the runner <b>154</b> is cut from the molded scroll member <b>150</b>, and therefore machining wherein a cutting tool, such as an end mill, is used to mill along the outer circumference of the discoidal end plate <b>152</b> is further required, which in turn increases manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">&#x3c;Features&#x3e;</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">(1)</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the present embodiment, the cavity <b>13</b>, which is a casting space of the scroll member <b>50</b> that is the molded article formed inside the forming mold <b>2</b>, is filled with the semimolten or semisolid metal in the plate thickness directions of the end plate <b>52</b> starting from the second surface <b>52</b><i>b</i>; note that the second surface <b>52</b><i>b </i>is on the opposite side of the end plate <b>52</b> to the first surface <b>52</b><i>a </i>wherefrom the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b> projects. Consequently, because the melt is supplied not from the circumferential edge of the end plate <b>52</b> but rather from the rear side surface, namely, the second surface <b>52</b><i>b</i>, whereon the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b> is not formed, the entire cavity <b>13</b> can be smoothly filled with the semimolten or semisolid metal, which prevents misruns, air inclusions, and cold shuts.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">(2)</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition, in the present embodiment, the aspect ratio of the passageway cross section of the runner <b>54</b>, which is a passageway for filling the cavity <b>13</b> with the semimolten or semisolid metal, is t<b>1</b>:t<b>2</b>&#x3c;1:3. Accordingly, the passageway of the runner <b>54</b> is not flat but rather has a somewhat square or circular cross sectional shape. Thereby, reducing the cross sectional length of the passageway of the runner <b>54</b> (in addition, the circumferential length of the pouring gate cross section) reduces cooling of the semimolten or semisolid metal at the runner <b>54</b> portion, which improves the fluidity of the melt. Consequently, the melt tends not to cool, which makes it possible to prevent misruns and improve yield.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, because the cross sectional shape of the runner <b>54</b> is not flat but rather is somewhat square or circular, after the runner <b>54</b> is cut off of the molded scroll member <b>50</b>, a lathe can be used to finish that cut portion of the molded scroll member <b>50</b>, which makes it possible to reduce manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">(3)</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the present embodiment, the insert or slide mold <b>5</b>, which is separate from the forming mold <b>2</b>, is inserted between the cavity <b>13</b> and the runner <b>54</b>, which is a passageway for filling the cavity <b>13</b> with the semimolten or semisolid metal, from a direction different from the directions in which the runner <b>54</b> extends, and subsequently the forming mold <b>2</b> is filled with the semimolten or semisolid metal.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Accordingly, because the insert or slide mold <b>5</b>, which is separate from the forming mold <b>2</b>, is inserted into the fixed mold <b>12</b>, the runner <b>54</b> can extend to the center of the cavity <b>13</b> (in particular, to the end plate <b>52</b> portion), which effectively prevents the generation of a decarburized layer, oxide scaling, or the like. Moreover, after molding, the insert or slide mold <b>5</b> can be easily detached from the forming mold <b>2</b> without interfering with the runner <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Moreover, using the insert or slide mold <b>5</b> to supply melt from the boss <b>53</b> side makes it possible to shorten the cross sectional length of the pouring gate.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">(4)</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The scroll member <b>50</b> molded in the present embodiment is a movable scroll that comprises the columnar boss <b>53</b> that projects from the second surface <b>52</b><i>b</i>, which is on the opposite side of the end plate <b>52</b> to the first surface <b>52</b><i>a </i>wherefrom the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b> projects. Accordingly, in the molding method according to the present embodiment, the semimolten or semisolid metal fills the cavity <b>13</b> of the forming mold <b>2</b> of the scroll member <b>50</b> from the portion of the boss <b>53</b> and through the runner <b>54</b>. Thus, filling the cavity <b>13</b> starting from the boss <b>53</b> of the scroll member <b>50</b> makes it possible to smoothly fill the entire cavity <b>13</b> (particularly the entire flat plate shaped groove <b>13</b><i>b </i>wherein the end plate <b>52</b> is formed) with the semimolten or semisolid metal, which more effectively prevents molding failures and enables the manufacture of the scroll member <b>50</b> with high quality.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">(5)</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As mentioned above, in the present embodiment, reducing cooling of the semimolten or semisolid metal at the runner <b>54</b> portion further improves the fluidity of the melt; moreover, viewed from the direction in which the cavity <b>13</b> is filled, it is possible to fill the cavity <b>13</b> from the rear surface side of the center part of the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b> of the scroll member <b>50</b> toward the radial directions.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">For these reasons, it is possible to eliminate misruns in the tip part of the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b> of the scroll member <b>50</b>. In addition, it is possible to eliminate air inclusions as well as to prevent cold shuts.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Moreover, after the runner <b>54</b> and the material residuary part <b>55</b> are cut off from the molded scroll member <b>50</b>, the scroll member <b>50</b> can be easily finished to its article shape using a lathe, which also makes it possible to reduce the cost of materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">MODIFIED EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">(A)</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Furthermore, the present embodiment explained an exemplary case of the scroll member <b>50</b> that comprises the scroll shaped portion <b>51</b>, the end plate <b>52</b>, and the boss <b>53</b>, but the shape of the cavity <b>13</b> of the molding apparatus <b>1</b> may be suitably modified to form a fixed scroll or some other cast article.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">(B)</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, to eliminate any scale from the surface of the semimolten or semisolid metal material C immediately after the semimolten or semisolid metal material C comes out of the material filling mechanism <b>6</b>, the material filling mechanism <b>6</b> is disposed spaced apart from, but not immediately behind, the boss <b>53</b> by a distance commensurate with a dimension of the runner <b>54</b>, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As a modified example, the runner <b>54</b> may be omitted and the boss <b>53</b> may be filled directly and from immediately behind with semisolid metal material and the like. For example, in the case of semisolid molding or semimolten molding that is heated in a vacuum or a nitrogen atmosphere, hardly any oxide scaling is generated, and consequently there is no need for a contamination prevention measure for preventing contamination of the molded article. Therefore, there is no need for a scale trap, such as the material residuary part <b>55</b>, and molding can be performed without the runner <b>54</b>. Eliminating the need for the runner <b>54</b> consequently improves the yield of the scroll member <b>50</b>. In addition, the mold configuration can also be simplified.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Industrial Applicability</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The present invention can be adapted to a semimolten or semisolid molding method and a molding apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In addition, the present invention can also be adapted to the molding of a fixed scroll, a rotary front head, and the like.</p>
