<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/135,019, filed Jun. 8, 2008, and entitled &#x201c;CONFIGURABLE SLIDING DOORS WITH REVERSIBLE HAND CONFIGURATIONS&#x201d; (now U.S. Pat. No. 8,056,286), which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/942,915, filed Jun. 8, 2007, and entitled &#x201c;NON-HANDED CONFIGURABLE SLIDING DOORS.&#x201d; The entire contents of each of the above-referenced patent application are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to door systems and components, such as door systems and components for use with movable walls.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background and Relevant Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Office space can be relatively expensive, not only due to the basic costs of the location and size of the office space, but also due to any construction needed to configure the office space in a particular way. An organization might purchase or rent a large open space in an office complex, and then subdivide or partition the open space into various offices, conference rooms, or cubicles, depending on the organization's needs and size constraints. Rather than having to find new office space and move as an organization's needs change, it is often necessary to have a convenient and efficient means to reconfigure the existing office space. Many organizations address their configuration and reconfiguration issues by dividing large, open office spaces into individual work areas using modular walls and partitions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, at least one advantage of modular systems is that they are relatively easy to configure. In addition, another advantage is that modular systems can be less expensive to set up, and can be reconfigured more easily than more permanently constructed office dividers. For example, a set of offices and a conference area can be carved out of a larger space in a relatively short period of time with the use of modular systems. If needs change, the organization can readily reconfigure the space.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, modular office partitions typically include a series of individual wall modules (and/or panels). The individual wall modules can either be free-standing or rigidly attached to one or more support structures. In addition, the wall modules are typically designed so that they can be assembled together to form a range of different configurations. In particular, a manufacturer or assembler can usually align and join the various wall modules together in almost any particular design, and then secure the design in place with any number of fasteners. These designs can include anything from large conference spaces to individual offices. A &#x201c;finished&#x201d; look is generally completed by adding gaskets or trim pieces in the joints between wall modules.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, one will appreciate that many modular wall partitions will need to implement a closure apparatus, such as a door. Doors are manufactured for use in a variety of settings including both exterior as well as interior settings. Manufacturers fabricate doors to suit the end uses found in the various applications in which the doors are to be used. In turn, doors provide a convenient way to enter and exit structures or interior spaces as well as to selectively open and close entrances. The necessary configuration of a particular door is determined by the specific requirements of the site where the door is being installed. These requirements may dictate the direction a door is to be opened, the type of door to be used, the configuration of mounting hardware, and how the door is to be installed, among other aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One particular use for doors is in conjunction with modular wall systems used to reconfigurably divide interior spaces. Of course, there are many types of doors from which to choose. In some cases, a manufacturer or designer will opt for a conventional swinging door, while in other cases, the manufacturer might opt for a sliding door configuration, whether for various aesthetic or space saving purposes. Regardless of the specific style or layout of the door, a manufacturer will typically need to fabricate a given door to suit a specific end-use found in the various applications in which the doors are to be used. One common consideration that will usually need to be taken into account is whether the door is a &#x201c;left-handed&#x201d; or &#x201c;right-handed&#x201d; door.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Manufacturers of sliding doors often fabricate doors with handles located on a selected side in order to allow the door to be opened in a desired direction. The door's hand is determined by the location of a door handle and the direction a door is opened. In general, the handedness of a door tends to be an important consideration since a door's hand may limit the situations in which the door may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Specific situations where a sliding door is going to be installed dictate the hand required for a particular door. Those wishing to install a sliding door must know, prior to purchasing the door, what hand and other aspects of the door are required and purchase a sliding door that has been manufactured in accordance with the site specific requirements where the door is to be installed. One will appreciate, therefore, that, if the particular handedness of a door is incorrect for a particular layout, the assembler may need to replace the given door with another door that is configured for a different handedness. Specifically, if the hand of a door is wrong, the contractor must then switch the door for one with the correct hand.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One will appreciate, however, that precisely predicting whether a sliding door should be right-handed or left-handed in a given construction site may be in flux, even during installation of the doors and wall modules. This is particularly true of modular partition assemblies, where the partition layouts may change during installation, or even sometime later during a remodeling phase. Furthermore, changes to a project may require corresponding changes in the hand of a door and mistakes may result in the purchase of doors with the wrong handedness. All of the foregoing can delay and burden projects in which the installation of doors is necessary.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Implementations of the present invention overcome one or more problems in the art with systems, methods, and apparatus configured to provide flexibility in the design and installation of door systems. In particular, implementations of the present invention allow for the reconfiguration of a single door regardless of the hand of the door for the given location. Furthermore, implementations of the present invention provide a manufacturer with the ability to produce one type of door that may be adapted for use at a number of given locations, and thereby minimize the number of components and materials used.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, a sliding door system that can be readily reconfigured on site for a plurality of different handedness requirements can include a horizontally symmetrical door frame having a plurality of different mounting locations. The plurality of mounting locations is configured to allow the sliding door to be selectively installed according to a plurality of orientations to reverse the handedness configuration of the sliding door. The system can also include a door pull coupled to the door frame. In this case, the door pull is configured for opening and closing the sliding door. In addition, the system can include mounting hardware comprising a roller mount assembly and a roller track assembly. A manufacturer can configure the mounting hardware and roller track assembly to be selectively coupled to the door frame in different orientations to reverse the handedness of the sliding door.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Similarly, a method for reversing the handedness configuration of a sliding door based on the orientation of the sliding door is provided. In particular, an assembler can identify that a sliding door in a doorway has a handedness configuration that needs to be reversed. The assembler can then remove the mounting hardware of the sliding door from a roller track affixed to the upper portion of a doorway. Similarly, the assembler can detach the mounting hardware from the door frame of the sliding door. As a result, by reorienting the door frame in a vertical or horizontal manner, the assembler can reverse the handedness configuration of the sliding door with respect to the doorway. Thereafter, the assembler can reattach the mounting hardware to the door frame and insert the mounting hardware into the roller track, wherein the sliding door is operable in the reverse handedness configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, a sliding door system that can be readily reconfigured on site for a plurality of different handedness requirements based on a vertical or horizontal orientation of the sliding door can include a doorway with a sliding connector means affixed thereto. The sliding connector means can allow a doorway closure means to slide open and closed with respect to the doorway. A reversible mounting means can reversibly mount the doorway closure means to the sliding connector means in a left or right handedness configuration with respect to the doorway even after the doorway closure means has been installed in an initial handedness configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additional features and advantages of exemplary implementations of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by the practice of such exemplary implementations. The features and advantages of such implementations may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of such exemplary implementations as set forth hereinafter.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention extends to systems, methods, and apparatus configured to provide flexibility in the design and installation of door systems. In particular, implementations of the present invention allow for the reconfiguration of a single door regardless of the hand of the door for the given location. Furthermore, implementations of the present invention provide a manufacturer with the ability to produce one type of door that may be adapted for use at a number of given locations, and thereby minimize the number of components and materials used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, and as will be understood more fully herein, an assembler can purchase a door of the present invention without regard for handedness restrictions. Specifically, when needed, the assembler can then configure the door, as necessary, to satisfy the specific handedness requirements of a given location. Thereafter, the assembler can even reconfigure the door if a different handedness is desired or required. Furthermore, the assembler can reuse the door at different locations with different handedness requirements by easily reconfiguring the door to satisfy the requirements at any given location. As a result, the door system of the present invention can also reduce the number of doors an assembler need keep in inventory.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Implementations of the present invention can be especially beneficial in the construction of modular wall systems, where the wall partition layouts can change during installation, or even sometime later during a remodeling phase. If changes to a project require corresponding changes in the handedness of a door or if a particular handedness configuration for the door is incorrect for a particular layout, the assembler can easily reconfigure the same door to satisfy the different handedness requirements. Thus, implementations of the present invention provide greater flexibility and efficiency in door systems.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to the Figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates several components of the reconfigurable door system <b>100</b> in accordance with an implementation of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, the system <b>100</b> includes a doorway closure means and reversible mounting means. As illustrated, the doorway closure means can include a sliding door <b>110</b> and the reversible mounting means can comprise separate mounting hardware <b>130</b>. As understood more fully herein, these and other components/parts can be used to create or install a door with virtually any handedness configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, the &#x201c;hand&#x201d; of a door generally relates to the direction and manner in which a particular door opens. For example, a user facing a door, and pulling a door pull/handle on the right side of the door, and pulling the door from right to left (swinging or sliding), would be facing a right-handed door configuration. By contrast, a user facing a door and pulling a door pull/handle on the left side of the door, and pulling the door from left to right (swinging or sliding), would be facing a left-handed door configuration. Changing the hand of the door in accordance with implementations of the present invention, therefore, can allow an assembler to easily configure the given door for use at a variety of locations.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To these and other ends, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that in at least one implementation of the present invention, the doorway closure means can also comprise a door frame <b>112</b> comprising a plurality of spaced-apart vertical members <b>112</b><i>a </i>coupled with at least one horizontal member <b>112</b><i>b</i>. In at least one implementation, the door frame <b>112</b> can be horizontally and/or vertically symmetrical so as to facilitate operation of the door <b>110</b> according to multiple configurations and orientations. A manufacturer can form the vertical <b>112</b><i>a </i>and/or horizontal <b>112</b><i>b </i>members of the door frame <b>112</b> using metallic materials, including extruded metallic materials, such as extruded aluminum. One will appreciate, however, that the door frame <b>112</b> can be manufactured using any number of other materials including wood, glass, plastic and the like. In an additional implementation, the door frame <b>112</b> can include a glass panel (not shown) coupled to the vertical <b>112</b><i>a </i>and horizontal <b>112</b><i>b </i>members.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further illustrates a handle or door pull <b>120</b> coupled to the door frame <b>112</b> to facilitate opening and closing the door <b>110</b>. As is illustrated, for example, an assembler can couple a door pull <b>120</b> to a vertical member <b>112</b><i>a </i>of the door frame <b>112</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the use of a single door pull <b>120</b> coupled to one side of the door <b>110</b>, it will be appreciated that an assembler or manufacturer can couple multiple door pulls <b>120</b> to the door <b>110</b>. For example, a manufacturer can configure the door <b>110</b> to include similar door pulls <b>120</b> on opposite sides of the vertical member <b>112</b><i>a</i>, such that a user can operate a door pull <b>120</b> to open the door <b>110</b> regardless of the side of the door <b>110</b> on which a user is located.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In situations where a single door pull <b>120</b> is used, the side of the door <b>110</b> to which the door pull <b>120</b> is attached will sometimes be referred to herein for reference purposes only as the &#x201c;door-pull side&#x201d; of the door <b>110</b>. For further reference purposes, the side of the door <b>110</b> facing the modular wall to which the door <b>110</b> is attached may be referred to herein as the &#x201c;wall side&#x201d; of the door <b>110</b>, while the side facing away from the modular wall may be referred to herein as the &#x201c;non-wall side&#x201d; of the door <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition to the door pull <b>120</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that the door <b>110</b> can also include a plurality of mounting locations <b>140</b> along the top edge thereof. A manufacturer can configure the mounting locations <b>140</b> to receive separate mounting hardware <b>130</b> for mounting the door <b>110</b> to a doorway where the door <b>110</b> is going to be employed. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one will appreciate that the manufacturer can also include similar mounting locations <b>140</b> along the bottom edge of the door <b>110</b>, such that an assembler can couple the separate mounting hardware <b>130</b> to the top edge or alternatively to the bottom edge of the door <b>110</b>, as desired, for different handedness configurations. As a result, the door <b>110</b> may be used in a variety of configurations wherein an assembler can horizontally or vertically rotate the door <b>110</b> as desired for different handedness configurations. Accordingly, the terms &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; are used for ease of reference only.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further illustrates reversible mounting means, which can include separate mounting hardware <b>130</b>, and which an assembler can attach to the mounting locations <b>140</b> of the door frame <b>112</b> and use to mount the door <b>110</b> at a desired location. In one implementation of the present invention, an assembler can mount the door <b>110</b> to a doorway by inserting the mounting hardware <b>130</b> into a sliding connector means attached above the doorway, thereby allowing a user to slide the door <b>110</b> open and closed. In one implementation, the sliding connector means includes a roller track assembly (e.g., <b>150</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). A manufacturer can configure the separate mounting hardware <b>130</b> so that an assembler can selectively couple the mounting hardware <b>130</b> to the mounting locations <b>140</b> in accordance with multiple configurations, which thus facilitates reconfiguration of the handedness of the door <b>110</b>. For example, in at least one implementation of the present invention, the manufacturer can configure the mounting hardware <b>130</b> to universally interface with (and couple to) any of the mounting locations <b>140</b> of the door <b>110</b>, regardless of the mounting location <b>140</b> or the direction the mounting hardware <b>130</b> faces, whether towards the front or back of the door. Of course, one will appreciate that &#x201c;front&#x201d; and &#x201c;back&#x201d; are used for reference purposes only. For example, a door <b>110</b> can be readily reconfigured such that the front becomes the back and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a partial perspective view of the system <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in more detail. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the separate mounting hardware <b>130</b> can include a roller mount assembly <b>132</b> and a slowdown block <b>138</b>. The roller mount assembly <b>132</b> can interface with a roller track (e.g., <b>150</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) such that a user can slide the door <b>110</b> open and closed. The slowdown block <b>138</b> can regulate the speed at which the door <b>110</b> slides open and closed for safety purposes and to prevent damage to the components of the door system <b>100</b>. The roller mount assembly <b>132</b> and slowdown block <b>138</b> can mount to a mounting location <b>140</b>, in this case, on the right side of the top of the door <b>110</b>. Of course, one will appreciate that the terms &#x201c;right&#x201d; and &#x201c;top&#x201d; are used for ease of reference only, and any reference to &#x201c;right&#x201d; or &#x201c;left&#x201d; with respect to any particular mounting location will be understood as being relative to the intended handedness of any given door. For example, though not illustrated, the left top side, and both the bottom left and bottom right sides of the door <b>110</b> can also include mounting locations <b>140</b> defined therein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In particular, the mounting location <b>140</b> can include a plurality of mounting holes <b>142</b> defined therein. In at least one implementation, the mounting holes <b>142</b> of the multiple mounting locations <b>140</b> can be substantially similar. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mounting holes <b>142</b> can be generally centered relative to the minor axis <b>114</b> of the door <b>110</b>, which can also be referred to as the thickness of the door <b>110</b>. In a further implementation, the mounting locations <b>140</b> can be configured to be symmetric about the minor axis <b>114</b> of the door <b>110</b> so as to facilitate reversibly mounting the separate mounting hardware <b>130</b> to the mounting locations <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In any event, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> and slowdown block <b>138</b> can be secured to the door frame <b>112</b> by way of the mounting holes <b>142</b>. In particular, the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> includes a bracket <b>134</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further shows that the bracket <b>134</b> can include a base portion <b>134</b><i>a </i>and an offset vertical portion <b>134</b><i>b</i>. The base portion <b>134</b><i>a </i>of the bracket <b>134</b> can also include holes <b>135</b> defined therein to allow the bracket <b>134</b> to be mounted to the corresponding mounting holes <b>142</b> in the mounting location <b>140</b>. By way of explanation, the various parts of the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> and slowdown block <b>138</b> can be formed using metallic materials. For example, in at least one implementation, a manufacturer can form the bracket <b>134</b> from sheet metal of any type and can form the slowdown block <b>138</b> using a zinc alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further illustrates, in addition to a bracket <b>134</b>, the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> can also include one or more rollers <b>133</b>. A manufacturer can configure the rollers <b>133</b> to interface with and roll along a roller track (not shown) to slide the door <b>110</b> open and closed. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the use of rollers <b>133</b>, one will appreciate that a manufacturer may use other means for allowing the door <b>110</b> to slide open and closed. In at least one implementation of the present invention, for example, a manufacturer may include bearings to facilitate the sliding of the door <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of a roller track configured to interface with the rollers <b>133</b> of the roller mount assembly <b>132</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a roller track assembly <b>150</b> for use in at least one implementation of the present invention. As is illustrated, the roller track assembly <b>150</b> can include a plurality of brackets <b>152</b> configured for coupling the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to a modular wall or doorway. In at least one implementation, the brackets <b>152</b> are removable and their location along the roller track assembly <b>150</b> is adjustable. In particular, an assembler can move and/or remove the brackets <b>152</b> in order to configure the roller track assembly <b>150</b> for use in a variety of different handedness configurations and with a variety of different modular wall and doorway configurations. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the use of brackets <b>152</b>, one will appreciate that a manufacturer can configure the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to include any available means for securing the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to a modular wall or doorway.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the roller track assembly <b>150</b> can include a roller track <b>156</b> configured to receive rollers or other means for sliding or rolling along the length of the roller track assembly <b>150</b>. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that the roller track assembly <b>150</b> can include a trim cap <b>154</b> configured to cover and protect the roller track <b>156</b>, and improve the aesthetics of the roller track assembly <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a more detailed representation of a roller track assembly <b>150</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a rear (or front) view of the roller track assembly <b>150</b>, a doorway header <b>160</b>, a roller mount assembly <b>132</b>, and a door <b>110</b>, and how the components interact. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an implementation in which an assembler has coupled the door <b>110</b> to the roller mount assembly <b>132</b>, and inserted the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> into the roller track assembly <b>150</b>. As shown, this assembly allows the rollers <b>133</b> to slide along the roller track <b>156</b> in order to open and close the door <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also shows that the roller track assembly <b>150</b> is in turn coupled to the doorway header <b>160</b>. Specifically, an assembler can couple the doorway header <b>160</b> to a modular wall to span the top of a doorway. Along these lines, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that the doorway header <b>160</b> can include a channel <b>162</b>, or other connection details, configured to receive the brackets <b>152</b> of the roller track assembly <b>150</b>. In turn, an assembler can fasten the brackets <b>152</b> to the roller track <b>156</b> in a desired configuration. Accordingly, a manufacturer or assembler can couple the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to the doorway header <b>160</b>. The roller track assembly <b>150</b> can also overlap the doorway (to the left or the right) in order to allow a door <b>110</b> to open to the left or the right of the doorway. As such, a manufacturer can further configure the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to be coupled to the portion of the adjacent modular wall overlapped by the roller track assembly <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Once the roller track assembly <b>150</b> is coupled to the doorway header <b>160</b>, an assembler can insert the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> into the roller track assembly <b>150</b>, such that the rollers <b>133</b> interface with the roller track <b>156</b>. As a result, the rollers <b>133</b> can roll along the length of the roller track <b>156</b>, thereby allowing the door <b>110</b> to slide relative to the doorway. In one implementation, the assembler may then install a trim cap <b>154</b>, which can provide an aesthetically pleasing and protective cover for the components of the roller track assembly <b>150</b> and the roller mount assembly <b>132</b>. In one implementation, an assembler may also install end caps (not shown) at the opposite ends of the roller track assembly <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, one will appreciate that as a user opens a door <b>110</b>, a substantial portion of the door <b>110</b> can travel beyond a doorway. In one implementation, the travel of the door <b>110</b> relative to the doorway can be controlled by the configuration of the roller track assembly <b>150</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show that the roller track <b>156</b> of the roller track assembly <b>150</b> can be less than double the width of a doorway, as a portion of the door <b>110</b> can still overlap the doorway when the door <b>110</b> is in the opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Accordingly, an assembler can couple the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to a doorway, such that a first portion of the roller track assembly <b>150</b> is positioned directly over the doorway, and the remaining portion is positioned to the left or right of the doorway, depending on the direction of travel desired for the door <b>110</b>. Specifically, an assembler can install the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to overlap to the right of the doorway if desiring that the door <b>110</b> open to the right, such as with a left-handed door configuration. Similarly, an assembler can install the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to overlap to the left of the doorway if desiring that the door <b>110</b> open to the left, such as with a right-handed door configuration. As such, the reconfigurable nature of the roller track assembly <b>150</b> furthers the reconfigurable capability of the system <b>100</b> by allowing the door <b>110</b> to be slid opened (or shut) in either direction, as is necessary or desired, for different handedness configurations and different locations.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> illustrate further examples of how an assembler can reconfigure the handedness configuration of the sliding door <b>110</b>, in accordance with an implementation of the present invention. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> illustrate the same sliding door <b>110</b> configured to have opposite handedness configurations. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates the door <b>110</b> having a right handed configuration, with the door pull <b>120</b> located on the right side of the door <b>110</b>, and being configured to slide open to the left as shown by the sliding direction <b>170</b>. As previously introduced, the door <b>110</b> includes mounting locations <b>140</b> along the top edge of the door <b>110</b> to which an assembler can mount the separate mounting hardware <b>130</b>, such as a roller mount assembly (e.g., <b>132</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In turn, the assembler can insert the mounting hardware <b>130</b> into a roller track assembly (e.g., <b>150</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to allow the door to slide open and closed. In the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the assembler would install the roller track assembly to overlap a doorway to the left to allow the door <b>110</b> in its right-handed configuration to slide open to the left as indicated by the sliding direction <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If desired, the assembler can later reconfigure the door <b>110</b> to have a left-handed configuration, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. In at least one example, as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, in order to change the hand of the door <b>110</b>, an assembler can remove the separate mounting hardware <b>130</b> from the roller track assembly (e.g., <b>150</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The assembler can then remove the separate mounting hardware <b>130</b> from the door <b>110</b>. Thereafter, the assembler can horizontally rotate the door <b>110</b> 180 degrees such that the front of the door <b>110</b> becomes the back and vice versa, and such that the door pull <b>120</b> is located on the opposite side as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> further illustrates that the assembler can then remount the separate mounting hardware <b>130</b> to the mounting locations <b>140</b> on the top of the door <b>110</b>. The assembler can also remove the roller track assembly (e.g., <b>150</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which was previously coupled to the doorway overlapping to the left and recouple the roller track assembly to the doorway overlapping to the right such that the door <b>110</b> can slide open to the right as illustrated by the slide direction <b>170</b>. The assembler can further insert the separate mounting hardware <b>130</b> back into the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to complete the reconfiguration of the handedness of the door <b>110</b>. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> illustrates the result in which the door <b>110</b> has a left handed configuration and is configured to slide open to the right. Accordingly, the configuration of the components of the system <b>100</b> allows the hand of the door <b>110</b> to be reconfigured from one side to the other in a convenient and rapid fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> illustrate one method of reconfiguring a door in accordance with an implementation of the present invention, one will appreciate that an assembler can reconfigure the door in a number of ways. For example, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> illustrate a reconfiguration of the door <b>110</b> using a horizontal 180 degree rotation, an assembler can also reconfigure the hand of the door <b>110</b> using vertical rotation, or using a combination of horizontal and vertical rotation as necessary to obtain the configuration desired for a certain location.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref> illustrate multiple reconfigurations of a sliding door <b>110</b> coupled to a doorway <b>200</b> of a modular wall <b>190</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates the door <b>110</b> having a left handed configuration from the perspective of a user on the wall side of the door <b>110</b>. Mounting hardware comprising a roller mount assembly <b>132</b>, attaches to the door <b>110</b> with the rollers <b>133</b> facing the wall side of the door <b>110</b> so as to interface with the roller track assembly <b>150</b> (only the outline of which is shown) and allow the door to slide open to the right as shown by the slide direction <b>170</b>. Of course, one will appreciate that the terms &#x201c;right&#x201d; and &#x201c;left&#x201d; are used for ease of reference only, and any reference to &#x201c;right&#x201d; or &#x201c;left&#x201d; with respect to a sliding direction <b>170</b> will be understood as being relative to the intended handedness of any given door from the perspective of a user on the wall side of the door <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An assembler can reconfigure the door <b>110</b> from a left handed configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> to a right handed configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. To do so, the assembler can remove the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> from the roller track assembly <b>150</b> and detach the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> from the door <b>110</b>. The assembler can then vertically rotate the door <b>110</b>, as illustrated by the rotation direction <b>180</b>, so as to locate the door pull <b>120</b> on the right side of the door <b>110</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. By vertically rotating the door <b>110</b>, the top of the door <b>110</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> becomes the bottom of the door <b>110</b> and vice versa. In order to facilitate reconfiguration of the door <b>110</b> through vertical rotation, the door can include mounting locations (e.g., <b>140</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) on both the top and the bottom edges of the door <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> further illustrates, the assembler can then reattach the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> to the door <b>110</b> and insert the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> back into the roller track assembly <b>150</b>. To facilitate sliding the door <b>110</b> to the left as indicated by the slide direction <b>170</b>, the assembler can remove the roller track assembly <b>150</b> and recouple the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to the doorway <b>200</b> so as to overlap the doorway <b>200</b> to the left.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, an assembler can then reconfigure the door <b>110</b> to have an alternative left handed configuration. To do so, the assembler can remove the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> from the roller track assembly <b>150</b> and detach the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> from the door <b>110</b>. The assembler can then horizontally rotate the door <b>110</b>, as illustrated by the rotation direction <b>180</b>, so as to locate the door pull <b>120</b> on the left side of the door <b>110</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. Unlike the vertical rotation discussed above, by horizontally rotating the door <b>110</b>, the top edge of the door <b>110</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> remains the top edge of the door <b>110</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> further illustrates, the assembler can then reattach the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> to the door <b>110</b> and insert the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> back into the roller track assembly <b>150</b>. To facilitate sliding the door <b>110</b> to the right as indicated by the slide direction <b>170</b>, the assembler can remove the roller track assembly <b>150</b> and recouple the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to the doorway <b>200</b> so as to overlap the doorway <b>200</b> to the right.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, an assembler can reconfigure the door <b>110</b> from the left handed configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> to a right handed configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>. To do so, the assembler can remove the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> from the roller track assembly <b>150</b> and detach the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> from the door <b>110</b>. The assembler can then vertically rotate the door <b>110</b>, as illustrated by the rotation direction <b>180</b>, so as to locate the door pull <b>120</b> on the right side of the door <b>110</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>. By vertically rotating the door <b>110</b>, the top of the door <b>110</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> becomes the bottom of the door and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> further illustrates, the assembler can then reattach the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> to the door <b>110</b> and insert the roller mount assembly <b>132</b> back into the roller track assembly <b>150</b>. To facilitate sliding the door <b>110</b> to the left as indicated by the slide direction <b>170</b>, the assembler can remove the roller track assembly <b>150</b> and recouple the roller track assembly <b>150</b> to the doorway <b>200</b> so as to overlap the doorway <b>200</b> to the left.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Of course, one will appreciate that although the hand of the door <b>110</b> has been described as being changed after the door <b>110</b> has been mounted to a doorway <b>200</b>, the hand of the door <b>110</b> can also be configured from one side to the other as desired prior to mounting the door <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition to the foregoing, implementations of the present invention can also be described in terms of one or more steps in a method of accomplishing a particular result. For example, at least one implementation of the present invention comprises a method for reversing the handedness configuration of a sliding door based on a vertical or horizontal orientation of the sliding door. This method is described more fully below.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, at least one method in accordance with the present invention can comprise an act of determining that a door's handedness configuration needs to be reversed. This act can include identifying a door in a doorway having a handedness configuration that needs to be reversed. For example, an assembler determines that a doorway is configured with a roller track assembly <b>150</b> in one position that corresponds with a particular door handedness configuration, but a different door handedness configuration is required for the doorway. Alternatively, a manufacturer can desire to switch the door handedness configuration of a sliding door <b>110</b> already in place in a doorway.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The method can also comprise an act of taking apart the existing components of the doorway. This act can include removing the mounting hardware of a sliding door from a roller track affixed to the upper portion of a doorway. For example, an assembler can remove the sliding door <b>110</b> from the doorway by removing the mounting hardware <b>130</b> of the sliding door <b>110</b> from the roller track assembly <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In addition, the method can comprise an act of removing the mounting hardware from the sliding door. This act can include detaching the mounting hardware from the door. For example, an assembler can remove the mounting hardware <b>130</b> from the mounting locations <b>140</b> of the sliding door <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Furthermore, the method can comprise an act of reorienting the sliding door to reconfigure its handedness configuration. This act can include reorienting the door in a vertical or horizontal manner to reverse the handedness configuration of the door with respect to the doorway. For example, an assembler can horizontally rotate the sliding door <b>110</b> with respect to the doorway. In particular, the assembler can rotate the sliding door <b>110</b>, thereby locating the door pull <b>120</b> on the opposite side of the sliding door <b>110</b> with respect to the doorway.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Still further, the method can comprise an act of remounting the sliding door according to the reconfigured handedness configuration. This act can include reattaching the mounting hardware to the door and inserting the mounting hardware into the roller track, wherein the sliding door is operable in the reverse handedness configuration. For example, an assembler can reattach the mounting hardware <b>130</b> to the mounting locations <b>140</b> of the sliding door <b>110</b> and reinsert the mounting hardware <b>130</b> into the roller track assembly such that the sliding door <b>110</b> can operate according to the reversed handedness configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6D</figref>, and the corresponding text, illustrate and describe a number of schematics, components, and mechanisms of a reconfigurable door and door mounting system. In particular, as illustrated herein, implementations of the present invention allow for the reconfiguration of a single door to satisfy multiple handedness configurations. The components described herein allow a manufacturer to produce one type of door that may be adapted for use at a number of given locations, thereby minimizing the number of components and materials used.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The present invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.</p>
