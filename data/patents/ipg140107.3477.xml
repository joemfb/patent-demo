<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Regulating the speed of a two-phase switched reluctance machine (TPSRM) rotor includes selecting either a motoring mode or braking mode of operation for the TPSRM, regulating the rotor speed, when the motoring mode is selected, using a control signal cooperatively produced by a speed control feedback loop and a current control feedback loop; and regulating the rotor speed, when the braking mode is selected, using a control signal produced by the current control feedback loop without the cooperation of the speed control feedback loop. The speed control feedback loop uses an established speed control signal and a signal indicative of the rotor's speed to dynamically adjust a first parameter governing the control signal. The current control feedback loop uses an established current control signal and a signal indicative of the current flowing through a stator winding of the TPSRM to dynamically adjust a second parameter governing the control signal.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method and system for controlling the operation of a two-phase switched reluctance machine (TPSRM). More specifically, the invention relates to controlling the TPSRM with a power converter employing a single controllable switch.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A two-phase switched reluctance machine (TPSRM) is a switched reluctance machine (SRM) with two phases, phases A and B, displaced from each other by 180 degrees/n, where n is the number of stator poles per phase. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>) illustrate a two-phase SRM <b>700</b> of the related art. TPSRM <b>700</b> has four stator poles <b>9</b>-<b>12</b> and two rotor poles <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and is characterized as a two-phase machine with a 4/2 stator/rotor pole combination (i.e., 4 stator poles and 2 rotor poles). The rotor rotates about a rotor shaft <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates TPSRM <b>700</b> and its flux paths through back iron segments <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>, stator poles <b>9</b>, <b>11</b>, and rotor poles <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> during the excitation of phase A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates TPSRM <b>700</b> and its flux paths through back iron segments <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>, stator poles <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, and rotor poles <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> during the excitation of phase B. The phase A excitation is induced by winding <b>16</b>, <b>16</b>&#x2032; around stator pole <b>9</b> and another winding <b>17</b>, <b>17</b>&#x2032; on the diametrically opposed stator pole <b>11</b>. Winding <b>16</b>, <b>16</b>&#x2032; and winding <b>17</b>, <b>17</b>&#x2032; may be connected in series or in parallel. The phase B excitation is induced by winding <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032; around stator pole <b>10</b> and another winding <b>19</b>, <b>19</b>&#x2032; on the diametrically opposed stator pole <b>12</b>. Winding <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032; and winding <b>19</b>, <b>19</b>&#x2032; may similarly be connected in series or in parallel. In each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>), the rotor poles are positioned in alignment with the stator poles whose windings are being energized.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Excitation of the phase B windings is initiated when rotor pole <b>14</b> is positioned between stator poles <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> and rotor pole <b>13</b> is positioned between stator poles <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. The rate of change of inductance will be positive in this region and, hence, positive torque will be produced. As a result, rotor poles <b>14</b> and <b>13</b> will rotate clockwise (CW) toward the phase B stator poles <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively. When rotor poles <b>14</b> and <b>13</b> pass around phase B stator poles <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively, the phase A windings will be excited, causing rotor poles <b>14</b> and <b>13</b> to rotate CW toward the phase stator poles <b>11</b> and <b>9</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To reverse the direction of rotation, phase B windings <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>&#x2032; and <b>19</b>, <b>19</b>&#x2032; are excited when rotor pole <b>14</b> is between stator poles <b>12</b> and <b>9</b> and rotor pole <b>13</b> is between stator poles <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. If the rotor poles are closer to phase B stator poles <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, the rotor will rotate toward them resulting in counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation. Therefore, controlling the rotor's direction of rotation involves the independent control of the phase A and B excitations. If such independent control of individual phase excitation is not possible, there is no control method that can reverse the machine's rotor rotation from one direction to another.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Related art TPSRMs are driven by two or four controllable switch-based power converters. Some examples are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a related art asymmetric power converter <b>100</b> for driving a two-phase SRM. Power converter <b>100</b> has two controllable and two uncontrollable power devices for each phase winding <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> of the SRM. Therefore, four controllable <b>103</b>-<b>106</b> and four uncontrollable <b>107</b>-<b>110</b> power devices are required for power converter <b>100</b> to operate. The primary advantage of power converter <b>100</b> is that it gives full controllability in terms of its ability to apply full positive or negative direct current (dc) link voltage, and, therefore, it does not diminish or restrict any operating mode of the SRM. The disadvantage of this power converter topology is that it uses eight power devices. A more detailed description of power converter <b>100</b>'s circuit operation may be found in &#x201c;Switched Reluctance Motor Drives&#x201d;, R. Krishnan, CRC Press, June 2001.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a related art single switch-per-phase power converter <b>200</b> for driving a two-phase SRM. Power converter <b>200</b>'s circuit topology is based on splitting a dc input source voltage <b>201</b> equally to the machine side power converter. This results in a circuit requiring one controllable and one uncontrollable power device per phase winding <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>. Therefore, overall, power converter <b>200</b> requires two controllable power devices <b>204</b>, <b>205</b> and two uncontrollable power devices <b>206</b>, <b>207</b> for a two-phase SRM. The major advantage of this circuit design is that it uses a reduced number of power devices (e.g., a total of four) compared to the asymmetric converter. The disadvantage of this circuit is that it reduces the available dc source voltage by half and, therefore, doubles the current rating required for the devices and for the machine, resulting in low efficiency machine operation. A fuller description of this circuit may be found in &#x201c;Switched Reluctance Motor Drives&#x201d;, R. Krishnan, CRC Press, June 2001.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some variations of the single-switch-per-phase topologies are described by Harris in U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,610, by Webster in U.S. Pat. No. 5,864,477, and by Disser et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,900,712. Harris describes a circuit with a single-switch-per-phase topology that requires more than one diode per phase and additionally requires more than one dc link capacitor. Also, the commutating voltages to the phase windings of Harris' power converter are always less than the source dc voltage in this circuit. These are severe limitations.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Webster and Disser each describe a single-switch-per-phase topology requiring two capacitors for storing energy in the circuit. Moreover, these topologies do not provide for a common emitter connection of the switches, thereby creating an isolation requirement for the gate drive circuits and a higher cost for the additional components. As a result of the above-mention and other factors, these circuits are strongly limited to low cost variable speed applications.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a related art C-Dump power converter <b>300</b> for driving a two-phase SRM. Power converter <b>300</b>'s circuit uses three controllable power devices <b>301</b>-<b>303</b> and three uncontrollable diodes <b>304</b>-<b>306</b>, resulting in the use of six power devices. This is an intermediate circuit between those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The operating modes are somewhat restricted for this circuit, since it can apply a full dc source voltage <b>309</b> to machine windings <b>307</b>, <b>308</b> only in the positive direction. Furthermore, this circuit requires an external inductor <b>310</b> or a resistor (not shown) to dissipate the energy stored in a C-dump capacitor <b>311</b>. Use of external inductor <b>310</b> increases the cost, whereas the use of the power resistor (not shown) will result in a lower efficiency of the system and higher package volume, due to increased thermal considerations. Therefore, this circuit is not ideal for use with two-phase SRMs. A more detailed description of this circuit may be found in &#x201c;Switched Reluctance Motor Drives&#x201d;, R. Krishnan, CRC Press, June 2001 and in Miller et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,684,867, dated Aug. 4, 1987.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a related art single switch-per-phase power converter <b>400</b> for driving a two-phase SRM. Power converter <b>400</b> requires one uncontrolled power device <b>401</b>, <b>402</b> and one controlled power device <b>403</b>, <b>404</b> per phase <b>405</b>, <b>406</b>, and therefore, requires four power devices to function. Furthermore, power converter <b>400</b> requires a special winding in the machine, known as a bifilar winding. This special winding increases the copper volume in the machine windings, resulting in increased cost for the machine. Additionally, power switches <b>403</b>, <b>404</b> experience higher voltage stresses due to the leakage inductance between the windings of each respective phase. This leakage inductance can be minimized but cannot be eliminated in a practical machine. Therefore, this converter circuit is not widely used, despite the fact that a full dc source voltage <b>407</b> can be impressed on the machine with full controllability of the current. A more in depth description of this circuit may be found in &#x201c;Switched Reluctance Motor Drives&#x201d;, R. Krishnan, CRC Press, June 2001 and in Miller, U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,824, dated Feb. 19, 1985.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">All other heretofore known two-phase power converter circuit topologies fall into one of the above-described categories, in terms of the total number of power devices required for their operation. From the foregoing, it may be seen that a minimum of two controllable power devices are required for operating a related art two-phase SRM.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Generally speaking though, commercial power converters used to drive a two-phase SRM usually have more than two controllable switches and more than two diodes. Circuits requiring only two controllable switches and two diodes have the disadvantages of high power loss, low efficiency, and a bifilar winding in the machine, thereby reducing the power density of the machine. Therefore, existing solutions are not attractive with regard to considerations of high efficiency operation, full range of speed control, compactness in the converter's packaging and, most importantly of all, the overall cost of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A fundamental challenge in power converter development has been to reduce the number of power devices, both controllable and uncontrollable, to a level corresponding to that of a single-quadrant chopper drive, such as is commonly used in a dc motor drive or in a universal motor drive. A description of these drives is provided in &#x201c;Switched Reluctance Motor Drives&#x201d;, R. Krishnan, CRC Press, June 2001. When the number of power devices has been reduced to this level, a brushless SRM drive becomes commercially competitive for variable speed applications. Moreover, the brushless SRM has the superior advantage of high efficiency, since there are no brushes and commutators in the SRM. Also, the brushless SRM is further endowed with high-speed operability, high reliability, maintenance-free operation, greater overload capability and, most of all, a cost advantage over the dc motor drive.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An object of the present invention is to overcome the above-described problems and limitations of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for controlling the speed of a two-phase switched reluctance machine (TPSRM) with a power converter having only one controllable switch.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Still another object of the invention is to provide speed control for a TPSRM, controlled by a power converter having only one controllable switch, during the transition from clockwise to counter-clockwise rotation and vice versa when the TPSRM is operating as a generator.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A further object of the invention is to provide speed control for a TPSRM, controlled by a power converter having only one controllable switch, so as to recover mechanical energy from the machine's inertia and that of its load and convert this energy to electrical energy so as to achieve the effect of an electric brake.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A further object of the invention is to provide speed control for a TPSRM, controlled by a power converter having only one controllable switch, so as to operate the TPSRM in all or a subset of its four-quadrant torque-versus-speed modes of operation, which are forward motoring, forward regeneration, reverse motoring, and reverse regeneration.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">These and other objects of the invention may be achieved in whole or in part by a method of regulating the speed of a two-phase switched reluctance machine (TPSRM) rotor. According to this method, a motoring mode or a braking mode of operation is selected for the TPSRM. The rotor speed is regulated, when the motoring mode is selected, using a control signal cooperatively produced by a speed control feedback loop and a current control feedback loop. When the braking mode is selected, the rotor speed is regulated using a control signal produced by the current control feedback loop without the cooperation of the speed control feedback loop. The speed control feedback loop uses an established speed control signal and a signal indicative of the rotor's speed to dynamically adjust a first parameter governing the control signal. The current control feedback loop uses an established current control signal and a signal indicative of the current flowing through a stator winding of the TPSRM to dynamically adjust a second parameter governing the control signal. The braking mode of operation converts the TPSRM's mechanical energy into electrical energy to produce a braking effect on the rotation of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The objects of the invention may also be achieved in whole or in part by a drive system for regulating the speed of a two-phase switched reluctance machine (TPSRM) rotor. The system includes a speed control feedback loop component that uses an established speed control signal and a signal indicative of the rotor's speed to dynamically adjust a first parameter, and a current control feedback loop component that uses an established current control signal and a signal indicative of the current flowing through a stator winding of the TPSRM to dynamically adjust a second parameter. A control signal for regulating the speed of the TPSRM rotor is produced in accordance with the first and second parameters when the TPSRM is operated in a motoring mode, and the control signal for regulating the speed of the TPSRM rotor is produced in accordance with the second parameter but not the first parameter when the TPSRM's braking mode is selected. The braking mode of operation converts the TPSRM's mechanical energy into electrical energy to produce a braking effect on the rotation of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The objects of the invention may be further achieved in whole or in part by a method of reversing the rotational direction of a two-phase switched reluctance machine (TPSRM) rotor. According to this method, the flow of current through a single controllable current valve is regulated to maintain a forward motoring mode of operation for the TPSRM. Then, the flow of current through the single controllable current valve is regulated to cause the TPSRM's mechanical energy to be converted into electrical energy so as to produce a braking effect on the rotation of the rotor. Thereafter, the flow of current through the single controllable current valve is interrupted for a period of time. After the period of time has expired, the flow of current through the single controllable current valve is regulated to induce the TPSRM's rotor to reverse its direction of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The objects of the invention may be further achieved in whole or in part by a system for reversing the rotational direction of a two-phase switched reluctance machine (TPSRM) rotor. The system includes a controller and a single controllable current valve that regulates, under the control of the controller, the current flowing through the current valve so as to establish the rotational direction and speed of the rotor. Together, the controller and the current valve cooperate to maintain a forward motoring mode of operation for the TPSRM, when the TPSRM's rotor is to continue rotating in its current direction. Also, the controller and the current valve cooperate to cause the TPSRM's mechanical energy to be converted into electrical energy so as to produce a braking effect on the rotation of the rotor, when a reversal in the rotor's direction of rotation is to be achieved. After the rotor has been braked, the controller and the current valve cooperate to interrupt the flow of current through the single controllable current valve for a period of time. Then the controller and the current valve cooperate to regulate the flow of current through the single controllable current valve to induce the TPSRM's rotor to reverse its direction of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The objects of the invention may be further achieved in whole or in part by a method of starting the rotation of a rotor of a two-phase switched reluctance machine (TPSRM) whose main and auxiliary phase windings are energized under the control of a single controllable current valve. According to this method, current is conducted through the current valve in a single conduction pulse. Then, a determination is made as to whether the TPSRM's rotor is rotating. If not, current is again conducted through the current valve in a single conduction pulse.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a single-switch power controller in the form of a power converter <b>500</b> for driving a two-phase switched reluctance machine (SRM). One winding of the SRM is alternatively referred to as a main or phase A winding <b>508</b>, while the other winding is referred to as an auxiliary or phase B winding <b>505</b>. Although phase windings <b>505</b>, <b>508</b> of the SRM may be spatially separated from power converter <b>500</b> and may also be considered to form a part of the machine (also referred to herein as a motor) rather than part of the power converter, these windings <b>505</b>, <b>508</b> are illustrated in the power converter circuit for the purpose of simplifying the description of their cooperative functionality with power converter <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When power converter <b>500</b> is activated by the application of an alternating current (ac) source voltage <b>501</b>, a dc source <b>510</b> comes into effect through the rectification and filtering provided by a diode <b>502</b> and a dc source capacitor <b>503</b>, respectively. As dc source <b>510</b> comes into effect, current begins flowing through electrical paths that are parallel to capacitor <b>503</b>. These parallel paths are provided by: (1) auxiliary phase B winding <b>505</b> and an auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b>, provided that an optional diode <b>504</b> is not included in the circuit, and (2) main phase A winding <b>508</b>, a diode <b>507</b>, and auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b>. The flow of current through these parallel paths charges auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b>, and the energy stored in auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b> generates a current in auxiliary phase B winding <b>505</b> and dc source capacitor <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Because of the current flow in auxiliary winding <b>505</b>, there will be a positive or negative torque produced in the SRM, depending on the SRM's rotor position with respect to auxiliary phase B winding <b>505</b>'s stator poles. If the rotor poles are coming toward the stator poles, the inductance slope is positive, and if the rotor poles are moving away from the stator poles, the inductance slope is negative. If there is a negative inductance slope, the torque produced will be negative and the machine will be generating and sending energy to source capacitor <b>503</b>. If the inductance slope is positive, auxiliary phase B winding <b>505</b> will produce positive or motoring torque, which is torque output by the SEW.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the current in auxiliary phase B winding <b>505</b> is constant and flows continuously, the average torque produced by auxiliary winding <b>505</b> is zero. However, current flow through auxiliary winding <b>505</b> will not remain constant. After a period of conduction, the current in auxiliary winding <b>505</b> discontinues, and this occurs when the voltages across auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b> and dc source capacitor <b>503</b> equalize. Thereafter, another way must be provided to charge auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b>. A transistor switch <b>509</b> provides this other way.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Transistor switch <b>509</b> is turned on to provide power to main winding <b>508</b>. In response to turning on transistor switch <b>509</b>, a current path is established through dc source <b>510</b>, main winding <b>508</b>, and transistor switch <b>509</b>. During the period transistor switch <b>509</b> is turned on, main winding <b>508</b> is operating in its energization mode. Transistor switch <b>509</b> is turned off either to regulate the current through main winding <b>508</b> or to stop its flow completely.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Due to the inductive nature of main winding <b>508</b>, it is important to provide a path for the current to flow away from main winding <b>508</b> when transistor switch <b>509</b> is turned off. This path is provided by diode <b>507</b>, auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b>, do source capacitor <b>503</b>, and main winding <b>508</b> itself. The current flowing out of main winding <b>508</b> charges auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b>, and this flow of current is the predominant way in which auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b> receives a charge, when operating the SRM.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The energy flow in auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b> and, hence, in auxiliary winding <b>505</b> is dependent on main winding <b>508</b>'s energy flow and, therefore, its duty cycle. As the speed of the SRM increases, the controllable duty cycle of transistor switch <b>509</b> increases, thereby increasing the duration of the voltage applied to main winding <b>508</b>. Therefore, less charging of auxiliary capacitor <b>506</b> occurs, and, hence, less power is provided to auxiliary winding <b>505</b>. During times of operating transistor switch <b>509</b> with a high duty cycle, the SRM behaves as though it is a single-phase SRM, with auxiliary winding <b>505</b> serving as a window to find the rotor position of the machine through its inductance. Auxiliary winding <b>505</b>'s inductance can be obtained from its current and voltage waveform or by some other technique known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Auxiliary winding <b>505</b> returns to dc source capacitor <b>503</b> the energy it receives from main winding <b>508</b>, when transistor switch <b>509</b> is turned off. During low speed operation, transistor <b>509</b>'s duty cycle is low and both auxiliary winding <b>505</b> and main winding <b>508</b> are active and produce motive power. Therefore, the SRM serves as a two-phase SRM. This resembles a capacitor-start and capacitor-run single-phase induction motor. It should be noted that such a single-phase induction motor has two phase windings.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the four quadrants of torque versus speed operation for a TPSRM. Quadrants I, II, III, and IV correspond respectively to the operational modes of forward motoring (FM), reverse regeneration (RR), reverse motoring (RM), and forward regeneration (FR).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Speed control is achieved in the clockwise (CW) direction of rotation by forward motoring and in the counter-clockwise (CCW) direction of rotation by reverse motoring. During forward and reverse motoring operation, the TPSRM produces mechanical power from the input of electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Also, speed control may be achieved when operating the TPSRM as a generator, during the transition from CW rotation to CCW rotation direction or vice versa. This operational mode provides the effect of an electric brake in that mechanical energy is recovered from the stored energy in the machine's inertia and its load inertia for conversion to electrical energy. By recovering the mechanical energy, the machine may be quickly slowed down without the use of a mechanical brake (use of a mechanical brake dissipates the energy resulting in low efficiency). When the mechanical energy is not recovered for conversion to electrical energy, the machine rotation will slow down by its inertia alone, but this may take longer since the mechanical energy is not harvested.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The transition from forward to reverse motoring is known as forward regeneration, and the reverse transition is known as reverse regeneration. A more complete description of an SRM's operational modes may be found in each of &#x201c;Switched Reluctance Motor Drives&#x201d;, R. Krishnan, CRC Press, June 2001, and &#x201c;A Sensorless Switched Reluctance Drive,&#x201d; Electric Machines and Drives, C E B Green and J M Stephenson, 1997, pp. 64-68.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a rotor and stator of a two-phase SRM motor with main and auxiliary windings wound on respective stator poles. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a two-phase SRM motor <b>800</b> is shown having a rotor <b>801</b> and a stator <b>803</b>. Rotor <b>801</b> has two salient poles <b>802</b>, and stator <b>803</b> has four salient poles <b>804</b>, <b>805</b>. Stator poles <b>805</b> have auxiliary winding <b>505</b> wound around them, and stator poles <b>804</b> have main winding <b>508</b> wound around them.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Power converter <b>500</b> provides a single-controllable-switch converter to control the speed of TPSRM <b>800</b> in all four quadrants of torque versus speed operation. Two issues related to controlling the four-quadrant operation of TPSRM <b>800</b> with power converter <b>500</b> are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A first issue concerns starting the rotation of the TPSRM's rotor both for instances where the main stator poles are in alignment with the rotor poles and not. Though the invention is not limited to an embodiment in which the main and auxiliary windings are equal in number or size, assume for the purpose of explaining this operational issue that TPSRM <b>800</b> is used. Main winding <b>508</b> primarily produces the motive power and auxiliary winding <b>505</b> is used for start-up and for reversing the rotational direction of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When rotor poles <b>802</b> are aligned with stator poles <b>804</b> and main phase winding <b>508</b> is excited, the machine will not produce any torque since the rate of change of inductance is zero in this position. An SRM produces torque only when there is a change of inductance with respect to rotor position. But it is not possible to excite auxiliary phase winding <b>505</b> independently when TPSRM <b>800</b> is operated with a single-controllable-switch converter. Therefore, the rotor and stator poles must be moved away from an aligned position at the time of starting.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Power converter <b>500</b> may be used to move the rotor and stator poles away from an aligned position in the following way. Transistor switch <b>509</b> is pulsed on for a considerable period of time, and if the machine does not start, then a second pulse is applied after about one second to make the rotor move. No further pulses are needed to start the movement of TPSRM <b>800</b>'s rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The second issue concerns, assuming that the machine is reliably started, keeping the machine running in quadrants I, II, III and IV in light of the fact that there is no independent way to energize the main <b>508</b> and auxiliary <b>505</b> phases of TPSRM <b>800</b> with power converter <b>500</b>, since it has only one controllable switch <b>509</b>. This issue is discussed more fully below.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A large amount of literature exists concerning the four-quadrant control of SRM drives, such as described by R. Krishnan, &#x201c;Switched reluctance motor drives&#x201d;, CRC Press, June 2001; Syed Hossain, Iqbal Husain, Harald Klode, Bruno Lequesne, and Avoki Omekanda, &#x201c;Four-Quadrant Control of a Switched Reluctance Motor for a Highly Dynamic Actuator Load&#x201d;, APEC, 2002, pp. 41-47, C E B Green and J M Stephenson, &#x201c;A Sensorless Switched Reluctance Drive&#x201d;, Electric Machines and Drives, 1997, pp. 64-68; B. Fahimi and Raymond. B Sepe Jr., &#x201c;Development of 4-Quadrant Sensorless Control of SRM Drives Over the Entire Speed Range&#x201d;, IEEE-IAS, 2002, pp. 1625-1632; and G. Suresh, B. Fahimi, K. M. Rahman, M. Ehsani, and I. Panahi, &#x201c;Four-quadrant Sensorless SRM Drive with High Accuracy at All Speeds&#x201d;, APEC, 1999, pp. 1226-1231. However, no literature is known to exist for SRM drives having a single-controllable-switch power converter, excluding applicant's patent applications. This is due to the absence of such a power converter in the related art. Significant features peculiar to this converter are its limited degree of direct-current control of a TPSRM's main phase and its heavy dependence on the auxiliary phase winding and auxiliary capacitor state. Additionally, the degree of control that may be exerted over the current flowing through the auxiliary winding is dependent on the duty cycle of the controllable switch, motor speed and load, and state of the auxiliary capacitor. These constraints on the current control through the auxiliary winding have to be managed very tightly to implement four-quadrant variable-speed operation of a TPSRM, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Once TPSRM <b>800</b> is started up, the normal running control involves turning on transistor switch <b>509</b> when rotor poles <b>802</b> are unaligned with respect to the main stator poles <b>804</b> (i.e., the rotor poles are more nearly aligned with the auxiliary stator poles) and turning off transistor switch <b>509</b> just before or at the complete alignment of the main stator and rotor poles <b>804</b> and <b>802</b>, respectively. The running control is described more fully below with respect to the four speed-versus-torque operational modes.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Assume the intended direction of rotation for rotor <b>801</b> is clockwise (CW). Main winding <b>508</b> on main stator poles <b>804</b> is energized with a current, and this current is commutated when the rotor and main stator poles <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> align or are close to alignment. During this energization period, the inductance slope of main winding <b>508</b> is positive. Hence, the torque produced is positive and in the direction of rotor <b>801</b>'s movement. Assuming that a CW rotation is positive, motor <b>800</b> is delivering positive output power (i.e., motoring torque). In other words, when the torque and speed are positive, so too is the power output of motor <b>800</b>. This condition indicates quadrant one operation.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For quadrant four operation, the torque has to be negative when the speed is positive. As a result, motor <b>800</b> delivers negative power in quadrant four operation. That is, the power is taken from SRM <b>800</b> and fed to dc source capacitor <b>503</b>. This is called regeneration in the CW direction of rotation. In order to produce negative torque, the current in main winding <b>508</b> is injected when rotor poles <b>802</b> move away from alignment with respect to main stator poles <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For quadrant three operation, rotor <b>801</b> rotates in the counter-clockwise (CCW) direction and torque is applied in this direction, resulting in negative speed and negative torque and contributing to positive power. Therefore, this is motoring in the reverse direction. Reverse direction motoring is achieved by energizing main winding <b>508</b> when rotor poles <b>802</b> start to move CCW front a completely unaligned position with respect to main stator poles <b>804</b>. The current is commutated in main winding <b>508</b> when the rotor and main stator poles <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> align or are near alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Quadrant two operation is very similar to that of quadrant four, but the torque is positive (CW) and the speed is negative (CCW). Quadrant two operation, therefore, provides negative output power. This is regeneration in the CCW direction of rotation and is realized by energizing main winding <b>508</b> with a current when rotor poles <b>802</b> start moving CCW away from alignment with main stator poles <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a drive system <b>900</b> for a TPSRM. Drive system <b>900</b> includes power converter <b>500</b>, SRM <b>800</b>, a signal interface module <b>910</b>, and a digital signal processor (DSP) controller <b>950</b>. Signal interface module <b>910</b> has a current sensor <b>912</b> for sensing the current flowing through main phase winding <b>508</b> (or some signal indicative of this current) and Hall-effect sensors <b>914</b> for detecting two discrete positions, spaced 90&#xb0; apart, of SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor. A voltage converter <b>916</b> of signal interface module <b>910</b> converts the output signals of Hall-effect sensors <b>914</b> before providing the converted signals to a general and an interrupt component <b>954</b> of DSP controller <b>950</b>. A signal indicative of the current sensed by current sensor <b>912</b> is filtered and amplified by a low-pass filter/amplifier <b>918</b> and provided to DSP controller <b>950</b> through its analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <b>956</b>. DSP controller <b>950</b> estimates the rotational speed of SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor from successively sensed rotor position signals provided by interrupt component <b>954</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A self-starting component <b>958</b> outputs a start-up signal to a speed command component <b>960</b> so as to activate a speed command, which consists of the intended magnitude and direction for SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor. The operational mode, corresponding to motoring or braking, of SRM <b>800</b> is determined by an operational mode component <b>962</b> based on the speed command. If the mode is determined to be the motoring mode, a summer <b>964</b> calculates a speed error from the difference between the speed estimated by DSP controller <b>950</b>, in speed estimator component <b>966</b>, and the speed command provided by operational mode component <b>962</b> via a motoring mode component <b>968</b>. The speed error is provided to a speed control loop component <b>970</b>, which may be a proportional plus integral (PI) controller. Speed control loop component <b>970</b> produces a current command that is regulated by a current feedback control component, which may also be a proportional plus integral type controller.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The current feedback control component comprises a summer <b>972</b>, a summer <b>974</b>, and a current control loop component <b>976</b>. Summer <b>972</b> determines the difference between the current command and a digital representation of the current signal provided to ADC <b>956</b>. The difference value output by summer <b>972</b> is provided to current control loop component <b>976</b> to produce a control signal that is proportional to the duty cycle of transistor switch <b>509</b> in power converter <b>500</b>. This control signal is provided to a pulse width modulator (PWM) <b>982</b> and updated for every carrier period of pulse width modulation control exerted on SRM <b>800</b>. PWM <b>982</b> generates a pulse width modulation signal, from the control signal, that is provided to a gate control signal component <b>920</b> of signal interface module <b>910</b>. Gate control signal component <b>920</b> produces a gate control signal that turns transistor switch <b>509</b> of power converter <b>500</b> on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">If the speed command produced by speed command component <b>960</b> indicates that regenerative braking is to be performed, then DSP controller <b>950</b> produces the control signal in a different way. Operation mode component <b>962</b> indicates to a braking mode component <b>978</b> that the regenerative braking mode is in effect. Braking mode component <b>978</b> provides an indication of SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor speed to a low speed component <b>980</b>. If SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor speed is above a threshold low speed, summer <b>974</b> determines a difference between a current command that is output by low speed component <b>980</b> and the digital representation of the sensed current signal output by ADC <b>956</b>. The difference signal determined by summer <b>974</b> is provided to current control loop <b>976</b> to generate the control signal for the braking mode of operation, which controls pulse width modulator <b>982</b> so as to regulate transistor switch <b>509</b>. If SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor speed is lover than the threshold low speed, then low speed component <b>980</b> provides a reversal pulse to PWM <b>982</b> that overrides the control signal output by current control loop <b>976</b> so that this reversal pulse regulates the pulse width modulated signal produced by PWM <b>982</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Once SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor speed is reversed, the controller automatically goes into motoring mode in the opposite direction and current control loop <b>976</b>, again, dynamically determines and controls the pulse width modulation signal that serves as the gate control signal for transistor switch <b>509</b>.</p>

Operational control of SRM <b>800</b> begins with the execution by self-starting component <b>958</b> of a self-starting operation <b>1002</b> that sets SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor in rotational motion. After self-starting operation <b>1002</b> is complete, operation mode component <b>962</b> determines <b>1004</b> whether the motoring mode is in effect.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a four-quadrant control algorithm for the drive system illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. According to this control implementation, drive system <b>900</b> continuously monitors the operation of SRM <b>800</b> to determine <b>1102</b> whether SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor should change its direction of rotation. When a change of direction is indicated, a braking sequence is executed <b>1104</b> to slow the rotational speed of SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor. If the turning speed of SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor is below a threshold speed <b>1106</b>, then a determination <b>1108</b> of the alignment between SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor and stator poles is made. Otherwise, the braking sequence <b>1104</b> is continued. If SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor and stator poles are unaligned, then the pulse width modulation signal applied to transistor switch <b>509</b> is discontinued <b>1110</b>. Otherwise, drive system <b>900</b> waits until SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor and stator poles have rotated to an unaligned position. After the pulse width modulation signal is discontinued <b>1110</b>, drive system <b>900</b> executes a delay operation <b>1112</b>, for a particular period of time, before generating a reversal start pulse <b>1114</b>. Thereafter, the pulse width modulation signal is reactivated <b>1116</b> so that a motoring sequence <b>1118</b> may be executed for controlling SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Accordingly, a purpose of the four-quadrant control algorithm is to set up a PWM sequence with respect to a quadrant command and to generate a start pulse for reversal. After the rotor speed reaches the desired speed, the starting signal for reversal will be applied to the power converter.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">DSP controller <b>950</b> checks <b>1108</b> for an unaligned position of SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor and stator poles, in the four-quadrant control algorithm illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, so as to obtain a huge negative torque with short delay. The maximum negative torque can be produced after the rotor passes the unaligned position (90&#xb0;) (i.e., preferably more than half way between adjacent stator poles in its rotation). PWM off <b>1110</b> indicates the deactivation of the PWM function, so as to slow and decrease the current flow in main winding <b>508</b>. Delay <b>1112</b> is the time duration needed to move rotor <b>801</b> to the maximum negative torque position.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an algorithm for the operation of drive system <b>900</b>. According to this algorithm, DSP controller <b>950</b> initializes <b>1202</b> its mode of operation by examining SRM <b>700</b>'s rotor position and the sensed current provided by Hall-effect sensors <b>914</b>. Additionally, DSP controller <b>950</b> determines its operational command parameters and initializes a timer, ADC <b>956</b>, general input port <b>952</b>, interrupt component <b>954</b>, its external interrupt functions, and its operating variables. After initialization, DSP controller <b>950</b> applies <b>1204</b> a single pulse to transistor switch <b>509</b> via signal interface module <b>910</b>. If this pulse does not cause SRM <b>800</b>'s rotor to begin turning, as determined in step <b>1206</b>, another pulse is applied <b>1204</b>. If rotor <b>901</b> is determined <b>1206</b> to be turning, DSP controller <b>950</b> determines <b>1208</b> the rotor's direction of rotation, sets <b>1208</b> a speed command, such as 5000 revolutions per minute (rpm), and sets <b>1208</b> SRM <b>800</b>'s operational mode to the motoring mode. Thereafter, DSP controller <b>950</b> drives <b>1210</b> the single switch SRM (SSSRM) <b>800</b>'s motoring operation in accordance with a proportional integrator (PI) speed control loop and a PI current control loop, until the speed command is determined <b>1212</b> to have changed. When the speed command is changed to indicate a reversal of rotational direction for SSSRM <b>800</b>'s rotor, DSP controller <b>950</b> drives <b>1214</b> a braking operation for SSSRM <b>800</b> using a PI current control loop, until the rotational speed of SSSRM <b>800</b>'s rotor is determined <b>1216</b> to be rotating at less than a threshold speed, such as 250 rpm. When the rotor's speed falls below this threshold, DSP controller <b>950</b> deactivates <b>1218</b> the PWM control of transistor switch <b>509</b> and waits <b>1218</b> an established delay time before applying <b>1218</b> a reversal pulse to SSSRM <b>800</b>'s rotor. Then, DSP controller <b>950</b> establishes <b>1220</b> this reverse direction of rotation as the desired direction and re-establishes the motoring operation drive <b>1210</b> for the new direction of the rotor's rotation.</p>

A summer <b>1302</b> determines a speed error signal by subtracting a filtered speed indication signal from a speed command. This speed error signal is provided to a speed controller and limiter <b>1306</b>, which generally is a proportional plus integral type controller. Speed controller and limiter <b>1306</b> performs a predetermined operation on the speed error signal and outputs the result to a current command controller <b>1308</b>.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The current command can be determined in many ways. The standard method is to set the current command proportional to the square root of a torque command, which is the output of the speed controller and limiter <b>1306</b>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A summer <b>1310</b> determines a current error signal by subtracting a filtered indicator of the current flowing through transistor switch <b>509</b> from the current command.

A current filter <b>1312</b> filters, using a low pass filter, the sensed indicator of the current flowing between power convertor <b>500</b> and SRM <b>800</b>, and a filter <b>1304</b> filters the rotor speed obtained from processing the rotor position signals, sensed from SRM <b>800</b>, in a DSP or from a hardware circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates simulated operational parameters of the drive system illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Torque and current parameters are graphed as a function of an applied speed command for the four-quadrant operational modes of forward motoring, forward regeneration, reverse motoring, and reverse regeneration. The units of measure for the parameters illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> are presented in normalized units (e.g., 1 p.u. means 100% times the base value of the variable).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when the rotor speed and its command are positive, then SRM <b>800</b> is in its quadrant I mode of operation of forward motoring. Note that during this time, the power is positive as the machine is being powered by the positive torque to keep it running in the CW direction (by the convention used herein, CW speed is positive speed).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When the command speed is made negative so as to make SRM <b>800</b> run in the negative direction (CCW), the torque of the machine is made negative. Hence, the power output is negative, indicating that the machine is operating as a generator by transferring mechanical energy from the machine to the power supply as electrical energy. This brakes the machine rotor resulting in a faster decrease in speed. The speed is positive (CW) but torque is negative. Therefore, SRM <b>800</b> is in its quadrant IV mode of operation of forward regeneration.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When the machine rotor reaches zero speed, the machine continues to produce negative torque, thus causing the motor rotor to rotate in the CCW direction (because positive torque runs the rotor in the CW direction), which is negative speed (as CW speed is positive). This corresponds to the quadrant III mode of operation, as the speed and torque are both negative and the resulting power is positive. That is, the machine produces mechanical power while taking in electrical power (same as in quadrant I). Therefore, this operational mode is reverse motoring.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the speed command is made to go from negative speed to say zero speed, while SRM <b>800</b> is operating in the quadrant III mode of operation, the machine is slowed down by applying a torque that is opposite to what was previously being applied (that is negative). Therefore, a positive torque has to be generated and applied. The torque command goes from negative to positive and the torque becomes positive as soon as the speed is commanded. The torque is positive and the speed is negative at this time, thus producing negative power. That is, the output power is electrical and the input power is mechanical power resulting in the slowing down of the machine. This is the quadrant II operational mode of reverse regeneration.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates the measured experimental results corresponding to the simulation results illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The units of measure for the graphed rotor speed and its command are 5,000 rpm/division, the unit of measure for the current is 10 A/division, and the unit of measure for the time is 5 s/division. As may be determined by comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the simulation results correspond closely to the experimental results.</p>
