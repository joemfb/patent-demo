<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A connector includes a housing in which a stationary separator portion and an accommodation portion are provided. The accommodation portion receives an actuator above the separator portion and receives an end of an FPC/FFC below the separator portion. A force receiving portion and a contact portion of a contact, which together have a bifurcated shape, are disposed above and below the separator portion, respectively. When the force receiving portion is moved upward by a turning operation of the actuator above the separator portion, the contact portion is abutted with a signal layer of the FPC/FFC, and the position of a ground member which holds the FPC/FFC in conjunction with the contact portion and the position of the separator portion are not changed. Accordingly, the contact between the contact portion and the single layer is stabilized, thereby improving the reliability of the contact between the contact portion of the contact and the FPC/FFC.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">In the connectors of Patent Document 1 to Patent Document 3, an FPC/FFC has a top side and a bottom side. The top side is brought into contact with a contact portion. An actuator applies stress to the bottom side of the FPC/FFC. This structure has a problem that contact reliability between the contact portion of the contact and the FPC/FFC is low.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a connector which improves contact reliability between the contact portion of the contact and the FPC/FFC.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">One aspect of the present invention provides a connector comprising an accommodation portion, a plurality of contacts, a housing and an actuator,</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0021">when the actuator is rotated from the first rotation position to the second rotation position, the lift portion lifting the force receiving portion so that the contact portion is pushed against a bottom surface of the end portion of the accommodated connection object.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Effect of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">According to the present invention, a portion other than the contact portion in the contact is displaced by rotation operation of the actuator. This displacement is transmitted to the contact portion so that the contact portion of the contact is displaced. In addition, positional relation between the separator portion and the connector of the present invention is fixed so that force is not transmitted from the actuator to an FPC/FFC even when the actuator is rotated. In other words, the actuator of the present invention does not push the FPC/FFC against the contact portion of the contact but pushes the contact portion of the contact against the FPC/FFC. With this structure, contact reliability between the contact portion of the contact and the FPC/FFC is improved.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0034">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a connection object of a connector <b>100</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention is an FPC/FFC <b>700</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the FPC/FFC has an end portion <b>710</b>. A top surface <b>712</b> of the end portion <b>710</b> is formed with a ground layer <b>720</b>. A bottom surface <b>714</b> of the end portion <b>710</b> is formed with a signal layer <b>730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the connector <b>100</b> comprises a plurality of contacts <b>200</b>, a housing <b>300</b>, an actuator <b>400</b> and a ground member <b>500</b>. The plurality of contacts <b>200</b> is made of conductive material. The housing <b>300</b> is made of insulative material which arranges the contacts <b>200</b> in a Y-direction (a left-right direction). The actuator <b>400</b> is made of insulative material and held by the housing <b>300</b> so as to be rotatable. The ground member <b>500</b> is made of conductive material and held by the housing <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the contact <b>200</b> comprises a contact portion <b>210</b>, a force receiving portion <b>220</b>, a support portion <b>230</b> and fixed portion <b>240</b>. The contact portion <b>210</b> is configured to be brought into contact with the signal layer <b>730</b>. The force receiving portion <b>220</b> forms a bifurcated shape (for example, an U-like shape or a V-like shape) together with the contact portion <b>210</b>. The support portion <b>230</b> elastically supports a boundary part between the contact portion <b>210</b> and the force receiving portion <b>220</b>. The fixed portion <b>240</b> is connected with the support portion <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the housing <b>300</b> comprises an accommodation portion <b>310</b>. The accommodation portion <b>310</b> accommodates the end portion <b>710</b> of the FPC/FFC <b>700</b> along an X-direction (a front-back direction). The housing <b>300</b> is formed with a separator portion <b>320</b>. The separator portion <b>320</b> forms a boundary between two areas. One of the areas is an allowable area which partially receives the actuator <b>400</b> and allows the rotation of the actuator <b>400</b> to rotate. The other area is the accommodation portion <b>310</b>. In other words, two areas, i.e. the allowable area and the accommodation portion <b>310</b> exist in the housing <b>300</b>. The separator portion <b>320</b> of the present invention defines a part (an upper side) of the accommodation portion <b>310</b>. In detail, the separator portion <b>320</b> is the plate-like part which extends in the Y-direction. The Y-direction is a longitudinal direction of the plate-like part. The separator portion <b>320</b> is provided so as to be parallel to the X-direction. Positional relation between the separator portion <b>320</b> and the connector <b>100</b> of the present embodiment is fixed. In other words, a position of the separator portion <b>320</b> does not change in the connector <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">The contact <b>200</b> is inserted into the housing <b>300</b> from a back-end side of the housing <b>300</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fixed portion <b>240</b> is a rear part of the contact <b>200</b>. The fixed portion <b>240</b> is press-fitted into the housing <b>300</b> so that the contact <b>200</b> is fixed to the housing <b>300</b>. The contact portion <b>210</b> of the contact <b>200</b> is positioned in the accommodation portion <b>310</b>. The force receiving portion <b>220</b> is positioned in the above-described allowable area. In other words, the separator portion <b>320</b> is positioned between the contact portion <b>210</b> and the force receiving portion <b>220</b> in a Z-direction (an up-down direction). Parts other than the fixed portion <b>240</b> in the contact <b>200</b>, i.e., the parts of the contact portion <b>210</b>, the force receiving portion <b>220</b> and the support portion <b>230</b>, are not fixed to the housing <b>300</b> so as to be displaceable to some extent in the housing <b>300</b>. In detail, the contact portion <b>210</b>, the force receiving portion <b>220</b> and the support portion <b>230</b> are deformable and/or displaceable in an XZ-plane (including X-direction and &#x2212;X-direction).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">The actuator <b>400</b> of the present embodiment is rotatable between a first rotation position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and a second rotation position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The actuator <b>400</b> comprises a push portion <b>410</b> and a lift portion <b>420</b>. The lift portion <b>420</b> is positioned between the separator portion <b>320</b> and the force receiving portion <b>220</b> of the contact <b>200</b> in the up-down direction. A top surface of the separator portion <b>320</b> serves as a pushed surface <b>321</b>. The push portion <b>410</b> pushes the pushed portion <b>321</b> of the separator portion <b>320</b> when the actuator <b>400</b> is rotated from the first rotation position to the second rotation position. The separator portion <b>320</b> is fixed to the housing <b>300</b> and does not move. Thus, the push portion <b>410</b> receives reaction force by the pushed surface <b>321</b> when the push portion <b>410</b> pushes the pushed surface <b>321</b>. The lift portion <b>420</b> is moved upward. The force receiving portion <b>220</b> of the contact <b>200</b> is lifted upward as a result of the lift portion <b>420</b> being moved upward. The contact portion <b>210</b> is displaced upward as a result of the force receiving portion <b>220</b> being lifted upward. Therefore, when the end portion of the FPC/FFC <b>700</b> is accommodated in the accommodation portion <b>310</b>, the contact portion <b>210</b> is pushed against the signal layer <b>730</b>. As explained above, the electrical contact between the contact portion <b>210</b> and the signal layer <b>730</b> is made by a rotation operation of the actuator <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the ground member <b>500</b> of the present embodiment comprises a plate-like portion <b>510</b>, an actuator-receiving portion <b>520</b> and end portions <b>530</b>. The plate-like portion <b>510</b> extends in parallel with an XY-plane. The actuator-receiving portion <b>520</b> extends obliquely to the X-direction and the direction from the plate-like portion <b>510</b>. The end portions <b>530</b> are provided on both left and right ends of the actuator-receiving portion <b>520</b>. The end portion <b>530</b> is provided with a press-fit portion <b>532</b> and a hold down <b>534</b>. The press-fit portions <b>532</b> are press-fitted into both end portions of the housing <b>300</b> so that the ground member <b>500</b> is attached to the housing <b>300</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the plate-like portion <b>510</b> is arranged under the separator portion <b>320</b>. In other words, the plate-like portion <b>510</b> of the present embodiment is positioned in the accommodation portion <b>310</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the actuator-receiving portion <b>520</b> comprises a front side part <b>521</b> and a rear side part <b>522</b>. The rear side part <b>522</b> receives the actuator <b>400</b> positioned at the first rotation position. The front side part <b>521</b> guides the end portion <b>710</b> of the FPC/FFC <b>700</b> into the accommodation portion <b>310</b>. In detail, when the actuator <b>400</b> is positioned at the first rotation position, the end portion <b>710</b> of the FPC/FFC <b>700</b> is guided under the plate-like portion <b>510</b> by the front side part <b>521</b> and inserted in the accommodation portion <b>310</b>. In the present embodiment, the end portion <b>710</b> accommodated in the accommodation portion <b>310</b> is positioned between the plate-like portion <b>510</b> of the ground member <b>500</b> and the contact portion <b>210</b> of the contact <b>200</b>. When the end, portion <b>710</b> is accommodated in the accommodation portion <b>310</b>, the actuator <b>400</b> is rotated so that the contact portion <b>210</b> is pushed against the signal layer <b>730</b>. Accordingly, the ground layer <b>720</b> of the FPC/FFC <b>700</b> is pushed against the plate-like portion <b>510</b> of the ground member <b>500</b>, and the plate-like portion <b>510</b> is pushed against the separator portion <b>320</b>. The plate-like portion <b>510</b> is sandwiched between the ground layer <b>720</b> and the separator portion <b>320</b>. The plate-like portion <b>510</b> is electrically connected with the ground layer <b>720</b>. In this state, connection between the plate-like portion <b>510</b> and the ground layer <b>720</b> is surface contact so that the ground layer <b>720</b> is not scraped by the plate-like portion <b>510</b>. In addition, similar to the separator portion <b>320</b>, the plate-like portion <b>510</b> is principally a fixed part in the connector <b>100</b>. In other words, positional relation between the plate-like portion <b>510</b> and the connector <b>100</b> is principally fixed. Thus, the contact portion <b>210</b> is hardly slid off the signal layer <b>730</b>. In other words, contact between the signal layer <b>730</b> and the contact portion <b>210</b> does not become unstable. As a result, stable contact between the signal layer <b>730</b> and the contact portion <b>210</b> can be obtained in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">The plate-like portion of the ground member <b>500</b> may be omitted in the case where the FPC/FFC <b>700</b> does not have the ground layer <b>720</b>. For example, a connector <b>100</b><i>a </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> comprises only hold downs <b>540</b> instead of the ground member <b>500</b>. In detail, the hold down <b>540</b> of the connector <b>100</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> has the press-fit portion <b>532</b> and the hold down <b>534</b> of the ground member <b>500</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The hold down <b>540</b> does not have either the plate-like portion <b>510</b> or the actuator-receiving portion <b>520</b> of the ground member <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. When the actuator <b>400</b> is brought into the rotation operation in the state that the end portion <b>710</b> of the FPC/FFC <b>700</b> is accommodated in the accommodation portion <b>310</b>, the contact portion <b>210</b> is pushed against the signal layer <b>730</b> and lifts the FPC/FFC <b>700</b>. The end portion <b>710</b> of the FPC/FFC <b>700</b> is sandwiched between the contact portion <b>210</b> and the separator portion <b>320</b>. In this embodiment, the positional relation between the separator portion <b>320</b> and the connector <b>100</b> is fixed. As a result, the stable contact between the signal layer <b>730</b> and the contact portion <b>210</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a connector <b>100</b><i>b </i>according to the second embodiment of the present invention is an example of variation of the above-described first embodiment. Hereinbelow, an explanation will be made only about differences between the connector <b>100</b> of the first embodiment and the connector <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the second embodiment and, therefore, the explanation of common structure between them will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The connector <b>100</b><i>b </i>according to this embodiment comprises the ground member <b>500</b><i>b </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> instead of the ground member <b>500</b> of the connector <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment. The ground member <b>500</b><i>b </i>of the embodiment comprises a plurality of ground contacts <b>510</b><i>b </i>instead of the plate-like portion <b>510</b>. These ground contacts <b>510</b><i>b </i>are provided with a space therebetween in the Y-direction. The ground contacts <b>510</b><i>b </i>are elastically supported by the ground member <b>500</b><i>b </i>so as to be displaceable.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">As understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a separator portion <b>320</b><i>b </i>of a housing <b>300</b><i>b </i>is formed with a plurality of slits (not shown). The plurality of slits extends in the X-direction. The slits are provided with a space therebetween in the Y-direction and correspond to the ground contacts <b>510</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The ground contacts <b>510</b><i>b </i>are partially positioned in the corresponding slits when the ground member <b>500</b><i>b </i>is attached to the housing <b>300</b><i>b</i>. In detail, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the ground contact <b>510</b><i>b </i>is partially positioned in an accommodation portion <b>310</b><i>b </i>when an end portion <b>710</b><i>b </i>of an FPC/FFC <b>700</b><i>b </i>is not accommodated in the accommodation portion <b>310</b><i>b</i>. Similar to the first embodiment, the end portion <b>710</b><i>b </i>of the FPC/FFC <b>700</b><i>b </i>is accommodated in the accommodation portion <b>310</b><i>b</i>. When the actuator <b>400</b> is brought into the rotation operation, the push portion <b>410</b> pushes a pushed surface <b>321</b><i>b </i>so that the contact portion <b>210</b> is pushed against the signal layer <b>730</b><i>b</i>. The ground layer <b>720</b><i>b </i>is pushed against the separator portion <b>320</b><i>b </i>and lift the ground contacts <b>510</b><i>b</i>. The lifted ground contacts <b>510</b><i>b </i>is brought into contact with the ground layer <b>720</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">The ground contact <b>510</b><i>b </i>does not establish a surface contact with the ground layer <b>720</b><i>b </i>of the FPC/FFC <b>700</b><i>b</i>. In other words, the ground contacts <b>510</b><i>b </i>are displaced while the plate-like portion <b>510</b> of the first embodiment (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is fixed. However, stress applied to the FPC/FFC <b>700</b><i>b </i>by the ground contact <b>510</b><i>b </i>of the present embodiment is exceedingly smaller than stress applied to the FPC/FFC <b>700</b><i>b </i>by the actuator <b>400</b> of the conventional type. Thus, in the connector <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the present embodiment, a stable contact between the contact portion <b>210</b> and the signal layer <b>730</b><i>b </i>can be obtained as compared to the conventional connector.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">The plate-like portion <b>510</b> or the ground contact <b>510</b><i>b</i>, the actuator-receiving portion <b>520</b>(<b>520</b><i>b</i>) and the hold downs <b>534</b> are formed integrally with each other in the ground member <b>500</b>, <b>500</b><i>b </i>of the above-described embodiment of the present invention. However, the hold downs <b>534</b> may be formed separately. Each of the hold downs <b>534</b> formed separately may be press-fitted into the housing <b>300</b>(<b>300</b><i>b</i>) so as to be held by the housing <b>300</b>(<b>300</b><i>b</i>).</p>
