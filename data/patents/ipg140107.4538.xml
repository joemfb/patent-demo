<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In response to a detected loss of previously transmitted information by an apparatus communicating with a remote device (e.g., using TCP), the rate of transmission of information is increased by the apparatus in response to attributing the detected loss of previously transmitted information as not being caused by congestion. This attribution of the packet loss is typically determined based on roundtrip delays between sent information and received corresponding acknowledgments, which may be used directly or indirectly, such as by estimating network queuing delays based on the measured roundtrip delays.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The communications industry is rapidly changing to adjust to emerging technologies and ever increasing customer demand. This customer demand for new applications and increased performance of existing applications is driving communications network and system providers to employ networks and systems having greater speed and capacity (e.g., greater bandwidth). In trying to achieve these goals, a common approach taken by many communications providers is to use packet switching technology.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used extensively in networks, such as the Internet, to reliably communicate information between devices. This reliability is based on the sender receiving acknowledgements from the receiver in response to successfully receiving packets. The performance of TCP also depends upon whether or not acknowledgements are received for sent packets. In response to an acknowledgment, the sender TCP slowly increases the rate at which it sends packets. Conversely, if the sender TCP does not receive such an acknowledgement for a sent packet, it decreases, such as by half, its rate of packet transmission based on the assumption that the packet was lost due to network congestion. Note, the sender TCP will continue slowly increasing its transmission rate of packets in response to receiving an acknowledgement of a sent packet.</p>

Also, if the average queuing delay is greater than a predetermined high threshold value amount of the longest queuing delay, then attribute the packet loss as being related to network congestion.
