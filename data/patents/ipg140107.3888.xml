<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Techniques are described to provide a fixed video feed display from a remote participant to a conference room, where the display further includes remote participant information. In one embodiment, for example, a method may include receiving a connection from a remote participant, retrieving metadata related to the remote participant, and displaying a video feed from the remote participant along with the metadata in a dedicated position in a conference room. The metadata may provide information about the remote participant, as well as points of interest that may aid in conversation with the remote participant. The remote feed remains in the dedicated position throughout the conference, creating the effect of the remote participant being in the room. Other embodiments are described and claimed.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Video teleconferences typically involve participants in at least two different locations, where each participant may be able to see the others via a video feed from a video camera in the room with the participant. In some teleconferences, a group of participants may be present in one conference room, while one or more participants take part from remote locations. The video feed from the remote participant(s) to the conference room may change as different remote participants become active, e.g. when speaking. If there are multiple video feeds from remote sources, the positions of the feeds may move among different displays. It may be difficult for the participants receiving the remote video feed to retain a context for the remote participants. Further, passive participants may not appear on any video feed, and the conference room participants may forget about their presence. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present improvements have been needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various embodiments are generally directed to techniques to provide a fixed video feed display from a remote participant to a conference room. Some embodiments are particularly directed to techniques to provide a fixed video feed display from a remote participant to a conference room, where the display further includes remote participant information to facilitate interaction among the participants. In one embodiment, for example, an apparatus may comprise a metadata retriever operative on a logic device to retrieve metadata about a remote participant connecting to a video conference; and a video feed builder operative on the logic device to build a consolidated video feed from video information received from the remote participant and the retrieved metadata and to output the consolidated video feed to a display. The apparatus may also include a video conferencing module to receive a connection from the remote participant and to select a dedicated position in a conference room for displaying the consolidated video feed. Other embodiments are described and claimed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">These and other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are explanatory only and are not restrictive of aspects as claimed.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Conventional video teleconferencing systems may only display remote participants that are also actively participating, e.g. speaking. As the speakers change, the video feeds may be swapped so that the new speaker is shown, usually at the expense of showing the previous speaker. Consequently, it can be difficult for the room participants to keep track of who is participating remotely, and addressing a remote participant from the conference room may be awkward, as there is no physical place to focus an address. The remote participants may not feel like they have a consistent presence in the room. Further, the room participants may not know the remote participant and may have trouble engaging in conversation with them. The embodiments described herein address these and other issues with conventional systems.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various embodiments are directed to providing a fixed video feed display from a remote participant to a conference room, where the display further includes remote participant information. In one embodiment, for example, a method may include receiving a connection from a remote participant, retrieving metadata related to the remote participant, and displaying a video feed from the remote participant along with the metadata in a dedicated position in a conference room. The metadata may provide information about the remote participant, as well as points of interest that may aid in conversation with the remote participant. The remote feed remains in the dedicated position throughout the conference, creating the effect of the remote participant being in the room.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram for a system <b>100</b> to provide a fixed video feed display from a remote participant to a conference room during a video teleconference (VTC), where the display further includes remote participant information.

The metadata retrieved about the remote participant may be helpful in facilitating interaction with the other VTC participants. VTC system <b>110</b> may combine the metadata with a video feed of the remote participant in a display to the other participants of the VTC.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a video teleconferencing (VTC) system <b>200</b>. VTC system <b>200</b> may comprise an exemplary embodiment of VTC system <b>110</b> as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. VTC system <b>200</b> may include one or more components, such as a video conferencing module <b>210</b>, a display driver <b>220</b>, a metadata retriever <b>230</b>, a video feed builder <b>240</b>, and an event detector <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Video conferencing module <b>210</b> may perform the coordinating tasks of operating a VTC. In particular, video conferencing module <b>210</b> may receive metadata about a remote participant and a video feed from the remote participant, and may instruct display driver <b>220</b> to send the video feed and the metadata from the remote participant to a dedicated position on a display in the conference room. Video conferencing module <b>210</b> may receive video and audio information from the conference room and transmit it to remote devices <b>150</b>. Video conferencing module <b>210</b> may provide collaboration services, such as document editing, or brainstorming exercises among the participants of the VTC. The embodiments are not limited to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Display driver <b>220</b> may receive one or more video feeds from video conferencing module <b>210</b> and may cause the video feeds to be displayed on specified displays in the conference room.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Metadata retriever <b>230</b> may connect with information sources, such as organization server <b>270</b> and third party sources <b>160</b> to search for and retrieve metadata about or relevant to a remote participant. For example, from a remote participant's location, metadata retriever <b>230</b> may search for and retrieve weather and news for that location. Metadata retriever <b>230</b> may use the email address and/or name for a remote participant to search for social networking or blog entries made by or about the remote participant. Metadata retriever <b>230</b> may then provide the retrieved metadata to video conferencing module <b>210</b> and/or video feed builder <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Video feed builder <b>240</b> may receive the video feed of the remote participant and the retrieved metadata and may generate a consolidated video feed that includes the video feed and some or all of the metadata. If the remote participant has no video feed, then video feed builder <b>240</b> may generate a video feed using, for example, a photograph of the remote participant retrieved with the metadata, and the rest of the metadata. In an embodiment, the consolidated video feed may include active links, such as, for example, to a news story, or the remote participant's blog. The metadata portion of the consolidated video feed may be dynamic, updating periodically with new metadata items, or providing a news-ticker-like scroll of text. In an embodiment, the remote participant may be allowed to specify which items of metadata to display in their video feed, for example, during the connection process of joining the VTC. If the remote participant has specified which items of metadata to display, video feed builder <b>240</b> may use that specification to construct the consolidated video feed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, video feed builder <b>240</b> may combine consolidated video feeds from multiple remote participants into one tiled video feed, for example, if there is only one display available in a conference room.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment, VTC system <b>200</b> may include an event detector <b>250</b> that may detect the occurrence of an event in the conference room, such as a room participant standing at a white board in the room. Event detector <b>250</b> may include logic that detects, from video information coming from the in-room cameras, events of interest that occur in conference room <b>102</b> during a VTC. Event detector <b>250</b> may detect, for example, an active speaker, a location or item in the room that the participants are looking at, a presenter standing near a board or display, a participant standing in a specific location in the room, and so forth. When an event is detected, video conferencing module <b>210</b> may direct display driver <b>220</b> to move the feed from the remote participant to a second location in the room closer to the event, such that the remote participant may continue to be a visible presence in the conference.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The components <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>250</b> may be communicatively coupled via various types of communications media to each other and to video cameras <b>120</b>, microphones <b>130</b>, and displays <b>140</b>. The components may coordinate operations among each other. The coordination may involve the uni-directional or bi-directional exchange of information. For instance, the components may communicate information in the form of signals communicated over the communications media. The information can be implemented as signals allocated to various signal lines. In such allocations, each message is a signal. Further embodiments, however, may alternatively employ data messages. Such data messages may be sent across various connections. Exemplary connections include parallel interfaces, serial interfaces, and bus interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a top-view diagram of an example of a conference room <b>300</b>. Conference room <b>300</b> may include participants <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, <b>302</b><i>c</i>, and <b>302</b><i>d </i>seated around a table <b>308</b>. Conference room <b>300</b> may include displays <b>304</b><i>a</i>, <b>304</b><i>b</i>, <b>304</b><i>c</i>, and <b>304</b><i>d </i>in various positions around the room. Conference room <b>300</b> may also include a board <b>306</b>, such as a white board, a chalk board, a smart white board, or other presentation surface. Conference room <b>300</b> may also include cameras <b>310</b><i>a</i>, <b>310</b><i>b</i>, and <b>310</b><i>c </i>to generate video feeds of the conference taking place in conference room <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">During a conference, a consolidated video feed from a remote participant may be displayed, for example, on display <b>304</b><i>b</i>. In an embodiment, if the focus of the conference changes from table conversation to a presentation on board <b>306</b>, VTC system <b>312</b> may detect the change as an event, and may move the consolidated video feed from display <b>304</b><i>b </i>to, for example, display <b>304</b><i>c</i>, so that the in-room participants <b>302</b> can see the remote participant while looking at board <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If there is more than one remote participant, each may be displayed on a separate display, e.g. on <b>304</b><i>a</i>, <b>304</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>304</b><i>d</i>. If there are not enough displays to dedicate one for each remote participant, VTC system <b>312</b> may send more than one consolidated video feed to a display, for example, in a mosaic or tiled arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of consolidated video feeds displayed on two separate displays <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>. Each consolidated video feed may include a video portion <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b </i>that displays the output of a video camera at the remote participant's site, showing the remote participant. In the event that a remote participant does not have an on-site camera, a photographic image of the remote participant may be displayed in video portion <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b </i>instead.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The consolidated video feed may also include a metadata portion <b>406</b><i>a</i>, <b>406</b><i>b</i>. The metadata portion may display information about the remote participant, and information related to the remote participant or the remote participant's location. For example, metadata portion <b>406</b><i>a </i>includes a name and title for the remote participant in line <b>408</b><i>a</i>; a geographic location in line <b>410</b><i>a</i>; a local time in line <b>412</b><i>a</i>; and local news headlines presented in a scrolling line <b>414</b><i>a</i>. Metadata portion <b>406</b><i>a </i>also includes a weather icon <b>416</b><i>a </i>to illustrate current local weather conditions. In the alternative, weather icon <b>416</b><i>a </i>may be replaced with text, e.g. &#x201c;85F; sunny.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Metadata portion <b>406</b><i>b </i>may include information similar to metadata portion <b>406</b><i>a</i>, such as a name and title in line <b>408</b><i>b</i>, a location in line <b>410</b><i>b</i>, and a local time in line <b>412</b><i>b</i>. In <b>414</b><i>b</i>, metadata portion <b>406</b><i>b </i>may include information from a social networking account belonging to the remote participant, e.g. a TWITTER feed. Additional or alternate metadata may be displayed. The embodiments are not limited to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example of consolidated video feeds displayed on one display <b>500</b>. In the example, there are three remote participants, but only one display is available. VTC system <b>110</b> may direct video feed builder <b>240</b> to divide a video feed into enough equal-sized sections to accommodate the number of remote participants, e.g. four sections <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> and <b>508</b> in this example. Video feed builder <b>240</b> may then assign one remote participant to one section of the video feed as a dedicated location for that remote participant. Unused sections, e.g. section <b>508</b>, may be left blank, or may be filled with other conference related material, a company logo, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The consolidated video feed shown in section <b>506</b> includes another example of metadata that may be displayed. In line <b>510</b>, an interests list may be displayed, for example, from an employee profile, or a social networking site profile.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example of a consolidated video feed displayed as a component of an application operating on a remote device <b>150</b>. The application may include a user interface visible on a display <b>600</b>. The application may be, for example, a video teleconferencing application or a web browser application. In an embodiment, the application may provide one or more windows such as windows <b>602</b>, <b>604</b> and <b>606</b>. The application may reserve one window, e.g. window <b>602</b>, to be dedicated to displaying a consolidated video feed, for example, from another remote participant. Other windows may display other conference related materials. For example, window <b>604</b> may display a meeting agenda. Window <b>606</b> may display other remote participant consolidated feeds, a video feed from the conference room, presentation materials, chat interfaces, and so forth. In an embodiment, windows that display a consolidated video feed may be fixed so that they remain on top and visible for the duration of the connection to the conference, fixed so that they cannot be moved to another location on display <b>600</b>, and/or fixed so that they cannot be resized. The embodiments are not limited to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Operations for the above-described embodiments may be further described with reference to one or more logic flows. It may be appreciated that the representative logic flows do not necessarily have to be executed in the order presented, or in any particular order, unless otherwise indicated. Moreover, various activities described with respect to the logic flows can be executed in serial or parallel fashion. The logic flows may be implemented using one or more hardware elements and/or software elements of the described embodiments or alternative elements as desired for a given set of design and performance constraints. For example, the logic flows may be implemented as logic (e.g., computer program instructions) for execution by a logic device (e.g., a general-purpose or specific-purpose computer).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a logic flow <b>700</b>. The logic flow <b>700</b> may be representative of some or all of the operations executed by one or more embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the illustrated embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the logic flow <b>700</b> may receive a connection from a remote participant to a video teleconference at block <b>702</b>. For example, a remote participant may call in to VTC system <b>110</b> using a designated call-in number and participant ID. A remote participant may use a remote device <b>150</b> to connect to VTC system <b>110</b> over a network, for example, via a designated uniform resource locator (URL). The remote participant may log in to VTC system <b>110</b> in some way such that VTC system <b>110</b> may identify the remote participant and be able to access organization server <b>170</b> for metadata about the remote participant. The log in may include, for example, an email address, a unique user name, a unique user ID, an employee ID, a phone number, and so forth. Once the remote participant is connected to VTC system <b>110</b>, the participant's remote device <b>150</b> may begin transmitting a video feed, if a camera is available.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The logic flow <b>700</b> may retrieve metadata about the remote participant at block <b>704</b>. For example, VTC system <b>110</b> may connect to organization server <b>170</b>, e.g. using metadata retriever <b>230</b>, and look up metadata about the remote participant, such as name, title, location, contact information, and so forth. VTC system <b>110</b> may then retrieve the metadata from the server. VTC system <b>110</b> may also connect to one or more third party sources <b>160</b> to search for metadata related to the remote participant and/or the remote participant's location, such as weather, news, social networking information, and so forth. In an embodiment, searches may be saved to a directory entry for the remote participant to enable faster retrieval of metadata in future occurrences. For example, a URL for weather specific to the participant's location may be saved to the participant's employee profile. Metadata retriever <b>230</b> may &#x201c;follow&#x201d; a participant's Twitter feed, or may store a link to the participant's blog or social networking page. Metadata retriever <b>230</b> may subscribe to real simple syndication (RSS) feeds for news from a news source local to the participant and may access that RSS feed directly rather than searching at each connection. In an embodiment, metadata retriever <b>230</b> may periodically or continuously check for new metadata, e.g. changing news headlines. The embodiments are not limited to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The logic flow <b>700</b> may build a consolidated video feed from the metadata and video from the remote participant at block <b>706</b>. For example, VTC system <b>110</b> may, using video feed builder <b>240</b>, combine the video feed from the remote participant's remote device <b>150</b> with some or all of the metadata retrieved for the remote participant into one consolidated video feed. Video feed builder <b>240</b> may format the metadata, for example, using a template, to present the metadata in text and/or graphic form in a visually pleasing manner. The metadata portion of the consolidated video feed may appear as a layer on top of the video feed or to a side of the video feed, e.g. on the bottom. Video feed builder <b>240</b> may update the metadata portion of the consolidated video feed periodically. For example, if local time is displayed, the time may update once per minute. If local news is included, then new headlines may replace older headlines. Video feed builder <b>240</b> may also change the types of metadata displayed periodically. For example, news, then social networking feeds, then weather, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The logic flow <b>700</b> may select a dedicated position in a conference room for displaying the consolidated video feed at block <b>708</b>. For example, VTC system <b>110</b> may determine how many displays <b>140</b> are available in conference room <b>102</b> and whether the display is being used or is needed for other information. VTC system <b>110</b> may then select an unused display for the consolidated video feed. If there are more consolidated video feeds than displays, VTC system <b>110</b> may instruct video feed builder <b>240</b> to combine the multiple consolidated video feeds into one video feed, for example, by dividing the video feed display area into sections and selecting one section for each consolidated video feed.
