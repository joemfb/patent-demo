<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, have housings with an interior compartment for receiving a printed circuit board (PCB) therein. The mobile phones usually include a side key assembly on an outer sidewall of the housing, so that user can operate the mobile phone with just one finger. However, many known side key assemblies have complicated configurations. Additionally, typical side key assembly uses a spring to restore it, however, the spring is subject to fatigue after using it many times.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An embodiment of an electronic device <b>100</b> incorporating a key button mechanism <b>40</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exploded view of the electronic device <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a cross section of the key button mechanism <b>40</b> in a first (circuit-open) configuration <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a cross section of the key button mechanism <b>40</b> in a second configuration (circuit-closed) <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the exemplary device <b>100</b>, which may be a mobile phone in this case, includes the key button mechanism <b>40</b>, a housing <b>10</b>, and a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The housing <b>10</b> includes a main body <b>11</b> and a sidewall <b>12</b>, which connects to the main body <b>11</b>. The housing <b>10</b> also includes a passage <b>121</b> defined through the side wall <b>12</b>, two opposite latching members <b>112</b> protruding from an inner surface of the side wall <b>12</b>, and two retaining poles <b>122</b> protruding from the inner surface of the side wall <b>12</b>. Each latching member <b>112</b> defines a latching groove <b>113</b> configured to retain the key button assembly <b>40</b> in the housing <b>10</b>. The retaining poles <b>122</b> are configured to locate and retain the key button assembly <b>40</b> on the housing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, the key button mechanism <b>40</b> includes a retaining board <b>21</b>, and a sliding board <b>23</b> slidably mounted to the retaining board <b>21</b> by a slide enabling member (not labeled), and a key button <b>30</b> fixed (e.g., hot-melted) to the sliding board <b>23</b>. The retaining board <b>21</b> defines two retaining holes <b>216</b> corresponding to the retaining poles <b>122</b>. Each retaining pole <b>122</b> is retained in one of the retaining holes <b>216</b> and portions of the retaining board <b>21</b> are secured in the latching grooves <b>113</b> so the retaining board <b>21</b> is fixed to the housing <b>10</b>. The retaining board <b>21</b> defines an opening <b>215</b>. When the retaining board <b>21</b> is affixed to the housing <b>10</b>, the opening <b>215</b> is aligned with the passage <b>121</b> for the key button <b>30</b> to pass through. The sliding board <b>23</b> defines a trough <b>235</b> aligned with the opening <b>215</b> and the passage <b>121</b>, to allow the key button <b>30</b> to pass through the sliding board <b>23</b>. The key button <b>30</b> includes a main body <b>31</b>, a button <b>32</b> protruding from one side of the main body <b>31</b> and an actuator <b>33</b> protruding from another side of the main body <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the slide enabling member, in this embodiment, includes a pair of rails <b>232</b> and a pair of flanges biased inwards from the long edges (tracks <b>212</b>), which are slidably engaged by the rails <b>232</b>. The rails <b>232</b> are carried on the sliding board <b>23</b>, that is to say, each rail <b>232</b> protrudes from a side of the sliding board <b>23</b>. The rails <b>232</b> in the tracks <b>212</b> allow the sliding board <b>23</b> to slide between the first configuration <b>200</b> and the second configuration <b>300</b>. The rails <b>232</b> may be positioned on either the retaining, hoard <b>21</b> or the sliding board <b>23</b>, and the rail engaging members (e.g. the tracks <b>212</b>) may be positioned on the element opposite the rails <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The PCB <b>13</b> has a switch <b>14</b> aligned with the passage <b>121</b> when the PCB <b>13</b> is positioned in the housing <b>10</b>. A user can apply fingernail pressure to the button <b>32</b> in the longitudinal direction of the device <b>100</b> to cause the key button <b>30</b> and the sliding board <b>23</b> to slide from the first configuration <b>200</b> to the second configuration <b>300</b> with respect to the housing <b>10</b>, so the switch <b>14</b> can be actuated by the actuator <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>7</b>, the key button mechanism <b>40</b> further includes a stopping member (not labeled) located between the sliding board <b>23</b> and the retaining hoard <b>21</b>, for holding the sliding board <b>23</b> in the first configuration <b>200</b> or in the second configuration <b>300</b>. The stopping member includes a first stopping protrusion <b>233</b>, a first stopping groove <b>213</b> engaging the first stopping protrusion <b>233</b>, a second stopping protrusion <b>234</b> and a second stopping groove <b>214</b> engaging the second stopping protrusion <b>234</b>. The first stopping protrusion <b>233</b> is sized and shaped to fit tightly in the first stopping groove <b>213</b> when the sliding board <b>23</b> is slid to the first configuration <b>200</b>. The second stopping protrusion <b>234</b> is sized and shaped to fit tightly in the second stopping groove <b>214</b> when the sliding board <b>23</b> is slid to the second configuration <b>300</b>. In this embodiment, both the first stopping protrusion <b>233</b> and the second stopping protrusion <b>234</b> protrudes from the sliding board <b>23</b>, both the first stopping groove <b>213</b> and the second stopping groove <b>214</b> are defined in the retaining hoard <b>21</b>. The stopping member or parts of it may be made from resilient materials.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the exemplary disclosure have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the disclosure, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in the matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the disclosure to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
