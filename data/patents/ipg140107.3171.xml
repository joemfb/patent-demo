<p id="p-0005" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Recently, organic light-emitting elements have been remarkably developed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">However, organic light-emitting elements that output light at a higher luminous intensity or have a higher conversion efficiency are being required. In addition, organic light-emitting elements still have many problems in terms of durability against, for example, aging caused by use for a long period of time or degradation caused by oxygen, moisture, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">When organic light-emitting elements are used for full-color displays or the like, the organic light-emitting elements are required to have a high color purity and emit blue light at a high efficiency. However, current organic light-emitting elements do not satisfy these requirements. On the other hand, organic light-emitting elements that particularly have a high color purity, a high light-emitting efficiency, and a high durability and materials for forming such organic light-emitting elements have been demanded.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">Then, attempts have been made to use organic compounds having a benzo[e]pyrene skeleton for light-emitting elements and structural formulae (A) and (B) below have been disclosed (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 09-241629 and 05-032966, respectively). However, in view of light-emitting hue, light-emitting efficiency, luminous intensity, and durability, further improvements are required.</p>

where one of X<sub>1 </sub>and X<sub>2 </sub>represents a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, another one of X<sub>1 </sub>and X<sub>2 </sub>represents a hydrogen atom, R represents an alkyl group, and n represents 0 or 1.
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021">Such an aryl group in the general formula [1] will be described. Examples of the aryl group include a phenyl group, a naphthyl group, a pentalenyl group, an anthryl group, a pyrenyl group, an indacenyl group, an acenaphthenyl group, a phenanthryl group, a phenalenyl group, a fluoranthenyl group, a benzofluoranthenyl group, an acephenanthryl group, an aceanthryl group, a triphenylenyl group, a chrysenyl group, a naphthacenyl group, a perylenyl group, a pentacenyl group, and a fluorenyl group. However, the aryl group is not restricted to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">Examples of a substituent of such an aryl group include alkyl groups such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, and a propyl group; aralkyl groups such as a benzyl group and a phenethyl group; aryl groups such as a phenyl group and a biphenyl group; heterocyclic groups such as a thienyl group, a pyrrolyl group, and a pyridyl group; amino groups such as a dimethylamino group, a diethylamino group, a dibenzylamino group, diphenylamino group, a ditolylamino group, and a dianisolylamino group; alkoxyl groups such as a methoxyl group, an ethoxyl group, a propoxyl group, and a phenoxyl group; a cyano group; a nitro group; and halogen atoms such as fluorine and chlorine. However, the substituent is not restricted to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">Such a benzopyrene compound has a wide band gap of 2.90 eV or more and 3.15 eV or less.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">A compound represented by the general formula [1] has a structure in which the benzo[e]pyrene skeleton is substituted with a 1-naphthyl group and this naphthyl group is substituted with a fused polycyclic compound.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">Benzo[e]pyrene, which has a band gap of 3.30 eV, is not suitable as a light-emitting material (having a band gap of 2.90 eV or more and 3.15 eV or less) for organic light-emitting elements because use of benzo[e]pyrene results in, for example, an increase in the drive voltage of organic light-emitting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">Compounds having a structure in which an alkyl group is bonded to benzo[e]pyrene have the same conjugation length as unsubstituted benzo[e]pyrene and hence probably have a band gap of about 3.30 eV. Similarly, compounds having a structure in which a phenyl group is bonded to benzo[e]pyrene probably have a large band gap and use of such a compound results in a high drive voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">In an embodiment of the present invention, by bonding a naphthyl group to benzo[e]pyrene, the band gap of the benzo[e]pyrene can be adjusted to a band gap suitable as a material for organic light-emitting elements and the drive voltage of organic light-emitting elements can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">The naphthyl group of a compound according to an embodiment of the present invention may be positioned at any substitution position of the benzo[e]pyrene skeleton of the compound. However, to effectively narrow the band gap, substitution with a naphthyl group is conducted at a position where the HOMO-LUMO are highly occupied by electrons. Thus, the substitution position may be a position corresponding to a substituent Y in a formula below. The following formula is a general formula illustrating a benzo[e]pyrene skeleton and the substituent Y at a specific position.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0032">Such a band gap can be measured with a visible-ultraviolet absorption spectrum. Herein, a 0.1% chloroform solution of each compound was applied to a glass substrate by a spin coat method to form a spin-coated film and the band gap of the compound was measured with the absorption edge of the film. In this measurement, a spectrophotometer U-3010 manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd. was used.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">Substitution of the benzo[e]pyrene moiety in the general formula [1] with an alkyl group serving as a steric hindrance group reduces the occurrence of intermolecular stacking. Accordingly, when a compound according to an embodiment of the present invention is used for an organic light-emitting element, a stable amorphous film of the compound can be formed in which the occurrence of intermolecular stacking is reduced and hence crystallization is suppressed. Such an alkyl group for reducing the occurrence of intermolecular stacking may be any alkyl group. However, in particular, a bulky alkyl group such as a tertiary butyl group or an isopropyl group is effectively used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034">Whichever position of the benzo[e]pyrene moiety is used for substitution with such an alkyl group, the effect of reducing the occurrence of intermolecular stacking is probably similarly provided.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">A compound according to an embodiment of the present invention may have a structure in which the naphthyl group is substituted with a fused polycyclic group. Materials for organic light-emitting elements need to form stable amorphous films. A compound according to an embodiment of the present invention has a structure in which the naphthyl group is substituted with a fused polycyclic compound. As a result, the glass transition temperature of the compound is increased and stable amorphous films can be formed from the compound, which contributes to an increase in the life of organic light-emitting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0036">The substitution position of the naphthyl group with such a fused polycyclic group may be any position. However, since the planarity of the entire molecular structure needs to be enhanced for the purpose of enhancing the mobility of electrons or holes, the substitution position may correspond to X1 or X2 in the general formula [1]. When a substitution position other than X1 and X2 is employed, peri-position repulsion in the naphthyl group or steric repulsion due to the benzo[e]pyrenyl group causes a loss of the planarity between the naphthyl group and the fused polycyclic group.</p>

In particular, compounds represented by the general formula [1] can be used to form a hole transport layer, an electron transport layer, and a luminescent sublayer. In this case, organic light-emitting elements having a high light-emitting efficiency and a long life can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">The term &#x201c;luminescent sublayer&#x201d; denotes a layer that emits light. An organic light-emitting element according to an embodiment of the present invention may include a functional layer in addition to such a luminescent sublayer. In this case, the organic light-emitting element has a structure in which layers including the luminescent sublayer and the functional layer are stacked. The layer configuration of such an organic light-emitting element will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048">An organic compound layer serving as a luminescent sublayer contains a compound represented by the general formula [1]. The luminescent sublayer may be formed of a compound represented by the general formula [1] only. Alternatively, a compound represented by the general formula [1] may be used as a guest material of the luminescent sublayer.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">Herein, the term &#x201c;guest material&#x201d; denotes a material that substantially determines the emission color of an organic light-emitting element and emits light.

<p id="p-0052" num="0050">In an organic luminescent sublayer, a host material has a high compositional ratio and a guest material has a low compositional ratio. Herein, such a compositional ratio is represented in weight percent in which the total weight of all the components constituting the organic compound layer serves the denominator.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0053">Hereinafter, an organic light-emitting element according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail. An organic light-emitting element according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a pair of electrodes constituted by an anode and a cathode, and one or more layers that contain an organic compound and are disposed between the pair of electrodes. At least one layer among the one or more layers that contain an organic compound contains at least one compound represented by the general formula [1].</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">In addition to the organic compound layer, another compound layer may be disposed between the pair of electrodes facing each other. Two or more compound layers including the organic compound layer may be disposed between the pair of electrodes. In such a case, the organic light-emitting element is referred to as a multilayer organic light-emitting element. Hereinafter, the first to fifth examples of such a multilayer organic light-emitting element will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0055">The first example of a multilayer organic light-emitting element has a configuration in which an anode, a luminescent sublayer, and a cathode are sequentially disposed on a substrate. Such an organic light-emitting element is advantageous in the case where a single organic compound having a hole transport capability, an electron transport capability, and a light-emitting capability is used and in the case where compounds having such capabilities are mixed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0056">The second example of a multilayer organic light-emitting element has a configuration in which an anode, a hole transport layer, an electron transport layer, and a cathode are sequentially disposed on a substrate. Such an organic light-emitting element is advantageous in the case where a light-emitting material having a hole transport capability or an electron transport capability or both capabilities is used to form a layer and, the light-emitting material is combined with a hole transport material without a light-emitting capability or an electron transport material without a light-emitting capability. In this case, a hole transport layer or an electron transport layer serves as a luminescent sublayer.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0057">The third example of a multilayer organic light-emitting element has a configuration in which an anode, a hole transport layer, a luminescent sublayer, an electron transport layer, and a cathode are sequentially disposed on a substrate. In this configuration, the carrier transport function and the light-emitting function are separated. Compounds having a hole transport capability, an electron transport capability, and a light-emitting capability can be appropriately combined. Accordingly, the degree of freedom with which materials are selected is considerably enhanced and various compounds having different light-emitting wavelengths can be used. Thus, various light-emitting hues can be provided. Furthermore, carriers or excitons can be effectively confined within the central luminescent sublayer to thereby enhance a light-emitting efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0058">The fourth example of a multilayer organic light-emitting element has a configuration in which an anode, a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a luminescent sublayer, an electron transport layer, and a cathode are sequentially disposed on a substrate. This configuration enhances the adhesion between the anode and the hole transport layer or enhances hole injection properties, which effectively results in low-voltage driving.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0059">The fifth example of a multilayer organic light-emitting element has a configuration in which an anode, a hole transport layer, a luminescent sublayer, a hole-exciton blocking layer, an electron transport layer, and a cathode are sequentially disposed on a substrate. In this configuration, the hole-exciton blocking layer that blocks passing of holes or excitons toward the cathode is disposed between the luminescent sublayer and the electron transport layer. In this configuration, by forming the hole-exciton blocking layer with a compound having a very high ionization potential, the light-emitting efficiency is effectively enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0060">However, the first to fifth examples show merely basic element configurations and the configuration of an organic light-emitting element including a compound according to an embodiment of the present invention is not restricted to these configurations. Various layer configurations may be employed: for example, an insulating layer is disposed at the interface between an electrode and an organic layer; a bonding layer or an interference layer is disposed; or an electron transport layer or a hole transport layer is constituted by two layers having different ionization potentials.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0061">A compound according to an embodiment of the present invention may be used as a host material of a luminescent sublayer. However, a compound according to an embodiment of the present invention may be used to form a layer other than a luminescent sublayer and an electron transport layer, that is, any one of a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a hole-exciton blocking layer, and an electron injection layer.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0062">Optionally, in addition to a compound according to an embodiment of the present invention, an existing compound such as a low molecular weight or high molecular weight hole transporting compound, a light-emitting compound, or an electron transporting compound can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0063">As a hole injection/transport material, a material having a high hole mobility may be used so that holes can be readily injected from an anode and the injected holes can be transported to a luminescent sublayer. Examples of a low molecular weight or high molecular weight hole injection/transport material include triarylamine derivatives, phenylenediamine derivatives, stilbene derivatives, phthalocyanine derivatives, porphyrin derivatives, poly(vinylcarbazole), poly(thiophene), and other conductive polymers. However, these examples are not limitative.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0064">Examples of a host material mainly include fused cyclic compounds such as fluorene derivatives, naphthalene derivatives, anthracene derivatives, pyrene derivatives, carbazole derivatives, quinoxaline derivatives, and quinoline derivatives; organic aluminum complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolate) aluminum; organic zinc complexes; triphenylamine derivatives; polymer derivatives such as triphenylamine derivatives, poly(fluorene) derivatives, and poly(phenylene) derivatives. However, these examples are not limitative.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0065">An electron injection/transport material can be freely selected from materials to which electrons are readily injected from a cathode and from which the injected electrons can be transported to a luminescent sublayer. An electron injection/transport material is selected in consideration of, for example, a balance relating to the hole mobility of a hole injection/transport material. Examples of a material having an electron injection/transport capability include oxadiazole derivatives, oxazole derivatives, pyrazine derivatives, triazole derivatives, triazine derivatives, quinoline derivatives, quinoxaline derivatives, phenanthroline derivatives, and organic aluminum complexes. However, these examples are not limitative.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0066">An anode material may have a work function as high as possible. Examples of an anode material include elemental metals such as gold, platinum, silver, copper, nickel, palladium, cobalt, selenium, vanadium, and tungsten; alloys of such metals; metal oxides such as tin oxide, zinc oxide, indium oxide, indium tin oxide (ITO), and indium zinc oxide; and conductive polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, and polythiophene. Such electrode materials may be used alone or in combination. An anode may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0067">On the other hand, a cathode material may have a low work function. Examples of a cathode material include alkali metals such as lithium; alkaline-earth metals such as calcium; elemental metals such as aluminum, titanium, manganese, silver, lead, and chromium; alloys of these elemental metals such as a magnesium-silver alloy, an aluminum-lithium alloy, and an aluminum-magnesium alloy; and metal oxides such as indium tin oxide (ITO). Such electrode materials may be used alone or in combination. A cathode may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0068">A substrate including an organic light-emitting element according to an embodiment of the present invention is not particularly restricted. For example, an opaque substrate such as a metal substrate or a ceramic substrate, or a transparent substrate such as a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, or a plastic-sheet substrate may be used. By combining a substrate and a color filter film, a fluorescent color conversion filter film, a dielectric reflection film, or the like, emitted color light can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0069">For the purpose of preventing a fabricated element from being in contact with oxygen, moisture, or the like, a protective layer or a sealing layer may be provided. Examples of such a protective layer include diamond thin films; inorganic material films such as metal oxide films and metal nitride films; polymer films such as fluorocarbon resin films, polyethylene films, silicone resin films, and polystyrene films; and photocurable resin films. Alternatively, a fabricated element may be covered with glass, a gas barrier film, a metal, or the like and may be packaged with an appropriate sealing resin.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0070">In an organic light-emitting element according to an embodiment of the present invention, a layer containing an organic compound according to an embodiment of the present invention and a layer composed of another organic compound can be formed in the following manner. In general, a thin film is formed by a vacuum deposition method, an ionization deposition method, sputtering, a plasma deposition method, or an existing application method in which a solution prepared by dissolving an organic compound in a solvent is applied, such as spin coating, dipping, a casting method, a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method, or an inkjet method. Of these methods, when a vacuum deposition method, a solution application method, or the like is employed to form a layer, crystallization or the like is less likely to be caused and the layer is excellent in terms of stability over time. When such an application method is employed to form a film, the film may be composed of an organic compound and an appropriate binder resin.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0071">Examples of such a binder resin include polyvinyl carbazole resins, polycarbonate resins, polyester resins, ABS resins, acrylic resins, polyimide resins, phenolic resins, epoxy resins, silicone resins, and urea resins. However, these examples are not limitative. Such a binder resin may be used alone in the form of a homopolymer or a copolymer, or in combination as a mixture of two or more thereof. Optionally, such a binder resin may be combined with an existing additive such as a plasticizer, an antioxidant, or an ultraviolet absorbing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0072">An organic light-emitting element according to an embodiment of the present invention can be applied to products that need to have a high energy efficiency or a high luminous intensity. Examples of such an application include display devices, lighting devices, light sources of printers, and backlights of liquid crystal display apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0073">Such display devices may be flat-panel displays that have a high energy efficiency, a high visibility, or a light weight. Such display devices may be image display devices of PCs, television receivers, advertising media, or the like. Alternatively, such display devices may be used for display sections of image capturing apparatuses such as digital still cameras or digital video cameras.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0074">Alternatively, such display devices may be used for operation display sections of electrophotographic image forming apparatuses such as laser beam printers or copiers.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0075">Such display devices may be used as light sources used in exposure of latent images on photo conductors of electrophotographic image forming apparatuses such as laser beam printers or copiers. A latent image can be formed by performing exposure on a photoconductor drum in a predetermined manner with arrays (for example, in the form of lines) of independently addressable organic light-emitting elements. By using an organic light-emitting element according to an embodiment of the present invention, spaces having been required to place a light source, a polygon mirror, various optical lenses, and the like can be saved.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0076">By using an organic light-emitting element according to an embodiment of the present invention as a lighting device or a backlight, energy consumption can be reduced. An organic light-emitting element according to an embodiment of the present invention can be used as a planar light source.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0077">By providing a color filter film, a fluorescent color conversion filter film, a dielectric reflection film, or the like on a substrate supporting organic light-emitting elements according to an embodiment of the present invention, emitted color light can be controlled. Switching between light emission and non-light emission can be controlled with a thin-film transistor (TFT) disposed on a substrate and connected to an organic light-emitting element. A plurality of organic light-emitting elements may be arranged in a matrix, that is, arranged within a plane and can be used as a lighting device.</p>
