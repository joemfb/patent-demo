<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an area of improvement in an infrared carousel oven of the type taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,250,210 (2001) entitled High Efficiency Carousel Infrared Oven.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The prior art as exemplified in said item is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> thru <b>3</b> herewith. Therein is shown a cooking panel <b>19</b> within the generally cylindrical envelope of oven <b>21</b> having a roof <b>39</b> in which the circular panel <b>19</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is mounted upon an axle <b>23</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>). Cooking panels that are used within infrared in other high energy intensity environments are typically formed of a material such as calcium aluminate which is able to store large quantities of heat and operate at temperature of at least 2200 degrees Fahrenheit. Panel <b>19</b> is thus formed of a high thermal capacity material having parameters in a range of about 0.24 BTUs/pounds/degree Fahrenheit or 75,000 BTUs, given the weight of the illustrated assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Panel <b>19</b> when mounted upon axle <b>23</b> will typically be enclosed by a journal <b>26</b>. This assembly, inclusive of axle <b>23</b>, is in turn rotated by a gear assembly <b>28</b>. The arrows within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> show the various forms and direction of heating to which heating panel <b>19</b> is subjected, this inclusive of burners <b>29</b> in the oven <b>21</b>. At the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown flue <b>27</b> within roof <b>39</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is axle journal <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Over the last approximately ten years of usage of high efficiency carousel infrared ovens and the like, it has been found that interface or connection <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) between axle <b>23</b> and panel <b>19</b> will eventually degrade, thereby disabling the entire system as the connection between panel <b>19</b> and axle <b>23</b> erodes. Accordingly, a need has arisen in the art for an improved method of connection between heating panel <b>19</b> and rotational axle <b>23</b>. The present invention is thereby directed to a solution to this problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A system for support and securement of a thermal heating panel of a carousel oven to a rotational axle thereof is set forth. The system includes a flat upper including a plurality of diametric strips formed of a high density material, the upper receiver proportioned for complemental receipt of the heating panel. Situated at, or integrally secured to the bottom of the upper receiver, and situated polarly symmetrically about said axle, is a cradle proportioned for complemental fit upon a male drive shaft formed at an uppermost end of said rotational axle. Due to the weight of the heating panel and its slow rate of rotation within the carousel oven, the force of gravity of the heating panel is sufficient to maintain the upper receiver and its cradle upon the male drive plate even in the absence of positive securement between said elements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an alternate embodiment, the heating panel itself is entirely replaced by the upper receiver. However, in said embodiment a grill-like surface is secured above or below the diametric strips to permit the cooking or grilling of types of meat or food other than that which would typically be cooked or heated upon the thermal plate panel of an oven carousel, such as an infrared carousel oven. The grill-like surface optionally may be formed in the geometry of pie-like or triangular recesses into which pods may be selectably placed, each of which may be provided with a different quantity, arrangement, or type of food. In this application of the invention, each pod may itself be covered by another grill surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a system for the support and securement of a thermal heating panel of a carousel oven to a rotational axle thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another object to provide an improved means for securement and support of a heating panel through a rotational axle thereof to reduce or eliminate degradation of the contact between the axle and the thermal panel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is thus a further object of the invention to provide enhanced stability to a heating panel of a carousel oven.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a yet other object to provide a grilling surface for a carousel oven in which such surface is rotated by the oven.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above and yet other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent form the hereinafter set forth Detailed Description of the Invention, Claims and Drawings herewith.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>, it may be noted, within housing <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that axle <b>24</b> is, at an uppermost end thereof provided with a male drive plate <b>34</b> upon which rests a female receiver <b>36</b> upon which in turn rests an upper cradle <b>38</b> which provides support for heating panel <b>20</b> that is complemental therewith. Receiver <b>36</b> constitutes an interface with upper cradle <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>) and may be secured to the bottom thereof. As such, receiver <b>36</b> defines a stable interface between male drive plate <b>34</b> and upper cradle <b>38</b> which in turn supports rotational cooking panel <b>20</b>. The weight of panel <b>20</b> and its slow rate of rotation permit a gravity-only interface between cradle <b>38</b> and drive plate <b>34</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is gas burner supply channel <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is to be appreciated that upper cradle <b>38</b> is formed of a plurality of diametric strips <b>42</b> that are of a material stronger than is the panel <b>20</b>, i.e., the panel <b>20</b> is furnished with increased structural strength and stability due to the integrated effect of upper cradle <b>38</b> and the receiver <b>36</b>. This arrangement is particularly easy to maintain inasmuch as the weight of cooking panel <b>20</b> is such that, in normal use of the carousel oven, will not tip the cradle relative to the male drive plate <b>34</b>. However, if desired, the various above-described elements of the invention may be secured together by mechanical or bonding means.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As may be further appreciated, the weight and speed of the panel <b>20</b> is such that there is no loss of rotational force or torque between male drive plate <b>34</b> and panel <b>20</b> during normal operation of the carousel oven.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the physical dimensions of receiver <b>36</b> relative to male drive plate <b>34</b> may be seen. It is also to be appreciated that upper cradle <b>38</b> and receiver <b>36</b> may be integrally formed as a single piece such that cradle <b>38</b> with its integral receiver may be placed directly upon male drive plate <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref> is shown an embodiment of the present invention in which, in housing <b>22</b>, heating panel <b>20</b> is not used at all. In this embodiment, a perforated or grill-like material <b>150</b> is adhered, preferably beneath receiver <b>136</b> and diametric strips <b>140</b>, to form a new type of rotational cooking panel, although one not having the thermal capacity of cooking panel <b>20</b> in the prior art. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref> is particularly applicable to cooking of certain meats and foods which do not require the high thermal capacity of panel <b>20</b>. Beneath receiver <b>136</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be employed a similar cradle driver plate <b>34</b>, and connection of the type shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> above. Further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are additional gas heating elements <b>140</b> depending from gas burner supply channel <b>30</b> and axle journal <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12-15</figref> are shown a further embodiment in which, in housing <b>22</b>, rotational element <b>238</b> is divided into a plurality of pie-segment shaped recesses <b>250</b> which may accommodate foods for one or more forms of cooking. Another compartment <b>252</b> thereof may be provided within a pie-segment shaped grill <b>254</b> upon which may be placed foods having different cooking requirement. Rotational element <b>228</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) comprises a grill plate for the cooking of foods which may also utilize removable cooking pods <b>254</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) placed within the pie shaped recess <b>250</b>, such that a user may readily place different types or groups of food to be cooked within the geometry of recesses <b>250</b> of rotational element <b>228</b> over which grill <b>254</b> may or may not be placed. Partitions <b>240</b> separate the respective recesses <b>250</b>. Further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is gas burner supply channel <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">While there has been shown and described the preferred embodiment of the instant invention it is to be appreciated that the invention may be embodied otherwise than is herein specifically shown and described and that, within said embodiment, certain changes may be made in the form and arrangement of the parts without departing from the underlying ideas or principles of this invention as set forth herewith.</p>
