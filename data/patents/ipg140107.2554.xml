<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for collecting and processing biological samples (e.g., fecal samples) is disclosed. The method may include obtaining a system comprising a container, a collector, and a lid. Using the collector, a user may collect a sample. The sample may be inserted within the container. The lid may be secured and the container and sample contained therewithin may be transported to a testing facility. At the testing facility, the container may be used throughout the processing of the sample. Accordingly, the risk of cross-contamination may be reduced.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. The Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a device, assembly, and method employed in the collection and analysis of samples or specimens and, more specifically, the collection and analysis of fecal or other biological matter.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. The Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various methods and devices have been used in the past to collect, transport, and test biological samples. Many such samples are fecal samples taken by veterinarians or technicians at veterinary clinics. The standard practice for collecting, transporting, and testing a fecal sample typically involves transferring the sample from one container to another several times. However, each time the sample is transferred, there is an increased risk of compromising (e.g., contaminating) the sample. The high volume of samples being tested in laboratories further compounds this risk.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing, it would be advantageous to provide a sample collection assembly that limits, or even eliminates, the risk of compromising or contaminating a sample during collection, transport, and testing. Further, it would be advantageous to provide a sample collection assembly that is less tedious and messy and improves the efficiency of laboratory technicians.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing, in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a method and apparatus are disclosed in one embodiment of the present invention as including a specimen collection, transport, and testing system. In selected embodiments, a system in accordance with the present invention may limit or eliminate the need for transferring a sample or solution derived therefrom from one container to another.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, a system may include a container having an open end and a closed end. The system may further include a collector, filter, lid, and the like or combinations or sub-combinations thereof. In selected embodiments, a collector may include a loop facilitating the collection of a sample of suitable size. A filter may be sized and configured to be positioned within the container. In selected embodiments, a filter may selectively engage a distal end of a collector. A lid may be selectively applied to cover the open end of a container. A lid may secure a sample, collector, filter, or some combination or sub-combination thereof within a container.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In selected embodiments, a filter may include a central portion and a filter portion. A central portion may connect to a distal end of a collector. A filter portion may surround at least a portion of the distal end of the collector. A filter portion may include multiple openings extending therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A filter may include a nub extending therefrom. Such a nub may engage an aperture located in a distal end of a collector. Alternatively, a distal end of a collector may include a nub extending therefrom. This nub may engage an aperture located in a filter. Accordingly, a filter may be selectively applied to a collector and removed thereof by a user as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In operation, a user may obtain a system in accordance with the present invention. The system may include a container, collector, filter, lid, and the like or combinations or sub-combinations thereof. Using the collector, a user may collect a sample (e.g., fecal sample). A user may then (1) apply a filter to a distal end of the collector, (2) insert the filter, collector, and sample within a corresponding container, and (3) secure a lid in place to capture the filter, collector, and sample within the corresponding container. The system and sample contained therein may then be transported to a testing facility (e.g., laboratory).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Alternatively, no filter may be needed or desired. Accordingly, after using a collector to collect a sample, a user may (1) insert the collector and accompanying sample within a corresponding container and (2) secure a lid in place to capture the collector and sample within the corresponding container. The system and sample contained therein may then be transported to a testing facility.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">At a testing facility, a liquid (e.g., a liquid facilitating processing of a sample) may be passed (e.g., injected) through an opening in a lid to at least partially fill a corresponding container. The sample and surrounding liquid may be agitated, which may disperse the sample within the liquid. The collector and filter (or simply the collector in embodiments that do no include a filter) may then be removed from the container.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In embodiments employing a filter, removal of the filter may support or provide removal of various solids from within a container. That is, located at a distal end of a collector, a filter may be distal to any solid debris or undissolved portions of a sample. Accordingly, as a collector and filter are removed from a container, the filter may remove the solid debris or undissolved portions from the container while permitting the liquid and dissolved portions of the sample to remain in the container.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Once a collector (or collector and filter combination) has been removed from a container, the contents remaining in the container may be subjected to additional processes or steps consistent with the testing being performed. In selected embodiments, these additional processes may include subjecting the container and its content to separation within a centrifuge, adding additional liquid to the container to bring floating parasite identifiers (e.g., parasite eggs) and the like to the opening of the container, placing a cover slip across the opening to collect floating parasite identifiers, placing the cover slip on a slide, and placing the slide under a microscope to identify and count the various parasite identifiers collected. Accordingly, the container of a system in accordance with the present invention may used throughout the collection, transport, and testing of a sample.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the drawings herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the system and method of the present invention, as represented in the drawings, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of various embodiments of the invention. The illustrated embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a system <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention may be employed to minimize the steps and cost in collecting and processing samples (e.g., fecal samples) in the field and laboratory. A system <b>10</b> may also minimize the risk of compromising and/or contaminating a sample due to transferring the sample from one container to another.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A system <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention may include a container <b>12</b>, collector <b>30</b>, filter <b>50</b>, and lid <b>90</b>. A container <b>12</b>, collector <b>30</b>, filter <b>50</b>, or lid <b>90</b>, or combinations or sub-combinations thereof, may be formed from any suitable material or combination of materials. In selected embodiments, one or more components may be formed from polymeric materials or thermoplastics. Suitable polymers may include Polypropylene (PP), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), or the like. Such components may be formed in any suitable manner. For example, one or more components may be formed and manufactured utilizing techniques such as injection molding, thermo-forming, plastic stamping, machining, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A container <b>12</b> in accordance with the present invention may have any suitable shape. In selected embodiments, a container <b>12</b> may have a cylindrical or tubular shape with one end <b>14</b> closed and the other end <b>16</b> open. A container <b>12</b> may include a taper <b>22</b> or conical portion <b>22</b> converging proximate a closed end <b>14</b>. A container <b>12</b> may include an inner surface <b>18</b> and an outer surface <b>20</b>. An outer surface <b>20</b> may include a detent mechanism <b>24</b> (e.g., a raised ring extending circumferentially around a container <b>12</b>) proximate an open end <b>16</b>. A detent mechanism <b>24</b> may assist in retaining a lid <b>90</b> in engagement with a corresponding container <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A collector <b>30</b> may include an elongate portion <b>32</b> and a collection portion <b>34</b>. A collector <b>30</b> may be sized and configured to allow a person to grasp the elongate portion <b>32</b> and collect, with the collection portion <b>34</b>, a sample (e.g., collect a fecal sample from a mammalian body). A collection potion <b>34</b> may have any suitable shape or configuration. The shape or configuration of the collection portion <b>34</b> may depend on the nature of the sample being collected. For example, to facilitate collection of fecal samples, a collection portion <b>34</b> may comprise or resemble a typical fecal loop. Alternatively, a collection portion <b>34</b> may comprise a different structure. For example, a collection portion <b>34</b> may comprise a swab, spoon, flat surface, fork, piercing element, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In selected embodiments, after a collector <b>30</b> has been used to obtain a sample, the collector <b>30</b> may engage or connect to a filter <b>50</b>. This engagement may be accomplished in any suitable manner. For example, a collector <b>30</b> may include a fastener <b>38</b> (e.g., extension nub <b>38</b>) sized and configured to selectively engage (and disengage) an aperture <b>58</b> in a corresponding filter <b>50</b>. A filter <b>50</b> may include a central portion <b>52</b> and multiple filter tabs <b>54</b> extending away from the central portion <b>52</b>. In selected embodiments, a central portion <b>52</b> may contain or define an aperture <b>58</b> for engaging or receiving a fastener <b>38</b> extending from a collector <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In certain embodiments, a fastener <b>38</b> may include a neck <b>40</b> and a head <b>43</b> extending away from a distal end <b>44</b> of a collector <b>30</b>. The fastener <b>38</b> may be sized and shaped to engage an aperture <b>58</b> in a filter <b>50</b> with a snap-type connection. Alternatively, a fastener <b>38</b> may include threads for engaging corresponding threads formed in an aperture <b>58</b> in a filter <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, a filter <b>50</b> may include a first side <b>60</b>, a second side <b>62</b>, and a periphery <b>64</b> or edge <b>64</b> extending between the first and second sides <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. The shape or configuration of the first and second sides <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> may be similar or substantially identical. The periphery <b>64</b> or edge <b>64</b> may define a plurality of filter tabs <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Filter tabs <b>54</b> may extend radially away from a central portion <b>52</b> of a filter <b>50</b>. In selected embodiments, a central portion <b>52</b> may have a hexagonal configuration. In such embodiments, one filter tab <b>54</b> may extend from each of the six sides. In other embodiments, a central portion <b>52</b> may be a different shape (e.g., triangular, square, octagonal, round, or the like). Each filter tab <b>54</b> may include one or more openings <b>66</b> extending therethrough. Openings <b>66</b> may be sized and configured to facilitate a filtering function. In selected embodiments, openings <b>66</b> may have an elongated shape defining a width <b>68</b>, or any other shape or configuration, to provide desired filtering characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In certain embodiments, filter tabs <b>54</b> may be positioned in an expanded configuration before a corresponding filter <b>50</b> has been inserted within a container <b>12</b>. However, as such a filter <b>50</b> is inserted within a container <b>12</b>, the corresponding filter tabs <b>54</b> may deflect <b>74</b>. The ability of the filter tabs <b>54</b> to deflect <b>74</b> may be enhanced by a thin wall <b>72</b> forming the interface between each filter tab <b>54</b> and a corresponding central portion <b>52</b>. A thin wall <b>72</b> may function as a living hinge.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In selected embodiments, a thin wall <b>72</b> may be symmetrical. That is, each filter tab <b>54</b> may deflect <b>74</b> with substantially equal ease in either direction. Accordingly, there may be no requirement for a first side <b>60</b> or a second side <b>62</b> of the filter <b>50</b> to be positioned adjacent a collector <b>30</b>. Either side <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> may be so positioned with substantially equal functionality and performance.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When a filter <b>50</b> is inserted within a container <b>12</b>, the filter tabs <b>54</b> may deflect to achieve a deflected configuration. In a deflected configuration, adjacent filter tabs <b>54</b> may be spaced from one another a distance <b>70</b> comparable (e.g., substantially equal) to the width <b>68</b> of the openings <b>66</b>. Accordingly, the spacing <b>70</b> between filter tabs <b>54</b> may provide a filtering function similar to that of the openings <b>66</b> within the filter tabs <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In selected embodiments, the side walls or periphery <b>64</b> of each filter tab <b>54</b> may be slightly curved so that when placed within a container <b>12</b>, the spacing <b>70</b> between filtering tabs <b>54</b> may be substantially constant along a length of each filter tab <b>54</b>. In certain embodiments, the width <b>68</b> of the openings <b>66</b> within a filter tab <b>54</b> and the spacing <b>70</b> between adjacent filter tabs <b>54</b> may be about 0.02 inches to about 0.04 inches and preferably about 0.025 inches to about 0.035 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In certain alternative embodiments, filter tabs <b>54</b> or a filter <b>50</b> may include one or more screen members or portions of screen material providing a more precise filtering action. In still other alternative embodiments, a filter <b>50</b> may be preformed in a cup-like configuration. In such a configuration, a filter <b>50</b> may be interconnected and no deflection <b>74</b> may be necessary. The central portion <b>52</b> of a filter <b>50</b> may form the bottom of a cup, while the side wall provides a filter portion. A fastener <b>38</b> may extend to engage the bottom of the cup. The side wall may then surround at least a distal portion of a collector <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, in selected embodiments, a lid <b>90</b> may include a cap portion <b>92</b> and a handle portion <b>94</b>. A cap portion <b>92</b> may be sized and configured to close an open end <b>16</b> of a container <b>12</b>. For example, an inner surface <b>98</b> of a lid portion <b>92</b> may include a detent mechanism <b>102</b> (e.g., a ridge) sized and configured to engage a corresponding detent mechanism <b>24</b> of a container <b>12</b>. Such an engagement may assist in maintaining a lid <b>90</b> properly secured with respect to a container <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In certain embodiments, a lid portion <b>92</b> and a handle portion <b>94</b> of a lid <b>90</b> may both include an outer surface <b>96</b> and an inner surface <b>98</b>. An inner surface <b>98</b> may define a conduit <b>100</b> extending through the length of a handle portion <b>94</b>. A conduit <b>100</b> may extend between a proximal end or opening <b>104</b> and a distal end or opening <b>106</b> to define a path through a lid <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A handle portion <b>94</b> of a lid <b>90</b> may be sized and configured to at least partially capture a proximal portion <b>82</b> or end <b>82</b> of an elongate portion <b>32</b> of a collector <b>30</b>. For example, a distal opening <b>106</b> and conduit <b>100</b> defined in a handle portion <b>94</b> may be sized and configured to receive, in a snug manner, at least a portion of a proximal end <b>82</b> of the elongate portion <b>32</b>. In selected embodiments, an inner surface <b>98</b> of a handle portion <b>94</b> may contact and grip one or more ridges <b>84</b> formed in a proximal portion <b>82</b> of a collector <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With a handle portion <b>94</b> sized and configured to at least partially receive the proximal end <b>82</b> of a collector <b>30</b> therewithin, a portion of one or more channels <b>80</b> (e.g., spaces between adjacent ridges <b>84</b>) may be exposed to allow fluid to pass therethrough. For example, such channels <b>80</b> may be sized and configured to pass liquid (e.g., a liquid or processing solution employed during a testing procedure) therethrough. Accordingly, without removing a lid <b>90</b> or collector <b>30</b> from a container <b>12</b>, liquid may be passed through the proximal opening <b>104</b> at one end of the lid <b>90</b>, through the conduit <b>100</b>, along the channels <b>80</b>, and into the container <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A channel <b>80</b> may extend and be defined in a handle portion <b>32</b> as a ravine-like structure, a tunnel, or the like. In selected embodiments, a collector <b>30</b> may include four channels <b>80</b> extending in parallel. In one embodiment, each channel <b>80</b> may be defined by a ridge <b>84</b> extending along each side thereof. A channel <b>80</b> may extend along a longitudinal length of an elongate portion <b>32</b>. Alternatively, a channel <b>80</b> may extend only within a proximal portion <b>82</b> of an elongate portion <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, any suitable mechanism may be employed to attached a filter <b>50</b> to a collector <b>30</b>. As described hereinabove, in selected embodiments, a collector <b>30</b> may include a fastener <b>38</b> extending to engage an aperture <b>58</b> in a filter <b>50</b>. In other embodiments, a filter <b>50</b> may include a fastener <b>110</b> extending to engage an aperture <b>112</b> in a collector <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, in certain embodiments, a distal end <b>44</b> of a collector <b>30</b> may include an exterior surface <b>114</b> (e.g., a flat exterior surface <b>114</b>) and an interior surface <b>116</b> (e.g., a flat interior surface <b>116</b>). An aperture <b>112</b> may extend through the distal end <b>44</b> from an exterior surface <b>114</b> to an interior surface <b>116</b>. An interior surface <b>116</b> may provide an edge or lip to assist in latching or engaging a fastener <b>110</b> of a filter <b>50</b>. Alternatively, an aperture <b>112</b> may comprise a recess in an exterior surface <b>114</b> that does not reach or breach any interior surface <b>116</b>. Such a recess may include one or more ridges defined therein to assist in latching or engaging a fastener <b>110</b> of a filter <b>50</b>. An aperture <b>112</b> may extend co-axially along a longitudinal axis <b>118</b> of a collector <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A central portion <b>52</b> of a filter <b>50</b> may include a fastener <b>110</b> extending therefrom. In selected embodiments, a fastener <b>110</b> may comprise an extension nub <b>110</b> extending from one side of a filter <b>50</b>. For example, a fastener <b>110</b> may include a neck <b>120</b> and a head <b>122</b> with a ridge <b>124</b> defined between the neck <b>120</b> and the head <b>122</b>. A head <b>122</b> may include a somewhat oval or round shape with a diameter slightly larger than a diameter of the aperture <b>112</b> defined in a corresponding collector <b>30</b>. A neck <b>120</b> may include a height that is about equal to or slightly greater than a depth of a corresponding aperture <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In operation, an aperture <b>112</b> may be positioned over <b>126</b> a fastener <b>110</b>. The aperture <b>112</b> may be manually pressed over the fastener <b>110</b>, thereby attaching a filter <b>50</b> to a collector <b>30</b>. For example, as it slides through an aperture <b>112</b>, the head <b>120</b> of a fastener <b>110</b> may slightly deform. However, once the head <b>120</b> extends completely through the aperture <b>112</b>, a ridge <b>124</b> or lip <b>124</b> portion of the fastener <b>110</b> may engage or abut an interior surface <b>116</b>. Accordingly, a fastener <b>110</b> may securely connect a filter <b>50</b> to a collector <b>30</b>. However, should a user need to remove a filter <b>50</b> from a collector <b>30</b>, the engagement between the ridge <b>124</b> and the interior surface <b>116</b> may be overcome without structural damage using a reasonable force.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In selected embodiments, tabs <b>54</b> of a filter <b>50</b> may define openings <b>66</b> therein that extend to an outer periphery <b>128</b>. For example, each opening <b>66</b> may define an elongate channel that is open to the outer periphery <b>128</b> of the tabs <b>128</b>. The tabs <b>54</b> in such embodiments may be shorter in length than the previously described embodiments (e.g., less than half the length of the collection portion <b>34</b> of a corresponding collector <b>30</b>). Such tabs <b>54</b> may provide more volume for a solution to mix with a sample adhering to the collection portion <b>34</b> of a collector <b>30</b>. Other structures, functions, and the like of such tabs <b>54</b> and corresponding filter <b>50</b> may be similar to the previously described embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in selected embodiments, various components or portions thereof may be omitted from a system <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention. For example, a filter <b>50</b> may be omitted. This may be done by simply selecting a collector <b>30</b>, using the collector <b>30</b> to collect a sample, inserting the sample and collector <b>30</b> within a container <b>12</b>, and securing a lid <b>90</b>. The collector <b>30</b> used in such filter-less embodiments may be configured to receive or engage a filter <b>50</b>. For example, the collector <b>30</b> may include a fastener <b>38</b>, aperture <b>112</b>, or the like. Alternatively, the collector <b>30</b> may be devoid of such mechanisms <b>38</b>, <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The size of a collection portion <b>34</b> of a collector <b>30</b> may vary between embodiments. In selected embodiments, the size of the collection portion <b>34</b> may be varied to control the size of a sample collected thereby. For example, in certain embodiments, a collection portion <b>34</b> may comprise a loop sized to collect a sample of about 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, a collection portion <b>34</b> may comprise a loop sized to collect a sample of about 1.0 grams. In still other embodiments, a collection portion <b>34</b> may comprise a loop sized to collect a sample of about 1.0 to about 2.0 grams.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, in selected embodiments, a lid <b>190</b> may include a vent <b>130</b>. A vent <b>130</b> may extend directly through the wall of a cap portion <b>92</b>. Alternatively, a vent <b>130</b> may extend along a longitudinal length of a handle portion <b>94</b> of a lid <b>90</b>. For example, a vent <b>130</b> may extending in parallel with a conduit <b>100</b> located within a handle portion <b>94</b> of a lid <b>90</b>. In operation, when liquid is inserted through a conduit <b>100</b>, a vent <b>130</b> may provide a passageway for displaced air to escape a container <b>12</b>. Accordingly, a vent <b>130</b> may be sized to the accommodate the expected flow rate of the displaced air.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In selected embodiments, a lid <b>90</b> may include one or more removable plugs or covers. When installed, a plug may cover a proximal opening <b>104</b>, vent <b>130</b>, or some combination thereof. A plug may be employed during transport of a system <b>10</b> and the sample contained therewithin. A plug may assist in maintaining the integrity of the sample and prevent the sample from drying out before testing. Once a system <b>10</b> and corresponding sample have arrived at a testing facility, a plug may be removed to allow the insertion of a processing liquid within the system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, in selected embodiments, the present invention may include a collection method <b>132</b>. In one embodiment of a collection method <b>132</b>, once a system <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention has been obtained <b>134</b>, a user may: (1) use a collector <b>30</b> to collect <b>136</b> a sample; (2) attach <b>138</b> a filter <b>50</b> to a distal end <b>44</b> of the collector <b>30</b>; (3) insert <b>140</b> the collector <b>30</b>, filter <b>50</b>, and accompanying sample within a corresponding container <b>12</b>; (4) install <b>142</b> a corresponding lid <b>90</b>; and (5) transport <b>144</b> (e.g., ship) the system <b>10</b> and contained sample to a testing facility. Alternatively, a user may: (1) use a collector <b>30</b> to collect <b>136</b> a sample; (2) insert <b>146</b> the collector <b>30</b> and accompanying sample within a corresponding container <b>12</b>; (3) install <b>142</b> a corresponding lid <b>90</b>; and (4) transport <b>144</b> (e.g., ship) the system <b>10</b> and contained sample to a testing facility.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the present invention may include an individualized processing method <b>148</b>. In selected embodiments, an individualized processing method <b>148</b> may begin when a testing facility (e.g., laboratory) receives <b>150</b> a system <b>10</b> and contained sample for processing and testing. At the testing facility, a user (e.g., laboratory technician) may individually process a sample. This may include: (1) injecting <b>152</b> a processing liquid (e.g., a zinc sulfate solution) through a lid <b>90</b> and into a container <b>12</b>; (2) waiting <b>154</b> a period of time for the processing liquid to dissolve, saturate, or break down the sample; (3) agitating <b>156</b> (e.g., moving the lid <b>90</b> up and down to move the collector <b>30</b> up and down with respect to the container <b>12</b>) the contents of the container <b>12</b>; (4) removing <b>158</b> the lid <b>90</b>, collector <b>30</b>, and (if included) the filter <b>50</b>; (5) accelerating <b>160</b> the container and its contents within a centrifuge; (6) topping <b>162</b> off the container <b>12</b> with the processing liquid; (7) making <b>164</b> a slide; (8) analyzing <b>166</b> the slide under a microscope; and the like or combinations or sub-combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the present invention may also include a batch processing method <b>168</b>. In selected embodiments, a batch processing method <b>168</b> may begin when a testing facility receives <b>170</b> a plurality of systems <b>10</b> and contained samples for processing and testing. At the testing facility, one or more users may process the samples as a batch. This may include: (1) placing <b>172</b> each system <b>10</b> in a caddie or centrifuge adapter; (2) placing <b>174</b> each caddie in a rack; (3) placing <b>176</b> the rack under a multi-station pump; (4) injecting <b>176</b> (e.g., simultaneously) a processing liquid (e.g.,) through a lid <b>90</b> and into each container <b>12</b>; (5) waiting <b>180</b> a period of time for the processing liquid to dissolve, saturate, or break down the samples; (6) agitating <b>182</b> (e.g., moving each lid <b>90</b> up and down to move a corresponding collector <b>30</b> up and down with respect to a corresponding container <b>12</b>) the contents of the containers <b>12</b>; (7) removing <b>184</b> each lid <b>90</b>, collector <b>30</b>, and (if included) filter <b>50</b>; (8) accelerating <b>186</b> each caddie (and corresponding containers <b>12</b> and contents) within a centrifuge; (9) topping <b>188</b> off the containers <b>12</b> with the processing liquid; (10) making <b>190</b> slides; (11) analyzing <b>192</b> the slides under a microscope; and the like or combinations or sub-combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A caddie or centrifuge adapter in accordance with the present invention may be a structure configured to support a plurality of containers <b>12</b> (e.g., four to eight containers <b>12</b>) in an upright orientation. A caddie may have a shape and size corresponding to a cavity within a centrifuge. Accordingly, rather than individually loading containers <b>12</b> into a centrifuge, a user may load a caddie (and all its contents) directly into a centrifuge in a single operation.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A rack in accordance with the present invention may be a structure configured to support one or more caddies (e.g., two to six caddies) in an upright orientation. In selected embodiments, a rack may index the caddies supported thereby. Accordingly, a rack may insure that containers <b>12</b> are consistently located in known locations with respect to the rack. Thus, by registering a rack with respect to a multi-station pump, each station may be positioned directly above the container <b>12</b> to which it will add processing liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In selected embodiments, topping <b>162</b>, <b>188</b> off a container <b>12</b> may include adding liquid to the container <b>12</b> until it is full (e.g., until a convex meniscus forms on the top of the container <b>12</b>). Making <b>164</b>, <b>190</b> a slide may include applying a cover slip to the top of a full container <b>12</b>. The cover slip may contact the liquid within the container <b>12</b>. Accordingly, material within the liquid (e.g., floating material) may collect on the cover slip. The cover slip may then be removed from the container <b>12</b> and placed on a microscope slide. Under a microscope, a user may analyze <b>166</b>, <b>192</b> the material collected on the cover slip.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In selected embodiments, this material may include parasite identifiers from the corresponding fecal sample. Parasite identifiers may be any material evidencing the presence, type, and quantity of parasites afflicting the source of the sample. Parasite identifiers may include parasitic organisms, eggs or oocytes of parasitic organisms, remains of parasitic organisms or eggs, or the like or combinations or sub-combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A system <b>10</b> of the present invention may provide a method <b>148</b>, <b>168</b> by which a single container <b>12</b> may be used at collection of a sample, during transport of the sample, and during processing of the sample at a testing facility. This may limit the risk of contaminating the sample and obtaining compromised or inaccurate test results. That is, a system <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention may substantially reduce the risk of cross-contaminating or compromising a sample to be tested by limiting the need to transfer the sample from one container to another in the field and while processing of the sample within a testing facility. Additionally, such a system <b>10</b> may better protect users from undesirable exposure to samples, lower the time involved in processing samples, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In selected embodiments, methods in accordance with the present invention may enable expert analysis of a sample without requiring the sample to be shipped to an expert. For example, in certain embodiments, a sample may be collected <b>136</b> and a slide generated <b>164</b>,<b>190</b> using one or more of the steps described above. However, rather than analyzing <b>166</b>, <b>192</b> a slide directly, an image of the slide may be generated. For example, a digital camera may capture through a microscope a digital copy (e.g., a still image, collection of still images, video clip, or the like) of the slide. This copy may then be transported (e.g., over a computer network) to an expert for analysis (e.g., for expert identification and counting of parasite identifiers).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In certain embodiments, methods in accordance with the present invention may avoid all shipping of a sample. For example, one or more steps of the collection <b>132</b> and processing <b>148</b>, <b>168</b> methods may be performed at a single facility (e.g., a single veterinary laboratory). One or more slides generated <b>164</b>, <b>190</b> in such methods <b>148</b>, <b>168</b> may also be analyzed <b>166</b>, <b>192</b> at the facility. However, if the expertise or personnel for performing such analysis is not present at the facility, an image of one or more slides may be generated and communicated in the manner described above to one or more qualified persons for analysis <b>166</b>, <b>192</b>. Accordingly, the sample itself may never leave the single facility.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative, and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.</p>
