<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description Of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A common constraint for application layer protocols is the transmission control protocol (TCP) port. A long-standing assumption in operating systems is that each TCP port is assigned to only one application. Because ports may be dedicated to specific types of services, limiting TCP to single applications prevents multiple applications from providing the same type of service on a single TCP port.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Exemplary methods, apparatus, and products for sharing a transmission control protocol (TCP) port by a plurality of applications in accordance with the present invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings, beginning with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Sharing a TCP port by a plurality of applications in accordance with the present invention is generally implemented with computers, that is, with automated computing machinery. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> sets forth a diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an exemplary computer (<b>152</b>) useful in sharing a TCP port by a plurality of applications (<b>193</b>) according to embodiments of the present invention. The computer (<b>152</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes at least one computer processor (<b>156</b>) or &#x2018;CPU&#x2019; as well as random access memory (<b>168</b>) (&#x2018;RAM&#x2019;) which is connected through a high speed memory bus (<b>166</b>) and bus adapter (<b>158</b>) to processor (<b>156</b>) and to other components of the computer (<b>152</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Stored in RAM (<b>168</b>) is an operating system (<b>154</b>). Operating systems useful sharing a TCP port by a plurality of applications according to embodiments of the present invention include invention include UNIX&#x2122;, Linux&#x2122;, Microsoft 7&#x2122;, AIX&#x2122;, IBM's i5/OS&#x2122;, iOS&#x2122;, Android&#x2122;, and others as will occur to those of skill in the art. A TCP port is an application-specific software construct serving as a communications endpoint. Transport Layer protocols, such as TCP, specify a source and destination port number in their packet headers. A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535. A process associates its input or output channel file descriptors (sockets) with a port number and an IP address, a process known as binding, to send and receive data via the network. The operating system (<b>154</b>) has the task of transmitting outgoing data from all ports onto the network, and forwarding arriving network packets to a process by matching the packet's IP address. A well-known range of port numbers is reserved by convention to identify specific service types on a host computer. In the client-server model of application architecture these reserved ranges are used to provide a multiplexing service on each port number that network clients connect to for service initiation, after which communication is reestablished on other connection-specific port numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Applications implementing common services often use specifically reserved, well-known port numbers for receiving service requests from client hosts. This process is known as listening and involves the receipt of a request on the well-known port and reestablishing one-to-one server-client communications on another private port, so that other clients may also contact the well-known service port. The well-known ports are defined by convention overseen by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IRNA).</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The example computer (<b>152</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes one or more input/output (&#x2018;I/O&#x2019;) adapters (<b>178</b>). I/O adapters implement user-oriented input/output through, for example, software drivers and computer hardware for controlling output to display devices such as computer display screens, as well as user input from user input devices (<b>181</b>) such as keyboards and mice.

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For further explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> sets forth a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method for sharing a transmission control protocol (TCP) port by a plurality of applications according to embodiments of the present invention. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes receiving (<b>202</b>), by a transmission controller (<b>191</b>) from a client (<b>182</b>), a first TCP packet (<b>230</b>) that includes an indication (<b>250</b>) of a new TCP connection for a TCP port (<b>195</b>). Receiving (<b>202</b>) a first TCP packet (<b>230</b>) that includes an indication (<b>250</b>) of a new TCP connection for a TCP port (<b>195</b>) may be carried out by receiving a TCP packet with a SYN flag set. For example, during a three-way handshake to establish a TCP connection, the first TCP packet received during the handshake has the SYN flag set.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also includes determining (<b>204</b>), by the transmission controller (<b>191</b>), an origination of the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>). In the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, determining (<b>204</b>) an origination of the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>) may be carried out by determining (<b>212</b>), by the transmission controller (<b>191</b>), an origination domain of the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>). An origination domain, as the term is used in this specification, refers to an identification label that corresponds to one or more IP addresses. Examples of origination domains include &#x201c;.ibm.com&#x201d; and &#x201c;.org.&#x201d; Determining (<b>212</b>) an origination domain of the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>) may be carried out by examining the header of the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>) to determine the domain of the client (<b>182</b>) that sent the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Determining (<b>204</b>) an origination of the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>) may also be carried out by determining (<b>214</b>), by the transmission controller (<b>191</b>), an origination IP address of the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>). Determining (<b>214</b>) an origination IP address of the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>) may be carried out by examining the header of the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>) to determine the IP address of the client (<b>182</b>) that sent the first TCP packet (<b>230</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes identifying (<b>206</b>), by the transmission controller (<b>191</b>), a TCP sequence number range (<b>240</b>) associated with the determined origination. TCP uses a sequence number to identify each segment of data. The sequence number indicates the order of the segments sent from each computer so that the data can be reconstructed in order and then transmitted to an application. Identifying (<b>206</b>) a TCP sequence number range (<b>240</b>) associated with the determined origination may be carried out by examining a table that indicates TCP sequence number range assignments and determining a TCP sequence number range that corresponds with the origination. That is, a first TCP sequence number may correspond to all packets from a first IP address and a second TCP sequence number may correspond to all packets from a second IP address.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also includes selecting (<b>208</b>), by the transmission controller (<b>191</b>), an initial sequence number (ISN) (<b>242</b>) within the identified TCP sequence number range (<b>240</b>). Selecting (<b>208</b>) an ISN (<b>242</b>) within the identified TCP sequence number range (<b>240</b>) may be carried out by determining a starting number of the identified TCP sequence number range, determining an ending number of the identified TCP sequence number range, and selecting a number between or including the starting number and the ending number.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes sending (<b>210</b>), by the transmission controller (<b>191</b>) to the client (<b>182</b>), a second TCP packet (<b>232</b>) that includes the selected ISN (<b>242</b>). Sending (<b>210</b>) a second TCP packet (<b>232</b>) that includes the selected ISN (<b>242</b>) may be carried out by transmitting a SYN-ACK TCP packet that includes a header with the selected ISN within the sequence number section. The transmission controller (<b>191</b>) may be configured to transmit the second packet (<b>232</b>) with a TCP header that includes a starting number and an ending number of the identified TCP sequence number range. By making the client (<b>182</b>) aware of the starting number and ending number of the identified TCP sequence number range, the client (<b>182</b>) will know the order of packets from the transmission controller (<b>191</b>). For example, the client (<b>182</b>) will be able to reorder received packets correctly such that a received packet that includes the ending TCP sequence number immediately precedes a received packet that includes the starting TCP sequence number.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">During a three-way handshake to establish a TCP connection, in response to receiving a first TCP packet with the SYN flag set, the transmission controller (<b>191</b>) transmits a second packet that includes an ISN. According to embodiments of the present invention, the ISN is selected by the transmission controller (<b>191</b>) from a particular TCP sequence number range corresponding to the origination of the first TCP packet. That is, multiple applications can share a TCP port by the transmission controller (<b>191</b>) dividing the TCP sequence numbers for a port into ranges for each application.</p>

Retrieving (<b>302</b>), by the transmission controller (<b>191</b>), the identified TCP sequence number range (<b>240</b>) from a port table (<b>304</b>) may be carried out by querying a port hash table. A port hash table may identify each application that is sharing a particular port.
