<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application claims priority to German Patent Application No. 10 2008 040 253.2, filed Jul. 8, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an implant system comprising a functional implant that fulfills a medical function, which implant is formed at least in part by a metal material that can be degraded by the body of the implant wearer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Implants are used for therapy of bone fractures, for example, in the form of nails, screws, or plates. Fundamentally, the process that occurs in the body when the broken ends of bones grow together is supposed to proceed with as little disruption as possible and in regular anatomical manner. In this connection, the most usual method is the use of an immobilization bandage in the form of a plaster or plastic cuff. This is generally used for uncomplicated fractures. The disadvantage of this method is the long loss of function of the injured extremity, leading to muscle and bone degeneration (atrophy) if the period of non-use is a long one.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to prevent atrophy, and in order to be able to begin rehabilitation as early as possible, it is increasingly true that an operation is carried out in the case of bone fractures wherein more precise restoration of the anatomy and better fixation of the fragments are possible using nails, screws, or plates. For older patients, this is often the only possibility so that the patients do not lose their previous independence for a long period of time or even permanently.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Usually, such functional implants for support, fixation, and hold are produced from non-degradable materials, such as medical steel or titanium (alloys). After the bone fragments have grown together, these implants remain in the body or they are explanted during the course of another operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Functional implants that remain in the body can lead to irritations, such as inflammations, in the long term. Explantation of the implant leads to another avoidable operation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to provide a remedy here, orthopedic implants are known, for example, from U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0015578, which are produced at least in part from metal materials that can be degraded by the body of the implant wearer. Metals, such as iron, magnesium, zinc, tungsten, as well as mixtures or alloys of these, are used.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An active orthopedic implant, for example, in the form of a bone plate, is known from U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0052782, which has at least one microchip and a sensor connected with it. The sensor responds to physical signals from the implant or from the patient tissue, such as temperature, pressure, or tensile stress, for example. The data recorded by the sensor are processed by the microchip and transmitted to a receiver disposed outside of the patient, such as a personal computer, for example. In this way, the medical care personnel can undertake a diagnosis, for example, of the effective period of functioning of the implant, the stress on the bone plate, and possible complications that can occur in the case of orthopedic implants, in the form of infections, non-healing of the fracture, and fatigue. Furthermore, the implant can have electrodes on its surface to support the healing process of the bone fracture.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A disadvantage of functional implants composed of a degradable material is the fact that the degradation process is dependent on the conditions in the body of the implant wearer, in each instance. In particular, the degradation process cannot be actively influenced.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure describes several exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One aspect of the present disclosure provides an implant system, comprising a) a medical implant formed at least in part from a metal material that can be degraded by the body of the implant wearer, and b) a control device for controlling the degradation behavior of the functional implant, the control device having (i) at least one counter-electrode to the functional implant, and (ii) a voltage source for making available a polarization voltage (&#x394;U) between functional implant and counter-electrode, to control the degradation behavior of the functional implant.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure is based on the task of indicating an implant system of the type stated, in which the degradation process, particularly the point in time at which it starts, and its duration, can be actively influenced.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This task is accomplished by an implant system having a functional implant that fulfills a medical function, particularly a bone implant, vascular support, stent, or depot implant, which is formed at least in part by a metal material that can be degraded by the body of the implant wearer. A control device for controlling the degradation behavior of the functional implant is provided having a counter-electrode with regard to the functional implant, which electrode consists of an electrochemically more precious metal material as compared with the metal material of the functional implant, and having a voltage source for making available a polarization voltage between functional implant and counter-electrode to control the degradation behavior of the functional implant.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Using this control device, it is possible to control the degradation behavior of the functional implant in a targeted manner, in that the polarization voltage applied between the functional implant and the counter-electrode protects the functional implant cathodically and thus it does not degrade, or at least the implant degrades more slowly. Thus, the dissolution of the implant after insertion can be delayed at first or completely prevented. As soon as the support, fixation, or hold function of the implant has been fulfilled, degradation of the implant can be accelerated by means of applying the polarization voltage using the control device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For purposes of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;functional implants&#x201d; comprises vascular supports, stents, or depot implants. Areas of application for the functional implants are also urological, intracranial, vascular, and orthopedic applications, local-drug-delivery applications, as well as applications in cancer therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, at least one reference electrode is provided to determine the voltage actually applied to the functional implant (<b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>15</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one exemplary embodiment, the control device has an implantable battery as a voltage source. Such a power source is reliable and extremely inexpensive.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Other exemplary embodiments of the implant system relate to the design of the counter-electrode, which can be separately implantable or formed by the housing of the implantable control device itself. If the counter-electrode is configured separately, the counter-electrode can consist of a degradable metal material, but the metal material must be electrochemically more precious than the metal material of the functional implant. Then, the counter-electrode no longer has to be explanted because the counter-electrode degrades over time, even in the body of the implant wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">If the counter-electrode is formed by the housing of the control device or its battery, a non-degradable material selection must be made, such as a titanium housing, for example. Optionally, complete or partial coating of the housing surface with a non-degradable metal, such as platinum, or a non-degradable alloy, such as platinum-iridium, can take place.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According one exemplary embodiment, switchability of the voltage source can be implemented in that a physician cuts the line connection between the battery and the counter-electrode, or explants the battery itself, during an outpatient operation. More convenient activation of the control device is possible; however, if the control device has a telemetrical data transmission unit, as is already the usual technology in the field of heart pacemakers. Control data for controlling the polarization voltage generated by the voltage source can be transmitted by way of the telemetrical data transmission unit, as can measurement data concerning the status of the functional implant, such as its degree of degradation, for example. In this way, true Home Monitoring can be implemented also in connection with the implant systems according to the present disclosure. Up to the present, it has not been known for orthopedic implants that their status or the status of the treated location can be monitored and influenced even without a visit to the doctor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An implementation that is also covered by the general core of the present disclosure is implementation of the functional implant as a depot implant that has at least one depot chamber filled with a therapeutic agent. Using the control device disclosed herein, the depot chamber, which consists at least partly of a degradable metal material, can be degraded under time control and thus the therapeutic agent contained in the depot chamber can be released in a manner defined over time. By using multiple depot chambers and different materials or dimensions for their covers, release of different therapeutic agents, offset over time, can be controlled in connection with a defined polarization voltage applied by the control unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a bone <b>1</b> in an extremity <b>2</b> of a person has suffered from a fracture <b>3</b>. This fracture <b>3</b> is medically treated with an implant system <b>4</b>, which system has a bone splint <b>5</b> with attachment screws <b>6</b> as the main components of the functional implant. This implant covers the fracture <b>3</b> of the bone <b>1</b> in order to immobilize and stabilize the bone fragments so that the bone fragments can grow back together. The bone splint <b>5</b> and attachment screws <b>6</b> are produced from a metal material that can be degraded by the extremity <b>2</b> of the body of the implant wearer, such as iron, magnesium, zinc, or tungsten, or a suitable alloy of these materials, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The second main component of the implant system is a control device <b>7</b>, which is structured, for example, in the manner of a heart pacemaker. To provide power, a battery <b>8</b> is integrated into the control device <b>7</b>. This battery is integrated into a housing <b>9</b> of the control device <b>7</b>, which consists of a titanium alloy, for example. Furthermore, a counter-electrode <b>10</b> is provided, which consists of platinum. Between the control device <b>7</b>, on the one hand, and the bone splint <b>5</b> and the counter-electrode <b>10</b>, on the other hand, connection lines <b>18</b> are provided, with which a polarization voltage U<sub>out </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) can be applied between the bone splint <b>5</b> with its attachment screws <b>6</b>, on the one hand, and the counter-electrode <b>10</b>, on the other hand. Using this polarization voltage U<sub>out</sub>, the degradation behavior of the bone splint <b>5</b> with its attachment screw <b>6</b> can be controlled such that when a corresponding polarization voltage U<sub>out </sub>is applied, the bone splint <b>5</b> with the attachment screws <b>6</b> is cathodically protected against degradation, in accordance with the electrochemical voltage conditions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the exemplary embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the counter-electrode <b>10</b> is structured as a section of the housing <b>9</b>. Furthermore, a reference electrode <b>11</b> is provided which is embedded into the counter-electrode <b>10</b> in an insulated manner in the case of the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The voltage U<sub>REF </sub>that is actually applied at the functional implant can be determined using the reference electrode <b>11</b>. The determination of the voltage U<sub>REF </sub>that is actually applied is necessary for regulation of the system. Namely, the voltage U<sub>out </sub>applied between the counter-electrode <b>10</b> and the functional implant, which allows the current I to flow from the counter-electrode <b>10</b> to the functional implant by way of the tissue, since a certain voltage drop U<sub>IR </sub>(IR drop) occurs as the result of the electrical resistance of the tissue R, which leads to the result that U<sub>in </sub>and U<sub>REF </sub>are not equal, and for this reason, the voltage U<sub>out </sub>has to be corrected by way of an amplifier <b>19</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The tissue resistance generally changes over the implantation period since the tissue that surrounds the functional implant and the counter-electrode <b>10</b> changes over the course of time.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The reference electrode <b>11</b> has a constant potential in vivo and no significant currents (other than those needed for measuring) flow over it. Materials such as Pt, PtIr, gold, carbon, or the like, are possible for the reference electrode <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The location of the reference electrode <b>11</b> is preferably selected to be spatially close to the functional implant. Here, an exemplary embodiment would be a PtIr sheet having an area of a few square millimeters, which is directly integrated into the control device <b>7</b> by means of a glass or ceramic passage through the housing <b>9</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Another exemplary embodiment would be a reference electrode <b>11</b> structured as a PtIr sheet having an area of a few square millimeters, which is applied directly on the bone splint <b>5</b>, for example, glued on, with a connection line <b>18</b> to the control device (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). What is important is that in both cases, there is no short-circuit to the counter-electrode <b>10</b> and to the functional implant <b>5</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Aside from the reference electrode, other sensors can also be used. For example, the pH and the temperature can be recorded. Likewise, micro-arrays can be connected which sensitively responsive to biological factors such as inflammations.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As soon as the degradation of the bone splint <b>5</b> with its attachment screws <b>6</b> is supposed to proceed, the polarization voltage U<sub>out </sub>must be lowered or turned off entirely. For this, it is sufficient if the connection line <b>18</b> between control device <b>7</b> and bone splint <b>5</b> is interrupted, using a small operation. As soon as it is certain that polarization voltage is no longer required, the control device <b>7</b> is explanted.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the reference electrode <b>11</b> allows measuring the voltage U<sub>REF </sub>that is actually applied, in this connection, which is compared with the desired voltage U<sub>in</sub>. If U<sub>REF </sub>and U<sub>in </sub>are different, the desired sameness is achieved by means of a corresponding adaptation of the voltage U<sub>out </sub>by means of the amplifier <b>19</b>. Furthermore, the control device <b>7</b> can have a telemetric data transmission unit <b>12</b> which can be used to collect measurement data concerning the status of the functional implant, in other words, essentially of the bone splint <b>5</b> by means of sensors, not shown in any detail, and transmit the measurement data to an external base unit <b>13</b>. From there, control data for controlling the voltage U<sub>in </sub>generated by the battery <b>8</b> and thus the polarization voltage U<sub>out</sub>, both with regard to its value and the time progression, can be input. Accordingly, the polarization voltage U<sub>out </sub>can also be turned off entirely, by way of a switch <b>14</b> of the control device <b>7</b>. A complete Home Monitoring System can be implemented with these functionalities.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of the implant system <b>4</b> in which a depot implant <b>15</b>, having multiple depot chambers <b>16</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>16</b>.<b>2</b>, is provided as the functional implant. These chambers are filled with different active substances, in each instance, and closed off with a cover <b>17</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>17</b>.<b>2</b> composed of different degradable metal materials. The covers <b>17</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>17</b>.<b>2</b> in turn are connected with a control device <b>7</b> of the type explained hereinabove using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, which can generate a polarization voltage U<sub>out </sub>between the counter-electrode <b>11</b> and the covers <b>17</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>17</b>.<b>2</b> to control the degradation behavior of the covers <b>17</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>17</b>.<b>2</b>. Accordingly, release of the active substances in the depot chambers <b>16</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>16</b>.<b>2</b> can be adjusted in a defined manner.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the degradation behavior of degradable metal materials can be explained as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Cathodic corrosion protection can be achieved in two ways:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0050">a) by means of the use of sacrificial anodes, or</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0051">b) by means of external current anodes, i.e., outside current anodes (ICCP or Impressed Cathodic Current Protection).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">In the case of method a), a very reactive ancillary metal is directly connected to the metal to be protected. In this connection, the ancillary material forms the anode of the system. The difference of the free corrosion potentials between the anode and the material to be protected causes a current flow through the electrolyte coming from the anode. The potential difference is determined by means of the relative position of the metals used in the electrochemical voltage series in the electrolyte used.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">The external current technique shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, according to method b), is generally used for protection of buried pipelines and on ship hulls that are exposed to seawater. In this connection, a direct current circuit is used to apply an electrical current to the metallic structure. The minus pole of the power source RF is connected with the metal that is supposed to be protected. The plus pole is connected with an additional anode AN that is situated in the same medium in order to close the circuit. The electrical current charges the structure with excess electrons and thereby changes the electrode voltage to the negative direction until the immunity region has been reached. In this connection, it is important that the anode AN and the cathode KA are completely separate from one another so that a flow of current through the medium between the electrodes of the anode to the cathode can take place. The function of the reference electrode RE is to monitor the electrode voltage of the protected structure, a buried pipeline in the case of this example, in order to ensure that the immunity region is reached. The reference electrode RE is designed in such a manner that it has a constant potential and no current flows by way of it. The rectifier DC-R acts as a voltage supply part and is employed so that the potential of the structure is sufficiently negative to reach the immunity region, which is regulated by the reference electrode RE.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a depot system similar to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this regard, reference can be made to the description there. In contrast to this, partial or also complete coating or mantling of the entire implant system, or even only of parts of it, is provided. Possibilities for this are polymers as well as metallic and ceramic layers or layer systems <b>20</b>. In this connection, coatings or layer systems <b>20</b> that are degradable in vivo are preferably used on the functional implant <b>15</b>, while coatings or layer systems <b>20</b> that are not degradable in vivo can also be used on the side of the control device <b>7</b> and the connection lines <b>18</b>, so that these parts of the implant system can be explanted again later.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">Furthermore, the coatings <b>20</b> can be designed in such a manner that the coatings can release at least one therapeutic agent or multiple therapeutic substances or pharmacologically active substances having one or more time progressions.</p>
