<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and system for anchoring a geomembrane liner. More particularly, one or more embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and system of anchoring a geomembrane liner by providing an anchor member in the ground and then securing the geomembrane liner to the anchor member.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Geomembrane lining systems are used for a variety of decorative and containment applications, including ponds for both commercial and residential uses, waterfalls, streams, irrigation canals, storm water retention ponds, agricultural pits and ponds, and landfill covering systems. Geosynthetic liner systems offer a number of advantages over alternative liners, including, for example, secure water containment, enhanced water quality control, cleaning and disinfection capabilities, erosion protection, gas permeability, rapid and easy installation, low maintenance costs, long life, and easy repairs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Geomembrane liners G are conventionally installed using trenches T to secure the liner in position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the case of a pond or canal, the liner may be positioned in the recess or channel that will contain the water, and extend over the bank and into a trench that extends around the periphery of the recess. In the case of landfill covering systems, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, trenches may be dug in the soil S that covers the trash X. After the geomembrane liner G has been positioned in the trench, dirt or other filler D is provided over the membrane to fill the trench T, thereby preventing the geomembrane liner from further movement.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many instances, due to concerns relating to movement and uplift of the geomembrane, anchor trenches must be dug to a depth of between 4 and 5 feet in order to adequately secure the geomembrane liner in place. In addition to being labor intensive and time consuming, digging trenches of this depth in landfill covering installations may also be complicated by a lack of adequate dirt covering the garbage and trash contained within the landfill. In these cases, where less than 4 or 5 feet of covering soil has been provided over the landfill, the trenches will unearth the garbage and trash that the covering system is designed to contain. However, shallower anchor trenches may be ineffective at maintaining the geomembrane liner in the desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another disadvantage associated with trench anchor systems is that dirt or other filler must be provided over the membrane and in the trench to anchor the membranes. Stated differently, it is not possible to leave the geomembrane entirely exposed when a trench anchor system is used. This results in reduced volume of trash stored within a landfill, and makes repairing the geomembrane difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is a need for a method and system of anchoring geomembrane liners to resist relatively high uplift forces while not requiring the digging of deep trenches.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One or more embodiments of the present invention provide a containment system including an anchor member positioned substantially below a ground surface; and a geomembrane liner positioned over the ground surface and the anchor member, the geomembrane liner being secured to the anchor member.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One or more embodiments of the present invention are directed toward a geomembrane lining system that covers a ground surface. In certain embodiments, the geomembranes are a component of a water containment system. In other embodiments, the geomembranes are part of a hazardous waste or landfill containment system. It should be appreciated, however, that the anchoring system of the present invention may be used in conjunction with any geomembrane containment system. In one or more embodiments, an anchor member may be provided in a hole with a top surface exposed in the ground surface, and a geomembrane may be secured to the anchor member to retain the membrane in a desired location and position. In certain embodiments, dirt or other covering material may then be provided over the geomembrane to further secure the geomembrane in place. In other embodiments, the geomembrane may be left exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A geomembrane containment system according to one or more embodiments of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-5</figref> and is generally indicated by the numeral <b>10</b>. The containment system <b>10</b> includes a ground surface <b>12</b> that, prior to installation of the containment system, forms the upper-most exposed layer of an area. In the case of a landfill, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, ground surface <b>12</b> is the upper-most exposed area of a layer of dirt or soil overfill <b>14</b> that is provided over the trash or garbage <b>16</b> that fills the landfill.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one or more embodiments, ground surface <b>12</b> over which containment system <b>10</b> is installed may be generally level. In other embodiments, ground surface may include a low grade slope. In still other embodiments, ground surface <b>12</b> may include a steep slope. In yet other embodiments, ground surface <b>12</b> may include a basin or recess in which water may be retained to form a pond or reservoir. In each case, the installation and anchoring of the containment system according to the concepts of the present invention is substantially the same.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Prior to placement of a geomembrane liner <b>18</b> over ground surface <b>12</b>, at least one hole <b>20</b> is created in overfill layer <b>14</b>.

In a preferred embodiment, the hole <b>20</b> is provided with a depth sufficient to accommodate the anchor member, discussed below, while being shallow enough to position the top surface of the anchor member proximate to ground surface <b>12</b>. The hole <b>20</b> may also be adapted to accommodate multiple anchor members.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">While at least one hole <b>20</b> is provided in each geomembrane containment system <b>10</b>, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any number or pattern of holes may be used in order to secure geomembrane liner <b>18</b> over ground surface <b>12</b>. The number, arrangement, and pattern of holes <b>20</b>, and thus anchor members, provided in a containment system <b>10</b> may be impacted and influenced by a number of factors including, for example, the purpose of the containment system (i.e., pond or landfill cover), the soil type, the terrain, local weather patterns, anticipated uplift forces, and any other design considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one or more embodiments, where containment system <b>10</b> is designed to hold water, hole <b>20</b> may be provided in the form of a trench around the perimeter of a basin or recess in which the water will be retained. In other embodiments, a plurality of holes <b>20</b> may be spaced around the perimeter of the basin or recess. In one or more embodiments, where containment system <b>10</b> is installed over a landfill, holes <b>20</b> may be provided in the form of trenches around the perimeter of the area, as well as in spaced parallel arrangement across the surface area of the area to be covered. In other embodiments, a plurality of holes <b>20</b> may be spaced across the surface of the area to be covered. It is also contemplated that holes <b>20</b>, and the anchor members <b>22</b>, therein may be strategically positioned at locations of high uplift forces.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Practice of the present invention is not necessarily limited by the selection of a particular geomembrane. The geomembrane, which may also be referred to as a geomembrane liner, may include any of those geomembranes currently employed in the art. In one or more embodiments, geomembrane <b>18</b> may be a thermoset material. In other embodiments, geomembrane <b>18</b> may be a thermoplastic or thermoformable material.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one or more embodiments, geomembrane <b>18</b> may be EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene-terpolymer) based. In other embodiments, geomembrane liner <b>18</b> may be TPO (thermoplastic-olefin) based. In yet other embodiments, geomembrane liner <b>18</b> may be PVC (polyvinyl chloride) based.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one or more embodiments, an anchor member <b>22</b> is positioned at or near the bottom of the hole <b>20</b> prior to placement and positioning of geomembrane liner <b>18</b>. Anchor member <b>22</b> may be in any desired form of shape so long as it provides sufficient weight to resist movement of geomembrane liner <b>18</b> and the uplift forces acting thereon. Once placed in hole <b>20</b>, anchor member <b>22</b> is back-filled so that it is positioned within the ground and so that top surface <b>25</b> is positioned proximate to ground surface <b>12</b> and exposed through ground surface <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one or more embodiments, anchor member <b>22</b> may have a generally I-shaped cross-section and may be provided in the form of a beam as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In these or other embodiments, anchor member <b>22</b> may be provided in segments that are joined end to end to cover substantially all of the bottom surface of a trench <b>20</b>. In still other embodiments, anchor member <b>22</b> may be provided in the form of columns (not shown) having a top surface exposed at the ground surface <b>12</b>, and a length extending vertically downward into hole <b>20</b> in overfill layer <b>14</b>. Although several examples are provided herein, the invention should not be limited to any specific type or configuration of anchor member <b>22</b>, unless so claimed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one or more embodiments, anchor member <b>22</b> may be made of concrete. In these embodiments, anchor member <b>22</b> may be preformed, or may be formed on site within hole <b>20</b>. It is also contemplated that an anchor member <b>22</b> formed on-site may be continuous along the length of a hole <b>20</b>. In other embodiments, anchor member may be made of any suitable material known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, steel or other metals.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Anchor member <b>22</b> may include one or more fastening plates <b>24</b> on a top surface <b>25</b> thereof. Fastening plate <b>24</b> is secured to anchor member <b>22</b> and includes a mechanism for securing geomembrane liner <b>18</b> thereto. Fastening plate <b>24</b> may be secured to anchor member <b>22</b> by any method or mechanism known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by using mechanical fasteners. In other embodiments, fastening plate <b>24</b> may be set into an uncured concrete anchor member <b>22</b> and thereby formed integrally with the anchor member. In one or more embodiments, fastening plate <b>24</b> may extend continuously along the top surface <b>25</b>. In other embodiments, a plurality of fastening plates <b>24</b> may be spaced along the top surface <b>25</b> of anchor member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one or more embodiments, fastening plate <b>24</b> may be a double sided adhesive layer. In other embodiments, fastening plate <b>24</b> may be a metal plate having apertures therethrough to receive mechanical fasteners. In still other embodiments, fastening plate <b>24</b> may include a substrate <b>27</b> and a top layer <b>26</b>. The substrate <b>27</b> may be any material capable of providing strength and rigidity to the fastening plate <b>24</b>, such as, for example, steel. Top layer <b>26</b> may be an adhesive or a heat weldable material.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Geomembrane liner <b>18</b> may be secured to fastening plate <b>24</b> by any method or mechanism known to those skilled in the art. Where a heat weldable layer is provided on fastening plate <b>24</b>, geomembrane <b>18</b> may be heat welded thereto. After positioning geomembrane liner <b>18</b> over anchor member <b>22</b> and fastening plate <b>24</b>, heat may be applied from the top surface of geomembrane liner <b>18</b> to secure the liner to heat weldable layer <b>26</b>. In one or more embodiments, the geomembrane liner <b>18</b> may be welded to adhesive layer <b>26</b> by an induction welding tool. Where a pressure sensitive adhesive is provided on fastening plate <b>24</b>, geomembrane <b>18</b> may be secured thereto by applying pressure from above.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one or more embodiments, dirt or other covering <b>28</b> may be provided and over membrane <b>18</b> to further secure it in place. Covering <b>28</b> may include any desired material known to those skilled in the art and suitable for providing ground cover and for anchoring membrane <b>18</b>. In certain embodiments, covering <b>28</b> may be dirt. In these or other embodiments, covering <b>28</b> may be the same material as overfill <b>14</b>. In one or more embodiments, containment system <b>10</b> may be devoid of any covering <b>28</b> over membrane <b>18</b>, thereby leaving substantially all of geomembrane liner <b>18</b> exposed. An exposed containment system <b>10</b> may be used in a variety of ways such as, for example, a location for a field of solar panels.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An alternative embodiment of a containment system according to the concepts of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref> and is indicated generally by the numeral <b>100</b>. Containment system <b>100</b> is similar in most respects to containment system <b>10</b> but includes an alternative anchoring member <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The anchor member <b>122</b> is provided to secure the geomembrane <b>18</b> over the ground surface <b>12</b> and prevent any substantial movement thereof. Anchor member <b>122</b> is a ground anchor including a main body portion <b>124</b> having a leading edge <b>125</b> adapted to be driven into the ground, a trailing edge <b>126</b> with an outturned lip, and an attachment point <b>128</b> intermediate the leading edge <b>125</b> and trailing edge <b>126</b>. The anchor member also includes a cable, rod, or guide wire <b>129</b>, hereinafter collectively referred to as a cable, secured at one end to the attachment point <b>128</b> and at an opposite end adjacent to ground surface <b>12</b> to a fastening plate <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">After the body portion <b>124</b> has been driven into the ground, pressure applied to the cable causes the outturned lip to engage the surrounding soil, thereby causing the body portion to rotate. Once rotated, the body portion of the ground anchor resists removal, even under high forces applied to the cable, such as by wind uplift forces acting upon a geomembrane liner. The cable <b>129</b> may be secured to the attachment point <b>128</b> and the fastening plate <b>130</b> by any method or mechanism known to those skilled in the art. Similar ground anchors suitable for use in the present invention are known to those skilled in the art, and are described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,789,594 and 6,237,289, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The fastening plate <b>130</b> is adapted to be secured to geomembrane liner <b>118</b>, thereby anchoring the geomembrane liner against movement any substantial movement relative to ground surface <b>12</b>. In one or more embodiments, fastening plate <b>130</b> may include an adhesive tape on a top surface thereof, the adhesive tape adapted to adhere to the geomembrane liner <b>18</b>. In other embodiments, fastening plate <b>130</b> may be a metal plate having an aperture therethrough to receive mechanical fasteners extending through geomembrane liner <b>18</b>. In certain embodiments, a flashing patch (not shown) may be positioned over the mechanical fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In still other embodiments, fastening plate <b>130</b> may include a coating <b>132</b>. In one or more embodiments, the coating <b>132</b> may be a heat weldable material covering at least the top of the substrate. In containment systems including a thermoplastic or heat weldable geomembrane liner <b>18</b>, the heat weldable coating <b>132</b> allows for heat welding of the geomembrane liner <b>18</b> to the fastening plate <b>130</b>. As an example, the UltraPly TPO Invisiweld Plates commercially available from Firestone Building Products, which are intended for use in TPO roofing systems, may be used as fastening plates <b>130</b> in containment system <b>100</b>. The Invisiweld Plates are coated with TPO to allow heat welding of thermoplastic roofing membranes to be heat welded to the plates. The plate <b>130</b> may be made of any material providing strength and rigidity such as, for example, galvanized metal. While the Invisiweld Plates from Firestone Building Products are references as a suitable example of a fastening plate <b>130</b>, it should be appreciated that fastening plates <b>130</b> may be provided in a variety of shapes and sizes, and with any known heat weldable material as the coating.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In use, the anchor members <b>122</b>, or ground anchors, are first driven into the ground using conventional techniques so that the fastening plates <b>130</b> are positioned approximately at the ground surface <b>12</b>. The geomembrane liner <b>18</b> may then be positioned over the fastening plates <b>130</b>, and the geomembrane liner <b>18</b> may then be secured to the fastening plates <b>130</b> from the top surface of the liner. In a containment system where mechanical fasteners are used to secure the geomembrane liner <b>18</b> to the fastening plate <b>130</b> the fasteners may be driven into the fastening plate <b>130</b> from the top of the geomembrane liner. In the case of fastening plates having adhesive thereon, pressure may be applied to the top surface of the geomembrane liner <b>18</b> at the locations of the fastening plates <b>130</b>. In the case of fastening plates having a heat weldable coating, an induction welding tool may be used to heat weld the geomembrane liner <b>18</b> to the fastening plate <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An anchoring system and method as described herein may provide improved performance in a geomembrane liner system, while also reducing the time and labor involved in site preparation. Furthermore, the anchoring system of the present invention may allow for secure and stable installation of geomembrane liner systems in locations where installation would not be possible using prior art methods. The system and method of the present invention also allow for an exposed geomembrane liner, where desired.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Various modifications and alterations that do not depart from the scope and spirit of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art. This invention is not to be unduly limited to the illustrative embodiments set forth herein.</p>
