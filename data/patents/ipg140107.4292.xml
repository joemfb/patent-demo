<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The priority of Korean patent application No. 10-2010-0060054 filed on Jun. 24, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference, is claimed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a non-volatile memory device, and more specifically, to a technology for measuring a read cell current in a non-volatile memory that performs a sensing operation using a current.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Memory devices can be classified as either a volatile memory device or a non-volatile memory device. A non-volatile memory device includes a non-volatile memory cell capable of preserving stored data even when it is not powered. For example, a non-volatile memory device may be implemented as a flash random access memory (flash RAM), a phase change random access memory (PCRAM), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The PCRAM includes a memory cell that is implemented using a phase change material such as germanium antimony tellurium (GST). If heat is applied to the GST, it changes to a crystalline phase or an amorphous phase, thereby storing data in the memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A non-volatile memory device (e.g., a magnetic memory, a phase change memory (PCM), or the like) has a data processing speed similar to that of a volatile RAM device. The non-volatile memory device also preserves data even when power is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate a conventional phase change resistor (PCR) element <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the PCR element <b>4</b> includes a top electrode <b>1</b>, a bottom electrode <b>3</b>, and a phase change material (PCM) layer <b>2</b> located between the top electrode <b>1</b> and the bottom electrode <b>3</b>. If a voltage and a current are applied to the top electrode <b>1</b> and the bottom electrode <b>3</b>, a current signal is provided to the PCM layer <b>2</b>, and a temperature of the PCM layer rises, such that an electrical conductive status of the PCM layer <b>2</b> changes depending on resistance variation. In this case, the PCM layer <b>2</b> may be generally formed of AgInSbTe. The PCM layer <b>2</b> uses chalcogenide, main components of which are chalcogen elements (e.g., S, Se and Te). In more detail, the PCM layer <b>2</b> may be formed of a germanium antimony tellurium alloy (Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>) composed of Ge&#x2014;Sb&#x2014;Te.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate a phase change principle of the conventional PCR element <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, if a current less than a threshold value flows in the PCR element <b>4</b>, the PCM layer <b>2</b> has a temperature suitable for a crystalline phase. Therefore, the PCM layer <b>2</b> changes to the crystalline phase, which has a low-resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, if a current greater than the threshold value flows in the PCR element <b>4</b>, the PCM layer <b>2</b> has a temperature higher than a melting point. Therefore, the PCM layer <b>2</b> changes to an amorphous phase, which has a high-resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, the PCR element <b>4</b> can store data corresponding to two resistance phases as non-volatile data. For example, if the PCR element <b>4</b> has a low-resistance phase set to data &#x2018;1&#x2019; and the PCR element <b>4</b> has a high-resistance phase set to data &#x2018;0&#x2019;, the PCR element <b>4</b> may store two logic states for data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, a phase of the PCM layer (i.e., a phase change resistive material) <b>2</b> does not change even when the phase change memory device is powered off. This allows the aforementioned data to be stored as non-volatile data.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a write operation of a conventional PCR cell.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a current flows between the top electrode <b>1</b> and the bottom electrode <b>3</b> of the PCR element <b>4</b> for a predetermined time, heat is generated. Therefore, the PCM layer <b>2</b> changes from a crystalline phase to an amorphous phase in response to the heat applied to the top electrode <b>1</b> and the bottom electrode <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this case, assuming that a low current flows in the PCR element <b>4</b> for a predetermined time, a crystalline phase is formed by a low-temperature heating state, such that the PCR element <b>4</b> serving as a low-resistance element enters a set state. Otherwise, assuming that a high current flows in the PCR element <b>4</b> for the predetermined time, an amorphous phase is formed by a high-temperature heating state, such that the PCR element <b>4</b> enters a reset status. Thus, a difference between two phases is represented by a variation in electrical resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, in order to write the set state during a write operation mode, a low voltage is applied to the PCR element <b>4</b> for a long period of time. On the other hand, in order to write the reset state during the write operation mode, a high voltage is applied to the PCR element <b>4</b> for a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a structural diagram illustrating a read path of a conventional phase change memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the conventional phase change memory device includes a unit cell C, a column switching unit <b>10</b>, and a sense amplifier (sense-amp) <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this case, the unit cell C is coupled between a word line WL and a bit line. The column switching unit <b>10</b> is coupled between the bit line of the unit cell C and an input/output (I/O) line SIO, so that it is controlled by a column selection signal. The column switching unit <b>10</b> is selectively turned on in response to the column selection signal, so that it controls a connection between the bit line and the I/O line SIO.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Only one signal from among a plurality of column selection signals is activated in an active operation mode, so that a unit cell C coupled to a corresponding bit line is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The sense amplifier <b>11</b> is coupled to the I/O line SIO, amplifies a sensing current of the unit cell C, and thus outputs a sensing signal SAOUT.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The aforementioned conventional phase change memory device detects a difference in resistance of the unit cell C selected by the column switching unit <b>10</b> using a current, and amplifies the detected resistance difference using the sense amplifier <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When measuring a current for a read operation mode, the conventional phase change memory device uses a method disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as can be seen from the sensing signal SAOUT, a read operation is repeated several times. Some points (e.g., points P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> and P<b>3</b>) selected from among the sensing signal SAOUT are established, and the sensing signal SAOUT obtained from the points P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> and P<b>3</b> are averaged. A read current is measured using the average result.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, the above-mentioned read current measurement method includes a current sensed in a read state, a current sensed in a standby state, and other current components in the average resultant value. Therefore it is impossible for the aforementioned read current measurement method to accurately measure the read current.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing a non-volatile memory device that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An embodiment of the present invention relates to a non-volatile memory device that measures a current generated in a read operation under the condition that an enable time of a sense amplifier is latched, measures a current flowing in the remaining parts other than a cell by mandatorily turning off a column switching unit selecting the cell, and correctly measures a cell current generated in the read operation using a difference between two measurement results.</p>

The column switching unit <b>100</b> is coupled between the bit line of the unit cell C and an I/O line SIO, so that it is controlled by a column selection signal YS. The column switching unit <b>100</b> is selectively turned on in response to the column selection signal YS, so that it controls connection between the bit line and the I/O line SIO.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an active operation mode, only one of several column selection signals YS is activated, so that the unit cell C coupled to the corresponding bit line is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The sense amplifier <b>110</b> is coupled to the I/O line SIO, and a sensing current of the unit cell C is amplified in response to a sense-amplifier enable signal SAEN, so that the sense amplifier <b>110</b> outputs a sensing signal SAOUT.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The latch unit <b>120</b> receives a latch control signal L_CON and a test code signal TUSAEN as input signals, so that it controls a latch operation of the column selection signal YS. The latch unit <b>130</b> controls a latch operation of the sense-amplifier enable signal SAEN upon receiving the test code signal TUSAEN and a sense-amplifier control signal SACON.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this case, the test code signal TUSAEN is adapted to activate the latch operation of the latch units <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> during a test mode.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The column controller <b>140</b> outputs the latch control signal L_CON to the latch unit <b>120</b> upon receiving a column switch-off signal TYSWOFF and a column control signal YCS. The column controller <b>140</b> includes inverters IV<b>1</b> and IV<b>2</b> and a NAND gate ND<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The NAND gate ND<b>1</b> performs a NAND operation between an inverted signal of the column switch-off signal TYSWOFF output from the inverter IV<b>1</b> and the column control signal YCS, and outputs the NAND operation result. The inverter IV<b>2</b> inverts an output of the NAND gate ND<b>1</b>, so that it outputs the latch control signal L_CON to the latch unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The above-mentioned non-volatile memory device detects a difference in resistance of the unit cell C selected by the column switching unit <b>100</b> using a current, and amplifies the detected resistance difference using the sense amplifier <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to an embodiment of the present invention, when the non-volatile memory device measures a current in a read operation, it uses a method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">That is, the sensing signal SAOUT of the sense amplifier <b>110</b> is output under the condition that the sense-amplifier enable signal SAEN is latched for a predetermined time according to an operation of the latch unit <b>130</b>. Therefore, if the test code signal TUSAEN is activated to a high level, the sense-amplifier enable signal SAEN of the latch unit <b>130</b> continuously maintains an activation state, so that the sensing signal SAOUT of the sense amplifier <b>110</b> continuously maintains an enable state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this case, the latch unit <b>120</b> may latch the column selection signal YS for a predetermined time upon receiving the test code signal TUSAEN and the latch control signal L_CON. Therefore, if the test code signal TUSAEN is activated to a high level, the column selection signal YS continuously maintains an activation state such that the column switching unit <b>100</b> continuously maintains a turn-on state.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Therefore, the non-volatile memory device according to the present invention measures a current generated in a read operation under the condition that the sense-amplifier enable signal SAEN input to the sense amplifier <b>110</b> and the column selection signal YS input to the column switching unit <b>100</b> are latched for the predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thereafter, the column switching unit <b>100</b> is mandatorily turned off in response to the column selection signal YS, so that a current flowing in a circuit located at the exterior of the unit cell C is measured.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">That is, while the read current of the unit cell C is measured, the column switch-off signal TYSWOFF is deactivated to a low level. Accordingly, the latch control signal L_CON goes to a high level, so that the latch unit <b>120</b> performs the latch operation and the column switching unit <b>100</b> is turned on in response to the column selection signal YS.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">On the other hand, in order to measure the current flowing in the circuit located at the exterior of the unit cell C, it is necessary for the column switching unit <b>100</b> to be turned off so as to cut off a read path of the unit cell C. Accordingly, if the column switch-off signal TYSWOFF is activated to a high level, the latch control signal L_CON is deactivated to a low level. As a result, the latch operation of the latch unit <b>120</b> is terminated, and the column selection signal YS is deactivated to a low level, so that the column switching unit <b>100</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In conclusion, a first read current value, which is measured when the sense amplifier <b>110</b> is latched under the condition that the column switching unit <b>100</b> is turned off, is subtracted from a second read current value, that is measured when the sense amplifier <b>110</b> is latched under the condition that the column switching unit <b>100</b> is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this way, by measuring of a difference between the current in the read operation of the unit cell C and the current flowing in another circuit in the remaining operations other than the read operation of the unit cell C, it is possible to correctly measure the current flowing only in the unit cell C during the read operation.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In other words, the present invention can measure a current encountered in the latched sensing signal SAOUT even though the read operation is not repeated several times. After the lapse of a predetermined initial delay time, some points (e.g., points P<b>4</b>&#x2dc;P<b>8</b>) are established, and a read current encountered in the sensing signal SAOUT is measured at the points P<b>4</b>&#x2dc;P<b>8</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The sense amplifier <b>240</b> is coupled to the input terminal SAI, amplifies a sensing current of the unit cell C in response to a sense-amplifier enable signal SAEN, and outputs a sensing signal SAOUT.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The read signal controller <b>260</b> controls activation timing points of the precharge signal SAIPRE and the clamping signal CLMBL upon receiving a read control signal R_CON.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The latch unit <b>280</b> latches the sensing control signal CLMBLS for a predetermined period of time, and outputs the latched result to the NAND gate ND<b>3</b>. In this case, the sensing control signal CLMBLS is a seed signal generated from a sense amplifier timing logic (not shown) such that it can control the clamping signal CLMBL and the precharge signal SAIPRE related to the operation of the sense amplifier <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A method for operating the non-volatile memory device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> will hereinafter be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, if the sensing control signal CLMBLS for controlling the operation of the sense amplifier <b>240</b> is activated, the latch unit <b>280</b> latches the sensing control signal CLMBLS for a predetermined period of time. Under this condition, if the test code signal TUSAEN is deactivated to a low level, the read control signal R_CON is deactivated to a low level.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">If the read control signal R_CON is low in level, the read signal controller <b>260</b> performs a general read operation. That is, the read signal controller <b>260</b> activates the clamping signal CLMBL and the precharge signal SAIPRE for a predetermined period of time, and thus the sense-amplifier enable signal SAEN is activated for a predetermined read interval.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, if the test code signal TUSAEN is activated to a high level, the read control signal R_CON is activated to a high level. If the read control signal R_CON is activated to a high level, both the clamping signal CLMBL and the precharge signal SAIPRE are latched such that a predetermined level is maintained without any change.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Therefore, if the test code signal TUSAEN is activated to a high level, the sense-amplifier enable signal SAEN continuously maintains an activation state, so that the sensing signal SAOUT acting as the output of the sense amplifier <b>240</b> continuously maintains an enable state.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this case, the latch unit <b>210</b> latches the column selection signal YS upon receiving the test code signal TUSAEN and the latch control signal L_CON. Therefore, if the test code signal TUSAEN is activated to a high level, the column selection signal YS continuously maintains the activation state so that the column switching unit <b>200</b> can continuously maintain the turn-on state.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Therefore, the present invention can measure the current encountered in a read operation under the condition that the sense-amplifier enable signal SAEN input to the sense amplifier <b>240</b> and the column selection signal YS input to the column switching unit <b>200</b> are latched for a predetermined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thereafter, the column switching unit <b>200</b> is mandatorily turned off in response to the column selection signal YS, so that it measures a current flowing in the circuit located at the exterior of the unit cell C.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In other words, when measuring the read current of the unit cell C, the column switch-off signal TYSWOFF is deactivated to a low level. Therefore, the latch control signal L_CON goes to a high level, so that the latch unit <b>210</b> performs a latch operation and the column switching unit <b>200</b> is turned on in response to the column selection signal YS.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As described above, the present invention recognizes a difference between one current measured in the read operation mode of the unit cell C and the other current flowing in another circuit in the remaining operation modes other than the read operation mode, so that it can correctly measure a current that flows only in the unit cell C during the read operation.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As apparent from the above description, a non-volatile memory device according to the embodiments of the present invention measures a current generated in a read operation under the condition that an enable time of a sense amplifier is latched, measures a current flowing in the remaining parts other than a cell by mandatorily turning off a column switching unit selecting the cell, and correctly measures a cell current generated in the read operation using a difference between two measurement results.</p>
