<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to lens fabrication and designing, more specifically, Micromirror Array Lens (Micromirror Array Lens) fabrication and designing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Optical systems are part of everyday life. The optical systems are found in virtually everywhere including in small portable electronics (e.g. digital camera, camcorder, camera phone, webcam), office supplies (e.g. printer, scanner, fax machine), surveillance systems, toys, quality control systems, laboratory and observatory equipments (e.g. telescope, microscope), medical equipments (e.g. endoscope), etc. The conventional lenses used in the optical systems continually face challenge of balancing image quality and production cost. The spherical lenses are widely used since they can be relatively easily fabricated with low cost. The optical systems using them, however, tend to suffer from the aberration problem and in turn produce low quality images. A sort of aspherical lenses configured to remove or reduce aberration can be used for improving image quality. However, the fabricating process of aspherical lenses is time consuming, complicated, and expensive, which hinder the wide use of the aspherical lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another challenge in the conventional lenses is to make them large. Conventional Fresnel type lenses are a good solution to make large lenses without handling large and heavy materials. However, the image quality of the Fresnel lens is not as good as that of the conventional lens.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To overcome the difficulties in fabricating conventional lenses, lenses using new fabrication methods have been introduced. Gradient index lenses are one example. Instead of using geometrical variation, the variation of refractive index is used to give the same effect in making a lens. Using the refractive index of material and geometrical variation together, the aberration of the optical system can be reduced. Although the gradient index lens gives the significant reduction of the aberration, it is still expensive and difficult to fabricate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the rapid growth of the MEMS technology, wide variety MEMS applications have been developed. One of well known application of the MEMS technology is micromirror devices using a plurality of micromirrors; for example, Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) used in the DLP (Digital Light Processing) projection devices. The DMD is an array of several hundred thousand micromirrors, wherein each individual micromirror has the same structure with one another and works as an on-off optical switch. With the success of the DMD technology, many efforts have been made to improve the micromirror devices to provide more advanced features such as multiple step motions, multiple degree of freedom motion, and simple actuation mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These advance features can be advantageously used to overcome the difficulties in fabricating conventional lenses. One exemplary micromirror device using these features is a Micromirror Array Lens reproducing conventional lenses. The Micromirror Array Lens comprises a plurality of micromirrors configured to have multiple step motions in multiple degrees of freedom and forms at least one optical surface profile by controlling the motions of the micromirrors. Each optical surface profile of the Micromirror Array Lens reproduces a conventional lens. The Micromirror Array Lens can be used as a variable focal length lens having multiple optical surface profiles. The Micromirror Array Lens with variable focal length lens and the properties of the Micromirror Array Lens can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,970,284 issued Nov. 29, 2005 to Kim, U.S. Pat. No. 7,031,046 issued Apr. 18, 2006 to Kim, U.S. Pat. No. 6,934,072 issued Aug. 23, 2005 to Kim, U.S. Pat. No. 6,934,073 issued Aug. 23, 2005 to Kim, U.S. Pat. No. 7,161,729 issued Jan. 9, 2007 to Kim, U.S. Pat. No. 6,999,226 issued Feb. 14, 2006 to Kim, U.S. Pat. No. 7,095,548 issued Aug. 22, 2006 to Cho, U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,438 issued Jul. 3, 2007 to Cho, U.S. Pat. No. 7,267,447 issued Sep. 11, 2007 to Kim, U.S. Pat. No. 7,274,517 issued Sep. 25, 2007 to Cho, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/426,565 filed Jun. 26, 2006, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/743,664 filed May 2, 2007, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/933,105 filed Oct. 31, 2007, all of which are incorporated herein by references. Typically, the micromirrors in the Micromirror Array Lens have the same structures with one another, wherein the structure is configured to provide a micromirror with multiple step motions. This structure is favorable when the Micromirror Array Lens reproduces multiple conventional lenses or a variable focal length lens.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Instead of producing multiple optical surface profiles, the Micromirror Array Lens can be configured to reproduce a single conventional lens or a fixed focal length lens as well. Each micromirror has a required motion to form a given optical surface profile but the required motion for one micromirror can be different from the required motions of others. When each micromirror is made to have the same structure, the structure still has to be configured to provide each micromirror with multiple motions just like the case of reproducing a variable focal length lens because each micromirror has a different required position. This can make the Micromirror Array Lens have unnecessarily complicated structure and require a control circuitry to control the motions of the micromirrors. In order to simplify the fabrication process and operation, the structure of the micromirror can be customized to have only the required motion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The fixed focal length Micromirror Array Lens has a lot of advantages and can solve many problems in fabricating the conventional lenses. First, the fabrication process of the Micromirror Array Lens is size independent. Since the Micromirror Array Lens uses standard semiconductor fabrication processes, making process of the Micromirror Array Lens is only dependent on the substrate wafer size. If the size of the lens is less than that of substrate wafer, then fabrication process is the same. Second, different kinds of lenses can be fabricated together. While fabricating the conventional lenses, the curvature of the lens determines the fabrication capability. Thus, only one kind of lens can be fabricated together. While fabricating the Micromirror Array Lenses, many different kinds of the Micromirror Array Lenses can be fabricated together. Third, since the Micromirror Array Lens is an adaptive optical element, the aberration of the optical system can be corrected by introducing the Micromirror Array Lens. Each micromirror can be designed to correct the aberration problem of the optical system. Fourth, mass productivity is a major advantage of the Micromirror Array Lens. Since Micromirror Array Lens is fabricated by using standard semiconductor procedures, the mass production of lenses can be easily achieved. Also, since the Micromirror Array Lens is arranged in a flat surface, the Micromirror Array Lens reduces the size of the optical system and also critically reduces the problems of mounting optics. And last, the fixed focal length Micromirror Array Lens has a great advantage over variable focal length Micromirror Array Lens. Since the structure of the micromirror can be simplified, the fabrication becomes extremely simple. Also the production cost is so low that the fixed focal length Micromirror Array Lens can substitute the conventional lens in the optical systems.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide a new fabrication and designing method for Micromirror Array Lenses overcoming obstacles of the conventional lenses. Fabricating a lens is very difficult depending on its size, surface profile, material properties (index of refraction) and shape. The present invention of the Micromirror Array Lens with self-tilted micromirrors provides a new method of lens fabrication virtually independent of its size, surface profile, and shape. Also, since the Micromirror Array Lens is a reflective type lens, the material properties are not a barrier for fabricating a lens any more.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">By introducing a surface profile shape memory, a Micromirror Array Lens can form a designed optical surface profile to function as a lens. The surface profile shape memory remembers a designed optical surface profile for the Micromirror Array Lens and the designed optical surface profile is formed after fabricating the Micromirror Array Lens. The Micromirror Array Lens with self-tilted micromirrors is fabricated with a surface profile shape memory. After fabrication of the Micromirror Array Lens, the Micromirror Array Lens forms a lens with a fixed focal length. The forming process of the designed optical surface profile after fabrication is a great advantage of the surface profile shape memory. The forming process of the Micromirror Array Lens is accomplished either while the micro-mechanical elements are released by removing sacrificial layers or while the initial operation of the Micromirror Array Lens. Once the designed optical surface profile is formed, the property of the Micromirror Array Lens is fixed and the Micromirror Array Lens performs its function of a lens.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a low cost lens to replace the current commercial lens optics. With mass productivity of semiconductor technology, the Micromirror Array Lens with self-tilted micromirrors can be manufactured with low cost. Thanks to the easy variation of the Micromirror Array Lens, the Micromirror Array Lens having a designed optical surface profile can be easily designed and fabricated by the mass production process.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A great advantage of the present invention is that the Micromirror Array Lenses having different designed optical surface profiles can be made with the same fabrication process including all processing conditions since the Micromirror Array Lens forms its own designed optical surface profile after fabrication, Even in the same wafer, many different Micromirror Array Lenses can be fabricated altogether. All the Micromirror Array Lenses have their own surface profile shape memories and form corresponding designed optical surface profiles and finally function as lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A Micromirror Array Lens with self-tilted micromirrors comprises a plurality of self-tilted micromirrors and configured to form a designed optical surface profile by self-tilted micromirrors. The self-tilted micromirror of the present invention comprises a substrate, at least one stiction plate configured to be attracted to the substrate by adhesion force, a micromirror plate having a reflective surface, coupled to the stiction plate elastically and configured to have a required motion when the stiction plate is attracted to the substrate, and at least one pivot structure disposed between the substrate and the micromirror plate and configured to provide a tilting point or area for the motion of the micromirror plate. The designed optical surface profile determines the required motion of the micromirror plate and a surface profile shape memory is built in the structure of the micro-mechanical elements of the self-tilted micromirrors so that each micromirror plate has the required motion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The stiction plate is disposed between the substrate and the micromirror plate and connected to the micromirror plate elastically by at least one micromirror plate spring structure. The micromirror plate spring structure can be a torsional spring structure or a flexible beam allowing stiction plate to have a relative rotational motion with respect to the micromirror plate. When the stiction plate is attracted to the substrate, the micromirror plate spring structure is configured to be deformed until the stiction plate contacts the substrate. The micromirror plate spring structure is configured to reduce or minimize the bending of the stiction plate and/or the micromirror plate. The self-tilted micromirror can further comprise at least one micromirror plate post configured to provide a space between the micromirror plate and the stiction plate and connecting the micromirror plate and the micromirror plate spring structure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The pivot structure provides a space between the substrate and the micromirror plate to allow the motion of the micromirror plate and a portion of the pivot structure becomes a tilting point or area for the motion of the micromirror plate when the stiction plate is attracted to the substrate. The pivot structure can be disposed on the substrate and configured to contact the micromirror plate when the stiction plate is attracted to the substrate. Also, the pivot structure can be disposed on the micromirror plate and configured to contact the substrate when the stiction plate is attracted to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The stiction plate is configured to be attracted to the substrate by adhesion force; for example, adhesion surface forces. As the size of the self-tilted micromirror decreases to micro-scale, the surface-to-volume ratio increases. Therefore, the effects of surface forces such as capillary force, van der Waals force, atomic bonding force, and electrostatic force by residual charge become significant. In conventional MEMS devices, these adhesion surface forces pose non-trivial problems such as unwanted stiction or collapse of the micro-mechanical elements. The present invention utilizes these adhesion surface forces advantageously to make the self-tilted micromirror have a required motion. In order to increase the amount of the adhesion surface forces, the stiction plate is configured to have a large surface area. Also, a passivation layer can be deposited on the substrate in order to increase the adhesion force.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">One of the adhesion surface forces is the capillary force. The capillary action occurred due to liquid used in the releasing process of the micro-mechanical elements. The capillary action is caused by adhesive intermolecular force between different substances. The liquid left in the releasing process of the micro-mechanical elements adheres to the substrate and stiction plate and draws the stiction plate toward to the substrate. During the drying process, the amount of the liquid between the substrate and the stiction plate decreases and so further does the distance between substrate and the stiction plate. The capillary action can initiate the attraction of the stiction plate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition to capillary action, stiction force including other adhesion surface forces such as van der Waals force, atomic bonding force, and electrostatic force by residual charge are generated. Although the liquid is eventually dried up, these stiction forces keep attracting the stiction plate toward the substrate and eventually make the surfaces of the substrate and the stiction plate contact. The substrate and stiction plate remain in contact if the stiction force is strong enough to overcome restoring force of the deformed micro-mechanical elements of the self-tilted micromirror including the micromirror plate spring structure. The micromirror plate spring structure is configured to be flexible enough such that the stiction force overcomes restoring force caused by the deformation of the micromirror plate spring structure. Then, the micromirror plate can have a fixed position without applying any external force.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The stiction plate is attracted to the substrate in the releasing process of the micro-mechanical elements. The stiction plate is attracted to the substrate in the initial operation of the self-tilted micromirror. The linear and angular position of the micromirror plate remains fixed by the adhesion force after the motion of the micromirror plate.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to connect the substrate and the other micro-mechanical elements, the self-tilted micromirror can further comprise at least one support structure. The support structure is disposed on the substrate and connected to the stiction plate elastically. The self-tilted micromirror can further comprise at least one substrate spring structure connecting the stiction plate and the support structure. The substrate spring structure is configured to be stiff enough to hold the micro-mechanical elements in place at the perturbation and flexible enough such that the stiction force can overcome restoring force caused by the deformation of the micromirror plate spring structure and the substrate spring structure to enable the stiction plate to contact the substrate. The pivot structure can be disposed on the micromirror plate and configured to contact the support structure when the stiction plate is attracted to the substrate. Also, the pivot structure can be the support structure configured to contact the micromirror plate when the stiction plate is attracted to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">To avoid unwanted stiction problems between the micromirror plate and other micro-mechanical elements, the self-tilted micromirror can further comprise at least one dimple structure disposed between the stiction plate and the micromirror plate and configured to provide a space between the stiction plate and the micromirror plate. The dimple structure prevents unnecessary contact between the micromirror plate and other micro-mechanical elements of the self-tilted micromirror.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The linear and angular position of the micromirror plate after the releasing process can be predetermined by the design process of the geometry of the self-tilted micromirror. In some case, the motion of the micromirror plate is determined by the contact points between the micromirror plate and the pivot structure and the contact points between the substrate and stiction plate. In some other cases, the motion of the micromirror plate is determined by the contact points between the pivot structure and the substrate and the contact points between the substrate and stiction plate. To change these contact points, the geometry of the micro-mechanical elements of the self-tilted micromirror can be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the design process of the Micromirror Array Lens, the required optical surface profile of the Micromirror Array Lens is designed. This designed optical surface profile determines the required motion of each micromirror plate. The surface profile shape memory is built in the structure of micro-mechanical elements of the self-tilted micromirrors in the Micromirror Array Lens so that the micromirror plates can have the required motions to form a designed optical surface profile. The required motions of the micromirror plates determine the sizes of the micromirror plates. Also, the required motions of the micromirror plates determine the sizes and/or positions of the pivot structures.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The designed optical surface profile is formed by the adhesion force between the stiction plates and the substrate in the Micromirror Array Lens while releasing the micro-mechanical structures of the Micromirror Array Lens. Also, the designed optical surface profile can be formed by the initial operation of the Micromirror Array Lens. The Micromirror Array Lens has the fixed designed optical surface profile by the stiction force between micro-mechanical elements and is used as a fixed focal length lens.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, an array of self-tilted micromirrors can form a plurality of Micromirror Array Lenses, wherein the self-tilted micromirrors are divided into parts and each part forms a different Micromirror Array Lens having designed a optical surface profile.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Conventional reflective optical elements should have non-flat surfaces to have an optical power. On the contrary, the designed optical surface profile of the Micromirror Array Lens is formed and arranged in a flat surface. The Micromirror Array Lens can have an optical power of a non-flat surface optical element even if it is formed in the flat surface. Each self-tilted micromirror in the Micromirror Array Lens has its own translational (linear) and rotational (angular) motion to have an optical power of the non-flat surface optical element. Alternatively, the Micromirror Array Lens can be formed and arranged in a surface with a curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To form a good lens, two conditions must be satisfied. One is the convergence condition that every light should be converged into a focal point. And the other is the phase matching condition that the phase of the converged light should be the same. In a conventional lens, the phase matching condition is that all the light passing through a lens should have the same optical path length to the focal point. But Micromirror Array Lens uses the periodicity of the light to satisfy the phase matching condition. Since the same phase condition occurs periodically, the phase matching condition can be satisfied even though the optical path length is different. Each micromirror plate in the Micromirror Array Lens can be configured to satisfy the phase matching condition and the convergence condition.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Since the Micromirror Array Lens with the designed optical surface profile functions as a lens, the designed optical surface profile is prepared to satisfy the convergence condition to form a lens. Also, the designed optical surface profile is prepared to satisfy the phase matching condition to form a lens. The convergence and phase matching conditions are satisfied by the structure of the micro-mechanical elements in the Micromirror Array Lens.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Since the Micromirror Array Lens is a kind of adaptive optics, the Micromirror Array Lens can correct aberration of an optical system. The designed optical surface profile of the Micromirror Array Lens is prepared to correct aberration of the optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The optical focusing power of the Micromirror Array Lens is determined by the properties of the designed optical surface profile. The Micromirror Array Lens can reproduce conic surfaces, aspherical surfaces, and anamorphic aspherical surfaces. Also, the Micromirror Array Lens reproduces a free surface. Further, the Micromirror Array Lens can reproduce discrete surfaces. The Micromirror Array Lens reproduces a Fresnel type reflective lens. Also, the Micromirror Array Lens reproduces a diffractive optical element.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each micromirror plate in the Micromirror Array Lens can have its own translational and rotational motions to form a lens. The required rotational motion of the micromirror plate is determined to satisfy the convergence condition of the lens and the required translational motion is determined to satisfy the phase matching condition of the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The Micromirror Array Lens with self-tilted micromirrors of the present invention has many advantages including: (1) the lens with surface profile shape memory provides an easy fabrication of lens system; (2) fabrication of the lens is size-independent; (3) fabrication of the lens is surface profile or shape independent; (4) fabrication of the lens is material independent; (5) the surface profile of the lens is formed after fabrication; (6) the lens can be manufactured with a low cost; (7) different shape or size lenses can be fabricated together; (8) the lens is an adaptive optics; (9) aberration of the system can be corrected; and (10) the lens has a simple structure.</p>

In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.

A self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b> of the present invention comprises a plurality of micro-mechanical elements including a substrate <b>12</b>, at least one stiction plate <b>13</b> configured to be attracted to the substrate <b>12</b> by adhesion force, a micromirror plate <b>14</b> coupled to the stiction plate <b>13</b> elastically and configured to have at least one motion when the stiction plate <b>13</b> is attracted to the substrate <b>12</b>, and at least one pivot structure <b>15</b> disposed between the substrate <b>12</b> and the micromirror plate <b>14</b> and configured to provide a tilting point or area P for the motion of the micromirror plate <b>14</b>, wherein the motion of the micromirror plate <b>14</b> is determined by the geometry of the micro-mechanical elements of the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> show the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b> before and after the motion of the micromirror plate <b>14</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The stiction plate <b>13</b> is disposed between the substrate <b>12</b> and the micromirror plate <b>14</b> and connected to the micromirror plate <b>14</b> elastically by at least one micromirror plate spring structure <b>16</b>. The micromirror plate spring structure <b>16</b> can be a torsional spring structure or a flexible beam allowing stiction plate <b>13</b> to have a relative rotational motion with respect to the micromirror plate <b>14</b>. When the stiction plate <b>13</b> is attracted to the substrate <b>12</b>, the micromirror plate spring structure <b>16</b> is configured to be deformed until the stiction plate <b>13</b> contacts the substrate <b>12</b>. The micromirror plate spring structure <b>16</b> is configured to reduce or minimize the bending of the stiction plate <b>13</b> and/or the micromirror plate <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The pivot structure <b>15</b> provides a space between the substrate <b>12</b> and micromirror plate <b>14</b> to allow the motion of the micromirror plate <b>14</b> and a portion of the pivot structure <b>15</b> becomes a tilting point or area P for the motion of the micromirror plate <b>14</b> when the stiction plate <b>13</b> is attracted to the substrate <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The stiction plate <b>13</b> is configured to be attracted to the substrate <b>12</b> by adhesion force; for example, adhesion surface forces. As the size of the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b> decreases to micro-scale, the surface-to-volume ratio increases. Therefore, the effects of surface forces such as capillary force, van der Waals force, atomic bonding force, and electrostatic force by residual charge become significant. In conventional MEMS devices, these adhesion surface forces pose non-trivial problems such as unwanted stiction or collapse of the micro-mechanical elements. The present invention utilizes these adhesion surface forces advantageously to make the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b> have a required motion. In order to increase the amount of the adhesion surface forces, the stiction plate <b>13</b> is configured to have a large surface area. Also, a passivation layer can be deposited on the substrate <b>12</b> in order to increase the adhesion force.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">One of the adhesion surface forces is the capillary force. The capillary action occurred due to liquid used in the releasing process of the micro-mechanical elements. The capillary action is caused by adhesive intermolecular force between different substances. The liquid left in the releasing process of the micro-mechanical elements adheres to the substrate <b>12</b> and stiction plate <b>13</b> and draws the stiction plate <b>13</b> toward to the substrate <b>12</b>. During the drying process, the amount of the liquid between the substrate <b>12</b> and the stiction plate <b>13</b> decreases and so further does the distance between substrate <b>12</b> and the stiction plate <b>13</b>. The capillary action can initiate the attraction of the stiction plate <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition to capillary action, stiction force including other adhesion surface forces such as van der Waals force, atomic bonding force, and electrostatic force by residual charge are generated. Although the liquid is eventually dried up, these stiction forces keep attracting the stiction plate <b>13</b> toward the substrate <b>12</b> and eventually make the surfaces of the substrate <b>12</b> and the stiction plate <b>13</b> contact. The substrate <b>12</b> and stiction plate <b>13</b> remain in contact if the stiction force is strong enough to overcome restoring force of the deformed micro-mechanical elements of the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b> including the micromirror plate spring structure <b>16</b>. The micromirror plate spring structure <b>16</b> is configured to be flexible enough such that the stiction force overcomes restoring force caused by the deformation of the micromirror plate spring structure <b>16</b>. Then, the micromirror plate <b>14</b> can have a fixed position without applying any external force.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In order to connect the substrate <b>12</b> and the other micro-mechanical elements, the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b> can further comprise at least one support structure as will be shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G-2J</figref>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">To avoid unwanted stiction problems between the micromirror plate <b>14</b> and other micro-mechanical elements, the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b> can further comprise at least one dimple structure disposed between the stiction plate <b>13</b> and the micromirror plate <b>14</b> and configured to provide a space between the stiction plate <b>13</b> and the micromirror plate <b>14</b> as will be shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>. The dimple structure prevents unnecessary contact between the micromirror plate <b>14</b> and other micro-mechanical elements of the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The motion of the micromirror plate <b>14</b> is determined by the contact points P between the micromirror plate <b>14</b> and the pivot structure <b>15</b> and the contact points between the substrate <b>12</b> and stiction plate <b>13</b>. To change these contact points, the geometry of the micro-mechanical elements of the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b> can be varied; for example, the size of the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b>, the size, position, and number of the pivot structure <b>15</b>, and so on. The linear and angular position of the micromirror plate after the releasing process can be predetermined by the design process of the geometry of the self-tilted micromirror <b>11</b>.</p>

Alternatively, the stiction plates <b>103</b>A and <b>103</b>B can be configured to have at least one hole MA and MB so that the pivot structure <b>105</b>A and <b>105</b>B can contact the substrates <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B or the micromirror plates <b>104</b>A and <b>104</b>B through the holes MA and MB as shown in the self-tilted micromirrors <b>101</b>A and <b>101</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> illustrate the principle of the Micromirror Array Lens. To be a good lens, the lens must satisfy two conditions. One is the convergence condition that all light rays scattered from one point of an object should converge into one point of an image plane. The other is the phase matching condition that all converging light rays should have the same phase at the image plane. To satisfy the lens conditions, the surfaces of conventional reflective lenses are formed to have all light rays scattered by one point of an object be converged into one point of the image plane and have the optical path length of all converging light rays be the same. The Micromirror Array Lens satisfies these conditions in a different way. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic diagram showing the principle of a Micromirror Array Lens. The Micromirror Array Lens <b>111</b> comprises a plurality of micromirrors <b>112</b> and replaces an ordinary single-bodied optical surface <b>113</b>. The Micromirror Array Lens <b>111</b> forms a reflective Fresnel lens or a diffractive Fresnel lens that satisfies the focusing properties of the ordinary single-bodied optical surface <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since each micromirror has the same function as a mirror, the reflective surface of the micromirror is made of metal, metal compound, multi-layered dielectric material, or other materials with high reflectivity such as aluminum coated with multi-layer dielectric material, aluminum coated with antioxidant, silver coated with multi-layer dielectric material, silver coated with antioxidant, gold, and gold coated with multi-layer dielectric material. The surface of the micromirror can be made to have high reflectivity using many known microfabrication processes.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The micromirrors in the Micromirror Array Lens can have various shapes including fan shape, triangular shape, rectangular shape, square shape, hexagonal shape, and circular shape depending on the geometry of the optical element that the Micromirror Array Lens reproduces. A Micromirror Array Lens comprising fan shape micromirrors is appropriate to reproduce revolution symmetric free surfaces. A Micromirror Array Lens comprising square or rectangular shape micromirrors is appropriate to reproduce line symmetric free surfaces. Also, a Micromirror Array Lens comprising triangular or hexagonal shape micromirrors is appropriate to reproduce rotational symmetric free surfaces such as with six-fold rotational symmetry or with arbitrary shape and/or size.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a Micromirror Array Lens <b>121</b> forming optical surface profiles to satisfy convergence condition and/or phase matching condition. The optical surface profile of the Micromirror Array Lens <b>121</b> comprising micromirrors <b>122</b> is configured to satisfy the convergence condition, wherein arbitrary scattered light rays <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> are converged into one point C on an image plane by the translational and/or rotational motions of each micromirror. Also, the optical surface profile of the Micromirror Array Lens <b>121</b> is configured to satisfy the phase matching condition, wherein the phases of all converging light rays at the converging point C on the image plane are adjusted to be the same by the translational and/or rotational motion of each micromirror <b>122</b>. Even though the optical path lengths of light rays <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> converged by the Micromirror Array Lens <b>121</b> are different from those of an equivalent conventional reflective lens, the same phase condition is satisfied by adjusting the phases of light rays <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> because the phase of light is periodic. The required maximum translational displacement is at least half wavelength of light.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is desired that each of the micromirrors <b>122</b> has a curvature because the ideal shape of a conventional reflective lens has a curvature. If the size of the flat micromirror <b>122</b> is small enough, the aberration of the lens comprising flat micromirrors <b>122</b> is also small enough. In this case, the micromirror <b>122</b> does not need a curvature. The micromirrors <b>122</b> can be configured to have motions required to make the Micromirror Array Lens <b>121</b> have a focal length f.</p>
