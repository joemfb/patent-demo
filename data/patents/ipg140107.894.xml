<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-247705, filed on Nov. 4, 2010, with the Japanese Patent Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a technology for controlling a flow rate of a liquid, and more particularly, to a technology that makes a plurality of flow rate control units with different controllable flow rate ranges cooperate with each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In manufacturing a semiconductor device, a cleaning system is employed in order to perform a cleaning before diffusion/CVD processing, a cleaning after etching, and a wet etching. The cleaning system has been highly integrated in recent years in order to meet requirements for a small footprint and a high throughput, such that a plurality of cleaning units are included in one cleaning processing system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although an exclusive cleaning liquid supply unit may be installed in each of the cleaning units, a common cleaning liquid supply unit is generally installed with respect to the plurality of cleaning units. A cleaning liquid is generally generated by mixing one kind or a plurality of kinds of highly concentrated chemical solutions with deionized water (DIW). While the cleaning liquid is generated in advance to be stored in a tank, the cleaning liquid may be supplied from the tank as necessary. However, in recent years, the chemical solutions-DIW mixing has been performed at the time of supplying a processing liquid. The plurality of cleaning units is operated according to a predetermined process schedule, and the number of cleaning units using the cleaning liquid varies every moment. There may be a case either only one cleaning unit uses the cleaning liquid, or all cleaning units use the cleaning liquid. In particular, since the chemical solution is highly corrosive, a flow rate control apparatus in which at least a liquid contacting portion is made of a chemical-resistant resin material needs to be used and a flow rate regulation range thereof is generally very narrow. Accordingly, if the number of cleaning units included in one cleaning processing system increases, the flow rate control apparatus for the chemical solution with the narrow flow regulating range has difficulty in dealing with the variations of a flow rate of the required chemical solution.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to user's requirements, one cleaning liquid supply unit may be required to supply a relatively low-concentration cleaning liquid (for example, DHF of HF:DIW=1:200) and a relatively high-concentration cleaning liquid (for example, DHF of HF:DIW=1:10). Further, one cleaning liquid supply unit may be required to supply different types of cleaning liquids (for example, DHF, SC<b>1</b>, and SC<b>2</b>). In this case, the flow rate control apparatus for the chemical solution with the narrow flow regulating range becomes more difficult to deal with variations of the flow rate of the required chemical solution. As an example, the flow rate control apparatus for the chemical solution may have to deal with a wide range in the flow rate of the chemical solution in the range of approximately 10 ml/min to 2800 ml/min.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2003-158122 discloses a technique in which two flow rate controllers having different controllable flow rate ranges and installed in parallel are used in order to supply a liquid raw material in a CVD device. However, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2003-158122 does not at all disclose controlling of two flow rate controllers which can deal with the variations in the required flow rate.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure provides an apparatus for controlling a flow rate of a liquid, including: a plurality of flow rate control units installed in parallel; and a controller configured to control the plurality of flow rate control units so that a total flow rate of liquids that flows on the plurality of flow rate control units becomes equivalent to a required value of a total flow rate to be implemented by the plurality of flow rate control units. In particular, the plurality of flow rate control units include at least a first flow rate control unit and a second flow rate control unit, the first flow rate control unit includes a first flow rate control valve with a first controlled flow rate range, the second flow rate control unit includes a second flow rate control valve with a second controlled flow rate range, the first controlled flow rate range is smaller than the second controlled flow rate range, and a duplicate range is present between the first controlled flow rate range and the second controlled flow rate range. Moreover, the controller is configured to control the first and second flow rate control units to allow the liquid to flow on either one or both of the first and second flow rate control units depending on variation of the required value of the total flow rate, and the controller is configured to control the first and second flow rate control units to increase the flow rate that flows on one of the first and second flow rate control units while maintaining the flow rate on the other of the flow rate control units during the course of increasing the total flow rate of the liquid that flows on the first and second flow rate control units.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawing, which form a part hereof. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawing, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure has been made in an effort to provide an apparatus for controlling a flow rate of a liquid, which can deal with a wide range of required flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A first exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure provides an apparatus for controlling a flow rate of a liquid, including: a plurality of flow rate control units installed in parallel; and a controller configured to control the plurality of flow rate control units so that a total flow rate of liquids that flows on the plurality of flow rate control units becomes a required value of a total flow rate to be implemented by the plurality of flow rate control units. In particular, the plurality of flow rate control units include at least a first flow rate control unit and a second flow rate control unit, the first flow rate control unit includes a first flow rate control valve with a first controlled flow rate range, the second flow rate control unit includes a second flow rate control valve with a second controlled flow rate range, the first controlled flow rate range is smaller than the second controlled flow rate range, and an overlapped range is present between the first controlled flow rate range and the second controlled flow rate range. Moreover, the controller is configured to control the first and second flow rate control units to allow the liquid to flow on either one or both of the first and second flow rate control units depending on variation of the required total flow rate, and the controller is configured to control the first and second flow rate control units to increase the flow rate at one of the first and second flow rate control units while maintaining the flow rate at the other of the flow rate control units during the course of increasing the total flow rate of the liquid that flows on the first and second flow rate control units.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a first aspect of the first exemplary embodiment, while increasing the total flow rate of the first and second flow rate control units from a first state in which the liquid only flows on the second flow rate control unit, when the flow rate of the first flow rate control unit, that corresponds to the total flow rate increases up to a first value within the overlapped range, the controller is configured to control the first and second flow rate control units so that the first state is changed to a second state in which the liquid flows both on the first and second flow rate control units. In this state, the flow rate of the first flow rate control unit decreases and the liquid starts to flow onto the second flow rate control unit so as not to change the total flow rate of the first and second flow rate control units.</p>

Control units <b>21</b> (<b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B, and <b>21</b>C) include pipes <b>27</b> (<b>27</b>A, <b>27</b>B, and <b>27</b>C). Flow meters <b>22</b> (<b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, and <b>22</b>C), flow rate control valves <b>23</b> (<b>23</b>A, <b>23</b>B, and <b>23</b>C) of which opening degrees are controlled by electropneumatic regulators (EV) <b>25</b> (<b>25</b>A, <b>25</b>B, and <b>25</b>C), and opening/closing valves <b>24</b> (<b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B, and <b>24</b>C) including air operation valves, are sequentially installed from the upstream side. In the exemplary embodiment, flow rate control valve <b>23</b> includes a needle valve in which at least a liquid contacting portion is all made of a high chemical-resistant material such as a hydrofluoric resin. Since it is difficult to completely set the flow rate passing through the needle valve to zero (0), opening/closing valves <b>24</b> are closed when the flow rate of each of flow rate control units <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B, and <b>21</b>C is completely zero (0). The flow rate of the chemical solution on pipe <b>27</b> is detected by flow meter <b>22</b>, a detection value is sent to controllers (CNTL) <b>26</b> (<b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B, and <b>26</b>C). Controllers <b>26</b> send control signals to electropneumatic regulators <b>25</b> to achieve a target flow rate received from an upper level controller (MGR) <b>28</b> to control the opening degrees of flow rate control valves <b>23</b>. That is, feedback groups controlling the opening degrees of flow rate control valves <b>23</b> are set to three flow rate control units <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B, and <b>21</b>C, respectively, so that upper level controller <b>28</b> achieves target flow rates set with respect to each of three flow rate control units <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B, and <b>21</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Three flow rate control units <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B, and <b>21</b>C have specifications of flow rate control valves <b>23</b> (<b>23</b>A, <b>23</b>B, and <b>23</b>C) in which controllable flow rate ranges are different from each other. The controllable flow rate ranges refer to flow rate ranges which can achieve the target flow rate as, for example, an error range of &#xb1;1%. A lower limit value of a controllable flow rate range of the resin-made needle valve is approximately one tenth ( 1/10) of an upper limit value. In the exemplified embodiment, the controllable flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A for a small flow rate is in the range of 10 ml/min to 100 ml/min, the controllable flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for a medium flow rate is in the range of 50 ml/min to 500 ml/min, and the controllable flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for a large flow rate is in the range of 250 ml/min to 2500 ml/min. That is, the controllable flow rate ranges of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A for the small flow rate and flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate have an overlapped range, and further, the controllable flow rate ranges of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate and flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for the large flow rate have the overlapped range.</p>

For example, the controlled flow rate range of 15 ml/min to 95 ml/min may be set with respect to flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A for a small flow rate with the controllable flow rate range of 10 ml/min to 100 ml/min. Further, for example, the controlled flow rate range of 10 ml/min to 100 ml/min may be set with respect to flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A for a small flow rate with the controllable flow rate range of 8 ml/min to 120 ml/min. In an exemplary embodiment described below, the controlled flow rate range is set similarly as the controllable flow rate range. Therefore, the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A for the small flow rate is in the range of 10 ml/min to 100 ml/min, the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate is in the range of 50 ml/min to 500 ml/min, and the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for the large flow rate is in the range of 250 ml/min to 2500 ml/min.

Further, one half (&#xbd;) of the upper limit value of the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate is set as the lower limit value of the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for the large flow rate. This relationship is appropriate in implementing a simple control (a detailed description thereof will be made below).</p>

As a result, the opening degree of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B increases to increase the flow rate of the chemical solution passing through flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B to 50 ml/min. That is, while the total flow rate is substantially maintained at 100 ml/min, a state where the flow rate control valve that supplies the chemical solution is only one valve <b>23</b>A is changed to a state in which the flow rate control valve is two valves <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B. In this case, while flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate stands by in an opened state at an opening degree corresponding to the lower limit value of the controlled flow rate range, opening/closing valve <b>24</b>B is able to be opened. However, as described above, opening/closing valve <b>24</b>B is opened while flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate in an opened state at a predetermined opening degree corresponding to a flow rate which is equal to or less than the lower limit value of the controlled flow rate range and the value corresponding to the lower limit value of the controlled flow rate range may be provided as the required flow rate to controller <b>26</b>B. Therefore, a decreasing speed of the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A and an increasing speed of the flow rate of the chemical solution on flows rate control valve <b>23</b>B are close to each other to stabilize the total flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thereafter, with the increase of the total required flow rate, the required flow rate provided to controller <b>26</b>A is immediately increased, and as a result, the opening degree of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A increases again, such that the total flow rate increases over 100 ml/min. In this case, the flow rate is controlled so that the required flow rate provided to controller <b>26</b>B is fixed to 50 ml/min to maintain the flow rate of the chemical solution passing through flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B to 50 ml/min.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A for the small flow rate reaches 100 ml/min which is the upper limit value of the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A (a time t<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the total flow rate reaches 150 ml/min. Continuously, when the total flow rate increases over 150 ml/min, the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A is controlled to be maintained at 100 ml/min by fixing the required flow rate provided to controller <b>26</b>A to 100 ml/min which is the value corresponding to the upper limit value of the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A for the small flow rate. In this state, the required flow rate provided to controller <b>26</b>B is increased, and as a result, the opening degree of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate increases to thereby increase the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the total flow rate reaches 600 ml/min (in this case, the flow rates allotted for flow rate control valves <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B are 100 ml/min and 500 ml/min, respectively), the required flow rate (target value) of 250 ml/min is provided to controller <b>26</b>B. As a result, the opening degree of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B decreases to decrease the flow rate of the chemical solution passing through flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B to 250 ml/min (a time t<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Concurrently, opening/closing valve <b>24</b>C positioned downstream of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for the large flow rate which stands by in an opened state at a predetermined opening degree corresponding to the flow rate which is equal to or less than the lower limit value of the controlled flow rate range is opened and the required flow rate (target value) of 250 ml/min is provided to controller <b>26</b>C. As a result, the opening degree of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C increases to increase the flow rate of the chemical solution passing through flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C to 250 ml/min. That is, while the total flow rate is substantially maintained at 600 ml/min, the state in which two flow rate control valves <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B are responsible for supplying the chemical solution is changed to a state in which three flow rate control valves <b>23</b>A, <b>23</b>B, and <b>23</b>C are responsible for supplying the chemical solution. Thereafter, with the increase of the total required flow rate, the required flow rate provided to controller <b>26</b>B is immediately increased. As a result, the opening degree of the flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B increases again, such that the total flow rate is increased over 600 ml/min. In this case, the flow rate is controlled so that the required flow rate provided to controller <b>26</b>C is fixed to 250 ml/min to maintain the flow rate of the chemical solution passing through flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C at 250 ml/min.</p>

In this case, 100 ml/min is allotted for flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A, 500 ml/min is allotted for flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B, and 250 ml/min is allotted for flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C. Continuously, when the total flow rate increases over 850 ml/min, the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B is controlled to be maintained at 500 ml/min by fixing the required flow rate provided to controller <b>26</b>A to 500 ml/min which is the value corresponding to the upper limit value of the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate. In this state, the required flow rate provided to controller <b>26</b>C is increased. As a result, the opening degree of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for the large flow rate increases to increase the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for the large flow rate. When the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for the large flow rate reaches 2500 ml/min which is the upper limit value of the controlled flow rate range, the total flow rate reaches 3100 ml/min.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the total flow rate of the chemical solution is decreased from the maximum flow rate of 3100 ml/min to the minimum flow rate of 10 ml/min which can be implemented by flow rate control unit <b>20</b>, controls shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are achieved.

When the amount of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for the large flow rate decreases up to 250 ml/min which is the lower limit value of the controlled flow rate range to decrease the total flow rate up to 850 ml/min (a time t<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C is controlled to be maintained at 250 ml/min by fixing the required flow rate provided to controller <b>26</b>C to the value corresponding to the lower limit value of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for the large flow rate.

At the same time or prior to the closing, the required flow rate of 300 ml/min is provided to controller <b>26</b>B. As a result, the opening degree of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate increases to thereby increase the flow rate of the chemical solution passing through flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B up to 300 ml/min (a time t<b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, by combining and using the plurality of flow rate control units <b>23</b> (<b>23</b>A, <b>23</b>B, and <b>23</b>C) with different controlled flow rate ranges, the controlled flow rate range can be variously widened throughout the liquid flow rate control apparatus. Further, by associating and controlling the operations of the plurality of flow rate control units with different controlled flow rate ranges, the flow rate of the liquid flow rate control apparatus can be changed precisely and smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the exemplary embodiment, while increasing the total flow rate of first and second flow rate control units <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B from a first state in which the liquid does not flow on second flow rate control unit <b>21</b>B and the liquid flows on first flow rate control unit <b>21</b>A, when the flow rate (that is, a total flow rate during the first state) of first flow rate control unit <b>21</b>A increases up to a first value (100 ml/min) within an overlapped range (50 ml/min to 100 ml/min) of the controlled flow rate range (10 to 100 ml/min) of first flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A and the controlled flow rate range (50 to 500 ml/min) of second flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B, the first state is changed to a second state in which the liquid flows on first and second flow rate control units <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B. In this case, the flow rate of first flow rate control unit <b>21</b>A decreases (from 100 ml/min to 50 ml/min) and the liquid starts to circulate low onto second flow rate control unit <b>21</b>B so that the total flow rate of first and second flow rate control units <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B is not changed (maintained at 100 ml/min). As a result, before and after the first state is changed to the second state (before and after the total flow rate becomes 100 ml/min), the total flow rate can be smoothly changed. That is, the overlapped range is set to the controlled flow rate ranges of first and second flow rate control valves <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B, and the first state is changed to the second state when the total flow rate is within the overlapped range. As a result, the flow rates which first and second flow rate control valves <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B should achieve immediately after the state changing are within each of the controlled flow rate ranges (the flow rates are, of course, within the controllable flow rate ranges of the flow rate control valves). Therefore, the total flow rate is also high in precision before and after the first state is changed to the second state.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the exemplary embodiment, while decreasing the total flow rate of first and second flow rate control units <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B from the second state, when the total flow rate of first and second flow rate control units <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B decreases up to a second value (60 ml/min) within an overlapped range (60 to 100 ml/min) smaller than the first value (100 ml/min), the second state is changed to the first state. In this case, the flow rate of first flow rate control unit <b>21</b>A is increased (for example, from 10 ml/min to 60 ml/min) and the liquid stops to flow onto second flow rate control unit <b>21</b>B so that the total flow rate of first and second flow rate control units <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B is not changed (maintained at 60 ml/min) As a result, for the same reason as described above, the total flow rate can be smoothly changed before and after the second state is changed to the first state (before and after the total flow rate becomes 60 ml/min) and further, the total flow rate is also high in precision.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The first state and the second state are changed from each other by setting the total flow rate of 100 ml/min as a threshold value (a first threshold value) while increasing the total flow rate of first and second flow rate control units <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B. In contrast, the first state and the second state are changed from each other by setting the total flow rate of 60 ml/min as a threshold value (a second threshold value smaller than the first threshold value) while decreasing the total flow rate of first and second flow rate control units <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B. That is, so called a hysteresis control is achieved. Rapid variation of the controlled flow rate of one flow rate control valve at the time of changing the number of operated flow rate control valves undesirably gives a large burden to the flow rate control valve. While the total flow rate is increasing, if a threshold value which causes a state changing trigger is the same, for example, the total flow rate is 100 ml/min, a target total flow rate increases or decreases frequently around 100 ml/min to cause the burden to one flow rate control valve to be excessively increased, but such problem does not occur in the exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Even in the relationship between second flow rate control unit <b>21</b>B and third flow rate control unit <b>21</b>C, of course, it may be the same as above.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The exemplary embodiment described above is an optimal exemplary embodiment which can be considered in the current situation, but the present disclosure is not limited to the exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the exemplified exemplary embodiment, the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A for the small flow rate is in the range of 10 ml/min to 100 ml/min, the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate is in the range of 50 ml/min to 500 ml/min, and the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>C for the large flow rate is in the range of 250 ml/min to 2500 ml/min. That is, the lower limit value of the controlled flow rate range of the flow rate control valve having the controlled flow rate range for relatively the large flow rate is one half (&#xbd;) of the upper limit value of the controlled flow rate range of the flow rate control valve having the controlled flow rate range for relatively the small flow rate. This is advantageous in that the operation when the first state (only flow rate control unit <b>21</b>A is opened) is changed to the second state (both flow rate control units <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B are opened) becomes very simple. That is, while the flow rate of the flow rate control valve having the controlled flow rate range for relatively the small flow rate increases up to the upper limit value and thereafter, a target value of one half (&#xbd;) of the upper limit value of the controlled flow rate range is provided to the controller of the flow rate control valve. At the same time, a target value corresponding to the lower limit value of the controlled flow rate range is provided to the controller of the flow rate control valve having the controlled flow rate range for relatively the large flow rate. In this state, the liquid starts to flow onto the flow rate control valve to achieve a simple state changing. It is evident that even the changing operation from the second state to the first state becomes very simple similarly. However, even though the relationship of the controlled flow rate range is not established, for example, if the controlled flow rate range of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A for the small flow rate is in the range of 10 ml/min to 100 ml/min and the controlled flow rate range of the flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B for the medium flow rate is in the range of 40 ml/min to 500 ml/min, it is evident that the high precision of the total flow rate can be acquired before and after the first state is changed to the second state (alternatively, a state changing opposite thereto) and the total flow rate can be smoothly changed. Further, even in the relationship between second flow rate control unit <b>21</b>B and third flow rate control unit <b>21</b>C, of course, it may be the same as above.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the exemplary embodiment, when the first state (only flow rate control unit <b>21</b>A is opened) is changed to the second state (both flow rate control units <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B are opened), the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A was increased up to the upper limit value (100 ml/min) of the controlled flow rate range and thereafter, the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A was decreased (from 100 ml/min to 50 ml/min). However, after the flow rate of the chemical solution on flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A is opened at an opening degree corresponding to a value (for example, 90 ml/min) smaller than the upper limit value of the controlled flow rate range, the opening degree of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>A may be decreased (for example, from 90 ml/min to 40 ml/min) Even in this case, it is evident that the high precision of the total flow rate can be acquired before and after the first state is changed to the second state and the total flow rate can be smoothly changed. Further, even when the second state is changed to the first state, it may also be the same as above. In addition, even in the relationship between flow rate control unit <b>21</b>B and flow rate control unit <b>21</b>C, of course, it may be the same as above.</p>

Further, when the second state is changed to the first state, a final required flow rate (an opening degree at the time of closing opening/closing valve <b>24</b>B) provided to controller <b>26</b>B of flow rate control valve <b>23</b>B of flow rate control unit <b>21</b>B also corresponds to the lower limit value (50 ml/min) of the controlled flow rate range. This is advantageous in that the changing operation between the first state and the second state becomes very simple.
