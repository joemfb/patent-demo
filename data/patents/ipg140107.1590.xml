<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Phase filing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 of PCT/EP2009/058134 filed on Jun. 29, 2009; and this application claims priority to Application No. MI2008A001336 filed in Italy on Jul. 23, 2008 under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119; the entire contents of all are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electrical component for low-voltage switching devices, to a method for manufacturing this electrical component, and to an electrical switching device, particularly a switch, or an isolating switch, or a contactor, or similar devices, containing this electrical component.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As is known, switching devices used in low-voltage electrical circuits (i.e. applications with operating voltages of up to 1000V AC/1500V DC), typically switches, isolating switches and contactors, generally referred to as &#x201c;switching devices&#x201d; and hereafter for brevity referred to as switches, are devices designed to enable the correct operation of specific parts of electrical systems and the loads operationally associated with them.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">These switches comprise a casing containing at least one fixed contact and a respective moving contact, which are each connected to a corresponding terminal for input/output connection with the associated electrical circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, the moving contacts of the switches are each connected to the respective terminal by means of a flexible conductor, constituted for example of flexible braids or strips.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Methods used by current technology to manufacture the junctions between the flexible conductor and the moving contact and the terminal are usually based on arc brazing or welding processes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These processes generate high temperatures for relatively long periods in a significant area surrounding the welding zone. This causes annealing phenomena that can affect both the terminal and above all the flexible conductor, with a consequent decline in the mechanical properties of both components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also from the point of view of electrical conductivity, the use of braze welding presents problems due to the presence of brazing substances used for the process but electrically harmful, and to the impossibility of achieving sufficient compactness in the junction zone. In the best cases, the filling factor, i.e. the full/empty ratio in the junction zone, reaches only 85%. The presence of brazing substances and/or discontinuities in the junction zone is manifested in the form of localised increases in electrical resistance, which in the presence of a current are known to lead to unwanted increases in temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, it is difficult to find an industrially feasible alternative to these methods, since they involve joining elements that are morphologically very different.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It must be remembered in particular that the flexible conductors may be subject to strong electro-dynamic phenomena, the energy from which is discharged in the form of tearing along the junction or welding areas of the conductor, which must therefore have a considerable degree of mechanical stability. In addition, the dimensions of the flexible conductor and the connecting terminal may also be relatively extensive, and consequently the welding system must have adequate power.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Alternative solutions include the use of laser welding techniques, which enable the elimination of brazing substances and a reduction in annealing phenomena, but do not significantly improve the filling factor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another known solution is so-called ultrasonic welding, which does not suffer from the annealing problems mentioned above, but is not practical to use given its known power limits.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to provide a solution for the connection of flexible conductors to rigid conducting elements such as terminals, which is a valid alternative to known solutions and will make it possible to achieve overall better performance and improved characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This object is achieved by means of an electrical component for low-voltage switching devices, characterised in that it comprises an electrode comprised of a substantially rigid body with one or more slots and at least one flexible conductor with an end portion inserted into and joined to an associated slot by means of cold plastic deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing an electrical component for low-voltage switching devices, characterised in that it includes the following steps:

<p id="p-0037" num="0040">In the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref>, the seats or slots <b>17</b> are preferably positioned at the common edge <b>18</b> between the upper face <b>11</b> and the front face <b>15</b>. In this case, the slots <b>17</b> are open both on the upper face <b>11</b> and on the front face <b>15</b> and extend for a section into the body <b>10</b> in a direction substantially parallel to the side faces <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the slots <b>17</b> are made and opened only on the front face <b>15</b>. Alternatively, the slots <b>17</b> could be made and opened only on the upper face <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">The electrical component <b>100</b> also comprises at least one flexible conductor <b>1</b>, made for example of one or more braids of copper, or alternatively of flexible blades also made of copper or another equivalent, electrically-conductive material. The flexible conductor <b>1</b> has a specifically shaped end portion <b>2</b> that is inserted into a corresponding slot <b>17</b> and is joined to it by means of cold plastic deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">Advantageously, as illustrated for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, at least part of the walls <b>21</b> between the slots <b>17</b> is clinched onto the associated end portion <b>2</b> inserted into the slot, so that it is covered at least partially and is substantially enclosed within the slot.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Preferably, the electrical component <b>100</b> comprises a plurality of slots <b>17</b>, into each of which the end portion <b>2</b> of a corresponding flexible conductor <b>1</b> is inserted. As indicated above, at least part of the walls <b>21</b> between the slots <b>17</b> is clinched onto the corresponding end portion <b>2</b>; in particular, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the entire junction zone <b>22</b>, i.e. the slots <b>17</b> and intermediate zones between adjacent slots, is preferably clinched or fitted onto the ends <b>2</b> to form a compaction zone between the parts, which in practice creates a deeper bond and welding finish between the flexible conductors <b>1</b> and the electrode <b>10</b>. In practice, the appearance and reduction in surface porosity achieved by this type of junction is much better than that achieved using traditional welding methods. Alternatively, as illustrated for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, it is possible to clinch onto each end portion <b>2</b> only the corresponding slot <b>17</b> zone, without intervening on the intermediate areas between two adjacent slots <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">In a first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</figref>, the flexible conductor <b>1</b> has an end portion <b>2</b> that is inserted into an associated slot <b>17</b> and is joined to the electrode <b>10</b> so as to extend transversely from the rigid body of the latter with respect to the front face <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">In a second embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flexible conductor <b>1</b> has an end portion <b>2</b> that is inserted into an associated slot <b>17</b> and is joined to the electrode <b>10</b> so as to extend transversely from the rigid body of the latter with respect to the upper face <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">This makes it possible to meet different construction needs for the component <b>100</b> inside an electrical switching device.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">Preferably, the slots <b>17</b> comprise at least one wall shaped so as to have a relief zone that can hold part of the material of the end portion <b>2</b> when it is pushed into the slot <b>17</b>. In addition, the slots <b>17</b> comprise at least one wall shaped so as to have an anti-tear zone for the same end portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">In particular, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, the slots <b>17</b> comprise a rear wall <b>19</b> substantially in the shape of a C, thereby creating a bulge that constitutes a relief zone for the material of the end portion <b>2</b> when it is pushed into the slot <b>17</b>; alternatively, as illustrated for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, the rear wall <b>19</b> can have a substantially U-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">The slots <b>17</b> comprise a base wall <b>20</b> that constitutes an anti-tear zone and, seen in a side cross-section, may have a profile completely or partially straight, or otherwise shaped, particularly with a curved profile, or variously undulating or shaped profiles. For example, the base wall <b>20</b> may have a curved profile with a curvature more or less accentuated, or may follow a broken line based on specific applications and construction demands. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>, the base wall <b>20</b> has a concave profile with the concavity facing the upper face <b>11</b> of the slot; in addition, as for example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-9</figref>, at the front face <b>15</b>, the base wall <b>20</b> may have a curved initial section <b>20</b><i>a</i>, with a curvature inverted with respect to the subsequent concave section <b>20</b><i>b</i>, so as to have a undulating, curved wave overall shape.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">A similar anti-tear effect can also be achieved by treating the base wall <b>20</b> with ridges, indentations, or by modifying the conformation of the sides of the walls between the slots <b>17</b> so that they form flaring or expansion zones along their length towards the inside of the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">In a preferred embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref>, the base wall <b>20</b> (seen in cross section) has an indented or square-wave undulating form created by means of at least one indent <b>23</b> sunk into the central part with respect to the ends of the base wall <b>20</b> itself; the edges of this indent may be rounded and/or bevelled as required.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the sides of the walls <b>21</b> (seen from above) have a dovetail configuration with side walls that widen as one moves from the mouth of the front face into the electrode <b>10</b> body.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">Clearly, the non-straight base wall <b>20</b> can also be used in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, just a sit is also possible to use slots <b>17</b> with both the rear wall <b>19</b> and the base wall <b>20</b> perfectly straight, so that the slots <b>17</b> have a substantially L-shape side profile.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">In any case, the overall form of the slots <b>17</b> and the relative walls <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> can derive from any of the combinations mentioned, and may also have forms other than those illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">As indicated above, another aspect of the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing an electrical component <b>100</b> as described above that can be used in low-voltage switching devices. The method according to the invention includes the following steps:</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">a) preparing an electrode <b>10</b> comprised of a substantially rigid body on which there are one or more slots <b>17</b>, as described above;</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">b) preparing at least one flexible conductor <b>1</b> with an end portion <b>2</b> that can be inserted into one of the slots <b>17</b>;</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">c) inserting the end portion <b>2</b> into an associated slot <b>17</b>;</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">d) joining the end portion <b>2</b> to the associated slot <b>17</b> by means of cold plastic deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">In particular, step d) includes a first step d.1) in which a first pressing action is applied to the end portion <b>2</b> of the flexible conductor <b>1</b> so as to press it into the slot <b>17</b> in which it is inserted and create the desired joint.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">In addition, step d.1) is preferably followed by a step d.2) in which a second pressing action is applied to the joint zone between the end portion <b>2</b> and the associated slot <b>17</b>, thus further sealing the electrode <b>1</b> and the flexible conductor <b>2</b>, and clinching at least part of the slot <b>17</b> onto the corresponding end portion <b>2</b>, which is closed inside the slot.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">In this way, a substantially one-piece component <b>100</b> is created in which there is a sort of weld between the flexible conductor <b>1</b> and the electrode <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">Preferably, the first and second pressing actions are performed substantially at the same pressure; this pressure is preferably between 0.5 and 1.5 GPa. In this way, along at least one part of the surfaces of the slots <b>17</b>, there is a sufficiently diffuse penetration between the material of the electrode <b>10</b> and the flexible conductor <b>1</b>, and therefore a large, stable degree of electrical and thermal conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>, these operations can be performed using a suitable hydraulic press, for example a swan-neck press, in which step d.1) can be performed using a comb punch <b>31</b>, and the subsequent step d.2), when performed, can be done using a rectangular punch <b>32</b>. Where necessary, during the punching steps, the bodies of the electrodes <b>10</b> can be held in position, for example on a work bench, by means of clamps or similar devices <b>33</b> that can hold the sides of the electrodes <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">Every electrical component <b>100</b> according to the invention can be used in low-voltage electrical switching devices, such as for example automatic switches, isolating switches, contactors and similar equipment. In particular, the best technical and economical results are found in applications in equipment with high power outputs, such as for example open switches or Air Circuit Breakers (ACB). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates schematically an automatic low-voltage switch comprising a component <b>100</b> according to the invention. Another aspect of the present invention, therefore, is constituted by an electrical switching device for low-voltage applications, characterised in that it comprises at least one electrical component <b>100</b> according to the invention and defined in the corresponding claims.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">It has been seen how the electrical component according to the invention, and the method for its manufacture, fully achieve the object of the invention. In fact, the joint obtained between the electrode <b>10</b> and the flexible conductor <b>1</b> makes it possible to have a component <b>100</b> with excellent characteristics from the point of view both of mechanical and electrical properties. In particular, since the process of joining or welding the two parts is obtained substantially by cold fitting the flexible conductor <b>1</b> into the slot <b>17</b>, problems of annealing of the flexible conductors typical of brazing processes and to a lesser extent of laser processes, are avoided, and the filling factor in the junction zone is definitely superior to that achieved using laser welding techniques. For example, the absence of annealing phenomena allows the flexible conductors to work substantially within the elastic range, reducing gradual breakage due to plastic deformation; in addition, the mechanical strength of the joint is increased, and therefore greater energy is required to cause the forced detachment of the flexible conductor from the connection.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">The method according to the invention can also be inserted in automated production cycles, thus making it possible to produce components <b>100</b> efficiently and relatively economically. In particular, the absence of annealing of the flexible conductor reduces friction and passive resistance to movement, thereby improving the dynamic behaviour of the moving contact in switching devices. Switches comprising the component <b>100</b> have greater electrical efficiency and fewer losses due to the Joule effect, resulting in an increased working life; in addition, the reduction in unwanted heating of the switch limits the process of decay of all thermally-sensitive components of the switch, particularly plastic materials and electronic parts. Lastly, the weld cycle time for cold mechanical deformation (generally referred to also as clinching or calking) is lower than the time required by traditional welding.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">The component <b>100</b> and the relative method for its manufacture thus described are subject to several modifications and variants, all of which fall within the context of the inventive concept as defined in the corresponding claims; for example, the body of the electrode <b>10</b>, the flexible conductor <b>1</b> with the relative end portion <b>2</b>, and the slots <b>17</b>, could have a different shape and/or position.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">In practice, the materials used, provided they are compatible with the specific use, and their dimensions, can vary according to needs and the state of the art.</p>
