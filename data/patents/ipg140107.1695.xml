<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A first exercise shoe assembly constructed according to the principles of the present invention is designated as <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>. Various components of the shoe assembly <b>100</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>. The shoe assembly <b>100</b> includes a shoe body <b>110</b>, at least one support bracket <b>120</b> integrated into the shoe body <b>110</b>, and a resistance device <b>190</b> connected to the support bracket <b>120</b> (via additional components).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The resistance device <b>190</b> is shown by itself in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>. The resistance device <b>190</b> is similar in many respects, including certain aspects of construction, operation, and use, to the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,726,607 to Ihli, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,087,001 to Ihli, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. However, persons skilled in the art will recognize that the resistance device <b>190</b> may operate in a totally different manner without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, an alternative embodiment may be made with a scaled-down version of the isokinetic resistance device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,740 to Loubert et al., which is also incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The resistance device <b>190</b> includes a housing <b>192</b> having a central channel <b>194</b> that extends vertically along the front and back sides and horizontally across the top side. An adjustment knob <b>196</b> is located on the top side to one side of the channel <b>194</b>, and a re-directional bearing <b>198</b> is located on the top side on an opposite side of the channel <b>194</b>. A flexible member or cable <b>199</b> extends from a distal end, disposed outside the housing <b>192</b>, through the re-directional bearing <b>198</b>, to an opposite end portion, wrapped about a sheave. A rewind spring is interconnected between the sheave and the housing <b>192</b> to encourage the flexible member <b>199</b> to wind onto the sheave. On the resistance device <b>190</b>, a band brake arrangement resists removal of the flexible member <b>199</b> from the sheave. On other embodiments, different types of resistance arrangements may be used in the alternative.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The shoe body <b>110</b> includes a front portion <b>112</b>, a heel portion <b>116</b>, and an intermediate portion disposed therebetween. A downwardly opening channel <b>114</b> extends longitudinally along the front portion <b>112</b> to accommodate a removable bracket <b>140</b> in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>. The intermediate portion of the shoe body <b>110</b> includes a block <b>119</b> that is preferably an integral portion of the shoe body sole, and configured and arranged to support and/or accommodate other components of the shoe assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A first channel bracket <b>124</b> is secured to a bottom side of the support bracket <b>120</b>, and is configured and arranged to define a laterally extending channel. A second channel bracket <b>125</b> is secured to a bottom side of the first channel bracket <b>124</b>, and is configured and arranged to define a longitudinally extending channel. A latch <b>130</b> is rotatably mounted on the support bracket <b>120</b>, and extends to a lower distal end that is configured for rotation by a person's thumb and forefinger. The latch <b>130</b> includes an intermediate portion <b>134</b> having diametrically opposite first and second sides that are bounded by cylindrical surfaces, and diametrically opposite third and fourth sides that are bounded by planar surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The removable bracket <b>140</b> may be described as a flat steel bar that has been bent into a configuration having a straight first section and an inverted J-shaped second section <b>149</b> extending perpendicularly away from an end of the straight section. The J-shaped section <b>149</b> cooperates with a proximate portion of the straight section to receive the resistance device <b>190</b>, and the segments of the J-shaped section <b>149</b> fit into respective portions of the channel <b>194</b> in the resistance device housing <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A slot <b>143</b> extends longitudinally into an opposite end of the straight section, and the slot <b>143</b> intersects two spaced apart circular holes <b>144</b><i>a </i>and <b>144</b><i>b </i>extending through respective portions of the straight section. The width of the slot <b>143</b> is wide enough to accommodate the intermediate portion <b>134</b> of the latch <b>130</b> when the flat sidewalls of the intermediate portion <b>134</b> extend parallel to the sidewalls of the slot <b>143</b>, but not wide enough to accommodate the intermediate portion of the <b>134</b> of the latch <b>130</b> when the flat sidewalls of the intermediate portion <b>134</b> extend perpendicular to the sidewalls of the slot <b>143</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>). The diameter of each circular hole <b>144</b><i>a </i>and <b>144</b><i>b </i>is large enough to accommodate the intermediate portion <b>134</b> of the latch <b>130</b> in any orientation.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-20</figref> show components of a resistance device <b>600</b> that is suitable for use on the various shoe assemblies described above. In other words, the resistance device <b>600</b> includes a housing <b>692</b> that may be configured to take the same functional shape of any of the housings <b>192</b>, <b>392</b>, or <b>492</b>. The resistance <b>600</b> also includes a flexible member or resistance cable <b>620</b> that is similarly extracted from the housing <b>692</b> when the extraction force exceeds an adjustable level of resistance, and that is similarly rewound into the housing <b>692</b> when tension in the cable <b>620</b> falls below the rewind force exerted by a spring within the housing <b>692</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the cable <b>620</b> is wound about a sheave <b>680</b>, which in turn, is mounted on a rotatable shaft <b>615</b> via a conventional one-way clutch bearing <b>685</b>. A hub <b>655</b> is rigidly secured to the shaft <b>615</b>, and a steel cylindrical cap <b>656</b> is rigidly mounted on the hub <b>655</b> to define a resistance drum. A stainless steel brake band <b>666</b> is secured about a portion of the cap <b>656</b> with a Kevlar brake strip sandwiched therebetween. The brake band <b>666</b> cooperates with the resistance drum to provide resistance to rotation of the shaft <b>615</b> in either direction.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a coiled rewind spring <b>690</b> is nested within a compartment defined by the sheave <b>680</b>. An inner end of the spring <b>690</b> is anchored to the housing <b>692</b> via a peg <b>608</b>, and an opposite, outer end of the spring <b>690</b> is anchored to the sheave <b>680</b> via a flange <b>682</b>. As a result, the spring <b>690</b> biases the sheave <b>680</b> to rotate in a first rotational direction relative to the shaft <b>615</b> and the housing <b>692</b>. The sheave <b>680</b> rotates together with the shaft <b>615</b> and relative to the housing <b>692</b> in an opposite, second rotational direction in response to extraction of the cable <b>620</b>. Thereafter, when the cable <b>620</b> is released, the rewind spring <b>690</b> rotates the sheave <b>680</b> relative to the shaft <b>615</b> to retract the cable <b>620</b> within the housing <b>692</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A knob <b>630</b> is rotatably mounted on an end of the housing <b>692</b>, and rotates relative to the housing <b>692</b> to adjust the level of resistance associated with the resistance drum. The housing <b>692</b> includes a bracket or frame member <b>616</b> that is preferably a stamped metal part. The frame member <b>616</b> is preferably secured in place between opposing &#x201c;halves&#x201d; of the housing <b>692</b> by means of internal structure on the housing shells, as well as fasteners that secure the halves to one another. A first rivet or other suitable fastener secures a first end of the brake strip <b>665</b> to a first portion of the frame member <b>616</b>. A second rivet or other suitable fastener secures an opposite, second end of the brake strip <b>665</b> to a discrete, second portion of the frame member <b>616</b>. The second rivet also preferably secures an end of the tension band <b>666</b> to the second portion of the frame member <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">An opposite end of the tension band <b>666</b> is secured to a slide block <b>676</b> by means of a separate fastener, which is preferably a screw. The slide block <b>676</b> is threaded onto a bolt <b>677</b>, and the slide block <b>676</b> bears against the frame member <b>616</b> in a manner that prevents rotation while allowing linear travel of the former relative to the latter. The bolt <b>677</b> is rotatably mounted within upper and lower openings in the frame member <b>616</b>. An upper end of the bolt <b>677</b> is keyed to the knob <b>630</b>, and a lower end of the bolt <b>677</b> is rigidly fastened to a nut <b>678</b>. A thrust bearing is preferably disposed between the knob <b>630</b> and the frame member <b>616</b> to accommodate relative rotation therebetween. The foregoing elements cooperate to rotatably mount the bolt <b>677</b> in a specific position relative to the frame. A lower end of the frame member <b>616</b> is configured and arranged to limit downward travel of the slide block <b>676</b> along the bolt <b>677</b>. On an alternative embodiment, a pin or other suitable stop is preferably secured to a lower section of the bolt <b>677</b> to function as the stopping means.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the knob <b>630</b> is rotated in a first direction, tension in the tension band <b>666</b> increases, and when the knob <b>630</b> is rotated in an opposite, second direction, tension in the tension band <b>666</b> decreases. In either case, tension in the brake material <b>665</b> remains relatively unaffected, while compression of the brake material <b>665</b> against the cap <b>656</b> increases or decreases in direct relation to the change in tension in the tension band <b>666</b>. On a working embodiment of the device <b>600</b>, the resulting resistance experienced by a user is smooth and predictable through a range of resistance from 2 to 40 pounds in response to less than two full rotations of the knob <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A re-directional bearing assembly <b>640</b> is movably mounted on top of the housing <b>692</b>, and the cable <b>620</b> is routed through the re-directional bearing assembly <b>640</b> to accommodate extraction of the cable <b>620</b> in any direction having an upward component relative to the top of the housing <b>692</b>. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that the re-directional bearing <b>640</b> is located at one of six available &#x201c;corner locations&#x201d; on the housing <b>692</b>, and furthermore, that it need not occupy an orthogonal or parallel orientation relative to the longitudinal axis of the adjustment bolt <b>677</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A bead or stop <b>624</b> is rigidly secured to an external portion of the cable <b>620</b>, and the bead <b>614</b> is too large to fit through the opening defined by the re-directional bearing assembly <b>640</b>, thereby preventing the distal end of the cable <b>620</b> from becoming lost inside the housing <b>692</b>. A carabineer clip <b>622</b> is connected to an outer distal end of the cable <b>620</b> to releasably connect the cable <b>620</b> to any of various force receiving members, including a conventional force receiving member, such as the handle shown in FIG. 11 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,087,001, for example.</p>
