<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to coffee makers and in particular to a coffee maker utilizing a stream of hot water through tamped ground coffee.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Coffee is generally prepared in a coffee maker by measuring an amount of ground coffee into a coffee filter, closing a lid over the ground coffee, and providing a stream of hot water through the loosely packed ground coffee. Unfortunately, water passes freely through the loosely packed ground coffee and does not obtain the full flavor which might otherwise be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/777,831 filed Jul. 13, 2007 for &#x201c;Pod Adapter System for Single Service Beverage Brewers&#x201d; by the present applicant overcomes this problem by packaging the coffee in closed filter paper commonly called a pod, and inserting the closed pod into a pod holder including a tamping spring and bottom tamper for tamping the pod between the bottom tamper and a coffee holder lid. While the pod adapter of the '831 application works well for coffee pods, it does not allow the simple use of bulk ground coffee not packaged in the closed pod.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention addresses the above and other needs by providing a coffee making apparatus and methods which provide a tamped packing of loose ground coffee thereby obtaining richer flavor. The Coffee maker includes a reservoir, a pump, a heater, and a check valve. Coffee grounds are first loosely deposited in a coffee holder and then tamped onto a compacted state. The coffee holder may be filled loosely with the coffee and then placed into the coffee making apparatus and compacted, or the coffee may be compacted in the coffee holder and then the coffee holder placed into the coffee making apparatus. The compacting may be by a spring or by a resilient solid material and may be part of the coffee holder or part of the coffee making apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided apparatus for tamping coffee. The apparatus includes a coffee maker and a coffee holder. The coffee holder receives a portion of untamped coffee and a holder lid closes the coffee holder after receiving the untamped coffee. A tamper resides inside the coffee holder and limits the portion of the coffee holder interior accessible by the untamped coffee and partially resides outside the coffee holder. The coffee maker includes a coffee maker lid openable to position the coffee holder inside the coffee maker, a coffee holder cavity under the coffee maker lid for receiving the coffee holder. A pad residing on a bottom surface of the coffee maker lid and is configured to reduce the combined vertical space occupied by the coffee holder and tamper to urge the tamper into the coffee holder thereby tamping the coffee. A hot water nozzle is attached to the coffee maker for providing a flow of hot water to the tamped coffee to make a coffee drink.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided apparatus for tamping coffee. The apparatus includes a coffee maker and a coffee holder. The coffee holder has a coffee holder interior space for receiving a portion of untamped coffee and a holder lid closing the coffee holder interior space after receiving the untamped coffee. The coffee maker includes a coffee maker lid openable to position the coffee holder inside the coffee maker and a coffee holder cavity under the coffee maker lid for receiving the coffee holder. A tamper residing in the coffee holder cavity is coupled to the coffee holder lid to advance into the coffee holder interior space when the coffee maker lid is closed. A hot water nozzle attached to the coffee maker for providing a flow of hot water to the tamped coffee to make a coffee drink.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a coffee making system combining a forced flow of heated water forced though tamped coffee, and apparatus and methods for tamping loose coffee for use in the coffee maker.</p>
