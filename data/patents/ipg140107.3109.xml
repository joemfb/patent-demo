<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims foreign priority benefits under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a)-(d) from German patent application ser. no. P 10 2008 017 784.9 filed Apr. 8, 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a device for making a muffle, with which dental restoration parts can be produced with the aid of an embedding compound, at least one press blank and a pressing device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has long been known to use devices to help simplify the production of suitable molds for the production of dental restoration parts. For example, it is known according to DE 539 734 to use what is known as a melting crucible former for forming the lining material, which has a high content of gypsum and to that extent corresponds to a muffle, a substantially conical base plate and a lining ring being used there, the latter as a sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This solution already allows a mold cavity, which is initially modelled in wax as a positive mold, to be created in the muffle, and then serve after curing as a pressing space for the dental restoration.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A comparatively much improved device for making a muffle is known from DE 900 17 40 U1. In the case of this solution, a central mold attachment is provided, which projects from an end wall part and allows models to be grown on its tooth supporting surface. After hardening of the muffle, to provide the dental restoration it is necessary for the mold attachment together with the end wall part to be pulled off, so that a certain strength is necessary there to ensure the desired clean separation of muffle and wax.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Specifically in the case of a cylindrical construction of the mold attachment, this solution requires a certain strength of the mold attachment, and consequently also a comparatively great wall thickness of the mold attachment, which is for example much greater than the wall thickness of the sleeve which surrounds the muffle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To facilitate the pulling out of such a mold attachment, the mold attachment may be turned, and at the same time pulled out. This also facilitates the detachment without impairing or damaging the muffle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, such turning is only possible in the case of circular-symmetrical forms of the mold attachment, and also only when only one mold attachment is provided. In this connection, it has also been proposed to create special pulling devices for the mold attachments that are connected to pulling tools. Although a mold attachment can be removed from the muffle with such a pulling device, the comparatively high forces that must overcome the adhesion between the mold attachment and the muffle put at risk the intactness of the muffle, so that this solution has not been adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, it has also been proposed to design such mold attachments not in a cylindrical manner but in a slightly conical manner, or possibly even slightly spherical, to facilitate demolding. Although this can assist demolding, this solution has also not been adopted, since it is not possible in this way to use the feed channel created in the muffle as a press channel, because otherwise, in view of the conical form, the cylindrical press blank deviates to the side, which leads to serious blockages and in any event means that it is not ensured that dental material in a semifinished state will pass by the sides of the press ram, so that the mold cavity is not completely filled.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, various other attempts have been undertaken to improve the making of muffles. For instance, it has been attempted to increase the diameter, or at least the cross-sectional area, of a press channel, in order also to create larger dental restoration parts, or possibly to create a number of dental restoration parts. However, an increase in the cross-sectional area also requires a correspondingly increased pressing pressure, so that then the wall thickness of the muffle also has to be increased to withstand the increased pressing pressure. Moreover, it has been found that an increased pressing pressure more easily leads to &#x201c;compression&#x201d; of the muffle, and consequently to reduction of the dimensional accuracy, so that, all in all, increasing the cross-sectional area of the press channel has not proven to be a promising prospect.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the invention is based on the object of simplifying and optimizing the production of dental restorations by means of muffles, and of providing for this purpose a correspondingly suitable device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the invention, the &#x201c;parallelization&#x201d; of the press channels results in comparatively little loading of the muffle in spite of good pressing performance and a good pressing displacement per unit of time. In a way similar to how a grid can be subjected to greater structural loading than a forming element with a single large hole, according to the invention the muffle is quite pressure-resistant without the wall thickness having to be increased appreciably. Here, the invention benefits from the fact that flaking off of the muffle can in principle only take place toward the outside, so that the inwardly acting compressive forces compensate for one another.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention, specifically a muffle with quite closely spaced-apart press channels can be created particularly favorably with a special flat-formed muffle insert from which press-channel forming elements protrude.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The press-channel forming elements are particularly thin-walled, so that they can also be readily burned out if they cannot be pulled off from the gypsum in the manner of a skin. The heating above the vaporization point of the material for the press-channel forming elements provides the assurance that the press-channel forming element is removed without leaving any residual material, so that the press channel is available exactly in the desired form.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">If need be, the press-channel forming elements may be created together with a flat-formed portion of the muffle insert, that is to say in one piece, which is then designed with preference likewise in such a way that it can be burned out. The free end face opposite from the flat-formed portion is formed in a closed manner and receives the positive mold of the dental restoration formed in wax. Provided there in a way that is known per se are growing channels, which make it possible for the molten dental ceramic to be advanced into the mold cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the invention, it is ensured by the creation of exactly parallel press channels through the cylindrical press-channel forming elements, which by allowing themselves to be burned out without leaving any residual material ensure corresponding forms, that the press rams for the parallel pressing of the blanks are also guided with little lateral play, but precisely, so that good pressing results can be expected.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the invention, a number of pellets or press blanks of comparatively high weight of the pressing ceramic of at least 20 grams, but if need be even up to 40 grams, which corresponds to a wax weight of 12 grams, can be pressed in parallel. This is so because, according to the invention, it is particularly favorable that the dental restorations grown on the end face of the forming elements according to the invention that are free according to the invention can also be connected to one another, so that it is possible according to the invention to create dental ceramics that are much larger and also technically optimized in terms of pressing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the invention, in this way it is now possible for demanding restoration tasks to be performed in one operation, and consequently much more efficiently than in the case of the previously known muffles, without the feared &#x201c;compression&#x201d; of the muffle material that inevitably occurs at high pressures adversely affecting the accuracy of the restoration result.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It goes without saying that the muffle wall thickness, and consequently the size of the muffle, can be adapted to requirements within wide ranges. Typically, with parallel pressing of, for example, six press channels, the muffle will have a much greater diameter than for example in the case of the solution according to DE 900 17 40 U1, but by no means six times the diameter. Altogether, the parallel processing has to this extent the effect not only of significantly reducing the cycle time of the working process, but in particular also of saving muffle material, provided that parallel creation of a number of dental restorations takes place, as is possible according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention is not restricted to the one-piece creation of the press-channel forming elements with a flat-formed portion of the muffle insert. For example, if need be, the forming elements may also be partially omitted, and the &#x201c;hole&#x201d; remaining as a result in the flat-formed portion of the muffle insert is covered at once, for example with a corresponding plate. By means of corresponding casting inserts, which reduce the effective diameter of the muffle, it is possible to form a muffle of reduced size, with for example only two press-channel forming elements, which can however if need be increased again to the maximum number.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the invention, it is also particularly favorable that the muffle insert is supported by a muffle base, with preference in the flat-formed portion. The muffle base is a reusable part and securely supports the muffle insert from below, so that, when the gypsum-like compound is poured into the sleeve, the flat-formed portion of the muffle insert does not buckle downward.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the invention, it is particularly favorable if the press channels created are spaced apart from one another much less than they are spaced away from the outer wall of the muffle. The spacing between the individual press channels may be reduced for example to just 5 mm, while the spacing with respect to the outside diameter of the muffle, that is to say the &#x201c;wall thickness&#x201d; of the muffle, may for example be more than 2 cm. It is particularly favorable if the flat-formed portion of the muffle insert is securely mounted on the muffle base, for example by positive engagement, but can nevertheless be separated.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With preference, the quite thin-walled muffle insert can be fastened by means of a latching connection on a location of the muffle insert that is spaced away from the flat-formed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With preference, the muffle insert is thin-walled, but hard and to this extent inelastic. For example, its Shore hardness according to DIN 53505 or DIN 7868 may be much greater than that of natural rubber and be for example more than 70&#xb0; A, in particular 75&#xb0; A. This configuration makes it possible to provide alignment of the press channels that is precise in spite of thin walls, with exactly parallel side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">EPM, that is to say ethylene-propylene rubber, with a hardness of 85&#xb0; A, comes into consideration for example, while it goes without saying that, with preference, no fillers should be contained. Polyethylene raw materials with a hard formulation are particularly suitable for this in principle, typically burning without leaving any residual material (cf. also EP 170 40 01).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the invention, it is provided that the wall thickness of the forming elements substantially corresponds to the wall thickness of the flat-formed portion or is up to 90 percent smaller than it and wherein the wall thickness of each forming element corresponds to at least 0.03 times the diameter, with preference at most 0.1 times the diameter, of a forming element. In a further advantageous refinement, it is provided that the muffle insert is formed as a self-supporting or non-self-supporting, one-piece disposable part. In a further advantageous refinement, it is provided that the muffle base stiffens the muffle insert, at least in the region of the flat-formed portion, and the forming elements of the muffle insert are supported on the muffle base.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The device <b>10</b> represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has, apart from other parts, a muffle insert <b>12</b>. The muffle insert <b>12</b> comprises a flat-formed portion <b>14</b> and press-channel forming elements, three press-channel forming elements <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> being provided in the exemplary embodiment represented. However, it is also readily possible in a modified configuration of the device to use any other number of press-channel forming elements, for instance in the range from two to ten forming elements.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The forming elements <b>16</b> to <b>20</b> are centrally arranged, so that they extend around the center of the circular flat-formed portion <b>14</b>. The spacing between the forming elements <b>16</b> and the edge of the flat-formed portion <b>14</b> is much greater, for example by a factor of 2 to 20, than the spacing of the forming elements from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The flat-formed portion <b>14</b> is surrounded by a collar <b>22</b>, which extends downward in the manner of an apron, to be precise by approximately one tenth of the diameter of the muffle insert. A collar <b>22</b> increases the dimensional stability of the muffle insert <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the exemplary embodiment represented, the muffle insert is formed in one piece by the flat-formed portion <b>14</b>, the forming elements <b>16</b>-<b>20</b> and the collar <b>22</b>, to be precise as a disposable part made of a comparatively thin-walled plastic. It goes without saying that, instead of this, the forming elements <b>16</b>-<b>20</b>, may also be detachably mounted on the flat-formed portion <b>14</b>, it being possible for any suitable coupling to be created there.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is also possible in principle to provide a muffle insert with for example six forming elements. If fewer than six dental restoration parts are produced, or if fewer than six forming elements <b>16</b> to <b>20</b> are required, the forming elements may then at once be cut off directly at their attachment to the flat-formed portion <b>14</b>, for example with a knife. The opening exposed in this way can then be covered with a suitable covering plate, which overlaps the opening somewhat and may for example be made of the same material as the muffle insert <b>12</b>. Such covering plates may also have a sealing lip facing the edge of the opening, and it is also possible to fit them from below into the opening <b>24</b> respectively present there. In this case, they are reusable, since they can be pulled off as soon as the gypsum-like compound of the muffle has cured.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The muffle insert <b>12</b> according to the invention is attached on a muffle base <b>26</b>, which muffle base acts in a stiffening manner and is designed in such a way that it supports the muffle insert <b>12</b> over its surface area from below. For this purpose, the muffle base <b>26</b> has a plate <b>28</b> made of a plastic that is for example 1 cm thick, on the outer edge of which a groove <b>30</b> extends. The groove <b>30</b> serves for receiving a projection <b>22</b>, which is provided on the underside of the collar <b>22</b> of the muffle insert <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Also belonging to the device for making a muffle <b>34</b> is a sleeve <b>36</b>, which cylindrically surrounds the muffle <b>34</b> in a way known per se. The sleeve <b>36</b> also overlaps the collar <b>22</b> in the downward direction and is supported on a pedestal <b>38</b> of the muffle base <b>26</b>. The overlapping has the effect that the collar <b>22</b> is also held against the muffle base <b>26</b>, so that, with the sleeve <b>36</b> uncovered, the muffle base <b>26</b> at the bottom insert <b>12</b> are undetachably connected to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that the forming element <b>18</b> is configured differently than the forming elements <b>16</b> and <b>20</b>. It is longer and already partly drawn out downward, so that this embodiment is an embodiment in which the forming elements <b>16</b>-<b>20</b> are otherwise detachable from the muffle insert. The forming element <b>18</b> has a flange <b>40</b>, which lies against the flat-formed portion <b>14</b> from below and is pressed there by the surface-area contact with which the flat-formed portion <b>14</b> rests on the muffle base <b>26</b>. If need be, the relevant forming element <b>18</b> may also be omitted and the relevant opening <b>24</b> covered by the covering plate mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An attachment piece <b>42</b> can also be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Such an attachment piece is to be seen as an alternative solution for the connection between the forming element and the flat-formed portion <b>14</b>. This piece is in one piece with the flat-formed portion <b>14</b> and, when the forming element is fitted in, is passed through by it.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the case of this embodiment with such an attachment piece, the muffle insert <b>12</b> can also be readily pulled off like a skin after hardening of the muffle compound of the muffle <b>34</b>, since the shortness of the axial extent of the piece <b>42</b> prevents it from anchoring in the material of the muffle <b>34</b> to any appreciable extent.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At least the forming elements <b>16</b>-<b>20</b> are formed in such a way that they can be burned out without leaving any residual material. This means that they can remain in the cylindrically formed press channels of the muffle <b>34</b>, but evaporate there. In the case of the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the rest of the muffle insert <b>12</b> additionally evaporates, while in the case of the embodiment with the attachment piece <b>42</b> the muffle insert <b>12</b> can otherwise&#x2014;that is to say apart from the forming elements&#x2014;be pulled off, and to that extent is reusable.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The muffle base <b>26</b> is in any event not intended for being burned out and is always designed as a reusable element. On the other hand, after curing of the muffle, the sleeve <b>36</b> can be peeled off from it in a way known per se, it usually being destroyed in the process.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> how the press channels <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> extend in the muffle <b>34</b> once they have been created by the forming elements <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>. Even if the forming elements <b>16</b>-<b>20</b> can be burned out, it may in an individual case be succeeded in removing them without leaving any residual material, or at least removing them partially from the press channels <b>50</b>-<b>54</b>, specifically as a result of the comparatively small wall thickness of the forming elements <b>16</b>-<b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">How they extend into the muffle <b>34</b> can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in an enlarged representation. They have a somewhat smaller wall thickness than the flat-formed portion <b>14</b> of the muffle insert <b>12</b> and rest with their underside on the muffle base <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Instead of a projection <b>32</b>, which engages in the groove <b>30</b>, an annular projection may also be provided, or a corresponding blind-hole bore may be provided in the muffle base <b>26</b>, intended for the engagement of the projection <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It goes without saying that, instead of this, a projection which engages in a corresponding recess on the collar <b>22</b> may be provided on the muffle base.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">While a preferred form of this invention has been described above and shown in the accompanying drawings, it should be understood that applicant does not intend to be limited to the particular details described above and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, but intends to be limited only to the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims.
