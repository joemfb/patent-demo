<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of fabricating an image sensor may include providing a substrate including light-receiving and non-light-receiving regions; forming a plurality of gates on the non-light-receiving region; ion-implanting a first-conductivity-type dopant into the light-receiving region to form a first dopant region of a pinned photodiode; primarily ion-implanting a second-conductivity-type dopant, different from the first-conductivity-type dopant, into an entire surface of the substrate, using the gates as a first mask; forming spacers on both side walls of the gates; and secondarily ion-implanting the second-conductivity-type dopant into the entire surface of the substrate, using the plurality of gates including the spacers as a second mask, to complete a second dopant region of the pinned photodiode. An image sensor may include the substrate; a transfer gate formed on the non-light-receiving region; a first dopant region in the light-receiving region; and a second dopant region formed on a surface of the light-receiving region.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;&#xa7;120/121 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/798,704, filed on May 16, 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,927,902, which claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2006-0044372, filed on May 17, 2006, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Example embodiments relate to methods of fabricating image sensors and image sensors fabricated by the methods. Also, example embodiments relate to methods of fabricating image sensors and image sensors fabricated by the methods in which the number of masks required to fabricate the image sensors may be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, an image sensor functions to convert an optical image to an electrical signal. With the recent developments in computer industries and communication industries, the demand for image sensors having improved performance is increasing in various fields, including those of digital cameras, camcorders, PCS (Personal Communication Systems), game kits, guard cameras, medical micro cameras, robots, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) image sensor having a simple driving process may be realized through various scanning manners. Further, since a signal processing circuit is integrated in a single chip, the size of a product may be decreased and the cost of fabricating such a sensor may be reduced due to the compatible MOS process technology. Furthermore, the MOS image sensor has very low power consumption, and therefore can be applied to a product having a limited battery capacity. Accordingly, the use of the MOS image sensor is drastically increasing, owing to the technological development thereof and the ability to realize high resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such an MOS image sensor, a light-receiving element is exemplified by a pinned photodiode (PPD) including an n-type dopant region formed in the substrate and a p-type dopant region formed on the surface of the substrate. Here, the n-type dopant region functions as a potential well for accumulating a charge corresponding to the amount of incident light to be absorbed, while the p-type dopant region functions as a potential barrier preventing the flow of the charge, generated by defects on the surface of the substrate, into the n-type dopant region.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, according to a conventional image sensor fabrication method, since an additional mask is required to form the p-type dopant region, it is necessary to perform a plurality of additional processes including the application of a photoresist film, photolithography, and removal of the photoresist film.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference will now be made to example embodiments, which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals may refer to like components throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In example embodiments, the image sensor may be, for example, a complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. However, the image sensor of example embodiments may include any image sensor resulting from the use of a CMOS process, including a negative-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) process, a positive-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (PMOS) process, or both NMOS and PMOS processes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing the image sensor according to an example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image sensor of example embodiments may include a APS array <b>10</b> composed of two-dimensionally arranged pixels each having a light-receiving element, and a peripheral circuit region for operating the APS array <b>10</b>. As such, the peripheral circuit region may include a timing generator <b>20</b>, a row decoder <b>30</b>, a row driver <b>40</b>, a correlated double sampler (CDS) <b>50</b>, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <b>60</b>, a latch <b>70</b>, and/or a column decoder <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The APS array <b>10</b> may include a plurality of pixels that are two-dimensionally arranged. In the APS array <b>10</b> of example embodiments, a 4-shared pixel structure, in which four light-receiving elements share a reading element with one another, may be arranged as a repeating unit in a matrix form. When the area that has been occupied by reading elements is decreased by the use of the 4-shared pixel structure, the size of the light-receiving elements may be increased by as much as the decrease in area, thus increasing light-receiving efficiency and improving light intensity and saturation signal level. However, example embodiments are not limited to such a 4-shared pixel structure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The 4-shared pixel structure may function to convert an optical image to an electrical signal. The APS array <b>10</b> may be driven in response to a plurality of driving signals (including a pixel selection signal SEL, a reset signal RX, and/or a charge-transfer signal TX) that may be received from the row driver <b>40</b>. Further, the electrical signal may be supplied from the APS array <b>10</b> to the CDS <b>50</b> via a vertical signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The timing generator <b>20</b> may function to supply a timing signal and a control signal to the row decoder <b>30</b>, and to supply a timing signal and a control signal to the column decoder <b>80</b>. The timing signal supplied to the row decoder <b>30</b> may be different than or the same as the timing signal supplied to the column decoder <b>80</b>. Similarly, the control signal supplied to the row decoder <b>30</b> may be different than or the same as the control signal supplied to the column decoder <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The row driver <b>40</b> may function to supply the plurality of driving signals for driving a plurality of unit pixels, depending on the decoded result using the row decoder <b>30</b>, to the APS array <b>10</b>. In the case where the unit pixels are arranged in a matrix form, the driving signal may be provided on every row.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The CDS <b>50</b> may receive the electrical signal from the APS array <b>10</b> via the vertical signal line in order to hold the electrical signal and to sample it. That is, a predetermined noise level and signal level caused by the electrical signal may be double sampled, after which the difference level between the noise level and the signal level may be output.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The ADC <b>60</b> may function to convert the analog signal corresponding to the difference level into a digital signal, which then may be output.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The latch <b>70</b> may function to latch the digital signal so as to subsequently output the latched signal to an image signal processor (not shown), depending on the decoded result using the column decoder <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of the APS array <b>10</b> of the image sensor, according to an example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the 4-shared pixel structure P may be arranged in a matrix form, thus forming the APS array <b>10</b> (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In the 4-shared pixel structure P, the four light-receiving elements share the reading element with one another. The reading element of example embodiments may be used to read a light signal supplied to the light-receiving elements, and may include, for example, a drive element, a reset element, and/or a select element.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, the 4-shared pixel structure P may include four light-receiving elements <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>, <b>11</b><i>d</i>. The light-receiving elements <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>, <b>11</b><i>d </i>may function to absorb incident light so as to accumulate a charge corresponding to the amount of such light. In example embodiments, the light-receiving elements <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>, <b>11</b><i>d </i>may be, for example, PPDs.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The respective light-receiving elements <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>, <b>11</b><i>d </i>may be electrically connected to charge-transfer elements <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>d </i>for transferring the accumulated charge to floating diffusion regions (FDs) <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>. Since the FDs <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, which are used to convert the charge into voltage, have parasitic capacitance, the charge is cumulatively stored.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the 4-shared pixel structure P, the four light-receiving elements <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>, <b>11</b><i>d </i>share the reading element, that is, the drive element <b>17</b>, the reset element <b>18</b>, and/or the select element <b>19</b>, with one another. The functions thereof are described below based on the i-row pixels (P(i, j), P(i, j+1), . . . ).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The drive element <b>17</b>, exemplified by a source-follower amplifier, acts to amplify the change of electrical potential of the FD <b>13</b> which receives the charge accumulated in the light-receiving elements <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>, <b>11</b><i>d </i>and then to output it to an output line Vout.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The reset element <b>18</b> may function to reset the FD <b>13</b>. Such resets may or may not be periodic. The reset element <b>18</b> may include a single MOS transistor that is driven by bias provided through a reset line RX(i) for applying bias. The bias may or may not be predetermined. When the reset element <b>18</b> is turned on by the bias provided through the reset line RX(i), electric potential (that may or may not be predetermined), for example, power voltage Vdd, electrically connected to the drain of the reset element <b>18</b>, may be transferred to the FD <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The select element <b>19</b> functions to select the 4-shared pixel structure P to be read in a row unit. The select element <b>19</b> may consist of a single MOS transistor, which is driven by bias provided through a row select line SEL(i). When the select element <b>19</b> is turned on by the bias provided through the row select line SEL(i), electric potential (that may or may not be predetermined), for example, power voltage Vdd, electrically connected to the drain region of the select element <b>19</b>, may be transferred to the drain region of the drive element <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The transfer lines TX(i)a, TX(i)b, TX(i)c, TX(i)d for applying the bias to the charge-transfer elements <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>d</i>, the reset line RX(i) for applying the bias to the reset element <b>18</b>, and/or the row select line SEL(i) for applying the bias to the select element <b>19</b> may be extended parallel to one another in the row direction to arrange them.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a layout of the APS array of the image sensor according to an example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the APS array <b>10</b> of example embodiments may be constructed so that a pair of a first active region A<b>1</b>, including two PPDs (PD<b>1</b>, PD<b>2</b>) sharing a first FD (FD<b>1</b>), and a second active region A<b>2</b>, including two PPDs (PD<b>3</b>, PD<b>4</b>) sharing a second FD (FD<b>2</b>), are arranged as a repeating unit in a matrix form. Additionally, the APS array <b>10</b> of example embodiments may be constructed so that a third active region A<b>3</b> and a fourth active region A<b>4</b>, as two independent reading element regions, are provided with every pair of the first active region A<b>1</b> and the second active region A<b>2</b>. That is, the first to fourth active regions A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b> may constitute the unit of the 4-shared pixel structure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first active region A<b>1</b> may be an active region, for example, in the form of one-axis-merged dual lobes, and the second active region A<b>2</b> may be an active region, for example, in the form of no-axis-merged dual lobes.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the first active region A<b>1</b> may be formed by merging dual-lobe-type active regions a to a one-axis active region b via a connection active region c. The dual-lobe-type active regions a may be aligned to face each other in a column direction while positioning the axis active region b between them. Thus, the one-axis-merged, dual-lobe-type active region may have an outer appearance substantially similar to the hypocotyl of a young dicotyledon and the dual cotyledons branching at the hypocotyl. The dual-lobe-type active regions a may include two PPDs (PD<b>1</b>, PD<b>2</b>), and the connection active region c may be the first FD (FD<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The second active region A<b>2</b> may be formed by merging the dual-lobe-type active regions a with each other via the connection active region c, without the axis. The dual-lobe-type active regions a may be aligned to face each other in the column direction. Therefore, the no-axis-merged, dual-lobe-type active region may have an outer appearance substantially similar to the dual cotyledons of a young dicotyledon. The dual-lobe-type active regions a may include two PPDs (PD<b>3</b>, PD<b>4</b>), and the connection active region c may be the second FD (FD<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, a reset gate RG may be arranged to the one-axis active region b to form the reset element, which is favorable in the interest of efficiency of wires. Further, since the reset element functions to reset the FD (such resets may or may not be periodic), a single junction of the FD and the reset element is preferable in terms of the minimization of wires. However, the element provided to the one-axis active region b is not limited to the reset element. In order to repeat the array, a dummy gate DG having substantially the same shape as the reset gate RG may be provided adjacent to the connection of the second active region A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The third active region A<b>3</b> and the fourth active region A<b>4</b> each may have a reading element. In the case where the reset element is formed to the one-axis active region b, the drive element and the select element may be formed to the third active region A<b>3</b> and the fourth active region A<b>4</b>, respectively. Accordingly, the source follower gate (SFG) of the drive element and the select gate (RSG) of the select element may be disposed in the third active region A<b>3</b> and the fourth active region A<b>4</b>, respectively. Alternatively, depending on how the wires are formed, the select element and the drive element may be formed in the third active region A<b>3</b> and the fourth active region A<b>4</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the image sensor formed according to the block diagram, the circuit diagram, and the layout of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the substrate <b>101</b> of an image sensor <b>100</b> may have a light-receiving region I and/or a non-light-receiving region II defined therein. As such, the light-receiving region I may be the region where a light-receiving element is formed, and the non-light-receiving region II may be the region where no light-receiving element is formed. For example, in the case where the layout of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is applied, of the APS array <b>10</b>, the dual-lobe-type active regions a of the first and second active regions A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> may be provided to the light-receiving region I, and the one-axis active region b and the connection active region c of the first and second active regions A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> and the third and fourth active regions A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b> may be provided to the non-light-receiving region II.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In example embodiments, the light-receiving element provided to the light-receiving region I may be exemplified by a PPD <b>110</b> for reducing dark current and noise caused thereby. Further, the APS array <b>10</b> in the non-light-receiving region II may include the charge-transfer elements <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>d </i>(i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the FD <b>130</b>, the drive element <b>17</b> (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the reset element <b>18</b> (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and/or the select element <b>19</b> (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In addition, the peripheral circuit region in the non-light-receiving region II may include a plurality of NMOS transistors <b>200</b> and PMOS transistors <b>300</b>, a resistor, and/or a capacitor. Thus, the peripheral circuit region may constitute a logic circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In example embodiments, the substrate <b>101</b> may have a p-type bulk substrate <b>101</b><i>a </i>and/or a p-type epi layer <b>101</b><i>b </i>formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, the substrate <b>101</b> may include a p-type well <b>103</b> formed therein. The p-type well <b>103</b>, which is spaced apart from the surface of the substrate <b>101</b>, is represented by a p-type dopant layer formed in the p-type epi layer <b>101</b><i>b</i>. The p-type well <b>103</b> forms a potential barrier for preventing the flow of charges produced from the deep portion of the substrate <b>101</b> into the light-receiving elements and increases the recombination of the charges and holes and, thus, acts as an electrical crosstalk barrier for reducing crosstalk between the pixels due to random drift of the charges.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The p-type well <b>103</b> may have a maximum concentration at a depth, for example, greater than or equal to about 3 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to about 12 &#x3bc;m from the surface of the substrate <b>101</b>. The p-type well <b>103</b> may have a layer thickness greater than or equal to about 1 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to about 5 &#x3bc;m. As such, greater than or equal to about 3 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to about 12 &#x3bc;m substantially corresponds to the absorption wavelength of infrared or near infrared rays in silicon. When the p-type well <b>103</b> is formed close to the surface of the substrate <b>101</b>, the diffusion of the charges into the light-receiving elements may be prevented, thus decreasing crosstalk. However, since the region corresponding to the PPD <b>110</b> also may be formed close to the surface, sensitivity to incident light having a long wavelength (i.e., red wavelength) exhibiting relatively high photoconversion efficiency in the deep portion of the substrate may be decreased. Therefore, the position at which the p-type well <b>103</b> is formed may be adjusted depending on the wavelength of incident light, if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this way, although the case in which the p-type epi layer <b>101</b><i>b </i>is grown on the p-type bulk substrate <b>101</b><i>a </i>and the p-type well <b>103</b> is formed in the p-type epi layer <b>101</b><i>b </i>is described, example embodiments include other combinations. For example, the substrate <b>101</b> having various combinations as shown in Table 1 below may be used in the fabrication of the image sensor.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition to the semiconductor substrates listed in Table 1, an organic plastic substrate also may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">On such a substrate <b>101</b>, a plurality of gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> may be disposed. For example, a transfer gate <b>120</b>, a reset gate, and/or a drive gate may be provided to the APS array <b>10</b>, while gates <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> of NMOS and PMOS transistors <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> may be provided to the peripheral circuit region. In addition, spacers <b>126</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b> may be formed on both side walls of the gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>. Substrate <b>101</b> also may include, for example, a plurality of shallow trench isolations STI.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> may be formed, for example, of a conductive polysilicon film, a metal film (such as, for example, W, Pt, or Al), a metal nitride film (such as, for example, TiN), a metal silicide film obtained from refractory metal (such as, for example, Co, Ni, Ti, Hf, or Pt), or combinations thereof. In addition, the gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> may be formed by sequentially superimposing the conductive polysilicon film and the metal silicide film, or sequentially superimposing the conductive polysilicon film and the metal film, but example embodiments include other formations. The spacers <b>126</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b> may be formed, for example, of a nitride film (such as, for example, SiN).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The PPD <b>110</b>, which is disposed at one side of the transfer gate <b>120</b>, includes a first conductivity type, for example, an n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> formed in the substrate <b>101</b>, and a second conductivity type, different from the first conductivity type, for example, a p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed on the surface of the substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Herein, the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may function to absorb incident light so as to accumulate the charge corresponding to the amount of light, while the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may function to decrease a thermally generated EHP (Electron-Hole Pair) so as to prevent the generation of dark current. For example, the dark current may occur as a result of damage to the surface of the substrate, such damage possibly being caused by dangling silicon bonds or etching stress during the formation of the gates <b>120</b> or spacers <b>126</b>. Hence, the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed deep in the substrate <b>101</b>, whereas the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed on the surface of the substrate. Thereby, among the thermally generated EHPs of the surface, the holes are diffused into the ground substrate via the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b>, and the electrons are recombined with the holes in the course of diffusing such electrons into the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b>, and are then eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">However, the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may include a lower-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>a </i>formed to be aligned to the transfer gate <b>120</b> and a higher-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>b </i>formed to be aligned to the spacer <b>126</b> formed at the side wall of the transfer gate <b>120</b>. As such, the formation depth of the lower-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>a </i>and the higher-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>b </i>may be substantially the same, and the lower-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>a </i>may have a concentration that is about one half that of the higher-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The reason why the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> includes the lower-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>a </i>and the higher-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>b </i>is that no additional mask is used in the formation of the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b>. That is, using the plurality of gates as a mask, the p-type dopant is primarily ion-implanted into the entire surface of the substrate <b>101</b>, and the spacers are formed. Subsequently, using the plurality of gates having the spacers as a mask, the p-type dopant is secondarily ion-implanted into the entire surface of the substrate <b>101</b>, thus completing the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b>. The description thereof is given below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5I</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, blue light, green light, and red light (respectively) have absorption wavelengths in the substrate <b>101</b> greater than or equal to about 0.05 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to about 0.4 &#x3bc;m, greater than or equal to about 0.15 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to about 1.5 &#x3bc;m, and greater than or equal to about 0.4 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to about 5 &#x3bc;m. Thus, the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be greater than or equal to about 2 &#x3bc;m in depth. Moreover, in order to capture almost all of the absorbed red light to realize high sensitivity, the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be greater than or equal to about 5 &#x3bc;m in depth.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, part of the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed to overlap the transfer gate <b>120</b>. The charge accumulated in the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be transferred to the FD <b>130</b> via the lower channel region of the transfer gate <b>120</b>. As such, since the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> is typically formed deeper than the channel region, the charge accumulated in the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> should transfer vertically upward by a distance (that may or may not be predetermined) to reach the channel region. However, if part of the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> overlaps the transfer gate <b>120</b>, the transfer distance of the charge is decreased and thus the charge may be transferred to the FD <b>130</b> within a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, the FD <b>130</b> disposed in the substrate <b>101</b>, at the other side of the transfer gate <b>120</b>, may have a LDD (Low Doped Drain) structure. In such a case, the FD <b>130</b> may include a lower-concentration dopant region <b>132</b> of the LDD formed to be aligned to the transfer gate <b>120</b> and/or a higher-concentration dopant region <b>134</b> of the LDD formed to be aligned to the spacer <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The source and/or drain regions <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> of the NMOS and PMOS transistors <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> provided to the peripheral circuit region in the non-light-receiving region II may have a LDD structure. In such a case, the source and/or drain regions <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> of the NMOS and PMOS transistors <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> may respectively have lower-concentration dopant regions <b>222</b>, <b>322</b> of the LDD and higher-concentration dopant regions <b>224</b>, <b>324</b> of the LDD.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">However, the source and/or drain regions <b>220</b> of the NMOS transistor <b>200</b> include both n-type and p-type dopants, the n-type dopant having the concentration higher than the p-type dopant. Upon the formation of the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b>, since the p-type dopant is ion-implanted into the entire surface of the substrate <b>101</b>, the p-type dopant may also be ion-implanted into the source and/or drain regions <b>220</b> of the NMOS transistor <b>200</b> provided to the peripheral circuit region.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5I</figref>, cross-sectional views showing the process of fabricating the image sensor according to an example embodiment are illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the substrate <b>101</b> having the p-type bulk substrate <b>101</b><i>a </i>and the p-type epi layer <b>101</b><i>b </i>formed thereon is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Subsequently, a p-type dopant is ion-implanted into the substrate <b>101</b> to form the p-type well <b>103</b>. The p-type well <b>103</b> may have a maximum concentration at a depth, for example, greater than or equal to about 3 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to about 12 &#x3bc;m from the surface of the substrate <b>101</b>. The p-type well <b>103</b> may have a layer thickness greater than or equal to about 1 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to about 5 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the substrate <b>101</b>, an insulating film, a gate conductive film, and/or an insulating film for a hard mask may be sequentially deposited and patterned, thus forming gate insulating films <b>122</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>312</b>, gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, and hard mask patterns <b>140</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>330</b> in the non-light-receiving region II.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, the gate insulating films <b>122</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>312</b> may be formed, for example, of SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiON, SiN, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, Ge<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>N<sub>z </sub>(0&#x3c;x&#x3c;1, 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;1, 0&#x3c;z&#x3c;1, x+y+z=1), Ge<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>y</sub>O<sub>z </sub>(0&#x3c;x&#x3c;1, 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;1, 0&#x3c;z&#x3c;1, x+y+z=1), or other high-k material(s). As such, the high-k material, such as HfO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, hafnium silicate, zirconium silicate, or combinations thereof, may be subjected to atomic layer deposition to form a film. Further, the gate insulating films <b>122</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>312</b> may be formed by superimposing two or more materials selected from among the above-listed materials into a plurality of layers. The gate insulating films <b>122</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>312</b> may have a thickness greater than or equal to about 5 &#x212b; and less than or equal to about 100 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The plurality of gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> may be composed of a conductive polysilicon film, a metal film (such as, for example, W, Pt, or Al), a metal nitride film (such as, for example, TiN), a metal silicide film obtained from refractory metal (such as, for example, Co, Ni, Ti, Hf, or Pt), or combinations thereof. In addition, the gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> may be formed by sequentially superimposing the conductive polysilicon film and the metal silicide film or sequentially superimposing the conductive polysilicon film and the metal film, but example embodiments include other formations.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The hard mask patterns <b>140</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>330</b> may be formed, for example, of SiN and/or SiON.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, on the substrate <b>101</b> having the gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> formed thereon, a photoresist pattern <b>191</b> in which the light-receiving region I is opened is formed, and a first conductivity type, for example, an n-type dopant <b>161</b>, is ion-implanted, thus forming the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">For example, the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed, for example, with a depth greater than or equal to about 2 &#x3bc;m so as to efficiently absorb blue light, green light, and/or red light. Further, the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed, for example, with a depth greater than or equal to about 5 &#x3bc;m in order to capture almost all of the red light, so as to increase the sensitivity to the red light.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed by ion-implanting the n-type dopant <b>161</b> (i.e., As) using energy, for example, greater than or equal to about 100 keV and less than or equal to about 500 keV at a dose, for example, greater than or equal to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. As well, the n-type dopant <b>161</b> may be ion-implanted, for example, at an angle. For example, the n-type dopant <b>161</b> may be ion-implanted at an angle greater than 0&#xb0; and less than or equal to about 15&#xb0; from perpendicular to the surface of the substrate (the angle may or may not be predetermined), so that part of the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed so as to overlap the transfer gate <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the photoresist pattern <b>191</b> (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) may be removed, and the hard mask patterns <b>140</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>330</b> (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>) may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">For example, since the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed through ion implantation at an angle using high energy (the angle may or may not be predetermined), the n-type dopant <b>161</b> (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) may be unintentionally ion-implanted into the lower channel region of the transfer gate <b>120</b>. In order to prevent such a phenomenon, the hard mask pattern <b>140</b> on the transfer gate <b>120</b> may be removed after the formation of the n-type first dopant region <b>112</b> of the PPD <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Subsequently, the substrate <b>101</b> may be thermally oxidized. The thermal oxidation process is called GPDX (Gate Poly OXidation).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Although not shown in the drawings, when the substrate <b>101</b> is thermally oxidized, the gate insulating films <b>122</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>312</b> beneath the gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> may be thickened at both edges thereof, thus having a bird's-beak form. Thereby, upon the operation of the transistor, the two edges beneath the gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> have a decreased field and, thus, reliability of the gate insulating films <b>122</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>312</b> is not deteriorated. Further, upon the formation of the gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, the reliability thereof may be increased thanks to the curing of etching damage.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, no additional mask is deposited, and the plurality of gates is used as a mask, whereby the second conductivity type dopant, different from the first conductivity type dopant, for example, a p-type dopant <b>162</b>, is primarily ion-implanted into the entire surface of the substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, the p-type dopant <b>162</b> may be ion-implanted using energy, for example, greater than or equal to about 5 keV and less than or equal to about 20 keV in the case of B (greater than or equal to about 20 keV and less than or equal to about 100 keV in the case of BF<sub>2</sub>) at a dose, for example, greater than or equal to about 5&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to about 5&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. The energy may or may not be predetermined.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">However, since the p-type dopant <b>162</b> is ion-implanted over the entire surface of the substrate <b>101</b>, it may also be provided to the source and/or drain regions <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the NMOS transistors <b>200</b> and the PMOS transistors <b>300</b> to be formed in the non-light-receiving region II (see <b>226</b>, <b>326</b>). Thus, when the p-type dopant <b>162</b> is ion-implanted at a large angle, the NMOS and PMOS transistors <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> to be formed in the non-light-receiving region II may undesirably operate asymmetrically. As a result, the p-type dopant <b>162</b> may be ion-implanted, for example, substantially perpendicular to the surface of the substrate. Also, the p-type dopant <b>162</b> may be ion-implanted at an angle which does not cause such asymmetrical operation, for example, greater than or equal to 0&#xb0; and less than or equal to about 3&#xb0; from perpendicular to the surface of the substrate (the angle may or may not be predetermined).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5E and 5F</figref>, in the non-light-receiving region II, an n-type dopant <b>163</b> may be ion-implanted into the NMOS transistor <b>200</b> and a p-type dopant <b>164</b> may be ion-implanted into the PMOS transistor <b>300</b>, thus forming lower-concentration dopant regions <b>132</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>322</b> of the LDD aligned to the gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, upon the formation of the lower-concentration dopant regions <b>132</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>322</b> of the LDD, the n-type and/or p-type dopants <b>163</b>, <b>164</b> may be used in doses suitable for compensating for the p-type dopant <b>162</b> through the primary ion implantation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. In example embodiments, &#x201c;compensation for a p-type dopant&#x201d; means the removal of the effect of the previously ion-implanted p-type dopant <b>162</b> by controlling the doses of the n-type and/or p-type dopants <b>163</b>, <b>164</b> to be subsequently ion-implanted, in consideration of the dose of the previously ion-implanted p-type dopant <b>162</b> (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>). For example, such a dopant may be ion-implanted into the FD <b>130</b> and/or the lower-concentration dopant regions <b>132</b>, <b>222</b> of the LDD of the NMOS transistor <b>200</b> in a larger dose, for example, greater than or equal to about 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to about 5.5&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. Further, the dopant may be ion-implanted into the lower-concentration dopant region <b>322</b> of the LDD of the PMOS transistor <b>300</b> in a smaller dose, for example, greater than or equal to about 5&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to about 4.5&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Moreover, since only the lower-concentration dopant regions <b>132</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>322</b> of the LDD need to be formed before the formation of the spacers, the above process sequence may be reversed in comparison with the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref>, spacers <b>126</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b> may be formed on both side walls of the plurality of gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>. Subsequently, using the plurality of gates <b>120</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> having the spacers <b>126</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b> as a mask, without the deposition of an additional mask, a second conductivity type dopant, for example, a p-type dopant <b>165</b>, may be secondarily ion-implanted into the entire surface of the substrate <b>101</b>, thus completing the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">For example, the secondary ion implantation may be conducted using substantially the same energy and/or substantially the same dose as in the primary ion implantation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. For example, the p-type dopant <b>165</b> may be ion-implanted using energy, for example, greater than or equal to about 5 keV and less than or equal to about 20 keV in the case of B (greater than or equal to about 20 keV and less than or equal to about 100 keV in the case of BF<sub>2</sub>) at a dose, for example, greater than or equal to about 5&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to about 5&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. The energy may or may not be predetermined. However, the energies and/or doses may be different. For example, the ratio of energies may be approximately 10:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1.5:1, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, or 1:10. For example, the ratio of doses may be approximately 10:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1.5:1, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, or 1:10. In an example embodiment, the ratio of doses may be approximately 7:3 or 3:7.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may include a lower-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>a</i>, in which the p-type dopant <b>162</b> (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>) is ion-implanted only upon the primary ion implantation, and/or a higher-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>b</i>, in which the p-type dopants <b>162</b>, <b>165</b> are ion-implanted upon both the primary and secondary ion implantations. However, as mentioned above, in the case where the primary and secondary ion implantations are conducted using the same energy and doses, the lower-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>a </i>may be formed as deep as the higher-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>b</i>. As such, the lower-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>a </i>may have a concentration about one half that of the higher-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5H and 5I</figref>, an n-type dopant <b>166</b> may be ion-implanted into the NMOS transistor <b>200</b> in the non-light-receiving region II, and/or a p-type dopant <b>167</b> may be ion-implanted into the PMOS transistor <b>300</b>, thus forming higher-concentration dopant regions <b>134</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>324</b> of the LDD respectively aligned to the spacers <b>126</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b>. For example, the doses of the n-type and p-type dopants <b>166</b>, <b>167</b>, which are used to form the higher-concentration dopant regions <b>134</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>324</b> of the LDD, may be suitable for the compensation of the p-type dopant <b>165</b> through the primary ion implantation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Alternatively, since only the higher-concentration dopant regions <b>134</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>324</b> of the LDD need to be formed after the formation of spacers <b>126</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b>, the above process sequence may be reversed compared to the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Thereafter, according to process steps widely known to those skilled in the semiconductor device art, steps of forming wires to input and/or output the electric signal to and/or from the transistor, forming a passivation layer on the substrate, and/or packaging the substrate are further carried out, thereby completing the image sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As such, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B, the reason why the p-type dopants may be respectively ion-implanted before and after the formation of the spacers <b>126</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b> to form the p-type second dopant region <b>114</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, in the case where a second dopant region <b>115</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed through a single ion implantation before the formation of the spacer <b>126</b> without the use of an additional mask, the second dopant region <b>115</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed to be aligned to the transfer gate <b>120</b>. In such a case, the second dopant region <b>115</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed to come into contact with the transfer gate <b>120</b> (see <b>171</b>) and, thus, the charge which is transferred through the lower channel region of the transfer gate <b>120</b> may not be efficiently transferred to the FD <b>130</b> due to the influence of the second dopant region <b>115</b> of the PPD <b>110</b>. Ultimately, image lag and noise caused thereby may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, in the case where a second dopant region <b>116</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed through a single ion implantation after the formation of the spacer <b>126</b> without the use of an additional mask, the second dopant region <b>116</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> may be formed to be aligned to the spacer <b>126</b>. In such a case, since the second dopant region <b>116</b> of the PPD <b>110</b> is not formed under the spacer <b>126</b> (see <b>172</b>), it may be impractical or impossible to prevent dark current from occurring on the surface of the substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in example embodiments, the lower-concentration dopant region <b>114</b><i>a</i>, which may be aligned to the transfer gate <b>120</b> and also extends to the portion beneath the spacer <b>126</b>, is formed, and may be formed in a concentration range within which it is possible to minimize the generation of dark current on the surface of the substrate <b>101</b> without causing image lag.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic view showing a processor-based system including the image sensor of an example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the processor-based system <b>401</b> is a system processing the output image of an image sensor <b>410</b>.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The processor-based system <b>401</b>, such as the computer system, includes a central processing unit (CPU) <b>420</b>, such as a microprocessor, capable of communicating with an I/O element <b>430</b> via a bus <b>405</b>. The image sensor <b>410</b> may communicate with the system via the bus <b>405</b> or other communication links.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Although the image sensor of example embodiments may be characterized by having the 4-shared pixel structure in which four PPDs <b>110</b> share the reading element with one another, a 2-shared pixel structure or an unshared pixel structure, which are known to those skilled in the art, may be applied.</p>
