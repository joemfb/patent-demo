<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/646,579, filed Aug. 22, 2003, entitled &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD OF INTEGRATING LOYALTY/REWARD PROGRAMS WITH PAYMENT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS,&#x201d; and Ser. No. 10/877,276, filed Jun. 25, 2004, entitled &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR COORDINATING PAYMENT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS,&#x201d; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/102,544, filed Apr. 8, 2005, entitled &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PATRON NOTIFICATION USING THE PATRON'S WIRELESS DEVICE,&#x201d; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to user transactional systems and more particularly to such systems and methods in which a user logs into a store or other facility, transacts business and logs out, all under control of the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Shopping, particularly shopping at a physical facility, has become a way of life. In one form or another, shopping is as old as civilization itself and has not varied a great deal, other than perhaps the now extremely wide array of goods and services that are available to the shopper.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Indeed, the number of choices that a modern shopper has is sometimes overwhelming. Thus, often a shopper needs assistance with his/her purchases. This assistance relates not only to styles, but to sizes (especially for gift items) and color coordination, and extends to the financial aspect of shopping, such as credit available or credit remaining on a gift card, or the availability of coupons or other money saving promotions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Often, a shopper will have made a mental (or physical) note of some item that the shopper wanted to buy on his/her next visit to the store, but memories (and notes written on slips of paper) being what they are the desired item is forgotten about when the user is in the store.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, while PDAs and like devices have eliminated some of the &#x201c;memory&#x201d; issues associated with visiting a merchant's facility (whether physically or virtually), these devices are attuned only to the shopper's needs and do not match the desires of the shopper with the merchandise and services available at a particular location.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is disclosed a system in which a user controls the log-in, transaction, and log-out process with respect to a merchant. The user's presence at the merchant's facility triggers the log-in process, such that the merchant's systems become aware of the user's presence. Once the user is registered with the merchant, information and services become available to the user without further action required by the user. Transactions are facilitated, specials are brought to the user's attention, and personal shopping becomes available while the user remains in the facility. Upon leaving the facility, or after a certain elapsed time with a transaction being consummated, the user is logged-out of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the invention, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one embodiment <b>10</b> of the invention when used with respect to a facility, such as facility <b>100</b>. When user <b>12</b> arrives at the facility, the user is detected, process <b>301</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and logged into the facility. The log-in can be controlled by the user by using a mobile device, such as cell phone <b>14</b>, to call a log-in number, or by having a magnetic (or near-field device) strip placed in contact with (or in proximity to) sensor <b>11</b>. In some situations, the log-in can be accomplished without action being taken by the user, for example, by knowing the geographical position of the user, which may be broadcast from the user's wireless device along with the identity of the user. The wireless device would know its location by GPS or otherwise. Bluetooth, NFC, LBS, E911, or IVR technology may be used to make the user's presence known inside facility <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Alternatively, the user's wireless device can periodically emit a code identifying the user such that when the user is in proximity of the facility, the user is logged-in. Using such a system, when a user, such as user <b>13</b>, drives past the facility along street <b>103</b>, the user could be temporarily logged-in to the facility such that specials or other information, as will be discussed hereinafter, can be communicated to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, assume that after a previous visit, the user entered into a user profile (perhaps from a home PC) a list of desired items, or perhaps the user indicated that he/she wanted to purchase an item at a given price point. In such a situation, when the user is driving by (or otherwise logged-in), the user would receive a reminder that he/she wanted to buy item X and that the item is now available at the desired price. A user also may visit a merchant's website to arrange a shopping or item list to identify what he/she may want to purchase at the merchant's store. Then, the list may be available to the user's cell phone, for example, for use when the customer nears or enters the merchant's facility.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Assume now that user <b>12</b> walks into facility <b>100</b> and sensor <b>11</b> signals his/her presence within facility <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, embodiment <b>30</b>, process <b>301</b>, detection of the presence of user <b>12</b>, causes process <b>303</b> to identify the user, and process <b>304</b> retrieves his/her user profile, for example from memory <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. At this time a timer (process <b>303</b>) is set. The identification process can be automatic, as discussed above, or could require active participation and perhaps a password, on the part of the user. The password would be important if credit or &#x201c;quick&#x201d; payment options are available while the user is in the facility.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The user profile accessed by process <b>304</b> can contain information about the user including, but not limited to: previous purchases, purchase characteristics, user characteristics, user preferences, receipts, discounts, payment information, identification information, monetary balances, and any other information.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Once the user's profile is retrieved, processes <b>308</b> and <b>309</b> can be used by the facility to communicate with the user. For example, the facility can notify the user of specials, available credit, the amount of money remaining on gift cards, coupons, previous on-hold or wish list items. At this point, based on the user's location in the facility, the user may learn of special offers via SMS/MMS, NFC, Bluetooth, Media, or IVR. Alternatively, the user may obtain this information by receiving an e-mail on his/her PDA or other handheld device, or the user may access the information through Internet connectivity via his/her cellular phone or handheld device. The customer also may view his/her item or shopping list, and based on the user's location, the list may be sorted to place items nearest in proximity to the user at the top of the list.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">If appropriate, process <b>305</b> notifies a facility employee, such as personal shopper <b>15</b>, and optionally provides the personal shopper with access to the user's profile, thereby allowing shopper <b>15</b> to view pertinent information pertaining to the shopper. This information is viewed, for example, using a wireless device, such as device <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the possession of shopper <b>15</b>. The information supplied to the shopper can be any information, such as sizes, last purchases, birthdays, preferences, names of family members, and any other information stored in the user's profile. For security purposes, the system could limit the amount of access shopper <b>15</b> has in viewing and modifying the user's profile.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Shopper <b>15</b> also has the option of initiating a transaction with the user, process <b>307</b>. For example, shopper <b>15</b> could send a list of items along with pricing and availability to the user's wireless device for consideration. Upon receipt of this list, the user could conduct the suggested transaction by, for example, purchasing the items or storing them in the user profile's wish list, process <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Process <b>309</b> provides the user with a plurality of transactional options while in the facility. For example, if user <b>12</b> wishes to deactivate wireless device <b>14</b> while in the store, he/she selects the deactivation option, process <b>310</b>, and wireless device <b>14</b> is logged-out, process <b>314</b>. Further, if the user does not desire to interact with a central server of the facility, the user may deactivate his/her wireless device accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Process <b>316</b> sets up a &#x201c;quick transaction&#x201d; when wireless device <b>14</b> is detected. &#x201c;Quick transaction&#x201d; is a process allowing user <b>12</b> to authorize payment for merchandise (or services) using wireless device <b>14</b>. This authorization could be under control of the system and method discussed in the above-identified U.S. patent application, &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR COORDINATING PAYMENT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS.&#x201d; Once &#x201c;quick transaction&#x201d; is set up, processes <b>309</b> and <b>310</b> allow user <b>12</b> to select a purchase option from the list of transactional options, thereby authorizing payment for an item from the facility using wireless device <b>14</b>. If desired, an option from the list of transactional options could allow user <b>12</b> to select the medium from which he/she receives the purchase receipt. For example, user <b>12</b> could choose to have the receipt printed in the facility, sent to an e-mail account, or stored in his/her user profile.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Once user <b>12</b> selects a transactional option, process <b>310</b>, the transaction is conducted, process <b>311</b>, and recorded in the user profile, process <b>312</b>. It should be noted that the transaction could be recorded in other databases as well, such as inventory tracking systems, marketing and promotion systems, and any other system which could benefit from tracking transactions. After the transaction is completed, the timer resets.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Process <b>315</b> allows user <b>12</b> to access and modify his/her user profile using wireless device <b>14</b>. For example, if while user <b>12</b> is shopping in the facility he/she sees something desired but he/she cannot purchase, user <b>12</b> could access his/her user profile and add the desired item to a wish list. If applicable, user <b>12</b> could input a price point at which he/she would be willing to make the purchase, so when the price of the item is lowered to the desired purchase price, user <b>12</b> will be notified under control of process <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Because the user profile contains sensitive information, it is important to include security features. As such, process <b>313</b>, in conjunction with processes <b>303</b> and <b>311</b>, utilize a timer which determines if a sufficient amount of time has passed since the last transaction. If it has, then it is safe to assume the user has left the facility. Specifically, once the user has been identified by process <b>303</b>, a timer is set. The system has a pre-determined time limit, process <b>313</b>, for example twenty minutes, such that when the time limit is exceeded the system assumes the user has left the facility and logs-out the wireless device. However, if the user conducts a transaction before the time limit is exceeded, the timer is reset, process <b>311</b>, and the user has another period of time to conduct another transaction before the system assumes he/she has left the facility. This step is particularly important for wireless devices which are set up with &#x201c;quick transaction&#x201d; to prevent unauthorized transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When user <b>12</b> leaves the range of the facility's sensor <b>11</b>, the system assumes the user has left the facility and logs-out wireless device <b>14</b>. This process can be used in conjunction with the timer or in place of the timer and is intended to provide further security against unauthorized transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be recognized that any number of methods could be used to log wireless device <b>14</b> out of the system, thereby ensuring the device's security. For example, the user profile could be set up such that when a triggering event occurs, the system will not allow further transactions. Some examples of triggering events include but are not limited to: a user selecting a log-off option; improper identification supplied by the user; the passage of time; the device leaving the sensor's range; passage of time without a transaction occurring; exceeding a predetermined number of transactions; exceeding a per transaction spending limit; exceeding a cumulative spending limit; conducting an unapproved transaction; or attempting to conduct a transaction outside the transactional options, or conducting transactions detectable by fraud detection systems that are deemed inappropriate for this user based on the user's profile and other information.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows another embodiment <b>250</b> of a system in which user <b>252</b> with a wireless device, such as cellular telephone <b>255</b>, approaches podium <b>257</b> of a restaurant where host/hostess <b>251</b> is positioned. Not shown are the plurality of other users mingling around waiting for a table to become available. In the embodiment shown, host/hostess <b>251</b> enters an identification number (such as the calling number) of wireless device <b>255</b> into controller <b>256</b> in a number of ways. The identification number could be spoken or it could be Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) or Near-Field (NF) communication transferred via wireless device <b>255</b> via receiving device <b>254</b>. Controller <b>256</b> is essentially the same as controller <b>25</b> as will be discussed in more detail hereinafter with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, a control number is provided to host/hostess <b>251</b> by controller <b>256</b>, or alternatively host/hostess <b>251</b> provides the control number for use by controller <b>256</b>. This control number is then stored in a memory in association with the calling identification number of the user's wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the table for user <b>252</b> becomes available, host/hostess <b>251</b> inputs the control number of user <b>252</b> into controller <b>256</b> which then establishes a communication link via either the public switch network, a wireless communication network, or a pager network (not shown) to wireless device <b>255</b> which then provides a signal or a message to user <b>252</b> indicating the availability of a table. This message, if desired, could also provide other information pertaining to the table, such as its location, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the user is waiting for a table, messages can be sent to device <b>255</b> from the business establishment. These messages can be, for example, specials of the day, menus, coupons for special pricing, music or other entertainment. One or more of these messages could be a bidirectional communication. For example, a message could say, &#x201c;We are featuring a certain drink or hors d'oeuvre today. The price is $4.95. Do you wish to order?&#x201d; User <b>252</b> then could choose to answer &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; &#x201c;no&#x201d; or ignore the message. Any reply message would be communicated over a bidirectional link back through the network to controller <b>256</b> which would then take the necessary action to insure that the request of user <b>252</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While the system is shown in conjunction with a restaurant setting, any merchandise (or service) that a user is waiting for can be the subject of the system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows, for example, an embodiment in which pharmacy <b>21</b> has drive-up window <b>201</b>. User <b>202</b> is in his/her vehicle waiting for service. User <b>202</b> has wireless device <b>22</b> which can communicate via RFID or NF communication via input device <b>24</b> to register an identification number, such as the calling number of wireless device <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the calling number can be registered verbally with a person located at pharmacy <b>21</b>, or the calling number could be registered from a remotely located user by having that user call in and verbally present the calling number. If desired, caller ID or another device could provide the identification of the wireless device of the remote user.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the calling identification could be from memory <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) of controller <b>25</b> or from a remote system, such as remote system <b>220</b> which can be, for example, the system shown in the above identified copending application entitled, &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR COORDINATING PAYMENT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In operation, using system <b>20</b>, a prescription (Rx) or other merchandise desired from pharmacy <b>21</b> would be entered into controller <b>25</b> as well as into the normal pharmaceutical system (not shown) of establishment <b>21</b>. A physician can call the Rx in to the pharmacy <b>21</b> or remotely type the Rx into controller <b>25</b> from the physician's office or other location. Attached to the prescription would be the user identification number. Controller <b>25</b> operates in conjunction with the pharmacy system, to cross-link the user identification, as obtained from the doctor, with the user's calling identification number and with a code number (if desired). An alternate method of delivering a Rx to establishment <b>21</b> is, of course, by physically hand carrying the Rx to an attendant, who would then register the user's calling identification in association with a code number.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Yet another method of delivering the Rx to establishment <b>21</b> utilizes process <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Here, the physician types the Rx and any additionally required information into a user's profile using either the user's wireless device <b>23</b> (user <b>203</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) or a remote computer (not shown). Then, when user <b>203</b> comes within range of detector <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) which detects and identifies user <b>203</b>, as discussed above with respect to processes <b>301</b> and <b>303</b>, the detected profile notifies (process <b>305</b>) the pharmacy's employee of the user's presence. The pharmacy's employee can then access user <b>203</b>'s user profile, view/modify the Rx (process <b>306</b>), and fill the Rx. If desired, the pharmacy's employee could view the user profile for other information, such as other prescribed medication or medical insurance information. Similarly, the pharmacy's employee could modify the user's profile, process <b>307</b>, if necessary. For example, if the Rx has a limited number of refills, the pharmacy's employee could modify the user profile to reflect the number of refills remaining for the Rx.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The user then is free to leave the establishment or do other shopping in the establishment or elsewhere and from time to time messages can be delivered to the user using, for example, the code number, with respect to other services available, such as specials, coupons, rebates, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At the time when the Rx becomes available, the code number associated with the Rx is communicated to controller <b>25</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> which, in one embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, has computer <b>203</b>, memory <b>204</b>, message store <b>26</b>, voice-to-text device <b>27</b>, and text-to-speech device <b>28</b>, operating in association therewith. When the code number of the available Rx arrives at controller <b>25</b>, controller <b>25</b> then retrieves from memory the user's calling number, such as the calling number of wireless device <b>23</b> for user <b>203</b>. A proper message is then selected from message store <b>26</b> for communication via a communication link to user device <b>23</b>. This communication link can be established locally from establishment <b>21</b> or it can be established from remote system <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some instances during the filling process of the Rx, the pharmacist may require additional information about the patient or a clarification of the patient's birth date or other information. If the information is available, for example, in memory <b>204</b>, then upon initiation of a request, the information can be provided from memory. In some situations, the request for additional information will be sent from controller <b>25</b> to the user, such as user <b>203</b>, via wireless device <b>23</b> on a bidirectional link under control of the assigned control code. The user could be asked for a birth date, an address, or other information. The user then can communicate the information, either using a touch pad or verbally back to the pharmacist. The verbal communications could be, if desired, translated by voice-to-text device <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When user <b>203</b>'s Rx is ready, a communication is sent from message store <b>26</b> through the system to wireless device <b>23</b> so that user <b>203</b> can drive up to window <b>201</b> to retrieve his/her filled Rx. As the user is approaching window <b>201</b>, wireless device <b>203</b> could identify itself, for example, via RFID or NF detector <b>24</b>, and the proper Rx would be ready when user <b>203</b> arrives at window <b>201</b>. If desired, when user <b>203</b> is notified that the Rx (or other merchandise) is available, a price could be included in the message and the user given the opportunity to authorize payment for the merchandise at that time. This authorization could be under control of the system and method discussed in the above-identified U.S. patent application, &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR COORDINATING PAYMENT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Again, it should be pointed out that while the inventive concepts have been discussed with respect to a pharmacy, any type of establishment can utilize the concepts discussed herein so that a user can register (or have registered) his/her calling identification, and when the merchandise is ready, the user will be notified. While the user is waiting for such notification, other messages can be delivered to the user pertaining to services available, either at the establishment or in conjunction with the desires of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows one embodiment of flow chart <b>40</b> illustrating the processes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. Process <b>401</b> determines whether a user has signed in with a service provider. The service provider can be a restaurant, a pharmacy, or any other type of commercial environment where notification of an event is important. Process <b>402</b> determines whether the system already has a calling phone or pager number of the wireless device used by the user. If the system does not already have that information, then process <b>403</b> controls the input of that calling information number. This could be by RFID or NF communication, caller ID, verbal with a voice-to-text conversion, (such as speech-to-text converter <b>27</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Process <b>404</b> assigns a local control number (LCN) to the phone number. Note that process <b>404</b> is not necessary and the system could, if desired, use the actual phone number or caller identification number of the wireless device. For ease of discussion herein it will be assumed that an LCN is utilized. The LCN is stored in association with the phone number via process <b>405</b>. This storage could be, for example, in memory <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) of controller <b>25</b> under control of computer <b>203</b>, but any other system, either local to the physical location of the user or the place of establishment or in a remote system, such as remote system <b>220</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an embodiment <b>50</b> of a process for receiving messages and notifications and communicating those messages to a user from time to time. Process <b>501</b> is the message control which determines which messages are to be sent at a given time. These messages can be prerecorded and selected by identification number or they could be input into the system live by a host/hostess, pharmacist, or other establishment member and converted if desired to speech via text-to-speech device <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The messages could contain information including but not limited to: the availability of a service, product, promotion, discount, special pricing, or payment option.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Process <b>502</b> determines if it is time to send a message to a user. This determination can be, for example, based on the fact that an Rx is filled or that other merchandise or services are available. The time of the message can be controlled such that, for example, if an Rx is filled in the middle of the night, the notification will not go out until morning. Likewise, the message could be sent immediately following the detection of wireless device within range of sensor <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Process <b>503</b>, in conjunction with process <b>504</b>, generates the message and/or retrieves it from a data store and sets up a link to the wireless device via process <b>505</b> under control of controller <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). The message is then sent via process <b>506</b> to either the public switched network, internet connection, packed switched network or otherwise, in accordance with the calling identification number provided during the initial registration period, process <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Process <b>513</b> inquires whether log-in to the payment system is desired, and if so, process <b>514</b> logs into the payment system.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Process <b>507</b> determines if a reply is expected, i.e., bidirectional communication has been set up. If not, then the original message link is terminated via process <b>508</b>. However, if a reply is expected, then process <b>509</b>, in conjunction with process <b>510</b>, determines if a reply has been generated, and if so, then the reply is sent, process <b>511</b>, and the link is ended, process <b>512</b>. Note that process <b>510</b> can be established such that if a reply is not generated within a certain time a repeat message is sent to the user to try to establish a bidirectional communication so as to obtain a reply message under control of process <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Moreover, the scope of the present application is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments of the process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, means, methods and steps described in the specification.
