<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A film of silicon dioxide is formed on the silicon-germanium layer, and a high dielectric constant film is further formed on the film of silicon dioxide. First irradiation from a flash lamp is performed on the semiconductor wafer to increase the temperature of a front surface of the semiconductor wafer from a preheating temperature to a target temperature for a time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second. Subsequently, second irradiation from the flash lamp is performed to maintain the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer within a &#xb1;25&#xb0; C. range around the target temperature for a time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second. This promotes the crystallization of the high dielectric constant film while suppressing the alleviation of distortion in the silicon-germanium layer.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a heat treatment method which heats a substrate such as a semiconductor wafer including a high dielectric constant film formed on a silicon-germanium layer to promote the crystallization of the high dielectric constant film.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hitherto, silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) has been typically used as the material of a gate insulator film for a field-effect transistor (FET). However, as gate insulator films are made thinner with the decreasing size of devices, the increase in leakage current has become a problem. To solve the problem, a metal gate electrode such that metal is used as the material of a gate electrode has been developed while a material (a high dielectric constant material) having a dielectric constant higher than that of silicon dioxide is used as the material of a gate insulator film, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0081753.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the use of the high dielectric constant film (high-k film) made of such a high dielectric constant material, it has been studied to form a silicon-germanium layer having different concentrations to apply stresses to a source and a drain, thereby causing more current to flow.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, a problem to be described below arises during the heat treatment of a semiconductor wafer in which a high dielectric constant film is formed on a silicon-germanium layer. The high dielectric constant film is formed by depositing a high dielectric constant material, using a MOCVD (metal organic chemical vapor deposition) technique and the like. The high dielectric constant film just deposited is low in crystallinity. It is hence necessary to anneal the high dielectric constant film at 1000&#xb0; C. or higher, thereby promoting the crystallization of the high dielectric constant film.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, heating of the silicon-germanium layer serving as a base layer to 1000&#xb0; C. or higher alleviates the distortion between portions of silicon-germanium with different concentrations to result in a problem such that the capability of applying stresses to the source and the drain is decreased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is intended for a method of heating a substrate including a high dielectric constant film formed on a silicon-germanium layer to promote the crystallization of the high dielectric constant film.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the present invention, the method comprises the steps of: (a) forming a first silicon-germanium layer on a substrate, the first silicon-germanium layer including a second silicon-germanium layer with a first germanium concentration and third silicon-germanium layers with a second germanium concentration higher than the first germanium concentration, the second silicon-germanium layer being sandwiched between the third silicon-germanium layers; (b) forming a film of silicon dioxide on the second silicon-germanium layer, and forming a high dielectric constant film on the film of silicon dioxide; (c) heating the substrate including the high dielectric constant film formed thereon at a predetermined preheating temperature; (d) irradiating the substrate with light to increase the temperature of a front surface of the substrate from the preheating temperature to a target temperature for a time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second; and (e) irradiating the substrate with light to maintain the temperature of the front surface of the substrate within a &#xb1;25&#xb0; C. range around the target temperature for a time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second, the step (e) being performed after the step (d).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The temperature of the front surface of the substrate is maintained near the target temperature for a fixed time period. This promotes the crystallization of the high dielectric constant film while suppressing the relaxation of the first silicon-germanium layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, a switching element intermittently supplies electrical charges from a capacitor to the flash lamp to control an emission output from the flash lamp in the step (d) and in the step (e).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The temperature of the front surface of the substrate is maintained near the target temperature with stability.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is therefore an object of the present invention to promote the crystallization of a high dielectric constant film while suppressing the relaxation of a silicon-germanium layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A preferred embodiment according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view showing a configuration of a heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> for carrying out a heat treatment method according to the present invention. The heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present preferred embodiment is a flash lamp annealer for irradiating a disk-shaped semiconductor wafer W having a diameter of 300 mm and serving as a substrate with a flash of light to heat the semiconductor wafer W. A semiconductor wafer W prior to the transport into the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> includes a high dielectric constant film formed therein, and the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> performs a heating treatment on the semiconductor wafer W to thereby promote the crystallization of the high dielectric constant film, which will be described in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> includes a chamber <b>6</b> for receiving a semiconductor wafer W therein, a flash heating part <b>5</b> including a plurality of built-in flash lamps FL, a halogen heating part <b>4</b> including a plurality of built-in halogen lamps HL, and a shutter mechanism <b>2</b>. The flash heating part <b>5</b> is provided over the chamber <b>6</b>, and the halogen heating part <b>4</b> is provided under the chamber <b>6</b>. The heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> further includes a holder <b>7</b> provided inside the chamber <b>6</b> and for holding a semiconductor wafer W in a horizontal position, and a transfer mechanism <b>10</b> provided inside the chamber <b>6</b> and for transferring a semiconductor wafer W between the holder <b>7</b> and the outside of the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>. The heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> further includes a controller <b>3</b> for controlling operating mechanisms provided in the shutter mechanism <b>2</b>, the halogen heating part <b>4</b>, the flash heating part <b>5</b>, and the chamber <b>6</b> to cause the operating mechanisms to heat-treat a semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The chamber <b>6</b> is configured such that upper and lower chamber windows <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> made of quartz are mounted to the top and bottom, respectively, of a tubular chamber side portion <b>61</b>. The chamber side portion <b>61</b> has a generally tubular shape having an open top and an open bottom. The upper chamber window <b>63</b> is mounted to block the top opening of the chamber side portion <b>61</b>, and the lower chamber window <b>64</b> is mounted to block the bottom opening thereof. The upper chamber window <b>63</b> forming the ceiling of the chamber <b>6</b> is a disk-shaped member made of quartz, and serves as a quartz window that transmits a flash of light emitted from the flash heating part <b>5</b> therethrough into the chamber <b>6</b>. The lower chamber window <b>64</b> forming the floor of the chamber <b>6</b> is also a disk-shaped member made of quartz, and serves as a quartz window that transmits light emitted from the halogen heating part <b>4</b> therethrough into the chamber <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An upper reflective ring <b>68</b> is mounted to an upper portion of the inner wall surface of the chamber side portion <b>61</b>, and a lower reflective ring <b>69</b> is mounted to a lower portion thereof. Both of the upper and lower reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> are in the form of an annular ring. The upper reflective ring <b>68</b> is mounted by being inserted downwardly from the top of the chamber side portion <b>61</b>. The lower reflective ring <b>69</b>, on the other hand, is mounted by being inserted upwardly from the bottom of the chamber side portion <b>61</b> and fastened with screws not shown. In other words, the upper and lower reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> are removably mounted to the chamber side portion <b>61</b>. An interior space of the chamber <b>6</b>, i.e. a space surrounded by the upper chamber window <b>63</b>, the lower chamber window <b>64</b>, the chamber side portion <b>61</b>, and the upper and lower reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b>, is defined as a heat treatment space <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A recessed portion <b>62</b> is defined in the inner wall surface of the chamber <b>6</b> by mounting the upper and lower reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> to the chamber side portion <b>61</b>. Specifically, the recessed portion <b>62</b> is defined which is surrounded by a middle portion of the inner wall surface of the chamber side portion <b>61</b> where the reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> are not mounted, a lower end surface of the upper reflective ring <b>68</b>, and an upper end surface of the lower reflective ring <b>69</b>. The recessed portion <b>62</b> is provided in the form of a horizontal annular ring in the inner wall surface of the chamber <b>6</b>, and surrounds the holder <b>7</b> which holds a semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The chamber side portion <b>61</b>, and the upper and lower reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> are made of a metal material (e.g., stainless steel) with high strength and high heat resistance. The inner peripheral surfaces of the upper and lower reflective rings <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> are provided as mirror surfaces by electrolytic nickel plating.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The chamber side portion <b>61</b> is provided with a transport opening (throat) <b>66</b> for the transport of a semiconductor wafer W therethrough into and out of the chamber <b>6</b>. The transport opening <b>66</b> is openable and closable by a gate valve <b>185</b>. The transport opening <b>66</b> is connected in communication with an outer peripheral surface of the recessed portion <b>62</b>. Thus, when the transport opening <b>66</b> is opened by the gate valve <b>185</b>, a semiconductor wafer W is allowed to be transported through the transport opening <b>66</b> and the recessed portion <b>62</b> into and out of the heat treatment space <b>65</b>. When the transport opening <b>66</b> is closed by the gate valve <b>185</b>, the heat treatment space <b>65</b> in the chamber <b>6</b> is an enclosed space.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At least one gas supply opening <b>81</b> for supplying a treatment gas (in this preferred embodiment, nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas) therethrough into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> is provided in an upper portion of the inner wall of the chamber <b>6</b>. The gas supply opening <b>81</b> is provided above the recessed portion <b>62</b>, and may be provided in the upper reflective ring <b>68</b>. The gas supply opening <b>81</b> is connected in communication with a gas supply pipe <b>83</b> through a buffer space <b>82</b> provided in the form of an annular ring inside the side wall of the chamber <b>6</b>. The gas supply pipe <b>83</b> is connected to a nitrogen gas supply source <b>85</b>. A valve <b>84</b> is inserted at some midpoint in the gas supply pipe <b>83</b>. When the valve <b>84</b> is opened, nitrogen gas is fed from the nitrogen gas supply source <b>85</b> to the buffer space <b>82</b>. The nitrogen gas flowing in the buffer space <b>82</b> flows in a spreading manner within the buffer space <b>82</b> which is lower in fluid resistance than the gas supply opening <b>81</b>, and is supplied through the gas supply opening <b>81</b> into the heat treatment space <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the other hand, at least one gas exhaust opening <b>86</b> for exhausting a gas from the heat treatment space <b>65</b> is provided in a lower portion of the inner wall of the chamber <b>6</b>. The gas exhaust opening <b>86</b> is provided below the recessed portion <b>62</b>, and may be provided in the lower reflective ring <b>69</b>. The gas exhaust opening <b>86</b> is connected in communication with a gas exhaust pipe <b>88</b> through a buffer space <b>87</b> provided in the form of an annular ring inside the side wall of the chamber <b>6</b>. The gas exhaust pipe <b>88</b> is connected to an exhaust part <b>190</b>. A valve <b>89</b> is inserted at some midpoint in the gas exhaust pipe <b>88</b>. When the valve <b>89</b> is opened, the gas in the heat treatment space <b>65</b> is exhausted through the gas exhaust opening <b>86</b> and the buffer space <b>87</b> to the gas exhaust pipe <b>88</b>. The at least one gas supply opening <b>81</b> and the at least one gas exhaust opening <b>86</b> may include a plurality of gas supply openings <b>81</b> and a plurality of gas exhaust openings <b>86</b>, respectively, arranged in a circumferential direction of the chamber <b>6</b>, and may be in the form of slits. The nitrogen gas supply source <b>85</b> and the exhaust part <b>190</b> may be mechanisms provided in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> or be utility systems in a factory in which the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> is installed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A gas exhaust pipe <b>191</b> for exhausting the gas from the heat treatment space <b>65</b> is also connected to a distal end of the transport opening <b>66</b>. The gas exhaust pipe <b>191</b> is connected through a valve <b>192</b> to the exhaust part <b>190</b>. By opening the valve <b>192</b>, the gas in the chamber <b>6</b> is exhausted through the transport opening <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view showing the entire external appearance of the holder <b>7</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a top plan view of the holder <b>7</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view of the holder <b>7</b> as seen from one side. The holder <b>7</b> includes a base ring <b>71</b>, coupling portions <b>72</b>, and a susceptor <b>74</b>. The base ring <b>71</b>, the coupling portions <b>72</b>, and the susceptor <b>74</b> are all made of quartz. In other words, the whole of the holder <b>7</b> is made of quartz.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The base ring <b>71</b> is a quartz member in the form of an annular ring. The base ring <b>71</b> is supported by the wall surface of the chamber <b>6</b> by being placed on the bottom surface of the recessed portion <b>62</b> (with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The multiple coupling portions <b>72</b> (in this preferred embodiment, four coupling portions <b>72</b>) are mounted upright on the upper surface of the base ring <b>71</b> in the form of the annular ring and arranged in a circumferential direction of the base ring <b>71</b>. The coupling portions <b>72</b> are quartz members, and are rigidly secured to the base ring <b>71</b> by welding. The base ring <b>71</b> may be of an arcuate shape such that a portion is removed from the annular ring.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The planar susceptor <b>74</b> is supported by the four coupling portions <b>72</b> provided on the base ring <b>71</b>. The susceptor <b>74</b> is a generally circular planar member made of quartz. The diameter of the susceptor <b>74</b> is greater than that of a semiconductor wafer W. In other words, the susceptor <b>74</b> has a size, as seen in plan view, greater than that of the semiconductor wafer W. Multiple (in this preferred embodiment, five) guide pins <b>76</b> are mounted upright on the upper surface of the susceptor <b>74</b>. The five guide pins <b>76</b> are disposed along the circumference of a circle concentric with the outer circumference of the susceptor <b>74</b>. The diameter of a circle on which the five guide pins <b>76</b> are disposed is slightly greater than the diameter of the semiconductor wafer W. The guide pins <b>76</b> are also made of quartz. The guide pins <b>76</b> may be machined from a quartz ingot integrally with the susceptor <b>74</b>. Alternatively, the guide pins <b>76</b> separately machined may be attached to the susceptor <b>74</b> by welding and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The four coupling portions <b>72</b> provided upright on the base ring <b>71</b> and the lower surface of a peripheral portion of the susceptor <b>74</b> are rigidly secured to each other by welding. In other words, the susceptor <b>74</b> and the base ring <b>71</b> are fixedly coupled to each other with the coupling portions <b>72</b>, and the holder <b>7</b> is an integrally formed member made of quartz. The base ring <b>71</b> of such a holder <b>7</b> is supported by the wall surface of the chamber <b>6</b>, whereby the holder <b>7</b> is mounted to the chamber <b>6</b>. With the holder <b>7</b> mounted to the chamber <b>6</b>, the susceptor <b>74</b> of a generally disc-shaped configuration assumes a horizontal position (a position such that the normal to the susceptor <b>74</b> coincides with a vertical direction). A semiconductor wafer W transported into the chamber <b>6</b> is placed and held in a horizontal position on the susceptor <b>74</b> of the holder <b>7</b> mounted to the chamber <b>6</b>. The semiconductor wafer W is placed inside the circle defined by the five guide pins <b>76</b>. This prevents the horizontal misregistration of the semiconductor wafer W. The number of guide pins <b>76</b> is not limited to five, but may be determined so as to prevent the misregistration of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an opening <b>78</b> and a notch <b>77</b> are provided in the susceptor <b>74</b> so as to extend vertically through the susceptor <b>74</b>. The notch <b>77</b> is provided to allow a distal end portion of a probe of a contact-type thermometer <b>130</b> including a thermocouple to pass therethrough. The opening <b>78</b>, on the other hand, is provided for a radiation thermometer <b>120</b> to receive radiation (infrared radiation) emitted from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W held by the susceptor <b>74</b>. The susceptor <b>74</b> further includes four through holes <b>79</b> bored therein and designed so that lift pins <b>12</b> of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b> to be described later pass through the through holes <b>79</b>, respectively, to transfer a semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a plan view of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a side view of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b>. The transfer mechanism <b>10</b> includes a pair of transfer arms <b>11</b>. The transfer arms <b>11</b> are of an arcuate configuration extending substantially along the annular recessed portion <b>62</b>. Each of the transfer arms <b>11</b> includes the two lift pins <b>12</b> mounted upright thereon. The transfer arms <b>11</b> are pivotable by a horizontal movement mechanism <b>13</b>. The horizontal movement mechanism <b>13</b> moves the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> horizontally between a transfer operation position (a position indicated by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in which a semiconductor wafer W is transferred to and from the holder <b>7</b> and a retracted position (a position indicated by dash-double-dot lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in which the transfer arms <b>11</b> do not overlap the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> as seen in plan view. The horizontal movement mechanism <b>13</b> may be of the type which causes individual motors to pivot the transfer arms <b>11</b> respectively or of the type which uses a linkage mechanism to cause a single motor to pivot the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> in cooperative relation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The transfer arms <b>11</b> are moved upwardly and downwardly together with the horizontal movement mechanism <b>13</b> by an elevating mechanism <b>14</b>. As the elevating mechanism <b>14</b> moves up the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> in their transfer operation position, the four lift pins <b>12</b> in total pass through the respective four through holes <b>79</b> (with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) bored in the susceptor <b>74</b> so that the upper ends of the lift pins <b>12</b> protrude from the upper surface of the susceptor <b>74</b>. On the other hand, as the elevating mechanism <b>14</b> moves down the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> in their transfer operation position to take the lift pins <b>12</b> out of the respective through holes <b>79</b> and the horizontal movement mechanism <b>13</b> moves the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> so as to open the transfer arms <b>11</b>, the transfer arms <b>11</b> move to their retracted position. The retracted position of the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> is immediately over the base ring <b>71</b> of the holder <b>7</b>. The retracted position of the transfer arms <b>11</b> is inside the recessed portion <b>62</b> because the base ring <b>71</b> is placed on the bottom surface of the recessed portion <b>62</b>. An exhaust mechanism not shown is also provided near the location where the drivers (the horizontal movement mechanism <b>13</b> and the elevating mechanism <b>14</b>) of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b> are provided, and is configured to exhaust an atmosphere around the drivers of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b> to the outside of the chamber <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flash heating part <b>5</b> provided over the chamber <b>6</b> includes an enclosure <b>51</b>, a light source provided inside the enclosure <b>51</b> and including the multiple (in this preferred embodiment, 30) xenon flash lamps FL, and a reflector <b>52</b> provided inside the enclosure <b>51</b> so as to cover the light source from above. The flash heating part <b>5</b> further includes a lamp light radiation window <b>53</b> mounted to the bottom of the enclosure <b>51</b>. The lamp light radiation window <b>53</b> forming the floor portion of the flash heating part <b>5</b> is a plate-like quartz window made of quartz. The flash heating part <b>5</b> is provided over the chamber <b>6</b>, whereby the lamp light radiation window <b>53</b> is opposed to the upper chamber window <b>63</b>. The flash lamps FL direct a flash of light from over the chamber <b>6</b> through the lamp light radiation window <b>53</b> and the upper chamber window <b>63</b> toward the heat treatment space <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The flash lamps FL, each of which is a rod-shaped lamp having an elongated cylindrical shape, are arranged in a plane so that the longitudinal directions of the respective flash lamps FL are in parallel with each other along the main surface of a semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> (that is, in a horizontal direction). Thus, a plane defined by the arrangement of the flash lamps FL is also a horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram showing a driving circuit for each flash lamp FL. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a capacitor <b>93</b>, a coil <b>94</b>, a flash lamp FL, and an IGBT (insulated-gate bipolar transistor) <b>96</b> are connected in series. Also as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the controller <b>3</b> includes a pulse generator <b>31</b> and a waveform setting part <b>32</b>, and is connected to an input part <b>33</b>. Examples of the input part <b>33</b> used herein include various known input devices such as a keyboard, a mouse, and a touch panel. The waveform setting part <b>32</b> sets the waveform of a pulse signal, based on an input from the input part <b>33</b>, and the pulse generator <b>31</b> generates the pulse signal in accordance with that waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The flash lamp FL includes a rod-shaped glass tube (discharge tube) <b>92</b> containing xenon gas sealed therein and having positive and negative electrodes provided on opposite ends thereof, and a trigger electrode <b>91</b> attached to the outer peripheral surface of the glass tube <b>92</b>. A power supply unit <b>95</b> applies a predetermined voltage to the capacitor <b>93</b>, and the capacitor <b>93</b> is charged in accordance with the applied voltage (charging voltage). A trigger circuit <b>97</b> is capable of applying a high voltage to the trigger electrode <b>91</b>. The timing of the voltage application from the trigger circuit <b>97</b> to the trigger electrode <b>91</b> is under the control of the controller <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The IGBT <b>96</b> is a bipolar transistor which includes a MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) incorporated in the gate thereof, and is also a switching element suitable for handling a large amount of power. The pulse generator <b>31</b> in the controller <b>3</b> applies the pulse signal to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>. When a voltage (&#x201c;high&#x201d; voltage) not less than a predetermined level is applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>, the IGBT <b>96</b> turns on. When a voltage (&#x201c;low&#x201d; voltage) less than the predetermined level is applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>, the IGBT <b>96</b> turns off. In this manner, the driving circuit including the flash lamp FL is turned on and off by the IGBT <b>96</b>. By turning the IGBT <b>96</b> on and off, a connection between the flash lamp FL and the capacitor <b>93</b> corresponding thereto is made and broken.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Even if, with the capacitor <b>93</b> in the charged state, the IGBT <b>96</b> turns on to apply a high voltage across the electrodes of the glass tube <b>92</b>, no electricity will flow through the glass tube <b>92</b> in a normal state because the xenon gas is electrically insulative. However, when the trigger circuit <b>97</b> applies a high voltage to the trigger electrode <b>91</b> to produce an electrical breakdown, an electrical discharge between the electrodes causes a current to flow momentarily in the glass tube <b>92</b>, so that xenon atoms or molecules are excited at this time to cause light emission.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also, the reflector <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is provided over the plurality of flash lamps FL so as to cover all of the flash lamps FL. A fundamental function of the reflector <b>52</b> is to reflect the light emitted from the plurality of flash lamps FL toward the holder <b>7</b>. The reflector <b>52</b> is a plate made of an aluminum alloy. A surface of the reflector <b>52</b> (a surface which faces the flash lamps FL) is roughened by abrasive blasting to produce a stain finish thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The multiple (in this preferred embodiment, 40) halogen lamps HL are incorporated in the halogen heating part <b>4</b> provided under the chamber <b>6</b>. The halogen lamps HL direct light from under the chamber <b>6</b> through the lower chamber window <b>64</b> toward the heat treatment space <b>65</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a plan view showing an arrangement of the multiple halogen lamps HL. In this preferred embodiment, 20 halogen lamps HL are arranged in an upper tier, and 20 halogen lamps HL are arranged in a lower tier. Each of the halogen lamps HL is a rod-shaped lamp having an elongated cylindrical shape. The 20 halogen lamps HL in the upper tier and the 20 halogen lamps HL in the lower tier are arranged so that the longitudinal directions thereof are in parallel with each other along a main surface of a semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> (that is, in a horizontal direction). Thus, a plane defined by the arrangement of the halogen lamps HL in each of the upper and lower tiers is also a horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the halogen lamps HL in each of the upper and lower tiers are disposed at a higher density in a region opposed to the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> than in a region opposed to the central portion thereof. In other words, the halogen lamps HL in each of the upper and lower tiers are arranged at shorter intervals in the peripheral portion of the lamp arrangement than in the central portion thereof. This allows a greater amount of light to impinge upon the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W where a temperature decrease is prone to occur when the semiconductor wafer W is heated by the irradiation thereof with light from the halogen heating part <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The group of halogen lamps HL in the upper tier and the group of halogen lamps HL in the lower tier are arranged to intersect each other in a lattice pattern. In other words, the 40 halogen lamps HL in total are disposed so that the longitudinal direction of the halogen lamps HL in the upper tier and the longitudinal direction of the halogen lamps HL in the lower tier are orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Each of the halogen lamps HL is a filament-type light source which passes current through a filament disposed in a glass tube to make the filament incandescent, thereby emitting light. A gas prepared by introducing a halogen element (iodine, bromine and the like) in trace amounts into an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon and the like is sealed in the glass tube. The introduction of the halogen element allows the temperature of the filament to be set at a high temperature while suppressing a break in the filament. Thus, the halogen lamps HL have the properties of having a longer life than typical incandescent lamps and being capable of continuously emitting intense light. In addition, the halogen lamps HL, which are rod-shaped lamps, have a long life. The arrangement of the halogen lamps HL in a horizontal direction provides good efficiency of radiation toward the semiconductor wafer W provided over the halogen lamps HL.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> includes the shutter mechanism <b>2</b> provided alongside the halogen heating part <b>4</b> and the chamber <b>6</b>. The shutter mechanism <b>2</b> includes a shutter plate <b>21</b>, and a sliding drive mechanism <b>22</b>. The shutter plate <b>21</b> is a plate opaque to halogen light (light from a halogen light source), and is made of titanium (Ti), for example. The sliding drive mechanism <b>22</b> causes the shutter plate <b>21</b> to slidably move in a horizontal direction, thereby bringing the shutter plate <b>21</b> into and out of a light shielding position lying between the halogen heating part <b>4</b> and the holder <b>7</b>. When the sliding drive mechanism <b>22</b> moves the shutter plate <b>21</b> forward, the shutter plate <b>21</b> is inserted into the light shielding position (a position indicated by dash-double-dot lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) lying between the chamber <b>6</b> and the halogen heating part <b>4</b> to provide isolation between the lower chamber window <b>64</b> and the plurality of halogen lamps HL. Thus, light directed from the plurality of halogen lamps HL toward the holder <b>7</b> in the heat treatment space <b>65</b> is intercepted. On the other hand, when the sliding drive mechanism <b>22</b> moves the shutter plate <b>21</b> backward, the shutter plate <b>21</b> is retracted from the light shielding position lying between the chamber <b>6</b> and the halogen heating part <b>4</b> to open the space lying under the lower chamber window <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The controller <b>3</b> controls the aforementioned various operating mechanisms provided in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> further includes, in addition to the aforementioned components, various cooling structures to prevent an excessive temperature rise in the halogen heating part <b>4</b>, the flash heating part <b>5</b> and the chamber <b>6</b> because of the heat energy generated from the halogen lamps HL and the flash lamps FL during the heat treatment of a semiconductor wafer W.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, a procedure for forming a high dielectric constant film for a semiconductor wafer W to perform a heat treatment on the semiconductor wafer W will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow diagram showing the procedure for the treatment of a semiconductor wafer W. Processes in Step S<b>4</b> and its subsequent steps in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are those performed by the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">First, silicon-germanium layers for a semiconductor wafer W are formed (in Step S<b>1</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a view illustrating the formation of the silicon-germanium layers. A silicon oxide film <b>112</b> (a film of silicon dioxide) is formed on a base material <b>111</b> of monocrystalline silicon (Si) by a thermal oxidation method and the like. A silicon-germanium (SiGe) layer <b>113</b> is grown on the silicon oxide film <b>112</b>. The silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> has a germanium concentration of 25%. This silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> may be formed by epitaxial growth, for example. The silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> with a germanium concentration of 25% is grown on the silicon oxide film <b>112</b> until a first vertical position H<b>1</b> is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At the instant when the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> is grown up to the first vertical position H<b>1</b>, the epitaxial growth is stopped. Thereafter, partial regions of the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> which lie above a second vertical position H<b>2</b> are removed. Silicon-germanium layers <b>114</b> with a germanium concentration of 45% are grown in the regions from which the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> is removed. The silicon-germanium layers <b>114</b> may also be formed by epitaxial growth, for example. The silicon-germanium layers <b>114</b> with a germanium concentration of 45% are grown until the first vertical position H<b>1</b> is reached. That is, the upper surface of the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> with a germanium concentration of 25% and the upper surface of the silicon-germanium layers <b>114</b> with a germanium concentration of 45% form a flat surface at the first vertical position H<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this manner, a silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b> in which the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> with a germanium concentration of 25% (a first germanium concentration) is sandwiched between the silicon-germanium layers <b>114</b> with a germanium concentration of 45% (a second germanium concentration) is formed on the semiconductor wafer W. The silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b> serves as a base layer for the formation of a gate electrode and a gate insulator film to be described later. The germanium concentration in the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> and the germanium concentration in the silicon-germanium layers <b>114</b> are not limited to those described in the aforementioned instance. It is only necessary that the germanium concentration in the silicon-germanium layers <b>114</b> is higher than the germanium concentration in the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a view illustrating the formation of a gate electrode and a gate insulator film. After the process in Step S<b>1</b>, a film <b>116</b> of silicon dioxide is formed on the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> included in the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b>, and a high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> is further formed on the film <b>116</b> of silicon dioxide (in Step S<b>2</b>). The high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> according to the present preferred embodiment includes at least one selected from the group consisting of TiN, ZrN, HfN, VN, NbN, TaN, MoN, WN, TiSiN, HfSiN, VSiN, NbSiN, TaSiN, MoSiN, WSiN, HfAlN, VAlN, NbAlN, TaAlN, MoAlN, and WAlN. The film <b>116</b> of silicon dioxide may be deposited by a thermal oxidation method, for example. The high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> may be deposited by MOCVD, for example. The film <b>116</b> of silicon dioxide and the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> serve as a gate insulator film.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, a gate electrode <b>118</b> is formed on the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> (in Step S<b>3</b>). The gate electrode <b>118</b> according to the present preferred embodiment is a metal gate electrode including at least one metal selected from the group consisting of titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W). The gate electrode <b>118</b> need not be the metal gate electrode, but may be made of polysilicon.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Side walls <b>119</b> made of SiN are formed on the opposite sides of the gate electrode <b>118</b>. The side walls <b>119</b> may be formed prior to the gate electrode <b>118</b> or be formed after the gate electrode <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">After the completion of the processes in Steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>3</b>, the semiconductor wafer W with the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> and the gate electrode <b>118</b> formed on the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b> is transported into the aforementioned heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> (in Step S<b>4</b>). The procedure for the operation in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> which will be described below proceeds under the control of the controller <b>3</b> over the operating mechanisms of the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Prior to the transport of the semiconductor wafer W into the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>, the valve <b>84</b> is opened for supply of gas, and the valves <b>89</b> and <b>192</b> for exhaust of gas are opened, so that the supply and exhaust of gas into and out of the chamber <b>6</b> is started in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>. When the valve <b>84</b> is opened, nitrogen gas is supplied through the gas supply opening <b>81</b> into the heat treatment space <b>65</b>. When the valve <b>89</b> is opened, the gas within the chamber <b>6</b> is exhausted through the gas exhaust opening <b>86</b>. This causes the nitrogen gas supplied from an upper portion of the heat treatment space <b>65</b> in the chamber <b>6</b> to flow downwardly and then to be exhausted from a lower portion of the heat treatment space <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The gas within the chamber <b>6</b> is exhausted also through the transport opening <b>66</b> by opening the valve <b>192</b>. Further, the exhaust mechanism not shown exhausts an atmosphere near the drivers of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b>. It should be noted that the nitrogen gas is continuously supplied into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> during the heat treatment of a semiconductor wafer W in the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>. The amount of nitrogen gas supplied into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> is changed as appropriate in accordance with the process steps.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Subsequently, the gate valve <b>185</b> is opened to open the transport opening <b>66</b>. A transport robot outside the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> transports the semiconductor wafer W with the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> and the gate electrode <b>118</b> formed therein through the transport opening <b>66</b> into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> in the chamber <b>6</b>. The semiconductor wafer W transported into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> by the transport robot is moved forward to a position lying immediately over the holder <b>7</b> and is stopped thereat. Then, the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b> is moved horizontally from the retracted position to the transfer operation position and is then moved upwardly, whereby the lift pins <b>12</b> pass through the through holes <b>79</b> and protrude from the upper surface of the susceptor <b>74</b> to receive the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">After the semiconductor wafer W is placed on the lift pins <b>12</b>, the transport robot moves out of the heat treatment space <b>65</b>, and the gate valve <b>185</b> closes the transport opening <b>66</b>. Then, the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> moves downwardly to transfer the semiconductor wafer W from the transfer mechanism <b>10</b> to the susceptor <b>74</b> of the holder <b>7</b>, so that the semiconductor wafer W is held in a horizontal position. The semiconductor wafer W is held on the susceptor <b>74</b> so that a surface thereof where the gate electrode <b>118</b> is formed is the upper surface. Also, the semiconductor wafer W is held inside the five guide pins <b>76</b> on the upper surface of the susceptor <b>74</b>. The pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> moved downwardly below the susceptor <b>74</b> is moved back to the retracted position, i.e. to the inside of the recessed portion <b>62</b>, by the horizontal movement mechanism <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">After the semiconductor wafer W is placed and held on the susceptor <b>74</b> of the holder <b>7</b>, the <b>40</b> halogen lamps HL in the halogen heating part <b>4</b> turn on simultaneously to start preheating (or assist-heating) (in Step S<b>5</b>). Halogen light emitted from the halogen lamps HL is transmitted through the lower chamber window <b>64</b> and the susceptor <b>74</b> both made of quartz, and impinges upon the back surface of the semiconductor wafer W. The semiconductor wafer W is irradiated with the halogen light from the halogen lamps HL, so that the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W increases. It should be noted that the transfer arms <b>11</b> of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b>, which are retracted to the inside of the recessed portion <b>62</b>, do not become an obstacle to the heating using the halogen lamps HL.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a graph showing changes in the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W. After the semiconductor wafer W is transported into the heat treatment space <b>65</b> and is placed on the susceptor <b>74</b>, the controller <b>3</b> turns on the <b>40</b> halogen lamps HL at time t<b>0</b>, so that the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W irradiated with the halogen light is increased to a preheating temperature T<b>1</b>. The preheating temperature T<b>1</b> is in the range of 600&#xb0; to 900&#xb0; C., and shall be 800&#xb0; C. in the present preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The temperature of the semiconductor wafer W is measured with the contact-type thermometer <b>130</b> when the halogen lamps HL perform preheating. Specifically, the contact-type thermometer <b>130</b> incorporating a thermocouple comes through the notch <b>77</b> into contact with the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W held by the susceptor <b>74</b> to measure the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W which is on the increase. The measured temperature of the semiconductor wafer W is transmitted to the controller <b>3</b>. The controller <b>3</b> controls the output from the halogen lamps HL while monitoring whether the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W which is on the increase by the irradiation with light from the halogen lamps HL reaches the predetermined preheating temperature T<b>1</b> or not. In other words, the controller <b>3</b> effects feedback control of the output from the halogen lamps HL, based on the value measured with the contact-type thermometer <b>130</b>, so that the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W is equal to the preheating temperature T<b>1</b>. It should be noted that, when the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W is increased by the irradiation with light from the halogen lamps HL, the temperature is not measured with the radiation thermometer <b>120</b>. This is because the halogen light emitted from the halogen lamps HL enters the radiation thermometer <b>120</b> in the form of disturbance light to obstruct the precise measurement of the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">After the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W reaches the preheating temperature T<b>1</b>, the controller <b>3</b> maintains the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W at the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> for a short time. Specifically, at time t<b>1</b> when the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W measured with the contact-type thermometer <b>130</b> reaches the preheating temperature T<b>1</b>, the controller <b>3</b> controls the output from the halogen lamps HL to maintain the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W at approximately the preheating temperature T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">By performing such preheating using the halogen lamps HL, the temperature of the entire semiconductor wafer W is uniformly increased to the preheating temperature T<b>1</b>. In the stage of preheating using the halogen lamps HL, the semiconductor wafer W shows a tendency to be lower in temperature in a peripheral portion thereof where heat dissipation is liable to occur than in a central portion thereof. However, the halogen lamps HL in the halogen heating part <b>4</b> are disposed at a higher density in the region opposed to the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W than in the region opposed to the central portion thereof. This causes a greater amount of light to impinge upon the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W where heat dissipation is liable to occur, thereby providing a uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W in the stage of preheating. Further, the inner peripheral surface of the lower reflective ring <b>69</b> mounted to the chamber side portion <b>61</b> is provided as a mirror surface. Thus, a greater amount of light is reflected from the inner peripheral surface of the lower reflective ring <b>69</b> toward the peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer W. This provides a more uniform in-plane temperature distribution of the semiconductor wafer W in the stage of preheating.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, the flash lamps FL emit a flash of light to perform a heating treatment at time t<b>2</b> when a predetermined time period has elapsed since the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W reached the preheating temperature T<b>1</b>. It should be noted that a time period required for the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W at room temperature to reach the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> (a time interval between the time t<b>0</b> and the time t<b>1</b>) is only on the order of several seconds, and that a time period required between the instant at which the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W reaches the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> and the instant at which the flash lamps FL emit light (a time interval between the time t<b>1</b> and the time t<b>2</b>) is also only on the order of several seconds. For flash irradiation from a flash lamp FL, the capacitor <b>93</b> is charged in advance by the power supply unit <b>95</b>. Then, with the capacitor <b>93</b> in the charged state, the pulse generator <b>31</b> in the controller <b>3</b> outputs a pulse signal to the IGBT <b>96</b> to drive the IGBT <b>96</b> on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a graph showing an example of a correlation between the waveform of the pulse signal and a current flowing through a flash lamp FL. In the present preferred embodiment, the pulse signal having a waveform as shown in an upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is outputted from the pulse generator <b>31</b>. The waveform of the pulse signal is specified by inputting from the input part <b>33</b> a recipe that is a sequence of defined parameters including a time interval (ON time) equivalent to the pulse width and a time interval (OFF time) between pulses. After an operator inputs such a recipe from the input part <b>33</b> to the controller <b>3</b>, the waveform setting part <b>32</b> in the controller <b>3</b> sets a pulse waveform having repeated ON and OFF time intervals as shown in the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> in accordance with the recipe. Pulses PA which are relatively long in pulse width and short in time intervals therebetween are set in an early part of the pulse waveform shown in the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and pulses PB which are relatively short in pulse width and long in time intervals therebetween are set in a late part thereof. Then, the pulse generator <b>31</b> outputs the pulse signal in accordance with the pulse waveform set by the waveform setting part <b>32</b>. As a result, the pulse signal having the waveform as shown in the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> to control the driving on and off of the IGBT <b>96</b>. Specifically, the IGBT <b>96</b> is on when the pulse signal inputted to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> is on, and the IGBT <b>96</b> is off when the pulse signal is off.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In synchronism with the turning on of the pulse signal outputted from the pulse generator <b>31</b>, the controller <b>3</b> controls the trigger circuit <b>97</b> to apply a high voltage (trigger voltage) to the trigger electrode <b>91</b>. The pulse signal is inputted to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>, with the electrical charges stored in the capacitor <b>93</b>, and the high voltage is applied to the trigger electrode <b>91</b> in synchronism with the turning on of the pulse signal, whereby a current flows across the electrodes of the glass tube <b>92</b> whenever the pulse signal is on. The resultant excitation of xenon atoms or molecules induces light emission.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The pulse signal having the waveform shown in the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is outputted from the controller <b>3</b> to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>, and the high voltage is applied to the trigger electrode <b>91</b> in synchronism with the turning on of the pulse signal, whereby a current having a waveform as shown in a lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> flows through the circuit including the flash lamp FL. Specifically, the value of the current flowing in the glass tube <b>92</b> of the flash lamp FL increases when the pulse signal inputted to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> is on, and decreases when the pulse signal is off. It should be noted that an individual current waveform corresponding to each pulse is defined by the constant of the coil <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The current having the waveform shown in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> flows, so that the flash lamp FL emits light. The emission output from the flash lamp FL is roughly proportional to the current flowing through the flash lamp FL. Thus, the output waveform (profile) of the emission output from the flash lamp FL has a pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> is irradiated with light in accordance with the output waveform from the flash lamp FL as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">If the flash lamp FL emits light without using the IGBT <b>96</b>, the electrical charges stored in the capacitor <b>93</b> are consumed momentarily by emitting light only once, so that the output waveform from the flash lamp FL exhibits a single pulse having a width on the order of 0.1 to 10 milliseconds. On the other hand, the IGBT <b>96</b> serving as a switching element is connected in the circuit and the pulse signal as shown in the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is outputted to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> according to the present preferred embodiment. Thus, the IGBT <b>96</b> intermittently supplies the electrical charges from the capacitor <b>93</b> to the flash lamp FL to control the current flowing to the flash lamp FL. As a result, the light emission from the flash lamp FL is accordingly chopper-controlled, which allows the electrical charges stored in the capacitor <b>93</b> to be consumed in a divided manner. This enables the flash lamp FL to repeatedly flash on and off in an extremely short time. It should be noted that, before the value of the current reaches exactly zero, the next pulse is applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> to increase the current value again, as shown in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. For this reason, the emission output never reaches exactly zero even while the flash lamp FL repeatedly flashes on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The output waveform of light shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> may be regarded to show that two-stage irradiation with light is performed. Specifically, the two-stage irradiation includes a first stage of irradiation (first irradiation) from time t<b>21</b> at which the flash lamp FL starts emitting light to time t<b>22</b> at which the emission output is at its maximum, and a second stage of irradiation (second irradiation) from the time t<b>22</b> to time t<b>23</b> during which the emission output decreases gradually.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">More specifically, the pulse generator <b>31</b> first intermittently applies the pulses PA which are relatively long in pulse width and short in time intervals therebetween to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> to cause the IGBT <b>96</b> to repeatedly turn on and off, whereby a current flows through the circuit including the flash lamp FL. At this stage, because the pulses PA which are relatively long in pulse width and short in time intervals therebetween are applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>, the ON time of the IGBT <b>96</b> is longer than the OFF time thereof, so that the current flowing through the flash lamp FL has a sawtooth waveform which increases as seen in general view (as shown in an early part of the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). The flash lamp FL through which the current having such a waveform flows performs the first irradiation such that the emission output increases from the time t<b>21</b> to the time t<b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, the pulse generator <b>31</b> intermittently applies the pulses PB which are relatively short in pulse width and long in time intervals therebetween to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>. At this stage, because the pulses PB which are relatively short in pulse width and long in time intervals therebetween are applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b>, the ON time of the IGBT <b>96</b> is shorter than the OFF time thereof in a manner contrary to the above, so that the current flowing through the flash lamp FL has a sawtooth waveform which decreases gradually as seen in general view (as shown in a late part of the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). The flash lamp FL through which the current having such a waveform flows performs the second irradiation such that the emission output decreases gradually from the time t<b>22</b> to the time t<b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">By performing the two-stage irradiation with light as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> on the semiconductor wafer W, the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W increases from the preheating temperature Ti to a target temperature T<b>2</b>, and the temperature profile thereof has a pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. More specifically, the first irradiation performed from the time t<b>21</b> to the time t<b>22</b> causes the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W to increase from the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> to the target temperature T<b>2</b> (in Step S<b>6</b>). The target temperature T<b>2</b> is in the range of 1000&#xb0; to 1200&#xb0; C. where the crystallization of the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> of the gate is promoted, and shall be 1100&#xb0; C. in the present preferred embodiment. The time period from the time t<b>21</b> to the time t<b>22</b> during which the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W is increased by the first irradiation is in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The second irradiation performed from the time t<b>22</b> to the time t<b>23</b> maintains the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W within a &#xb1;25&#xb0; C. range around the target temperature T<b>2</b> (in Step S<b>7</b>). The time period from the time t<b>22</b> to the time t<b>23</b> during which the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W is maintained within a &#xb1;25&#xb0; C. range around the target temperature T<b>2</b> is in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second. It should be noted that the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is plotted with a time scale of seconds, whereas the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is plotted with a time scale of milliseconds. Thus, the times t<b>21</b> to t<b>23</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> are shown as substantially overlaid on the time t<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">After the second irradiation using the flash lamp FL is completed, the IGBT <b>96</b> turns off to stop the light emission from the flash lamp FL (in Step S<b>8</b>). Then, the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W decreases rapidly from the target temperature T<b>2</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the halogen lamps HL turn off at time t<b>3</b> which is a predetermined time period later than the completion of the second irradiation (in Step S<b>9</b>). This causes the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W to start decreasing from the preheating temperature T<b>1</b>. At the same time that the halogen lamps HL turn off, the shutter mechanism <b>2</b> inserts the shutter plate <b>21</b> into the light shielding position lying between the halogen heating part <b>4</b> and the chamber <b>6</b>. The temperatures of filaments and tube walls of the halogen lamps HL do not decrease immediately after the halogen lamps HL turn off, but radiant heat is continuously emitted from the filaments and the tube walls at elevated temperature for a short time interval to obstruct the temperature decrease of the semiconductor wafer W. The insertion of the shutter plate <b>21</b> interrupts the radiant heat emitted from the halogen lamps HL immediately after the turning off toward the heat treatment space <b>65</b> to increase the rate at which the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At the time of the insertion of the shutter plate <b>21</b> into the light shielding position, the radiation thermometer <b>120</b> starts measuring the temperature. Specifically, the radiation thermometer <b>120</b> measures the intensity of infrared radiation emitted from the lower surface of the semiconductor wafer W held by the holder <b>7</b> through the opening <b>78</b> of the susceptor <b>74</b> to measure the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W which is on the decrease. The measured temperature of the semiconductor wafer W is transmitted to the controller <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Some radiant light is continuously emitted from the halogen lamps HL at elevated temperature immediately after the turning off. The radiation thermometer <b>120</b>, however, measures the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W when the shutter plate <b>21</b> is inserted in the light shielding position. Thus, the radiant light directed from the halogen lamps HL toward the heat treatment space <b>65</b> of the chamber <b>6</b> is interrupted. This allows the radiation thermometer <b>120</b> to precisely measure the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W held by the susceptor <b>74</b> without being influenced by disturbance light.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The controller <b>3</b> monitors whether the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W measured with the radiation thermometer <b>120</b> decreases to a predetermined temperature or not. After the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W decreases to the predetermined temperature or below, the pair of transfer arms <b>11</b> of the transfer mechanism <b>10</b> is moved horizontally again from the retracted position to the transfer operation position and is then moved upwardly, whereby the lift pins <b>12</b> protrude from the upper surface of the susceptor <b>74</b> to receive the heat-treated semiconductor wafer W from the susceptor <b>74</b>. Subsequently, the transport opening <b>66</b> which has been closed is opened by the gate valve <b>185</b>, and the transport robot outside the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> transports the semiconductor wafer W placed on the lift pins <b>12</b> to the outside (in Step S<b>10</b>). Thus, the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> completes the heating treatment of the semiconductor wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the present preferred embodiment, the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b> in which the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> with a relatively low concentration is sandwiched between the silicon-germanium layers <b>114</b> with a relatively high concentration is formed on the semiconductor wafer W. Then, the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> is formed on the film <b>116</b> of silicon dioxide which in turn is formed on the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> with a relatively low concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">There is a difference in lattice constant between the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> with a low concentration and the silicon-germanium layers <b>114</b> with a high concentration. This creates distortion in the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b>. The distortion causes stresses directed inwardly (from the silicon-germanium layers <b>114</b> lying on the opposite sides toward the silicon-germanium layer <b>113</b> lying inside) in the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b>. The action of such stresses causes current to flow more easily to a source and a drain.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">On the other hand, the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> deposited at a relatively low temperature by MOCVD and the like is not high in crystallinity. It is hence necessary to anneal the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> at 1000&#xb0; C. or higher, thereby promoting the crystallization of the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b>. However, if this is done by spike annealing and the like, the distortion in the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b> is alleviated, so that the acting stresses are decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the present preferred embodiment, the semiconductor wafer W in which the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> is formed on the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b> is transported into the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>, and is heated by the flash irradiation from the flash lamps FL. Prior to the flash irradiation, the semiconductor wafer W is preheated by increasing the temperature of the semiconductor wafer W up to the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> in the range of 600&#xb0; to 900&#xb0; C. The preheating temperature T<b>1</b> shall be not higher than 900&#xb0; C. for the purpose of preventing the relaxation of the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">For the flash irradiation, the first irradiation is initially performed for which the pulses PA which are relatively long in pulse width and short in time intervals therebetween are intermittently applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> whereby the emission output from the flash lamp FL is changed from zero up to a maximum value over a time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second. Such first irradiation causes the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W to increase from the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> to the target temperature T<b>2</b> for the time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second (in the present preferred embodiment, to increase by 300&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The crystallization of the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> is promoted by increasing the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W to the target temperature T<b>2</b>. Also, the increase in the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W from the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> to the target temperature T<b>2</b> over a time period not less than 3 milliseconds prevents the occurrence of process-induced damage to a device (the gate electrode <b>118</b> and the like) formed on the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W. If the time period for which the temperature is increased is longer than 1 second, there is a danger that the distortion in the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b> is alleviated, so that the stresses are decreased. For these reasons, the time period for which the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W is increased from the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> to the target temperature T<b>2</b> shall be in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, after the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W is increased from the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> to the target temperature T<b>2</b>, the second irradiation is performed for which the pulses PB which are relatively short in pulse width and long in time intervals therebetween are intermittently applied to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> whereby the emission output from the flash lamp FL is decreased gradually from the maximum value over a time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second. Such second irradiation maintains the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W within a &#xb1;25&#xb0; C. range around the target temperature T<b>2</b> for the time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The crystallization of the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> is further promoted by maintaining the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W near the target temperature T<b>2</b> for the time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second. Because the time period for which the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W is maintained near the target temperature T<b>2</b> is less than 1 second, the crystallization of the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> is promoted while the relaxation of the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b> is suppressed. If the time period for which the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W is maintained within a &#xb1;25&#xb0; C. range around the target temperature T<b>2</b> is less than 3 milliseconds, there is a danger that the crystallization of the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> is insufficient. On the other hand, if this time period is greater than 1 second, there is a danger that the distortion in the silicon-germanium layer <b>115</b> is alleviated. For these reasons, the time period for which the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W is maintained within a &#xb1;25&#xb0; C. range around the target temperature T<b>2</b> shall be in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Also, the flatness of the interface between the high dielectric constant film <b>117</b> and the film <b>116</b> of silicon dioxide is improved by maintaining the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W near the target temperature T<b>2</b> for the time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second. Further, since the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W is maintained near the target temperature T<b>2</b> for a time period of not less than 3 milliseconds, electron traps resulting from abrupt increase and decrease in temperature are prevented from being created in crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The provision of the temperature maintaining step for maintaining the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W within a &#xb1;25&#xb0; C. range around the target temperature T<b>2</b> for the time period in the range of 3 milliseconds to 1 second facilitates a simulation of heat conduction in the semiconductor wafer W and the like, as compared with an instance where the temperature of the front surface decreases immediately after the target temperature T<b>2</b> is reached. As a result, phenomena resulting from the heating treatment are precisely analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">While the preferred embodiment according to the present invention has been described hereinabove, various modifications of the present invention in addition to those described above may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, in the aforementioned preferred embodiment, the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W is increased from the preheating temperature T<b>1</b> to the target temperature T<b>2</b> by the first irradiation, and is then maintained near the target temperature T<b>2</b> by the second irradiation subsequent to the first irradiation. However, the temperature maintained by the second irradiation is not limited to the target temperature T<b>2</b>. As an example, when the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W is decreased by 50&#xb0; to 200&#xb0; C. from the target temperature T<b>2</b> following a slight time interval after reaching the target temperature T<b>2</b>, the second irradiation may be started to maintain the temperature of the front surface of the semiconductor wafer W within a &#xb1;25&#xb0; C. range around the decreased temperature (a second target temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The silicon-germanium layers are formed on the semiconductor wafer W in the aforementioned preferred embodiment. In place of the silicon-germanium layers, silicon carbide (SiC) layers may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Also, the process for setting the waveform of the pulse signal is not limited to inputting the parameters including the pulse width and the like one by one from the input part <b>33</b>. For example, the setting of the waveform may be done by an operator inputting the waveform directly in graphical form from the input part <b>33</b>, by reading the waveform previously set and stored in a storage part such as a magnetic disk and the like, or by downloading the waveform from outside the heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Further, although the voltage is applied to the trigger electrode <b>91</b> in synchronism with the turning on of the pulse signal in the aforementioned preferred embodiment, the timing of the application of the trigger voltage is not limited to this. The trigger voltage may be applied at fixed time intervals independently of the waveform of the pulse signal. In a case where the pulse signal is short in time intervals or where the passage of current is started by a pulse while the value of the current caused to flow through the flash lamp FL by the preceding pulse is not less than a predetermined value, the current continues to flow through the flash lamp FL without interruption. In such a case, it is not necessary to apply the trigger voltage for each pulse. In a case where all of the pulse intervals of the pulse signal are shorter than a predetermined value as shown in the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> according to the aforementioned preferred embodiment, the trigger voltage may be applied only when the first pulse is applied. Thereafter, the current waveform as shown in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is provided only by outputting the pulse signal as shown in the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to the gate of the IGBT <b>96</b> without the application of the trigger voltage. In other words, the timing of the application of the trigger voltage may be arbitrarily determined as long as the timing of the current flow through the flash lamp FL coincides with the turning on of the pulse signal.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Although the IGBT <b>96</b> is used as a switching element in the aforementioned preferred embodiment, another transistor capable of turning on and off the circuit in accordance with the signal level inputted to the gate thereof may be used in place of the IGBT <b>96</b>. It is, however, preferable to use an IGBT and a GTO (gate turn-off) thyristor which are suitable for handling high power as a switching element because the emission of light from the flash lamps FL consumes considerably high power.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Also, a circuit configuration different from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be employed as long as multi-stage irradiation with light from the flash lamp FL is achieved. For example, a plurality of power supply circuits having different coil constants may be connected to a single flash lamp FL. Also, as long as the multi-stage irradiation with light is achieved, the light source is not limited to the flash lamp FL, but is required only to be capable of emitting light for not more than 1 second. As an example, a laser may be used as the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Although the 30 flash lamps FL are provided in the flash heating part <b>5</b> according to the aforementioned preferred embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this. Any number of flash lamps FL may be provided. The flash lamps FL are not limited to the xenon flash lamps, but may be krypton flash lamps. Also, the number of halogen lamps HL provided in the halogen heating part <b>4</b> is not limited to 40. Any number of halogen lamps HL may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Also, in the aforementioned preferred embodiment, the semiconductor wafer W is preheated by irradiating the semiconductor wafer W with halogen light from the halogen lamps HL. The technique for preheating is not limited to this, but the semiconductor wafer W may be preheated by placing the semiconductor wafer W on a hot plate.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Moreover, a substrate to be treated by the heat treatment apparatus according to the present invention is not limited to a semiconductor wafer, but may be a glass substrate for use in a flat panel display for a liquid crystal display apparatus and the like, and a substrate for a solar cell.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">While the invention has been described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is understood that numerous other modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
