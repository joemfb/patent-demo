<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Autofill is a function in some computer applications or programs, typically those containing forms, which fills in a data entry field automatically. In some accounting applications, when entering a transaction as a line item in a form typically, accountants may receive prompts for autofill of account categories, check numbers, deposit references, etc. based on a previous entry of the line item. For example, if accountant X enters a transaction for &#x201c;ABC Plumbing Store&#x201d; and assigns it &#x201c;HARDWARE EXPENSES&#x201d; category, the accounting application remembers this and, the next time accountant X enters another transaction for &#x201c;ABC Plumbing Store&#x201d;, the accounting application prompts with a pre-fill of &#x201c;HADWARE EXPENSES.&#x201d; However, if another user, say accountant Y, from the same accounting firm enters yet another transaction for &#x201c;ABC Plumbing Store&#x201d; in accountant Y's copy of the accounting application, that user may not be prompted with any autofill category, requiring that accountant Y to manually check with accountant X regarding whether any category has been previously assigned to avoid proliferation in inconsistently assigned categories. In a typical accounting firm, there may be hundreds of transactions entered by multiple accountants on behalf of scores of clients, thus creating a huge inefficiency in recording these transactions.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying figures. Like elements in the various figures are denoted by like reference numerals for consistency.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the invention provide a method and system to collect each user's first time entries of categories or subsequent reclassification of categories in an accounting application, and recording those in a &#x201c;social/community contribution&#x201d; database (also referred to as a user behavior database). Based on this social/community contribution database, the accounting application performs an autofill function that prompts all users with options to adopt community defined categories. For example, if accountant X were assigning &#x201c;ABC Plumbing Store&#x201d; to &#x201c;HARDWARE EXPENSES&#x201d; category, that information will now become available based on pre-determined criteria and in a central repository (also referred to as the rules database) for that accounting firm, allowing subsequent users, such as accountant Y, to benefit from the social/community contribution of other users.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a similar fashion, accountants will set up rules in an accounting application that capture certain tasks such as adjusting for depreciation, prepaid insurance, etc. This may be done through a user interface (UI) that offers the accountant a formula and the periodicity for executing the adjustment. According to the setting, the task is periodically executed and corresponding journal entries are made. For example, if the accountant sets a rule such as &#x201c;Adjust Insurance Premium by 1/12 every month,&#x201d; the following will happen on a monthly basis: account &#x201c;PREPAID INSURANCE&#x201d; is credited 1/12 the insurance premium and account &#x201c;INSURANCE EXPENSES&#x201d; is debited that same amount. Similar to sharing the user assigned category in the community database as community defined category, the periodicity for conducting such task and the required formula used by a user may also be shared via the community contributed rules database as community defined periodicity and/or community defined formula. For example, the community defined periodicity and/or community defined formula may be used to perform an autofill functionality, which prompts all users with options to adopt them.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another example, in the case of account receivable (A/R) write-offs, the users may choose not to set a rule. The statistical behaviors of write-offs among many accountants may be tracked to determine that the average value written off is $225 after 6 months. This can be converted into a community defined rule and used in the same manner as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a schematic block diagram of a system (<b>100</b>) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. In one or more embodiments of the invention, one or more of the modules and elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be omitted, repeated, and/or substituted. Accordingly, embodiments of the invention should not be considered limited to the specific arrangements of modules shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The system (<b>100</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the components of a system for community contributed rules in online accounting systems in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system (<b>100</b>) includes a user A (<b>101</b><i>a</i>) who is a user of a user computer A (<b>110</b>) executing accounting application instance A (<b>111</b><i>a</i>), a user B (<b>101</b><i>b</i>) who is a user of a user computer B (<b>120</b>) installed with a web browser (<b>121</b>) configured to access via a computer network (<b>150</b>) accounting application instance B (<b>111</b><i>b</i>) executing on an accounting application system (<b>130</b>). In addition, the system (<b>100</b>) includes an accounting application configuration system (<b>121</b>) to configure parameters of the accounting application instance A (<b>111</b><i>a</i>) and the accounting application instance B (<b>111</b><i>b</i>). In one or more embodiments of the invention, each of the accounting application instance A (<b>111</b><i>a</i>) and the accounting application instance B (<b>111</b><i>b</i>) is a copy of the accounting application (<b>130</b>). Accordingly, the user A (<b>101</b><i>a</i>) and the user B (<b>101</b><i>b</i>) are also referred to as users of the accounting application (<b>130</b>). Although not explicitly shown, there may be multiple users each using respective user computer to execute, either locally or via the computer network (<b>150</b>), a respective instance of the accounting application (<b>130</b>). These multiple users form a community (<b>140</b>). In one or more embodiments, the user computer A (<b>110</b>) and the user computer B (<b>120</b>) may be a desktop computer, a notebook computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, or other computing device configured with data communication capability. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the computer network (<b>150</b>) may include local area network, wide area network, Internet, mobile phone network, WIFI, or any other suitable wired and/or wireless data network.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one or more embodiments, the users (e.g., user A (<b>101</b><i>a</i>), user B (<b>101</b><i>b</i>)) of the community (<b>140</b>) may be accountants who work for an accounting firm that provides accounting service to a number of clients. Each client may be assigned an account to organize its accounting information using the accounting application (<b>130</b>). For example, the accounting information of each client may be recorded in a journal of its account by the accountants. Once recorded, the accountants may also use the accounting application (<b>130</b>) to generate various accounting reports for the client based on the recorded journal. The accounting report may be related to or based on tasks performed on the accounting information, such as depreciation of an asset, write-off of a receivable, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one or more embodiments, the accounting information recorded in the journal is categorized into multiple categories that are classified using classification tags. For example, such categories may be used to organize the accounting information into sales transaction, account receivable, account payable, expense, depreciation, etc. Each category may be further divided into sub-categories, such as cash transaction sub-category and credit card transaction sub-category under the sales transaction category, hardware expense sub-category and travel expense sub-category under the expense category, etc. In particular, sales transaction, cash transaction, credit card transaction, account receivable, account payable, expense, depreciation, etc. are referred to as classification tags that describe the categories and sub-categories. The structure of the categories and sub-categories is referred to as the category organization. Generally, the accounting information and various reports derived therefrom are presented, according to the category organization, to the accountants (e.g., user A (<b>101</b><i>a</i>), user B (<b>101</b><i>b</i>)) for review before presenting to the clients. In one or more embodiments, a single category organization may be used for multiple client accounts that are in the same industry and sharing similar characteristics. For example multiple clients in manufacturing business may share the same category organization to organize accounting information for their accounts. In one or more embodiments, different category organizations may be used for different client accounts that are in different industries and having different characteristics. For example a client in manufacturing business and another client in personal service business may use different category organizations. Generally, different clients may have different requirements for category organization to present accounting information and reports, as well as different requirements for other aspects of accounting tasks, such as determining depreciation, write-off, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one or more embodiments, the accounting application configuration system (<b>121</b>) includes a user module (<b>122</b>) and a community input analyzer (<b>123</b>), which are software and/or firmware modules executing on the processor (<b>124</b>). In one or more embodiments, the processor (<b>124</b>) may be a microprocessor or any other computer circuit capable of executing software instructions. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the accounting application configuration system (<b>121</b>) further includes the repository (<b>125</b>) that is configured to store client and user attribute (<b>126</b>), user behavior database (<b>127</b>), and rules database (<b>128</b>). In one or more embodiments, the repository (<b>125</b>) may be a disk storage device, a flash memory device, or other suitable memory or data storage device. Each module of the system (<b>100</b>) is described in details below.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one or more embodiments, the user module (<b>122</b>) is configured to receive metadata from users of the community (<b>140</b>), where the metadata includes one or more user defined classification tags associated with one or more accounts of the accounting application (<b>130</b>). For example, the user A (<b>101</b><i>a</i>) may have defined a classification tag &#x201c;HARDWARE EXPENSE&#x201d; to categorize purchases made by client X from the vendor &#x201c;ABC Plumbing Store&#x201d; while the user B (<b>101</b><i>b</i>) may have defined a classification tag &#x201c;MICELLANEOUS EXPENSE&#x201d; to categorize purchases made by client Y from the vendor &#x201c;ABC Plumbing Store.&#x201d; In one or more embodiments, such user actions in defining these classification tags are referred to as user behaviors that occur when the user enters for the first time, or subsequently reclassify, a transaction associated a particular client and a particular vendor. In one or more embodiments, the user behaviors are captured by the user module (<b>122</b>) as metadata and stored in the user behavior database (<b>127</b>). In one or more embodiments, the stored metadata may be used to perform the autofill functionality when the user later enters another transaction associated with the same client and the same vendor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one or more embodiments, the user behavior database (<b>127</b>) is structured to index the classification tags by the user, client, vendor (or payee), and/or customer (or payor) associated with the accounting record for which the classification tag is initially defined. For example in the user behavior database (<b>127</b>), the classification tag &#x201c;HARDWARE EXPENSE&#x201d; is indexed by a user identifier of the user A (<b>101</b><i>a</i>) and a vendor identifier of the vendor &#x201c;ABC Plumbing Store&#x201d; while the classification tag &#x201c;MICELLANEOUS EXPENSE&#x201d; is indexed by another user identifier of the user B (<b>101</b><i>b</i>) and the vendor identifier of the vendor &#x201c;ABC Plumbing Store.&#x201d; In one or more embodiments, attributes of the user (e.g., user A (<b>101</b><i>a</i>), user B (<b>101</b><i>b</i>)) and the clients (not shown) are also captured by the user module (<b>122</b>) as metadata and stored as the client and user attribute (<b>126</b>). For example, the user attribute may include title, job code, seniority, experience level, authority, etc. of the user (e.g., user A (<b>101</b><i>a</i>), user B (<b>101</b><i>b</i>)) while the client attribute may include industry, location, employee count, revenue size, client specified requirement, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one or more embodiments, the user module (<b>122</b>) is further configured to send one or more community defined classification tags to a particular user's instance of the accounting application (<b>130</b>). For example, a community defined classification tag may be sent when it is generated, when a pre-determined event occurs, or in response to a request from the particular user's instance (e.g., accounting application instance A (<b>111</b><i>a</i>), accounting application instance B (<b>111</b><i>b</i>)) of the accounting application (<b>130</b>). In one or more embodiments, the one or more community defined classification tags are configured to be used by the particular user's instance (e.g., accounting application instance A (<b>111</b><i>a</i>), accounting application instance B (<b>111</b><i>b</i>)) of the accounting application (<b>130</b>) for performing the autofill functionality. Based on the autofilled classification tag(s) (i.e., the community defined classification tag(s)) being accepted by the particular user, the community defined classification tags are used to organize the accounting information in the particular user's instance (e.g., accounting application instance A (<b>111</b><i>a</i>), accounting application instance B (<b>111</b><i>b</i>)) of the accounting application. For example, the user A (<b>101</b><i>a</i>) may accept the autofilled classification tag(s) (i.e., the community defined classification tag(s)) and uses them to organize and present information regarding the particular user's instance of the accounting application (<b>130</b>) according to the category organization specified by the community defined classification tags. In one or more embodiments, the category organization is used to group accounting information of the one or more accounts based on the community defined classification tags. In one or more embodiments, the category organization includes a hierarchical structure of community defined classification tags. In one or more embodiments, the accounting application (<b>130</b>) may initially have a default category organization, which may be modified later based on the community defined classification tags.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one or more embodiments, the community input analyzer (<b>123</b>) is configured to create the aforementioned one or more community defined classification tags from metadata stored in the user behavior database (<b>127</b>) and the client and user attribute (<b>126</b>). In one or more embodiments, the one or more community defined classification tags are selected from the various user defined classification tags and represent a preferred category organization, based on community inputs of the community (<b>140</b>), within the accounting application (<b>130</b>). In one or more embodiments, a community defined classification tag used to categorize accounting records associated with a vendor (or a payee) is selected from those user defined classification tags indexed in the user behavior database (<b>127</b>) by the vendor identifier of the vendor. For example, these user defined classification tags associated with the same vendor may be scored based on the time when they are each defined, a tally of how many users define the same classification tags, the user attributes of the users defining them, the client attributes of the clients associated with them, or combinations thereof. For example, the user defined classification tag that was defined first may be treated as the precedence and selected as the community defined classification tag. In another example, the user defined classification tag that was commonly defined by most number of users may be treated as the majority and selected as the community defined classification tag. In yet another example, the user defined classification tag that was defined by a user having the most significant title, job code, seniority, experience level, authority may be treated as carrying highest weight and selected as the community defined classification tag. In still another example, the community defined classification tag may be selected based on a requirement imposed by client industry or other client attribute or client specification.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one or more embodiments, a score is calculated for each user defined classification tag used to categorize accounting records associated with a vendor based on a pre-determined weighting scheme of the title, job code, seniority, experience level, and authority of the user and industry or other client attribute or client specification of the client. Accordingly, the community defined classification tag is selected based on the scores of the user defined classification tags. In one or more embodiments, a community defined classification tag used to categorize accounting records associated with a customer (or payor) is selected in a similar way as selecting the community defined classification tag used to categorize accounting records associated with a vendor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one or more embodiments, the community input analyzer (<b>123</b>) is further configured to create a community defined formula from the metadata. In addition to the user defined classification tags described above, the metadata further includes one or more user defined formulae for performing a pre-determined calculation of the accounting application (<b>130</b>) by a corresponding user. By the same token, the community defined formula specifies a community method to perform the pre-determined calculation. For example, the formula may be used to calculate depreciation of a particular type of asset (e.g., computer equipment, production equipment, factory building, business vehicle, etc.) of the client. In such embodiments, the community input analyzer (<b>123</b>) is configured to select the community defined formula from various user defined formulae in a similar way as selecting the community defined classification tags from various user defined classification tags. In such embodiments, the user module (<b>122</b>) is further configured to send the community defined formula to the particular user's instance (e.g., accounting application instance A (<b>111</b><i>a</i>), accounting application instance B (<b>111</b><i>b</i>)) of the accounting application (<b>130</b>).

Based on the autofilled formula (i.e., the community defined formula) being accepted by the particular user, the community defined formula is used to perform the pre-determined calculation based on information regarding the particular user's instance of the accounting application (<b>130</b>). For example, the user A (<b>101</b><i>a</i>) may accept the autofilled formula (i.e., the community defined formula) when prompted and uses the community defined formula to perform the depreciation calculation in the accounting application instance A (<b>111</b><i>a</i>) based on specific asset book value information of a client account. In this manner, the community defined formula is used by the accounting application instance A (<b>111</b><i>a</i>) to calculate the depreciation as it is accepted community-wide as the community method.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one or more embodiments, the community input analyzer (<b>123</b>) is further configured to create a community defined periodicity from the metadata. In addition to the user defined classification tags and the user defined formula described above, the metadata further includes one or more user defined periodicities associated with a recurring task of the accounting application (<b>130</b>) performed by a corresponding user. By the same token, the community defined periodicity specifies a periodicity, as agreed by users across the community (<b>140</b>), to perform the recurring task within the accounting application (<b>130</b>). For example, the periodicity may specify how frequent a payment (e.g., an insurance payment to &#x201c;XYZ insurance company&#x201d;) is adjusted. In such embodiments, the community input analyzer (<b>123</b>) is configured to select the community defined periodicity from various user defined periodicities in a similar way as selecting the community defined classification tag from various user defined classification tags.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Initially in Step <b>201</b>, metadata from users of an accounting application is received. For example, the users may be accountants in an accounting firm forming a community in sharing configurations of each other's instances of the accounting application. In particular, autofill parameters are shared among the users when recording and processing accounting information for clients of the accounting firm. In one or more embodiments, the metadata represents users' behaviors in interacting with the accounting application. For example, a user may define classification tags for categorizing information regarding an instance of the accounting application used by the user, a formula for a pre-determined calculation performed in the instance of the accounting application, and/or a periodicity for a recurring task performed in the instance of the accounting application. As noted above, the user actions in defining these classification tags, formulae, and/or periodicities are referred to as user behaviors that occur when the user enters for the first time, or subsequently reclassifies, a transaction associated a particular client and a particular vendor, or when the user performs for the first time, or subsequently modifies, a calculation and/or recurring task associated with a particular accounting record, such as an asset valuation or an accounting payment. In one or more embodiments, the metadata associated with a user describes a classification rule defined by the user regarding how accounting information is categorized, a calculation rule defined by the user regarding which formula to use for a pre-determined calculation, and a periodicity rule define by the user regarding how often a recurring task is performed. In one or more embodiments, the metadata also includes attributes of the users and clients, such as title, job code, seniority, experience level, authority, etc. of a user and industry, location, employee count, revenue size, specific requirement, etc. of a client.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In Step <b>202</b>, a community defined rule is created from the metadata based on a pre-determined criterion. For example, the community defined rule may include a community defined classification rule regarding how accounting information is categorized, a community defined calculation rule regarding which formula to use for a pre-determined calculation, and a community defined periodicity rule regarding how often a recurring task is performed. In one or more embodiments, the community defined rule is created by selecting from user defined rules based on pre-determined criteria. For example, these user defined rules associated with the same vendor, customer, or same type of accounting record may be scored based on the time when they are each defined, a tally of how many users define the same rules, the user attributes of the users defining them, the client attributes of the clients associated with them, or combinations thereof. For example, the user defined rule that was defined first may be treated as the precedence and selected as the community defined rule. In another example, the user defined rule that was commonly defined by highest number of users may be treated as the majority and selected as the community defined rule. In yet another example, the user defined rule that was defined by a user having the most significant title, job code, seniority, experience level, authority may be treated as carrying highest weight and selected as the community defined rule. In still another example, the community defined rule may be selected based on a requirement imposed by client industry or other client attribute or client specification. In one or more embodiments, a score is calculated for each user defined rule associated with a vendor, a customer, or a type of accounting record based on a pre-determined weighting scheme of the title, job code, seniority, experience level, and authority of the user and industry or other client attribute or client specification of the client. Accordingly, the community defined rule is selected based on the scores of the user defined rules.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In Step <b>203</b>, the community defined rules are stored in a database accessible by a particular user's instance of the accounting application.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In Step <b>204</b>, the community defined rules are sent to the particular user's instance of the accounting application. For example, a community defined rule may be sent when it is generated, when a pre-determined event occurs, or in response to a request from the particular user's instance of the accounting application. In one or more embodiments, the community defined rule is configured to be used by the particular user's instance of the accounting application for performing the autofill functionality. For example, based on the autofilled classification tag(s), (i.e., the community defined classification tag(s)) being accepted by the particular user, the community defined classification tags are used to organize the accounting information in the particular user's instance of the accounting application. Specifically, the user may accept the autofilled classification tag(s) (i.e., the community defined classification tag(s)) and uses them to organize and present information regarding the particular user's instance of the accounting application according to the category organization specified by the community defined classification tags. In this manner, the accounting application instance organizes/presents the accounting information according to the community defined classification tags as they are accepted community-wide as the category organization to use.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another example, based on the autofilled formula (i.e., the community defined formula) being accepted by the particular user, the community defined formula is used to perform the pre-determined calculation based on information regarding the particular user's instance of the accounting application.

The captured user behaviors are stored as client specific behaviors (<b>303</b><i>a</i>) in the user behavior database (<b>303</b>). Said in other words, the classification tags, calculation formulae, and/or recurring task periodicities captured from the users for a particular client are stored together in the user behavior database (<b>303</b>) and indexed by an identifier of the particular client. Further, community behaviors (<b>303</b><i>b</i>) are derived from the client specific behaviors (<b>303</b><i>a</i>). For example, the community behaviors (<b>303</b><i>b</i>) may include tallies and scores of the client specific behaviors (<b>303</b><i>a</i>) based on the user attributes (<b>305</b><i>a</i>) and client attributes (<b>305</b><i>b</i>), such as title, job code, seniority, experience level, authority, etc. of each of the users and industry, location, employee count, revenue size, specific requirement, etc. of each of the clients.
