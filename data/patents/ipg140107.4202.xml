<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">PCI cards function as network cards, monitor cards, sound cards, and the like in a computer. Known methods for mounting PCI cards involve screws and screwdrivers in a tedious endeavor, activities often result in screws being lost. A screw falling on a printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer can result in a computer malfunction and/or damage to the PCB.</p>

The pressing portion <b>513</b> of the pressing element <b>51</b> is placed on the second end <b>83</b>. The securing element <b>52</b> is rotated to enable the two engaging protrusions <b>5233</b> of the securing element <b>52</b> to engage each of the two engaging openings <b>631</b> of the engaging plate <b>63</b>. At this time, the second base panel <b>521</b> is pressing the first base panel <b>511</b>. The second end <b>83</b> is located between the bracket body <b>61</b> and the pressing portion <b>513</b>, being prevented thereby from moving in a direction substantially perpendicular to the bottom panel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In disassembly, the handle portion <b>5232</b> of the securing member <b>50</b> is pulled in a direction which is substantially parallel to the PCI card <b>80</b>, to disengage the two engaging protrusions <b>5233</b> from each of the two engaging openings <b>631</b>. The pressing element <b>51</b> rotates away from the second end <b>83</b>. Thus, the PCI card <b>80</b> is easily removable from the enclosure <b>10</b>.</p>
