<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention is an electronically processed single-step test device for detecting the presence of a preselected analyte in a fluid. The device includes a hollow rectangular outer casing, disposed within co-joined upper and lower sections of the casing are assay material, an electronic processing system, and a LCD display. The LCD display is observable through a viewing window. The assay material is a sorptive material including a fluid sample application region in the form of a sample wick in fluid communication with a test strip. The test strip includes an analyte capture region adjacent to a light shield. The electronic processing system includes red and green LEDs which are alternately pulsed or energized over predetermined periods of time to determine if fluid test results show a marker or markers in the capture region indicative of the presence of a preselected analyte in the fluid. If so, Yes+ is displayed on the LCD. If not, No&#x2212; is displayed on the LCD.</p>

No. 6,319,676, entitled &#x201c;DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE AND METHOD&#x201d;; and to U.S. Pat.

No. 29/174,065, entitled ELECTRONIC DIAGNOSTIC DETECTION DEVICE CASING WITH REMOVABLE CAP, filed Jan. 10, 2003; all of which are incorporated herein in their entirety to the extent that they do not conflict herewith. These related applications and patents are all assigned to the same Assignee as the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an improved device for assaying a preselected analyte, such as an antigen, in a body fluid, such as urine, and more particularly relates to such a device including electronic interpretation of the read area in a lateral flow strip, for electronically providing a display of the results of the interpretation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of ligand-receptor assays have been developed to detect the presence of a preselected analyte in body fluid. Typically, these assays involve antibody-antigen interactions, synthetic conjugates comprising radioactively, enzymatically, spectroscopically, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) that is specific for the preselected analyte (e.g., an antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of a resulting receptor-analyte (e.g., antibody-antigen) complex. Most current assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative result, i.e., a positive or negative signal. Examples of such qualitative assays include, for example, pregnancy tests, ovulation tests as well as a variety of other types of urine analysis. In these tests, visually observable signals such as the presence of agglutination of a color change are preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The assays optimally are performed using single-step devices wherein the only step the user need perform prior to observation of the result is application of the sample to be assayed onto the device. Single-step devices, therefore, obviate the necessity of performing, subsequent to the application of the sample, a series of manipulations which may be time consuming and/or may introduce errors in the end result. Accordingly, several single-step devices, for example those described in International Application Nos. WO 88/08534, published Nov. 3, 1988, have been developed and are commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The single-step device described in International Application Published No. WO 88/08534 comprises a hollow casing containing a porous assay material communicating with the exterior of the casing via a fluid sample receiving member. During operation, the user applies the fluid test sample onto the fluid sample receiving member protruding out of the casing. Thereafter, the fluid sample while traversing the carrier material enters the casing and moves to a capture region disposed upon the carrier material. The capture region comprises a means for binding a preselected analyte. When the fluid sample reaches the capture region, assuming that the fluid sample contains the analyte, the analyte binds to the capture region. The bound analyte subsequently can be visualized within the capture region.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It has been found, however, that invalid test results may arise from the use of single-step devices, particularly devices wherein the fluid sample is applied directly from a fluid stream through a urine inlet port defined by the casing onto assay material enclosed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An improved single-step test device for detecting the presence of a preselected analyte in an urine stream is described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,046,057 and 6,277,650. The device includes a hollow rectangular outer casing and an assay material disposed within co-joined upper and lower sections of the casing. The outer casing includes a urine inlet port; a viewing window in the upper section; at least the upper section consisting of transparent material; and may also include at least one drainage vent spaced about the urine inlet port. The assay material is a sorptive material including: a urine sample application region adjacent to, and in fluid communication with the urine inlet port; a capture region adjacent to the viewing window; and a fluid flow path for transporting a liquid sample between the urine sample application region and the analyte capture region. The flow of urine in the fluid path is observable through the transparent upper section for confirming a test is operative. The drainage vent is located to permit excess urine entering the casing from the urine stream to exit the casing thereby to minimize hydraulic pressure induced flooding of the assay material disposed within the casing and to reduce the frequency of false test results. In this improved device, a colloidal gold label antibody reagent is deposited on a release region of assay material. When, in this example, urine is applied to the sample absorbent material <b>8</b>, the urine moves by capillary action or sorbent movement downstream toward window. When the urine contacts the reagent, it reconstitutes the reagent material, causing the reagent to move with the urine front along the flow path. When the reconstituted marker reagent passes through the window region <b>11</b>, capture means are included in the capture region <b>85</b> to cause a single colored line to appear indicative of no pregnancy, or a double line to appear indicative of pregnancy. Although this device represented a very positive improvement over the prior single-step test devices, a user must interpret the lines that appear in the associated window to determine whether or not the test result is indicative of pregnancy. The present inventors recognized that if the requirement for a user to have to interpret between single colored lines and double lines can be eliminated, whereby a simple display of the word Yes+ for pregnancy, or No&#x2212; for non-pregnancy, could be provided in a further improved such device, mistakes in interpretation by a user can be substantially eliminated. Note that as previously indicated above, the aforesaid two patents, and the present invention, are all commonly owned.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, with the problems in the prior art in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide both an improved single-step detection device for reliably detecting the presence of a preselected analyte within a body fluid, when the body fluid, an example being urine, is applied directly from a fluid stream, a urine stream for example, onto assay material disposed within the device, and to provide electronic interpretation of the test results for displaying in a window Yes+ as being indicative of pregnancy, or No&#x2212; indicative of non pregnancy, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another object of the invention to provide a method for detecting a preselected analyte using a single-step device including electronic interpretation as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method for producing a single-step detection device including electronic or electro-optical means for interpreting and displaying test results, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for permitting a user, after applying a fluid sample onto assay material, to shortly thereafter view the test results in a window consisting of the word Yes+ being displayed indicative of pregnancy, or the word No&#x2212; being displayed indicative of non pregnancy, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One embodiment, the present invention provides a device having an outer casing enclosing an assay material, and electro-optical system means, for detecting the presence of an analyte in a urine stream. The assay material defines a capture region for binding the analyte. The outer casing includes a removable cap for exposing a portion of a sample wick to which urine is applied directly from a urine stream, whereafter the cap can be reinstalled. The urine flows from the sample wick onto a test strip containing assaying material. The electro-optical means monitors the overall operation of the device in the capture region for interpreting the test results, and for displaying the results on a small display screen located in a viewing window. The electro-optical means includes electronic processing means for interpreting changes in color in the capture region, such as a test result producing two lines indicative of pregnancy, or one line indicative of non-pregnancy, whereby the processing means displays Yes+ on the display for pregnancy, and No&#x2212; for non pregnancy, for example. In one embodiment of the present invention, the display is a liquid crystal display (LCD).</p>

A raised more central portion <b>9</b> of the case <b>3</b> includes a centrally located window <b>11</b> to permit a user to observe test results provided on an underlying LCD display <b>13</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). A removable cap <b>15</b> is provided at the other end of the device <b>1</b>. In one embodiment, the device <b>1</b> with the cap <b>15</b> installed on the casing <b>3</b> is about 5.7 inches long, the cap <b>15</b> being about 1.5 inches long. The central portion <b>9</b> of casing <b>3</b> is about 1.5 inches long, in this example. The dimensions are not meant to be limiting, and are given for purposes of illustration only.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As will be described in greater detail below, the device <b>1</b> is battery powered, disposable, and extremely easy to use. More specifically, to use the device a user merely has to remove the cap <b>15</b> to expose a sample wick <b>17</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Next, the user inserts the sample wick into a urine stream for wetting the wick <b>17</b> with the urine. The cap <b>15</b> can then be replaced or reinstalled, and the user merely waits for a message to be shown on the LCD display <b>13</b> through the window <b>11</b> of case <b>3</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, from the time that the sample wick <b>17</b> is wetted with urine, it takes only about three minutes for the device <b>1</b> to complete the test and provide the results on the LCD display <b>13</b>. As previously indicated, if the user is pregnant, a Yes+ message will appear on display <b>13</b>, and if not pregnant the message No&#x2212; will appear, in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The bottom <b>20</b> of device <b>1</b> is substantially flat as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>. Also, note that a portion of the sample wick <b>17</b> provided to a user extends from a reduced portion <b>19</b> of case <b>3</b>, with the reduced portion <b>19</b> also being configured to receive the cap <b>15</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An exploded assembly view of one embodiment of the present device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The interior configuration <b>21</b> of the bottom half portion <b>18</b> of the casing <b>3</b> includes a plurality of standoff sockets <b>23</b> for receiving a plurality of standoff pins <b>25</b>, respectively, located in the interior portion <b>27</b> of the top half <b>10</b> of the casing <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Also, the interior portion <b>21</b> of the bottom half <b>18</b> includes a circumferential lip <b>29</b> protruding outward from a ledge portion <b>31</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>). With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the interior portion <b>27</b> of the top half section <b>10</b> includes a circumferential ledge <b>33</b> that extends beyond or higher than a top edge <b>35</b> of an interior wall <b>37</b>. When the top and bottom half sections <b>10</b>, <b>18</b> respectively, are joined together, the sockets <b>23</b> of the bottom half section <b>18</b> securely retain associated pins <b>25</b> of the top half section <b>10</b>, and the protruding circumferential lip <b>29</b> of the bottom half section has its top edge abutted against the top edge <b>35</b> of interior wall <b>37</b> of the top half section <b>10</b>, with the lip <b>29</b> of the bottom half section <b>18</b> proximate against the edge of the protruding lip <b>33</b> of the top half section <b>10</b>, the two half sections <b>10</b>, <b>18</b> of casing <b>3</b> can be permanently secured together after assembly of the device through electrode welding, or use of an appropriate adhesive material.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A</figref>, <b>14</b>B, and <b>14</b>L, a subassembly of the fluidic and electronic portions of the device includes a sample wick <b>17</b> having an interior end securely mounted upon a portion of one end of a test strip <b>39</b>, the other end of which has a portion secured to an interior end of an absorber strip <b>41</b>.

Similarly, the barbs <b>60</b> on the top edges of waffled portion <b>59</b> are for retaining the sample wick <b>17</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14B</figref>, <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>D, <b>14</b>E, <b>14</b>F, <b>14</b>G, <b>14</b>H, <b>14</b>I, and <b>14</b>M, in one embodiment of the invention, the light shield <b>43</b> is provided in one piece, and includes battery compartment <b>66</b> at one end as shown. Specifically, the light shield <b>43</b> includes as shown outer mounting rails <b>42</b>R adjacent the right side, and <b>42</b>L adjacent the left side, upon which the test strip <b>39</b> is mounted (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>). The test strip <b>39</b> includes an alignment notch <b>200</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14N</figref>) for interacting with a registration tab <b>50</b> located on the right hand mounting rail <b>42</b>R, as shown. By use of the alignment notch <b>200</b> and registration tab <b>50</b>, the capture region <b>85</b> of the test strip <b>39</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) is centered on a rectangular detector aperture <b>95</b> of the recessed bottom portion <b>44</b> of light shield <b>43</b>. Strip guide walls <b>46</b> and <b>52</b> are provided at opposing portions of the right side. Other strip guide walls <b>48</b> and <b>202</b> are provided on an interior portion of the left side. Also, a standoff <b>76</b> is provided on the recessed bottom portion <b>44</b>, for elevating the test strip <b>39</b> away from the recessed bottom portion <b>44</b> of light shield <b>43</b>. The strip guide walls <b>202</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, and <b>52</b> retain and guide, via their interior portions, side edge portions of test strip <b>39</b>. In one embodiment, rectangular apertures <b>103</b> and <b>109</b> are provided in the recessed bottom portion <b>44</b> for permitting light emitted from a red LED <b>99</b> and a green LED <b>105</b>, respectively, to be directed onto the capture region <b>85</b> of the test strip <b>39</b>. In an alternative embodiment, LEDs <b>99</b> and <b>105</b> can be located together in either one of apertures <b>103</b> and <b>109</b>, or located separately in the apertures <b>103</b>, <b>109</b>. Accordingly, the alternative embodiment permits the elimination of one of the apertures <b>103</b>, <b>109</b>, whereby two apertures will remain either one of <b>103</b> and <b>109</b>, and detector aperture <b>95</b>. Note that the mounting rails <b>42</b>R and <b>42</b>L are extended above the recessed bottom portion <b>44</b> to provide sufficient space between the control region <b>85</b> of test strip <b>39</b> and apertures <b>103</b>, and <b>109</b>, and <b>95</b>, to ensure that light from either aperture <b>103</b> or aperture <b>109</b> is readily directed onto the capture region <b>85</b>, and reflected light therefrom is directed into detector aperture <b>95</b>. The aforesaid gap between the control region <b>85</b> of test strip <b>39</b> and apertures <b>95</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>109</b> is necessary for proper operation of the inventive device <b>1</b>.</p>

In this manner, flood blocking is provided in the device <b>1</b>. The cells <b>53</b> and <b>59</b> collect the excess urine.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">From the foregoing, preferred embodiments of the invention device <b>1</b> have been shown and illustrated. However, the outer casing <b>3</b> of the device and light shield <b>43</b> may take various forms. Typically, the case <b>3</b> will comprise an elongated casing having interfitting parts made of moisture impervious solid materials, for example, a plastic material. It is contemplated that a variety of commercially available plastics, including, but not limited to, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene, polycarbonates, polysulfanes, polyesters, urethanes, and epoxies can be used to produce casing <b>3</b> and the light shield <b>43</b> useful in the practice of the instant invention.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> showing a simplified diagram of certain operating principles of the present device <b>1</b>, the test strip <b>39</b> is shown to include a capture region <b>85</b> centrally located under the light shield <b>43</b> (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>). Accordingly, the capture region <b>85</b> is disposed upon assay material in the test strip <b>3</b> downstream of the analyte capture region represented by sample wick <b>17</b>. Preferred reagents for use in the test strip <b>39</b> are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/432,894 filed on May 2, 1995, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent that it does not conflict herewith. Note that as used herein, the term &#x201c;assay material&#x201d; means any material, preferably absorptive material, that can be used to detect a presence of a preselected analyte in a urine sample. Also, as used herein the term &#x201c;capture region,&#x201d; such as region <b>85</b>, means a region of the assay material capable of binding, either directly or indirectly, the preselected analyte. During direct binding, the preselected analyte binds to an immobilize binding partner, for example, an anti-analyte antibody immobilized within the capture region <b>85</b> of the assay material or test strip <b>39</b>. During indirect binding, the preselected analyte binds to a binding partner, for example, an anti-analyte antibody biotin conjugate, and the binding partner binds to a capture component, for example, streptavidin, immobilized within the capture region <b>85</b> of the test strip <b>39</b>. As previously mentioned, by means of sorptive transport, urine applied to the sample wick <b>17</b> via a urine stream is transported from the sample wick to the test strip <b>39</b>, and flows through the test strip <b>39</b> and capture region <b>85</b> to the absorber pad <b>41</b> for collecting the urine from the test strip <b>39</b>. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the assay material comprises three elements, the sample wick <b>17</b>, test strip <b>39</b>, and absorber <b>41</b>, but this particular design configuration is not meant to be limiting. Alternatively, a single element of wicking or sorptive material can be used, through appropriate alterations in other aspects of the design of the present device <b>1</b>. In the preferred embodiment illustrated, the sample wick <b>17</b> is provided by a urine sample absorbent material, as appropriate. Test strip <b>39</b> is provided through use of a biphasic chromatographic substrate. A reservoir absorbent material is provided for absorber pad or strip <b>41</b>. The material requirements for the sample wick <b>17</b>, test strip <b>39</b>, and absorber strip <b>41</b>, are known in the art and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,319,676, previously mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the preferred embodiment, the sample wick <b>17</b> consists of bibulous hydrophilic material to facilitate absorption and transport of a urine sample to the biphasic chromatographic medium. Such materials may include cellulose acetate, hydrophilic polyester, or other materials having similar properties. A combination of absorbent materials also may be used. Preferred materials include bonded cellulose acetate, bonded polyolefin or hydrophilic polyester, such as those materials commercially available from American Filtrona Company (Richmond, Va.). Other preferred materials include absorbent papers such as Ahlstrom 939 or Ahlstrom 1281. The sample wick <b>17</b> preferably is coated with a buffered solution containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and a nonionic surfactant, such as Trition X-100&#xae;. The presence of BSA and a surfactant minimize non-specific absorption of the analyte. A concentration of about 3% BSA and about 0.1% surfactant are effective for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Also, the preferred embodiment of the invention includes a biphasic chromatographic substrate with a test strip <b>39</b>. For ease of illustration, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The substrate includes a release regent media <b>87</b> adjacent the capture regent media <b>85</b>. As taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,650, a release regent media <b>87</b> preferably comprises absorbent paper, and the capture medium or region media <b>85</b> preferably comprises a nitrocellulose membrane. Although not specifically shown herein, as taught in the aforesaid patent, the release region media <b>87</b> and capture region media <b>85</b> preferably are both laminated onto an opaque plastic film or sheet <b>89</b>. Disposed upon the release region media <b>87</b> is a first binding member comprising a first monoclonal antibody reactive with a first epitope on the analyte, and labeled with a visually detectable marker, such as, colloidal gold particles, and a capturable component comprising a biotinylated monoclonal antibody disposed downstream of the labeled antibody. In this example, the color of the marker is purple. The biotinylated antibody is reactive with a second epitope on the analyte and is capable of forming a complex with the labeled antibody and the analyte. Also disposed upon the test strip <b>39</b> is a capture region site <b>85</b> for capturing and immobilizing the complex, as previously mentioned. The capture region <b>85</b> immobilizes thereon a capture component, preferably streptavidin, which has a high affinity for the biotin portion of the complex.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A method for manufacturing the preferred biphasic chromatographic medium is described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,835, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as previously mentioned. Briefly, the release region media <b>87</b> and the capture region media <b>85</b> are positioned such that they overlap slightly, and an adhesive is disposed on the back of each (the back being the side opposite that which will receive reagents). The adhesive may be any pressure sensitive or hot melt adhesive which does not fill the pores of the release or capture region, thereby permitting unimpeded flow of the solvent front through the medium. Adhesives useful in the present invention are commercially available for example, from Adhesives Research Corporation. In a currently preferred embodiment, the adhesive is disposed on a opaque polymer backing. The overlapping release and capture regions media <b>87</b>, <b>89</b>, respectively, then are packed through laminating rollers of a laminating machine together with the backed adhesive, forming a laminate of the capture and release media, the adhesive and the polymer backing. The resulting laminated biphasic substrate forming test strip <b>39</b> then is ready to receive the reagents, which are disposed as &#x201c;stripes&#x201d; onto the top of the substrate. Once the reagents have been deposited and dried, if necessary, the substrate is cut into desired size.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The diffusive and non-diffusive reagents can be applied to the release and capture reagents by any well known technique. In a currently preferred embodiment, the diffusable antibody reagents are applied to the release region <b>87</b> by direct application onto the surface of the medium and dried to form a narrow band. The non-diffusable reagents are applied to the capture region <b>85</b> by passive adsorption.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The preferred embodiment further comprises, an absorber <b>41</b> consisting of absorbent material disposed distal to, or downstream of, the biphasic chromatographic substrate or test strip <b>39</b> and in fluid communication therewith. The absorber <b>41</b> provides a reservoir of absorbent material disposed beyond the test strip <b>39</b>, for absorbing and drawing a relatively large volume of the urine and any analyte it contains through the test strip <b>39</b> to aid sensitivity. The reservoir absorbent material preferably comprises a hydrophilic material which may be the same as the urine sample application region absorbent. The purpose of the absorber <b>41</b> is to facilitate capillary action along the chromatographic substrate of test strip <b>39</b>, and to absorb excess urine contained with the casing <b>3</b>. The reservoir absorbent material preferably comprises absorbent paper made from cotton long linter fibers, such as identified by product codes S&#x26;S 300, S&#x26;S 470, and S&#x26;S 900 (available from Schleicher &#x26; Schuell, Inc.) or cellulosic materials, such as Whatman 3MM (available from Whatman).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">During operation of the preferred embodiment, the cap <b>15</b> is removed, and urine typically from a urine stream is deposited onto the exposed sample wick <b>17</b>. The urine then passes by sorptive transport, for example, capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting, from the sample wick <b>17</b> to the biphasic chromatographic material of test strip <b>39</b>, and finally to the reservoir material of absorber <b>41</b>. During transportation through the test strip <b>39</b>, the urine initially contacts the first monoclonal antibody located on the release region <b>87</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). Upon contact with the urine, the first monoclonal antibody becomes reconstituted in the urine and then reacts with a first epitope on the preselected analyte, provided that the analyte is present within the urine sample. The first monoclonal antibody is labeled with a visually detectable marker such as colloidal gold. The urine while moving towards the capture region <b>85</b> contacts the second monoclonal antibody also located in the release region <b>87</b>. Upon contact with the urine, the second monoclonal antibody also becomes reconstituted in the urine, and then reacts with the second epitope on the preselected analyte. The second monoclonal antibody is labeled with a capturable component such as biotin. The analyte, first monoclonal antibody, and the second monoclonal antibody, therefore, react to form a complex which subsequently can be captured when the complex reaches the capture region <b>85</b> and contacts the streptavidin immobilized within the capture region <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Broadly, the device and method of the invention may be used to detect any analyte which has heretofore been assayed using known immunoassay procedures, or is detectable by such procedure, using polyclonal antibodies or fragments thereof, monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof, biosynthetic antibody binding sites or other proteins. Various specific assay protocols and reagents are known per se, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,313,734, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,366,241.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It is, therefore, contemplated that chemical aspects of the invention are not limited by the precise nature of the binding members. For example, polyclonal antibodies and fragments thereof or biosynthetic antibody sites, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,091,513, and 5,132,405, and 5,258,498 may be substituted for the monoclonal antibodies disclosed herein. Accordingly polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies or biosynthetic antibody binding sites having specific binding properties and high affinity for virtually any antigenic substances which are useful in the present invention as binding and capture materials are publicly known and available. Alternatively, preferred monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, or biosynthetic antibody binding sites may be prepared using techniques well known and thoroughly disclosed in the art. The literature is replete with protocols for producing and immobilizing antibodies. For example, the preparation of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies is disclosed in <i>Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual </i>(1988) Harlow and Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Press. The preparation of biosynthetic antibody binding sites is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,091,513, and 5,132,405, and 5,258,498. Methods for immobilizing proteins are described in <i>Laboratory Techniques In Biochemistry And Molecular Biology</i>, Tijssen, Vol. 15, Practice And Theory Of Enzyme immunoassay, Chapter 13, Immobilization of Immunoreactants on Solid Phases, pp. 297 through 328 and all the references cited therein.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The electro-optical embodiments of the invention will now be discussed in greater detail with further reference to the simplified diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The single piece light shield <b>43</b> is mounted on the printed circuit board <b>45</b>, as shown. Two pairs of standoffs <b>91</b> are used for securing the test strip <b>39</b> to the printed circuit board <b>45</b>, with the test strip <b>39</b> being positioned a predetermined distance or spacing from the light shield <b>43</b>, as shown. A photodiode <b>93</b> is mounted on the printed circuit board <b>45</b> at a position that is below a detector aperture <b>95</b> of light shield <b>43</b> for receiving light rays <b>97</b> reflected from the capture region <b>85</b> and directed through the aperture <b>95</b>. A red LED <b>99</b> (light emitting diode having a wavelength in the red color region, [typically 660 nm (nanometers), in a range of 640 nm to 680 nm] is mounted on printed circuit board <b>45</b> in a position for permitting light waves <b>107</b> emitted therefrom to be directed through a guide path <b>109</b> provided by light shield <b>43</b> onto capture region <b>85</b>. Also, a green LED <b>105</b> is mounted on printed circuit board <b>45</b> at a position for emitting light waves <b>101</b> having a wavelength in the green color region (typically 565 nm, in a range of 560 nm to 570 nm) to be guided through a guide path <b>103</b> of light shield <b>43</b> for directing green light onto the capture region <b>85</b>. Accordingly, the light shield <b>43</b> is designed to provide multiple functions, including guiding red light waves emitted by LED <b>45</b> to the capture region <b>85</b> serving as a test target area, to guide green light emitted by LED <b>105</b> to the capture region <b>85</b>, to provide an aperture <b>95</b> for both permitting reflected light rays from the capture region <b>85</b> to be directed onto the photodetector <b>93</b> while simultaneously rejecting background reflections, and to provide a means for facilitating the location of the optical components in test strip <b>39</b> an appropriate three dimensional relationship with one another. Note that the invention is not meant to be limited to a red LED <b>99</b> and a green LED <b>105</b>, but the LEDs must have easily detectable different respective wavelengths. A green LED is used for LED <b>105</b> rather than a blue LED to obtain a lower cost for device <b>1</b>, although it has been found that a blue LED in the range of 505 nm to 540 nm can provide increased sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The block schematic diagram of device <b>1</b> for showing the interconnection between various components and functional aspects of the electronic portion thereof is shown in simplified form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. An Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) <b>111</b> is included on the PCB <b>45</b> for providing electronic circuitry and digital networks necessary for operating device <b>1</b>. Components that interact with the ASIC <b>111</b> include a battery represented by a pair of batteries <b>47</b>, <b>49</b>, that are alkaline button cells as normally used in watches, and hearing aids. For example, batteries <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> can be provided by LR41H button cells manufactured by Golden Power Industries Ltd. The batteries <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> provide DC power to the internal power supply <b>113</b> of ASIC <b>111</b>. The fluid switch or Fluid Probes <b>115</b> are provided by a pair of spaced apart electrical contacts <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> secured to the printed circuit board <b>45</b> at a position for contacting the surface of test strip <b>39</b> proximate sample wick <b>17</b>, as previously described. The Fluid Probes <b>115</b> are connected to a Fluid Detector <b>117</b> of ASIC <b>111</b>. Fluid Detector <b>117</b> detects the flow of electrical current caused by a drop in the electrical resistance between contacts <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> due to the presence of urine in the test strip <b>39</b>. When such current flow is detected, the Fluid Detector <b>117</b> provides an output signal to the Debounce Circuit <b>119</b> which responds to the output signal from the Fluid Detector <b>117</b> by turning on power to the ASIC <b>111</b>. A time delay circuit <b>123</b> provided by a capacitor <b>284</b> to the &#x201c;clock&#x201d; pin on the ASIC <b>111</b>, and the other end to a source of reference potential, ground in this example. The R/C Delay circuit <b>123</b> functions to provide a time constant for the clock generator <b>125</b> of ASIC <b>111</b>, which operates to provide a clock or timing signal to a Timer/Counter digital network <b>127</b>, the latter being connected to the System State Machine <b>121</b>. The Analysis &#x26; Decision Network <b>129</b> operates via an algorithm to analyze signals provided from the System State Machine <b>121</b>, and to provide results of this analysis in the form of decision signals back to System State Machine <b>121</b>. Based upon this result, System State Machine <b>121</b> drives the display controller <b>122</b> to output the appropriate result to operate display <b>13</b>. During operation of the device <b>1</b>, when fluid is detected, that is when urine is detected on the test strip <b>39</b> via the Fluid Probes <b>115</b>, Fluid Detector <b>117</b> driving Debounce Circuit <b>119</b>, connected to the System State Machine <b>121</b> responds in a manner described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In general or broad terms, the System State Machine <b>121</b> operates a LED Pulse Generator <b>131</b> to selectively provide an energizing or drive pulse of predetermined duration to the red LED <b>99</b>, or to the green LED <b>105</b>, at appropriate times, as will be further described. The Detector <b>93</b> is a photodiode, as previously described, for detecting reflected light from capture region <b>85</b> of test strip <b>39</b>. The signal from the Detector <b>93</b> is an analog signal that is inputted to the Gain Circuit <b>133</b> of ASIC <b>111</b>. As will be described in greater detail, the Gain Circuit <b>133</b> operates to both amplify the red reflected signals and green reflected signals over a given test time. The output of the Gain Circuit <b>133</b> is provided to an Analog-to-Digital Convertor network <b>135</b> which converts the signal to a digital signal. The digitized signal is provided to both the System State Machine <b>121</b>, and to a Normalize Measurement Circuit <b>137</b> which normalizes the digitized signal, and provides the same to the System State Machine <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> will now be described in greater detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows an example of the waveforms associated with detecting the absence of a preselected analyte in a urine stream, in this example. The waveforms of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> are related to an example of a test routine that detects the presence of a preselected analyte in a urine stream. More specifically, the pulsing of the red LED <b>99</b> causes the waveform <b>301</b> to be produced, and the pulsing of the green LED <b>105</b> causes the waveform <b>303</b> to be produced, as previously described. If the preselected analyte is not present in the urine stream, difference signal <b>305</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is produced, whereas if the analyte is present, the difference signal <b>305</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A flowchart is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A</figref>, <b>19</b>B, and <b>19</b>C of the processing steps required for operation of the device <b>1</b>. These steps will be described in association with the waveform and timing diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>. With reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A</figref>, <b>19</b>B, and <b>19</b>C, steps <b>139</b> through <b>191</b> are shown and briefly described therein in each step relative to the functions of each. More specifically, the Start Step <b>139</b> is initiated by a user removing the cap <b>15</b>, and placing the sample wick <b>17</b> into a urine stream for wetting the same with urine. Next, in Step <b>140</b> a pair of spaced apart electrical contacts <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> on the PC board <b>45</b> which touch the transverse surface of the test strip <b>39</b> are wetted by the urine, causing a current flow between the contacts or electrodes <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> which are included in the Fluid Detector <b>117</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The Debounce Circuit <b>119</b> responds to the current flow between the electrodes to apply power to the Power Supply <b>113</b> via a shared field effect transistor (FET, not shown) between the Power Supply <b>113</b> and the Debounce Circuit <b>119</b>. The Power Supply <b>113</b> turns on, and in turn applies full power to the entire ASIC <b>111</b>. In Step <b>141</b>, in this example, for the next 100 ms (milliseconds), the ASIC <b>111</b> attempts to try to periodically turn off the device <b>1</b> by removing power. If in Step <b>142</b> it is determined device <b>1</b> is turned off, then Step <b>143</b> is entered for the unpowered state via the FET turning off, whereby it is assumed device <b>1</b> turned on in error due to noise or some transient effect across electrodes <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. However, if after 100 ms device <b>1</b> remains turned on, the ASIC <b>111</b> ceases any further attempt to turn the device <b>1</b> off, and Step <b>144</b> is entered for pulsing red LED <b>99</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In Step <b>145</b>, the intensity of the red light emitted is read via photodetector <b>93</b>, with the value being stored in a register (not shown) in system state machine <b>121</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) as a reference or calibration value. Next, in Step <b>146</b>, the green LED <b>150</b> is pulsed for 3.2 ms, in this example. Simultaneously, Step <b>150</b> is entered whereby photodetector <b>93</b> reads the intensity of the green light emitted, with the value being stored as a reference or calibration value, and Step <b>147</b> is entered for checking batteries <b>47</b> and <b>49</b>. If in the next Step <b>148</b> the batteries are determined to be &#x201c;Bad,&#x201d; Step <b>149</b> is entered for ending the test and displaying &#x201c;?&#x201d; on LCD <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">If in Step <b>148</b>, it is determined that batteries <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> are good, Step <b>151</b> is entered for calculating the difference in the intensity of light from the red LED <b>99</b> and green LED <b>105</b> relative to their expected values which are hardwired in ASIC <b>111</b>. Next, Step <b>152</b> is entered to determine if their respective differences are within a predetermined tolerance. If not, Step <b>149</b> is entered to display &#x201c;?&#x201d; on LCD <b>13</b> and end the test. If both differences are within tolerance, Step <b>153</b> is entered for normalizing both pulses associated with their respective differences.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, in Step <b>154</b>, a pulse and read process is entered as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref> shows the steps in detail for the pulse and read Step <b>154</b>. More specifically, the first step of this process is Step <b>161</b> for again pulsing the red LED <b>99</b> for 3.2 ms, followed by reading the intensity of the red light emitted in Step <b>162</b> and storing the same in a register in the ASIC <b>111</b>. Next, Step <b>163</b> is entered for pulsing the green LED <b>105</b> for 3.2 ms, followed by simultaneously entering Step <b>167</b> to detect via photodetector <b>93</b> the intensity of the green light emitted, and storing the same in a register in the ASIC <b>111</b>, and checking the batteries <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> in Step <b>164</b>. If in the following Step <b>165</b>, the batteries <b>47</b>, <b>49</b>, are determined to be &#x201c;Bad,&#x201d; Step <b>166</b> is entered for displaying &#x201c;?&#x201d; on the LCD display <b>13</b>, and ending the test. Contrariwise, if in Step <b>165</b>, the batteries <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> are determined to be good, Step <b>168</b> is entered for calculating the difference between the intensities of the light emitted by the red LED <b>99</b> and green LED <b>105</b>. Following Step <b>168</b>, Step <b>169</b> is entered to determine whether the prior Steps <b>161</b> through <b>165</b>, and <b>167</b> through <b>168</b> have been performed four times. If not, Step <b>169</b> loops back to cause these prior steps to be reentered. If so, Step <b>170</b> is entered for calculating the average difference in value between the intensity of light of the red LED <b>99</b> and green LED <b>105</b>. Processing then continues with Step <b>155</b> for again calculating the difference in the intensity of light from the red LED <b>99</b> and green LED <b>105</b> relative to their expected values. If not, Step <b>149</b> is entered for displaying &#x201c;?&#x201d; on LCD display <b>13</b>, and ending the test. If within tolerance, Step <b>156</b> is entered for calculating thresholds from the red and green intensity values stored in registers in the ASIC <b>111</b>. Next, Step <b>157</b> is entered for determining whether the device <b>1</b> has been placed in a test mode. If so, Step <b>158</b> is entered for displaying all LCD segments on the LCD display <b>13</b>. This step is only entered at the factory where each device assembled is tested as previously indicated, with the display of all of the LCD <b>13</b> segments alerting a test technician that power should be removed, and no further steps performed, whereby the device <b>1</b> has passed the quality control test. Note that during factory testing, the batteries <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> are not yet installed in the device, an external power is applied to the device, while at the same time the electrical contacts <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> are shorted to one another for simulating the presence of a conductive fluid, such as urine, for example. After power is removed, the batteries <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> are installed in the device <b>1</b>, and the device <b>1</b> is completely assembled for packaging and shipment. Also note that during use of the device <b>1</b> by the ultimate consumer, that Steps <b>139</b> through <b>157</b> are performed again, and represent a calibration routine, wherein in Step <b>157</b> it is determined that the device <b>1</b> is not in a &#x201c;test mode,&#x201d; causing Steps <b>159</b> and <b>160</b> to be entered. Step <b>159</b> causes a clock icon to blink on and off on the LCD display <b>13</b>, to let a user know that a test is in progress. Step <b>160</b> is entered to cause the &#x201c;Pulse &#x26; Read&#x201d; process previously described to be repeated. Next, Step <b>171</b> is entered to determine if the fluid front check time period has been spent. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, this check time occurs between 5 seconds and 48 seconds of turning on device <b>1</b>, whereafter a &#x201c;sleep&#x201d; or inactivity period State <b>3</b> is entered until the end of 127 seconds before data acquisition begins. Note that State <b>3</b> can begin anywhere from 12 seconds to 48 seconds depending upon the time of occurrence of the fluid front. If the fluid front check time, that is State <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) is being processed, or has not ended, Step <b>172</b> is entered for determining whether the average difference calculated in Step <b>170</b> is greater than the threshold previously calculated in Step <b>156</b>. If not, another process is performed followed by repeating Step <b>171</b>. If the average difference in intensity is greater than the threshold, Step <b>173</b> is entered for incrementing a fluid front counter in ASIC <b>111</b>, followed by Decision Step <b>174</b> for determining whether the count is greater than 7. If not, another &#x201c;Pulse &#x26; Read&#x201d; process is performed (Step <b>160</b>). If the count is greater than 7, then Step <b>175</b> is entered for indicating that a valid fluid front has occurred. If either 48 seconds or a count greater than 7, for example, has occurred (State <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>), Step <b>176</b> is entered. When it is determined in Step <b>177</b> that 127 seconds, in this example, have been spent since turning on device <b>1</b>, Step <b>178</b> will then proceed to &#x201c;wake up the processing,&#x201d; for entering Step <b>179</b> for performing another &#x201c;Pulse &#x26; Read&#x201d; process. Note that with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, the device <b>1</b> is now in State <b>4</b> for beginning data acquisition. Next, Step <b>180</b> is entered for calculating new threshold values. The new threshold values represent the reference intensity against which subsequent comparisons are made, as will be described, for using intensity readings from the light emitted by red LED <b>99</b> and green LED <b>105</b> at a time when the fluid or urine has moved by the capture region <b>85</b> on test strip <b>39</b>. Next, another &#x201c;Pulse &#x26; Read&#x201d; process is performed in Step <b>181</b>. In Step <b>182</b> it is determined whether the average difference in light intensity obtained from Step <b>181</b> is provided within the result allowed test time ranging between 127 to 180 seconds (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>), Step <b>183</b> is entered if the time is still within this range, for testing whether a valid fluid front has been previously detected. If not, Step <b>181</b> is repeated for performing another &#x201c;Pulse &#x26; Read,&#x201d; whereas if a valid fluid front was detected, Step <b>184</b> is entered for determining whether the average difference in light intensity is greater than a predetermined threshold. If not, Step <b>181</b> is reentered, whereas if so, Step <b>185</b> is entered for incrementing an accumulator in ASIC <b>111</b>, followed by entering Step <b>186</b> for determining whether the aforesaid accumulator has attained a count greater than 48. If not, Step <b>181</b> is reentered and performed, whereas if so, Step <b>187</b> is entered for displaying &#x201c;YES followed by a + sign&#x201d; for this example.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">If in Step <b>182</b>, the accumulated test time exceeds 180 seconds, Step <b>188</b> is entered to determine whether the test time actually exceeds 180 seconds. If not, Step <b>181</b> is entered and performed as previously described, and if so, Step <b>189</b> is entered to determine whether a valid fluid front has been previously detected. If so, the ASIC <b>111</b> drives the LCD display <b>13</b> to display &#x201c;NO followed by a negative sign&#x201d; for this example. If a valid fluid front was not detected, Step <b>191</b> is entered for displaying on the LCD display <b>13</b> &#x201c;(?),&#x201d; in this example. Following either one of Steps <b>187</b>, <b>190</b>, or <b>191</b>, the State Machine <b>121</b>, and the LCD display <b>13</b> remain active until the batteries <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> are de-energized.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Obviously, the device <b>1</b> can be designed for displaying other than the word Yes for indicating pregnancy, or No for indicating no pregnancy, that is for indicating the presence or absence, respectively, of the preselected analyte. The device <b>1</b> can be modified for detecting analytes other than those associated with pregnancy.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this example, the device <b>1</b> is designed to remain powered for at least 30 minutes after the initiation of a test for display purposes. As indicated, the entire test period takes about three minutes. The test results can be displayed for the entire 30 minute activation period. Also note that although it is indicated that the sample wick <b>17</b> is inserted into a urine stream for taking a sample, it can also be dipped into urine held in a clean container. The system is a self calibrated device <b>1</b>. The self calibration is automatically performed when the device is powered up by taking a measurement of the red LED <b>105</b> and green LED <b>99</b> light emissions and storing the values for later reference. Thereafter, as the testing proceeds, the level of light emissions from the red LED <b>105</b> and green LED <b>99</b> are adjusted against the reference levels. The device <b>1</b> is designed to be at least 99% accurate, for detecting for a positive (YES) answer or result for the presence of at least 25.0 mIU/mL of hCG in the urine, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">With reference to the circuit schematic diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the electrical connections of the various components of the device <b>1</b> are shown. The application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) <b>111</b> is designed to operate the device <b>1</b> as previously described. More specifically, the photodetector <b>93</b> is a photodiode that is protected by a guard <b>94</b>. The function of guard <b>94</b> is to supply a low impedance voltage equal in potential to the input voltage to ASIC <b>111</b> to nullify parasitic capacitance effects, and to supply a low impedance plane to act as a shield for the high impedance input to the ASIC <b>111</b>. The guard <b>94</b> is provided in the printed circuit of the PC board <b>45</b>, as would be known to one of skill in the art. Resistor <b>280</b>, connected and parallel with the photodiode <b>93</b>, serves to provide initial trans-impedance gain of the photo current produced by photodiode <b>93</b>, and serves to linearize the response of photodiode <b>93</b>. Capacitor <b>288</b> provides a low pass filter function. The liquid crystal display (LCD) <b>13</b> is connected as shown, and operated by the ASIC <b>111</b> for providing the previously mentioned displays at an appropriate time in the operation of the device <b>1</b>. The ASIC <b>111</b> is connected to the electrical contacts <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> for sensing the presence of fluid, as previously described. The test point <b>291</b> provides for a functional test mode for verifying proper operation of the device <b>1</b> during manufacture. Bias resistor <b>286</b> serves to provide the internal reference current for ASIC <b>111</b>. The value of capacitor <b>284</b> is selected for determining the frequency of the clock. Capacitor <b>282</b> serves to provide a compensation capacitor for the internal voltage regulation for the ASIC <b>111</b>.
