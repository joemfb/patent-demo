<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">One embodiment of the method includes providing an electrically conductive first member in a wellbore located in a subsurface formation, and also providing an electrically conductive second member in the wellbore. The method also includes providing an electrically conductive granular material in the wellbore. The granular material is positioned so as to provide an electrical connection between the first member and the second member. An electrical current is established across the first member, the granular material and the second member so as to generate resistive heat within the granular material. The surrounding subsurface formation is thereby conductively heated so as to cause formation hydrocarbons in the formation to be heated, and in some cases, pyrolyzed to form hydrocarbon fluids. Preferably, the subsurface formation is an organic-rich rock formation, including, for example, an oil shale formation.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the field of hydrocarbon recovery from subsurface formations. More specifically, the present invention relates to the in situ recovery of hydrocarbon fluids from organic-rich rock formations including, for example, oil shale formations, coal formations and tar sands. The present invention also relates to methods for heating a subsurface formation using electrical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Certain geological formations are known to contain an organic matter known as &#x201c;kerogen.&#x201d; Kerogen is a solid, carbonaceous material. When kerogen is imbedded in rock formations, the mixture is referred to as oil shale. This is true whether or not the mineral is, in fact, technically shale, that is, a rock formed from compacted clay.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Kerogen is subject to decomposing upon exposure to heat over a period of time. Upon heating, kerogen molecularly decomposes to produce oil, gas, and carbonaceous coke. Small amounts of water may also be generated. The oil, gas and water fluids become mobile within the rock matrix, while the carbonaceous coke remains essentially immobile.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Oil shale formations are found in various areas world-wide, including the United States. Such formations are notably found in Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. Oil shale formations tend to reside at relatively shallow depths and are often characterized by limited permeability. Some consider oil shale formations to be hydrocarbon deposits which have not yet experienced the years of heat and pressure thought to be required to create conventional oil and gas reserves.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The decomposition rate of kerogen to produce mobile hydrocarbons is temperature dependent. Temperatures generally in excess of 270&#xb0; C. (518&#xb0; F.) over the course of many months may be required for substantial conversion. At higher temperatures substantial conversion may occur within shorter times. When kerogen is heated to the necessary temperature, chemical reactions break the larger molecules forming the solid kerogen into smaller molecules of oil and gas. The thermal conversion process is referred to as pyrolysis or retorting.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Attempts have been made for many years to extract oil from oil shale formations. Near-surface oil shales have been mined and retorted at the surface for over a century. In 1862, James Young began processing Scottish oil shales. The industry lasted for about 100 years. Commercial oil shale retorting through surface mining has been conducted in other countries as well such as Australia, Brazil, China, Estonia, France, Russia, South Africa, Spain, and Sweden. However, the practice has been mostly discontinued in recent years because it proved to be uneconomical or because of environmental constraints on spent shale disposal. (See T. F. Yen, and G. V. Chilingarian, &#x201c;<i>Oil Shale,&#x201d;</i> Amsterdam, Elsevier, p. 292) Further, surface retorting requires mining of the oil shale, which limits application to very shallow formations.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the United States, the existence of oil shale deposits in northwestern Colorado has been known since the early 1900's. While research projects have been conducted in this area from time to time, no serious commercial development has been undertaken. Most research on oil shale production has been carried out in the latter half of the 1900's. The majority of this research was on shale oil geology, geochemistry, and retorting in surface facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In 1947, U.S. Pat. No. 2,732,195 issued to Ljungstrom. That patent, entitled &#x201c;Method of Treating Oil Shale and Recovery of Oil and Other Mineral Products Therefrom,&#x201d; proposed the application of heat at high temperatures to the oil shale formation in situ. The purpose of such in situ heating was to distill hydrocarbons and to produce them to the surface. The '195 Ljungstrom patent is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Ljungstrom coined the phrase &#x201c;heat supply channels&#x201d; to describe bore holes drilled into the formation. The bore holes received an electrical heat conductor which transferred heat to the surrounding oil shale. Thus, the heat supply channels served as early heat injection wells. The electrical heating elements in the heat injection wells were placed within sand or cement or other heat-conductive material to permit the heat injection wells to transmit heat into the surrounding oil shale while preventing the inflow of fluid. According to Ljungstrom, the &#x201c;aggregate&#x201d; was heated to between 500&#xb0; and 1,000&#xb0; C. in some applications.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Along with the heat injection wells, fluid producing wells were also completed in near proximity to the heat injection wells. As kerogen was pyrolyzed upon heat conduction into the rock matrix, the resulting oil and gas would be recovered through the adjacent production wells.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Ljungstrom applied his approach of thermal conduction from heated wellbores through the Swedish Shale Oil Company. A full scale plant was developed that operated from 1944 into the 1950's. (See G. Salamonsson, &#x201c;The Ljungstrom In Situ Method for Shale-Oil Recovery,&#x201d; 2<sup>nd </sup>Oil Shale and Cannel Coal Conference, v. 2, Glasgow, Scotland, Institute of Petroleum, London, p. 260-280 (1951).)</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additional in situ methods have been proposed. These methods generally involve the injection of heat and/or solvent into a subsurface oil shale formation. Heat may be in the form of heated methane (see U.S. Pat. No. 3,241,611 to J. L. Dougan), flue gas, or superheated steam (see U.S. Pat. No. 3,400,762 to D. W. Peacock). Heat may also be in the form of electric resistive heating, dielectric heating, radio frequency (RF) heating (U.S. Pat. No. 4,140,180, assigned to the ITT Research Institute in Chicago, Ill.) or oxidant injection to support in situ combustion. In some instances, artificial permeability has been created in the matrix to aid the movement of pyrolyzed fluids. Permeability generation methods include mining, rubblization, hydraulic fracturing (see U.S. Pat. No. 3,468,376 to M. L. Slusser and U.S. Pat. No. 3,513,914 to J. V. Vogel), explosive fracturing (see U.S. Pat. No. 1,422,204 to W. W. Hoover, et al.), heat fracturing (see U.S. Pat. No. 3,284,281 to R. W. Thomas), and steam fracturing (see U.S. Pat. No. 2,952,450 to H. Purre).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In 1989, U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,118; issued to Shell Oil Company, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. That patent, entitled &#x201c;Conductively Heating a Subterranean Oil Shale to Create Permeability and Subsequently Produce Oil,&#x201d; declared that &#x201c;[c]ontrary to the implications of . . . prior teachings and beliefs . . . the presently described conductive heating process is economically feasible for use even in a substantially impermeable subterranean oil shale.&#x201d; (col. 6, ln. 50-54). Despite this declaration, it is noted that few, if any, commercial in situ shale oil operations have occurred other than Ljungstrom's enterprise. The '118 patent proposed controlling the rate of heat conduction within the rock surrounding each heat injection well to provide a uniform heat front.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additional history behind oil shale retorting and shale oil recovery can be found in co-owned patent publication WO 2005/010320 entitled &#x201c;Methods of Treating a Subterranean Formation to Convert Organic Matter into Producible Hydrocarbons,&#x201d; and in patent publication WO 2005/045192 entitled &#x201c;Hydrocarbon Recovery from Impermeable Oil Shales.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A need exists for improved processes for the production of shale oil. In addition, a need exists for improved methods for heating a subsurface formation and pyrolyzing solid hydrocarbons. Still further, a need exists for methods addressing the cost-effective installation of robust subsurface heater wells. A need also exists for improved subsurface heater well arrangements that use granular conductive material. Granular materials placed even in oddly shaped subsurface regions form connections with surrounding materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, a method for heating a subsurface formation using an electrical resistance heater is provided. The method may include providing an electrically conductive first member in a wellbore located at least partially within a subsurface formation, and providing an electrically conductive second member in the wellbore. The method may further include providing an electrically conductive granular material in the wellbore, where the granular material is positioned to provide electrical communication between the conductive first member and the conductive second member, thereby forming a granular connection. The method further includes passing an electrical current through the first member, the granular material and the second member, thereby generating heat, with the generated heat produced primarily through electrical resistive heating of the granular material over the life of the heating operation. The heat is then transferred, by thermal conduction into the subsurface formation so as to cause solid hydrocarbons in the formation to be pyrolyzed into hydrocarbon fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another embodiment of the invention includes a method for heating a subsurface formation. The method may include forming a wellbore to the subsurface formation, and filling at least a part of the wellbore with a conductive granular material to act as a resistive heating element. The method may further include passing electricity through the granular material in order to generate resistive heat within the granular material, and continuing to pass electricity through the granular material to generate additional resistive heat in order to cause in situ pyrolysis of at least some solid hydrocarbons. Pyrolysis of the solid hydrocarbons forms hydrocarbon fluids. Heat again is generated primarily from the granular material over the life of the heating operation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another embodiment of the invention includes a method for heating a subsurface formation using an electrically resistive heater. The method includes forming a wellbore below an earth surface and into the subsurface formation. The method may further include running a string of casing into the wellbore, and also running an elongated, electrically conductive conductor element within the string of casing. The method may further include injecting electrically conductive granular material between the conductor element and the surrounding string of casing proximate a bottom of the wellbore. A voltage is applied across the string of casing and the conductor element in order to resistively heat the conductive granular material. This serves to heat the surrounding subsurface formation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another embodiment of the invention includes a method for heating a subsurface formation. The method may include passing electricity through a conductive granular material to generate resistive heat within the granular material, where the granular material is disposed between and within at least two adjacent wellbores completed at least partially within the subsurface formation. An example is through interconnecting fractures. The granular material may provide electrical communication between the wellbores, where a majority of the resistive heat is generated within the wellbores as opposed to the granular material over the life of the heating operation. The method may further include transferring, by thermal conduction, at least a portion of the resistive heat into the subsurface formation in order to cause in situ pyrolysis of at least some solid formation hydrocarbons to form hydrocarbon fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Also provided herein is a resistive heater for heating a subsurface formation. The resistive heater may include a wellbore formed from an earth surface and into the subsurface formation, a string of casing in the wellbore, and an elongated, electrically conductive conductor element within the string of casing. The resistive heater further includes a conductive granular material disposed within the string of casing at a bottom of the wellbore and along the depth of the subsurface formation. The granular material thereby provides an electrical connection between the string of casing and the conductor element. The granular material may have an electrical resistance that is higher than the electrical resistance of the string of casing and the conductor element. In this way resistive heat is generated primarily within the granular material when a current is passed through the string of casing, the granular material and the conductor element.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Another embodiment of the invention includes a method for heating a subsurface formation. The method may include providing a first wellbore to the subsurface formation. A conductive member is then run into the first wellbore. The method may further include providing a second wellbore, with the second wellbore having a bottom portion that intersects the first wellbore within the subsurface formation. The method may further include running a conductive member into the second wellbore. The method may further include filling at least a part of each of the first and second wellbores with a conductive granular material. The granular materials provides an electrical connection between the conductive member in the first wellbore and the conductive member in the second wellbore. The method may further include passing an electrical current through the conductive member in the first wellbore, the granular material, and the conductive member in the second wellbore in order to generate heat via electrical resistance primarily within the granular material over the life of the heating operation. The granular material thus acts as a resistive heating element for heating the surrounding formation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another embodiment of the invention includes a method of producing a hydrocarbon fluid. The method may include heating an organic-rich rock formation in situ using an electrical resistance heater, and producing a hydrocarbon fluid from the organic-rich rock formation. In this instance, the hydrocarbon fluid is at least partially generated as a result of pyrolysis of formation hydrocarbons located in the organic-rich rock formation. The heating is performed by using an electrical resistance heater formed by providing an electrically conductive first member in a wellbore located at least partially within a subsurface formation, providing an electrically conductive second member in the wellbore, and providing an electrically conductive granular material in the wellbore that is positioned to provide electrical communication between the first member and the second member. The first member has a lower end terminating at a first depth located within the subsurface formation, and is insulated above the first depth. Similarly, the second member has a lower end terminating at a second depth located within the subsurface formation, and is insulated above the second depth. An electrical current is passed through the first member, the granular material and the second member, thereby generating heat through electrical resistive heating of the granular material. Heat is transferred by thermal conduction from the granular material and into the subsurface formation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another embodiment of the invention includes a method of producing a hydrocarbon fluid.

The granular material may provide electrical communication between the wellbores, where a majority of the resistive heat is generated within the wellbores. The granular material has a bulk resistance that is greater than a resistance of the wellbores. The electrical resistance heater may further include transferring, by thermal conduction, at least a portion of the resistive heat into the subsurface formation in order to cause in situ pyrolysis of at least some solid formation hydrocarbons to form the hydrocarbon fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another embodiment of the invention includes a method for heating a subsurface formation using electrically resistive heat.

The method may further include providing a second wellbore located at least partially within the subsurface formation, the second wellbore having an electrically conductive third member, an electrically conductive fourth member, and an electrically conductive second granular material in the second wellbore, where the second granular material is positioned to provide electrical communication between the third member and the fourth member. The method may further include passing a first electrical current through the first member, the first granular material and the second member, thereby generating first heat, with the generated first heat produced primarily through electrical resistive heating of the first granular material. The method may further include passing a second electrical current through the third member, the second granular material and the fourth member, thereby generating second heat, with the generated second heat produced primarily through electrical resistive heating of the second granular material. The method may also include heating formation hydrocarbons located substantially equidistant from the first wellbore and the second wellbore primarily with the generated first heat, second heat or both.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Another embodiment of the invention includes a method for heating a subsurface formation.

The wellbores <b>14</b> may be located in relatively close proximity, being from 10 feet to up to 300 feet in separation. In some embodiments, a well spacing of 15 to 25 feet is provided. Typically, the wellbores <b>14</b> are also completed at shallow depths, being from 200 to 5,000 feet at total depth. In some embodiments the oil shale formation targeted for in situ retorting is at a depth greater than 200 feet below the surface or alternatively 400 feet below the surface. Alternatively, conversion and production occur at depths between 500 and 2,500 feet.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The wellbores <b>14</b> will be selected for certain functions and may be designated as heat injection wells, water injection wells, oil production wells and/or water-soluble mineral solution production wells. In one aspect, the wellbores <b>14</b> are dimensioned to serve two, three, or all four of these purposes. Suitable tools and equipment may be sequentially run into and removed from the wellbores <b>14</b> to serve the various purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A fluid processing facility <b>17</b> is also shown schematically. The fluid processing facility <b>17</b> is equipped to receive fluids produced from the organic-rich rock formation <b>16</b> through one or more pipelines or flow lines <b>18</b>. The fluid processing facility <b>17</b> may include equipment suitable for receiving and separating oil, gas, and water produced from the heated formation. The fluid processing facility <b>17</b> may further include equipment for separating out dissolved water-soluble minerals and/or migratory contaminant species, including, for example, dissolved organic contaminants, metal contaminants, or ionic contaminants in the produced water recovered from the organic-rich rock formation <b>16</b>. The contaminants may include, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and tri-methylbenzene. The contaminants may also include polyaromatic hydrocarbons such as anthracene, naphthalene, chrysene and pyrene. Metal contaminants may include species containing arsenic, boron, chromium, mercury, selenium, lead, vanadium, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, or zinc. Ionic contaminant species may include, for example, sulfates, chlorides, fluorides, lithium, potassium, aluminum, ammonia, and nitrates.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In order to recover oil, gas, and sodium (or other) water-soluble minerals, a series of steps may be undertaken. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> presents a flow chart demonstrating a method of in situ thermal recovery of oil and gas from an organic-rich rock formation <b>100</b>, in one embodiment. It is understood that the order of some of the steps from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be changed, and that the sequence of steps is merely for illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">First, the oil shale (or other organic-rich rock) formation <b>16</b> is identified within the development area <b>10</b>. This step is shown in box <b>110</b>. Optionally, the oil shale formation may contain nahcolite or other sodium minerals. The targeted development area within the oil shale formation may be identified by measuring or modeling the depth, thickness and organic richness of the oil shale as well as evaluating the position of the organic-rich rock formation relative to other rock types, structural features (e.g. faults, anticlines or synclines), or hydrogeological units (i.e. aquifers). This is accomplished by creating and interpreting maps and/or models of depth, thickness, organic richness and other data from available tests and sources. This may involve performing geological surface surveys, studying outcrops, performing seismic surveys, and/or drilling boreholes to obtain core samples from subsurface rock. Rock samples may be analyzed to assess kerogen content and hydrocarbon fluid generating capability.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The kerogen content of the organic-rich rock formation may be ascertained from outcrop or core samples using a variety of data. Such data may include organic carbon content, hydrogen index, and modified Fischer assay analyses. Subsurface permeability may also be assessed via rock samples, outcrops, or studies of ground water flow. Furthermore the connectivity of the development area to ground water sources may be assessed.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Next, a plurality of wellbores <b>14</b> is formed across the targeted development area <b>10</b>. This step is shown schematically in box <b>115</b>. The purposes of the wellbores <b>14</b> are set forth above and need not be repeated. However, it is noted that for purposes of the wellbore formation step of box <b>115</b>, only a portion of the wells need be completed initially. For instance, at the beginning of the project heat injection wells are needed, while a majority of the hydrocarbon production wells are not yet needed. Production wells may be brought in once conversion begins, such as after 4 to 12 months of heating.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">It is understood that petroleum engineers will develop a strategy for the best depth and arrangement for the wellbores <b>14</b>, depending upon anticipated reservoir characteristics, economic constraints, and work scheduling constraints. In addition, engineering staff will determine what wellbores <b>14</b> shall be used for initial formation <b>16</b> heating. This selection step is represented by box <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Concerning heat injection wells, there are various methods for applying heat to the organic-rich rock formation <b>16</b>. The present methods are not limited to the heating technique employed unless specifically so stated in the claims. The heating step is represented generally by box <b>130</b>. Preferably, for in situ processes the heating of a production zone takes place over a period of months, or even four or more years.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The formation <b>16</b> is heated to a temperature sufficient to pyrolyze at least a portion of the oil shale in order to convert the kerogen to hydrocarbon fluids. The bulk of the target zone of the formation may be heated to between 270&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C. Alternatively, the targeted volume of the organic-rich formation is heated to at least 350&#xb0; C. to create production fluids. The conversion step is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by box <b>135</b>. The resulting liquids and hydrocarbon gases may be refined into products which resemble common commercial petroleum products. Such liquid products include transportation fuels such as diesel, jet fuel and naphtha. Generated gases include light alkanes, light alkenes, H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Conversion of the oil shale will create permeability in the oil shale section in rocks that were originally impermeable. Preferably, the heating and conversion processes of boxes <b>130</b> and <b>135</b>, occur over a lengthy period of time. In one aspect, the heating period is from three months to four or more years. Also as an optional part of box <b>135</b>, the formation <b>16</b> may be heated to a temperature sufficient to convert at least a portion of nahcolite, if present, to soda ash. Heat applied to mature the oil shale and recover oil and gas will also convert nahcolite to sodium carbonate (soda ash), a related sodium mineral. The process of converting nahcolite (sodium bicarbonate) to soda ash (sodium carbonate) is described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In connection with the heating step <b>130</b>, the rock formation <b>16</b> may optionally be fractured to aid heat transfer or later hydrocarbon fluid production. The optional fracturing step is shown in box <b>125</b>. Fracturing may be accomplished by creating thermal fractures within the formation through application of heat. By heating the organic-rich rock and transforming the kerogen to oil and gas, the permeability of portions of the formation are increased via thermal fracture formation and subsequent production of a portion of the hydrocarbon fluids generated from the kerogen. Alternatively, a process known as hydraulic fracturing may be used. Hydraulic fracturing is a process known in the art of oil and gas recovery where a fracture fluid is pressurized within the wellbore above the fracture pressure of the formation, thus developing fracture planes within the formation to relieve the pressure generated within the wellbore. Hydraulic fractures may be used to create additional permeability in portions of the formation and/or be used to provide a planar source for heating. The WO 2005/010320 patent publication incorporated above describes one use of hydraulic fracturing.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As part of the hydrocarbon fluid production process <b>100</b>, certain wells <b>14</b> may be designated as oil and gas production wells. This step is depicted by box <b>140</b>. Oil and gas production might not be initiated until it is determined that the kerogen has been sufficiently retorted to allow maximum recovery of oil and gas from the formation <b>16</b>. In some instances, dedicated production wells are not drilled until after heat injection wells (box <b>130</b>) have been in operation for a period of several weeks or months. Thus, box <b>140</b> may include the formation of additional wellbores <b>14</b>. In other instances, selected heater wells are converted to production wells.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">After certain wellbores <b>14</b> have been designated as oil and gas production wells, oil and/or gas is produced from the wellbores <b>14</b>. The oil and/or gas production process is shown at box <b>145</b>. At this stage (box <b>145</b>), any water-soluble minerals, such as nahcolite and converted soda ash may remain substantially trapped in the rock formation <b>16</b> as finely disseminated crystals or nodules within the oil shale beds, and are not produced. However, some nahcolite and/or soda ash may be dissolved in the water created during heat conversion (box <b>135</b>) within the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Box <b>150</b> presents an optional next step in the oil and gas recovery method <b>100</b>. Here, certain wellbores <b>14</b> are designated as water or aqueous fluid injection wells. Aqueous fluids are solutions of water with other species. The water may constitute &#x201c;brine,&#x201d; and may include dissolved inorganic salts of chloride, sulfates and carbonates of Group I and II elements of The Periodic Table of Elements. Organic salts can also be present in the aqueous fluid. The water may alternatively be fresh water containing other species. The other species may be present to alter the pH. Alternatively, the other species may reflect the availability of brackish water not saturated in the species wished to be leached from the subsurface. Preferably, the water injection wells are selected from some or all of the wellbores used for heat injection or for oil and/or gas production. However, the scope of the step of box <b>150</b> may include the drilling of yet additional wellbores <b>14</b> for use as dedicated water injection wells. In this respect, it may be desirable to complete water injection wells along a periphery of the development area <b>10</b> in order to create a boundary of high pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Next, optionally water or an aqueous fluid is injected through the water injection wells and into the oil shale formation <b>16</b>. This step is shown at box <b>155</b>. The water may be in the form of steam or pressurized hot water. Alternatively the injected water may be cool and becomes heated as it contacts the previously heated formation. The injection process may further induce fracturing. This process may create fingered caverns and brecciated zones in the nahcolite-bearing intervals some distance, for example up to 200 feet out, from the water injection wellbores. In one aspect, a gas cap, such as nitrogen, may be maintained at the top of each &#x201c;cavern&#x201d; to prevent vertical growth.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Along with the designation of certain wellbores <b>14</b> as water injection wells, the design engineers may also designate certain wellbores <b>14</b> as water or water-soluble mineral solution production wells. This step is shown in box <b>160</b>. These wells may be the same as wells used to previously produce hydrocarbons or inject heat. These recovery wells may be used to produce an aqueous solution of dissolved water-soluble minerals and other species, including, for example, migratory contaminant species. For example, the solution may be one primarily of dissolved soda ash. This step is shown in box <b>165</b>. Alternatively, single wellbores may be used to both inject water and then to recover a sodium mineral solution. Thus, box <b>165</b> includes the option of using the same wellbores <b>14</b> for both water injection and solution production (Box <b>165</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Temporary control of the migration of the migratory contaminant species, especially during the pyrolysis process, can be obtained via placement of the injection and production wells <b>14</b> such that fluid flow out of the heated zone is minimized. Typically, this involves placing injection wells at the periphery of the heated zone so as to cause pressure gradients which prevent flow inside the heated zone from leaving the zone.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an illustrative oil shale formation that is within or connected to ground water aquifers and a formation leaching operation. Four separate oil shale formation zones are depicted (<b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>) within the oil shale formation. The water aquifers are below the ground surface <b>27</b>, and are categorized as an upper aquifer <b>20</b> and a lower aquifer <b>22</b>. Intermediate the upper and lower aquifers is an aquitard <b>21</b>. It can be seen that certain zones of the formation are both aquifers or aquitards and oil shale zones. A plurality of wells (<b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>) is shown traversing vertically downward through the aquifers. One of the wells is serving as a water injection well <b>31</b>, while another is serving as a water production well <b>30</b>. In this way, water is circulated <b>32</b> through at least the lower aquifer <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows diagrammatically water circulating <b>32</b> through an oil shale volume that was heated <b>33</b>, that resides within or is connected to an aquifer <b>22</b>, and from which hydrocarbon fluids were previously recovered. Introduction of water via the water injection well <b>31</b> forces water into the previously heated oil shale <b>33</b> and water-soluble minerals and migratory contaminants species are swept to the water production well <b>30</b>. The water may then processed in a facility <b>34</b> wherein the water-soluble minerals (e.g. nahcolite or soda ash) and the migratory contaminants may be substantially removed from the water stream. Water is then reinjected into the oil shale volume <b>33</b> and the formation leaching is repeated. This leaching with water is intended to continue until levels of migratory contaminant species are at environmentally acceptable levels within the previously heated oil shale zone <b>33</b>. This may require 1 cycle, 2 cycles, 5 cycles 10 cycles or more cycles of formation leaching, where a single cycle indicates injection and production of approximately one pore volume of water. It is understood that there may be numerous water injection and water production wells in an actual oil shale development. Moreover, the system may include monitoring wells (<b>28</b> and <b>29</b>) which can be utilized during the oil shale heating phase, the shale oil production phase, the leaching phase, or during any combination of these phases to monitor for migratory contaminant species and/or water-soluble minerals.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some fields, formation hydrocarbons, such as oil shale, may exist in more than one subsurface formation. In some instances, the organic-rich rock formations may be separated by rock layers that are hydrocarbon-free or that otherwise have little or no commercial value. Therefore, it may be desirable for the operator of a field under hydrocarbon development to undertake an analysis as to which of the subsurface, organic-rich rock formations to target or in which order they should be developed.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The organic-rich rock formation may be selected for development based on various factors. One such factor is the thickness of the hydrocarbon containing layer within the formation. Greater pay zone thickness may indicate a greater potential volumetric production of hydrocarbon fluids. Each of the hydrocarbon containing layers may have a thickness that varies depending on, for example, conditions under which the formation hydrocarbon containing layer was formed. Therefore, an organic-rich rock formation will typically be selected for treatment if that formation includes at least one formation hydrocarbon-containing layer having a thickness sufficient for economical production of produced fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">An organic-rich rock formation may also be chosen if the thickness of several layers that are closely spaced together is sufficient for economical production of produced fluids. For example, an in situ conversion process for formation hydrocarbons may include selecting and treating a layer within an organic-rich rock formation having a thickness of greater than about 5 meters, 10 meters, 50 meters, or even 100 meters. In this manner, heat losses (as a fraction of total injected heat) to layers formed above and below an organic-rich rock formation may be less than such heat losses from a thin layer of formation hydrocarbons. A process as described herein, however, may also include selecting and treating layers that may include layers substantially free of formation hydrocarbons or thin layers of formation hydrocarbons.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The richness of one or more organic-rich rock formations may also be considered. Richness may depend on many factors including the conditions under which the formation hydrocarbon containing layer was formed, an amount of formation hydrocarbons in the layer, and/or a composition of formation hydrocarbons in the layer. A thin and rich formation hydrocarbon layer may be able to produce significantly more valuable hydrocarbons than a much thicker, less rich formation hydrocarbon layer. Of course, producing hydrocarbons from a formation that is both thick and rich is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The kerogen content of an organic-rich rock formation may be ascertained from outcrop or core samples using a variety of data. Such data may include organic carbon content, hydrogen index, and modified Fischer assay analyses. The Fischer Assay is a standard method which involves heating a sample of a formation hydrocarbon containing layer to approximately 500&#xb0; C. in one hour, collecting fluids produced from the heated sample, and quantifying the amount of fluids produced.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Subsurface formation permeability may also be assessed via rock samples, outcrops, or studies of ground water flow. Furthermore the connectivity of the development area to ground water sources may be assessed. Thus, an organic-rich rock formation may be chosen for development based on the permeability or porosity of the formation matrix even if the thickness of the formation is relatively thin.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Other factors known to petroleum engineers may be taken into consideration when selecting a formation for development. Such factors include depth of the perceived pay zone, stratigraphic proximity of fresh ground water to kerogen-containing zones, continuity of thickness, and other factors. For instance, the assessed fluid production content within a formation will also effect eventual volumetric production.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In producing hydrocarbon fluids from an oil shale field, it may be desirable to control the migration of pyrolyzed fluids. In some instances, this includes the use of injection wells, particularly around the periphery of the field. Such wells may inject water, steam, CO<sub>2</sub>, heated methane, or other fluids to drive cracked kerogen fluids inwardly towards production wells. In some embodiments, physical barriers may be placed around the area of the organic-rich rock formation under development. One example of a physical barrier involves the creation of freeze walls. Freeze walls are formed by circulating refrigerant through peripheral wells to substantially reduce the temperature of the rock formation. This, in turn, prevents the pyrolyzation of kerogen present at the periphery of the field and the outward migration of oil and gas. Freeze walls will also cause native water in the formation along the periphery to freeze.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The use of subsurface freezing to stabilize poorly consolidated soils or to provide a barrier to fluid flow is known in the art. Shell Exploration and Production Company has discussed the use of freeze walls for oil shale production in several patents, including U.S. Pat. No. 6,880,633 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,032,660. Shell's '660 patent uses subsurface freezing to protect against groundwater flow and groundwater contamination during in situ shale oil production. Additional patents that disclose the use of so-called freeze walls are U.S. Pat. No. 3,528,252, U.S. Pat. No. 3,943,722, U.S. Pat. No. 3,729,965, U.S. Pat. No. 4,358,222, U.S. Pat. No. 4,607,488, and WO Pat. No. 98996480.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As noted above, several different types of wells may be used in the development of an organic-rich rock formation, including, for example, an oil shale field. For example, the heating of the organic-rich rock formation may be accomplished through the use of heater wells. The heater wells may include, for example, electrical resistance heating elements. The production of hydrocarbon fluids from the formation may be accomplished through the use of wells completed for the production of fluids. The injection of an aqueous fluid may be accomplished through the use of injection wells. Finally, the production of an aqueous solution may be accomplished through use of solution production wells.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The different wells listed above may be used for more than one purpose. Stated another way, wells initially completed for one purpose may later be used for another purpose, thereby lowering project costs and/or decreasing the time required to perform certain tasks. For example, one or more of the production wells may also be used as injection wells for later injecting water into the organic-rich rock formation. Alternatively, one or more of the production wells may also be used as solution production wells for later producing an aqueous solution from the organic-rich rock formation.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In other aspects, production wells (and in some circumstances heater wells) may initially be used as dewatering wells (e.g., before heating is begun and/or when heating is initially started). In addition, in some circumstances dewatering wells can later be used as production wells (and in some circumstances heater wells). As such, the dewatering wells may be placed and/or designed so that such wells can be later used as production wells and/or heater wells. The heater wells may be placed and/or designed so that such wells can be later used as production wells and/or dewatering wells. The production wells may be placed and/or designed so that such wells can be later used as dewatering wells and/or heater wells. Similarly, injection wells may be wells that initially were used for other purposes (e.g., heating, production, dewatering, monitoring, etc.), and injection wells may later be used for other purposes. Similarly, monitoring wells may be wells that initially were used for other purposes (e.g., heating, production, dewatering, injection, etc.). Finally, monitoring wells may later be used for other purposes such as water production.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The wellbores for the various wells may be located in relatively close proximity, being from 10 feet to up to 300 feet in separation. Alternatively, the wellbores may be spaced from 30 to 200 feet, or 50 to 100 feet. Typically, the wellbores are also completed at shallow depths, being from 200 to 5,000 feet at total depth. Alternatively, the wellbores may be completed at depths from 1,000 to 4,000 feet, or 1,500 to 3,500 feet. In some embodiments, the oil shale formation targeted for in situ retorting is at a depth greater than 200 feet below the surface. In alternative embodiments, the oil shale formation targeted for in situ retorting is at a depth greater than 500, 1,000, or 1,500 feet below the surface. In alternative embodiments, the oil shale formation targeted for in situ retorting is at a depth between 200 and 5,000 feet, alternatively between 1,000 and 4,000 feet, 1,200 and 3,700 feet, or 1,500 and 3,500 feet below the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">It is desirable to arrange the various wells for an oil shale field in a pre-planned pattern. For instance, heater wells may be arranged in a variety of patterns including, but not limited to triangles, squares, hexagons, and other polygons. The pattern may include a regular polygon to promote uniform heating through at least the portion of the formation in which the heater wells are placed. The pattern may also be a line drive pattern. A line drive pattern generally includes a first linear array of heater wells, a second linear array of heater wells, and a production well or a linear array of production wells between the first and second linear array of heater wells. Interspersed among the heater wells are typically one or more production wells. The injection wells may likewise be disposed within a repetitive pattern of units, which may be similar to or different from that used for the heater wells.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">One method to reduce the number of wells is to use a single well as both a heater well and a production well. Reduction of the number of wells by using single wells for sequential purposes can reduce project costs. One or more monitoring wells may be disposed at selected points in the field. The monitoring wells may be configured with one or more devices that measure a temperature, a pressure, and/or a property of a fluid in the wellbore. In some instances, a heater well may also serve as a monitoring well, or otherwise be instrumented.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Another method for reducing the number of heater wells is to use well patterns. Regular patterns of heater wells equidistantly spaced from a production well may be used. The patterns may form equilateral triangular arrays, hexagonal arrays, or other array patterns. The arrays of heater wells may be disposed such that a distance between each heater well is less than about 70 feet (21 meters). A portion of the formation may be heated with heater wells disposed substantially parallel to a boundary of the hydrocarbon formation.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In alternative embodiments, the array of heater wells may be disposed such that a distance between each heater well may be less than about 100 feet, or 50 feet, or 30 feet. Regardless of the arrangement of or distance between the heater wells, in certain embodiments, a ratio of heater wells to production wells disposed within a organic-rich rock formation may be greater than about 5, 8, 10, 20, or more.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In one embodiment, individual production wells are surrounded by at most one layer of heater wells. This may include arrangements such as 5-spot, 7-spot, or 9-spot arrays, with alternating rows of production and heater wells. In another embodiment, two layers of heater wells may surround a production well, but with the heater wells staggered so that a clear pathway exists for the majority of flow away from the further heater wells. Flow and reservoir simulations may be employed to assess the pathways and temperature history of hydrocarbon fluids generated in situ as they migrate from their points of origin to production wells.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides a plan view of an illustrative heater well arrangement using more than one layer of heater wells. The heater well arrangement is used in connection with the production of hydrocarbons from a shale oil development area <b>400</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the heater well arrangement employs a first layer of heater wells <b>410</b>, surrounded by a second layer of heater wells <b>420</b>. The heater wells in the first layer <b>410</b> are referenced at <b>431</b>, while the heater wells in the second layer <b>420</b> are referenced at <b>432</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">A production well <b>440</b> is shown central to the well layers <b>410</b> and <b>420</b>. It is noted that the heater wells <b>432</b> in the second layer <b>420</b> of wells are offset from the heater wells <b>431</b> in the first layer <b>410</b> of wells, relative to the production well <b>440</b>. The purpose is to provide a flowpath for converted hydrocarbons that minimizes travel near a heater well in the first layer <b>410</b> of heater wells. This, in turn, minimizes secondary cracking of hydrocarbons converted from kerogen as hydrocarbons flow from the second layer of wells <b>420</b> to the production wells <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In the illustrative arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first layer <b>410</b> and the second layer <b>420</b> each defines a 5-spot pattern. However, it is understood that other patterns may be employed, such as 3-spot or 6-spot patterns. In any instance, a plurality of heater wells <b>431</b> comprising a first layer of heater wells <b>410</b> is placed around a production well <b>440</b>, with a second plurality of heater wells <b>432</b> comprising a second layer of heater wells <b>420</b> placed around the first layer <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The heater wells in the two layers also may be arranged such that the majority of hydrocarbons generated by heat from each heater well <b>432</b> in the second layer <b>420</b> are able to migrate to a production well <b>440</b> without passing substantially near a heater well <b>431</b> in the first layer <b>410</b>. The heater wells <b>431</b>, <b>432</b> in the two layers <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> further may be arranged such that the majority of hydrocarbons generated by heat from each heater well <b>432</b> in the second layer <b>420</b> are able to migrate to the production well <b>440</b> without passing through a zone of substantially increasing formation temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Another method for reducing the number of heater wells is to use well patterns that are elongated in a particular direction, particularly in a direction determined to provide the most efficient thermal conductivity. Heat convection may be affected by various factors such as bedding planes and stresses within the formation. For instance, heat convection may be more efficient in the direction perpendicular to the least horizontal principal stress on the formation. In some instanced, heat convection may be more efficient in the direction parallel to the least horizontal principal stress.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In connection with the development of a shale oil field, it may be desirable that the progression of heat through the subsurface in accordance with steps <b>130</b> and <b>135</b> be uniform. However, for various reasons the heating and maturation of formation hydrocarbons in a subsurface formation may not proceed uniformly despite a regular arrangement of heater and production wells. Heterogeneities in the oil shale properties and formation structure may cause certain local areas to be more or less productive. Moreover, formation fracturing which occurs due to the heating and maturation of the oil shale can lead to an uneven distribution of preferred pathways and, thus, increase flow to certain production wells and reduce flow to others. Uneven fluid maturation may be an undesirable condition since certain subsurface regions may receive more heat energy than necessary where other regions receive less than desired. This, in turn, leads to the uneven flow and recovery of production fluids. Produced oil quality, overall production rate, and/or ultimate recoveries may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">To detect uneven flow conditions, production and heater wells may be instrumented with sensors. Sensors may include equipment to measure temperature, pressure, flow rates, and/or compositional information. Data from these sensors can be processed via simple rules or input to detailed simulations to reach decisions on how to adjust heater and production wells to improve subsurface performance. Production well performance may be adjusted by controlling backpressure or throttling on the well. Heater well performance may also be adjusted by controlling energy input. Sensor readings may also sometimes imply mechanical problems with a well or downhole equipment which requires repair, replacement, or abandonment.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In one embodiment, flow rate, compositional, temperature and/or pressure data are utilized from two or more wells as inputs to a computer algorithm to control heating rate and/or production rates. Unmeasured conditions at or in the neighborhood of the well are then estimated and used to control the well. For example, in situ fracturing behavior and kerogen maturation are estimated based on thermal, flow, and compositional data from a set of wells. In another example, well integrity is evaluated based on pressure data, well temperature data, and estimated in situ stresses. In a related embodiment the number of sensors is reduced by equipping only a subset of the wells with instruments, and using the results to interpolate, calculate, or estimate conditions at uninstrumented wells. Certain wells may have only a limited set of sensors (e.g., wellhead temperature and pressure only) where others have a much larger set of sensors (e.g., wellhead temperature and pressure, bottomhole temperature and pressure, production composition, flow rate, electrical signature, casing strain, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As noted above, there are various methods for applying heat to an organic-rich rock formation. For example, one method may include electrical resistance heaters disposed in a wellbore or outside of a wellbore. One such method involves the use of electrical resistive heating elements in a cased or uncased wellbore. Electrical resistance heating involves directly passing electricity through a conductive material such that resistive losses cause it to heat the conductive material. Other heating methods include the use of downhole combustors, in situ combustion, radio-frequency (RF) electrical energy, or microwave energy. Still others include injecting a hot fluid into the oil shale formation to directly heat it. The hot fluid may or may not be circulated.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">One method for formation heating involves the use of electrical resistors in which an electrical current is passed through a resistive material which dissipates the electrical energy as heat. This method is distinguished from dielectric heating in which a high-frequency oscillating electric current induces electrical currents in nearby materials and causes them to heat. The electric heater may include an insulated conductor, an elongated member disposed in the opening, and/or a conductor disposed in a conduit. An early patent disclosing the use of electrical resistance heaters to produce oil shale in situ is U.S. Pat. No. 1,666,488. The '488 patent issued to Crawshaw in 1928. Since 1928, various designs for downhole electrical heaters have been proposed. Illustrative designs are presented in U.S. Pat. No. 1,701,884, U.S. Pat. No. 3,376,403, U.S. Pat. No. 4,626,665, U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,514, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,023,554).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">A review of application of electrical heating methods for heavy oil reservoirs is given by R. Sierra and S. M. Farouq Ali, &#x201c;Promising Progress in Field Application of Reservoir Electrical Heating Methods&#x201d;, Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper 69709, 2001.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Certain previous designs for in situ electrical resistance heaters utilized solid, continuous heating elements (e.g., metal wires or strips). However, such elements may lack the necessary robustness for long-term, high temperature applications such as oil shale maturation. As the formation heats and the oil shale matures, significant expansion of the rock occurs. This leads to high stresses on wells intersecting the formation. These stresses can lead to bending and stretching of the wellbore pipe and internal components. Cementing (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,118) or packing (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 2,732,195) a heating element in place may provide some protection against stresses, but some stresses may still be transmitted to the heating element.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">As an alternative, international patent publication WO 2005/010320 teaches the use of electrically conductive fractures to heat the oil shale. A heating element is constructed by forming wellbores and then hydraulically fracturing the oil shale formation around the wellbores. The fractures are filled with an electrically conductive material which forms the heating element. Calcined petroleum coke is an exemplary suitable conductant material. Preferably, the fractures are created in a vertical orientation extending from horizontal wellbores. Electricity may be conducted through the conductive fractures from the heel to the toe of each well. The electrical circuit may be completed by an additional horizontal well that intersects one or more of the vertical fractures near the toe to supply the opposite electrical polarity. The WO 2005/010320 process creates an &#x201c;in situ toaster&#x201d; that artificially matures oil shale through the application of electric heat. Thermal conduction heats the oil shale to conversion temperatures in excess of 300&#xb0; C., causing artificial maturation.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">International patent application WO2005/010320 describes using granular conductive materials within hydraulic fractures as the primary heating elements. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 3,137,347 discloses the use of a conductive granular material to longitudinally connect subsurface electrodes for in situ heating of oil shales. In the '347 patent, the granular material is heated with the stated aim of causing the oil shale itself to become electrically conductive.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The '347 patent envisions the granular material being an initial source of heat until the oil shale is warmed. At some point, the oil shale itself is said to become electrically conductive. Heat conducted into the surrounding formation due to the passing of current through the oil shale material itself causes pyrolysis and generates hydrocarbon fluids for production.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The present disclosure provides important improvements to the use of granular materials as part of an electrically resistive downhole heater. By using a granular material, the heater wells will be much less susceptible to failure due to stresses and bending. In this respect, the granular mass can readily change shape as needed. Moreover, the heater wells may be simpler and cheaper to construct. Thus, methods are provided herein for applying heat to a subsurface formation wherein conductive granular material provides a conductive pathway between electrically conductive members within wellbores or even between wellbores. In the present embodiments, the granular material itself generates resistive heat sufficient to convert and continue to convert solid hydrocarbons into hydrocarbon fluids.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The granular material is positioned so as to provide an electrical connection between the electrically conductive first member and the electrically conductive second member. A current is established across the electrically conductive first member, the granular material and the electrically conductive second member so as to cause an electrical current to flow. This generates resistive heat which, in turn, transfers heat to at least a portion of the subsurface formation.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The electrical resistance of the conductive members may vary. In any event, a majority of the generated heat emanates from the granular material. In one aspect, at least 75% of the heat is generated via electrical resistance of current flow through the granular material.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">It is not required that the granular material directly contact the conductive members, although it is preferred that the granular material contacts both the first member and the second member. In many embodiments, there is no substantial fluid flow within the granular material. In some embodiment, there is no substantial hydrocarbon fluid flow within the granular material while the electrical current is established through the granular material. In one aspect, Darcy flow of hydrocarbon fluids does not substantially occur through the granular material and into the wellbore while the electrical current is established through the granular material.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Various embodiments for heater well arrangements using granular material are described. In some embodiments, the electrical flow through the granular material is primarily longitudinal, while in others the electrical flow through the granular material is primarily radial. The desired resistivity of the in-place bulk granular material is substantially greater for the radial flow embodiments than for the longitudinal flow embodiments. In either arrangement, the resistive heat from the granular material thermally conducts into and warms the surrounding subsurface formation, causing pyrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">A voltage may be passed through the wellbore by passing an alternating current. Alternatively, the voltage may be created by passing a direct current. The voltage in one aspect is between about 200 and 3,000 Volts. Alternatively, the voltage is between about 400 and 2,000 Volts. As an additional step, the method may also comprise testing the electrical conductivity of the electrical circuit formed by the electrically conductive first member, the granular material, and the electrically conductive second member.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The electrically conductive first member may comprise a well pipe. The well pipe may be, for example, a casing, tubing, or combinations thereof. In this arrangement, the electrically conductive second member may optionally be placed within the well pipe. In one aspect, the electrically conductive second member hangs within the surrounding well pipe. A weight may be placed proximate the bottom of the electrically conductive second member so as to maintain the electrically conductive second member in tension.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In one aspect, the step of providing an electrically conductive first member in a wellbore comprises running a well pipe string in the wellbore to a first depth, the well pipe string thereby serving as at least a portion of the electrically conductive first member. The step of providing an electrically conductive second member in the wellbore comprises running a second conductive string within the well pipe string to a second depth below the first depth. The second conductive string thereby serves as at least a portion of the electrically conductive second member. The step of providing an electrically conductive granular material in the wellbore then includes placing the granular material around the second conductive string below the first depth.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The wellbore may be left uncased below the first depth. In this instance, the granular material resides in an annular region defined between the second conductive string and the surrounding subsurface formation. Alternatively, the wellbore may be cased with an electrically nonconductive casing below the first depth. In either instance, it is preferred that the surface casing not be electrified so as to enhance safety. This may be accomplished in several ways such as where the electrical flow near the surface is through an insulated wire.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In one aspect, the well pipe string comprises an upper portion and a lower portion. Each of these portions is electrically conductive. An intermediate portion that is non-conductive is provided between the upper and lower portions. In this arrangement, the conductive first member may further comprises an electrically conductive wire or cable to provide electrical communication between the lower portion of the first member and a power source at a surface.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In another aspect, the step of providing an electrically conductive first member in the wellbore includes electrically connecting an electrically conductive third conductive member to the well pipe string. The well pipe string and the third member thus serve as at least a portion of the first member. The third member may be disposed around at least a portion of the granular material. The third member may be electrically connected between the well pipe string and the granular material. Alternatively, the third member may be electrically connected to the well pipe string, while the well pipe string is electrically connected to the granular material.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In one aspect, the second depth is near the bottom of the subsurface formation. The second conductive string is insulated with an electrically insulating material from at least the first depth to a third depth. The third depth is between the first depth and the second depth so that at least a lower portion of the second conductive string is left uninsulated. Then, the step of establishing a current includes establishing a current between the well pipe string and the lower portion of the second conductive string. In this way current is applied through the granular material in order to resistively heat the subsurface formation through the generation of heat within the granular material.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The step of establishing a current may include applying a positive voltage to the first member and a negative voltage to the second member. In this way the voltage is applied from the well pipe string, though the granular material, and to the second conductive string. Alternatively, the step of applying a voltage may include applying a positive voltage to the second member and a negative voltage to the first member. In this way the voltage is applied from the second conductive string, through the granular material, and to the well pipe string.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In another aspect, the first depth and the second depth are both near the bottom of the subsurface formation. An annular region is then defined by the well pipe string and the second conductive string. The step of establishing a current would then include applying a voltage radially through the granular material so as to resistively heat the subsurface formation through the generation of heat within the granular material. Preferably, the first depth is proximate the shallowest depth of the subterranean formation, and the granular material is continuous within the annular region.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In one embodiment of the method, the subsurface formation contains two separate oil shale zones.

The electrically conductive granular material is disposed in at least a portion of the annular region. The elongated conductive element preferably comprises a metal rod or a metal wire. Preferably, the elongated conductive element is centralized in the casing using nonconductive centralizers. In this embodiment, the steps of passing electricity through the granular material comprise passing an electrical current through the casing, through the granular material, and through the conductive element within the casing. This creates longitudinal resistive heating.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In an alternate embodiment, the method includes running a string of conductive casing into the wellbore to a first depth, and running an elongated conductive element into the wellbore and within the string of conductive casing to a lower second depth. Here, the elongated conductive element is insulated from about the first depth in the wellbore to the second depth proximate the bottom of the wellbore, but with an exposed portion left proximate the bottom of the wellbore. In this embodiment, the step of passing electricity through the electrically conductive granular material comprises radially passing an electrical current through the string of casing, through the granular material, and through the exposed portion of the elongated conductive element in order to generate resistive heat in the granular material.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In each of the above methods, the electrically conductive granular material may be a mixture of two or more component granular materials, each having a different conductivity. This allows the operator to adjust the bulk resistance of the mixture. In one aspect, one or more of the component granulated materials comprises essentially nonconductive materials.

This step is shown at Box <b>2930</b>. This step <b>2930</b> is not limited to the manner in which the electricity is passed or the hardware downhole which delivers the electricity. In one aspect, a voltage is applied across a string of casing placed downhole. The voltage is further applied through the electrically conductive granular material and to a conductor element in order to resistively heat the subsurface formation. The voltage may be applied by passing an alternating current. Alternatively, the voltage may be applied by passing a direct current. In one aspect, a three-phase alternating current is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The illustrative method <b>2900</b> may include the step of continuing to pass electricity through the electrically conductive granular material to generate additional resistive heat. This step is shown at Box <b>2940</b>. This step <b>2940</b> may be employed for the purpose of causing pyrolysis of at least some solid hydrocarbons in the subsurface formation into hydrocarbon fluids. Preferably, temperatures in excess of 300&#xb0; C., and perhaps greater than 500&#xb0; C., are achieved from the resistive heating.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In one aspect, the steps <b>2910</b> through <b>2940</b> are repeated for one or more adjacent wellbores. This is shown at Box <b>2950</b>. Preferably, multiple heater wells are employed for heating an extended area of a subsurface formation. The heater wells may be placed in linear arrays, or may be arranged in patterns with hydrocarbon production wells. Examples of such patterns included 3-spot, 5-spot and 7-spot well patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">In order to practice the illustrative method <b>2900</b>, a heater well is employed. Various arrangements for a heater well may be used. Such wells contemplate the use of electrical resistance heaters and well designs that are relatively low cost, and yet robust. These designs may, in certain embodiments, provide heater wells that survive high temperatures without experiencing problems associated with material softening and creep. Such wells may also, in certain applications, avoid problems associated with high geomechanical stresses on the well due to thermal expansion or formation subsidence arising from maturation of the oil shale and resulting formation fracturing and movement.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an illustrative heater well <b>300</b>, in one embodiment.

The wellbore <b>305</b> has a wall <b>306</b> that defines a radius. The wellbore <b>305</b> is completed as an open hole at the level of the targeted formation <b>308</b>.

<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The heater well <b>300</b> comprises an electrically conductive first member <b>310</b>.

<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The string of casing <b>310</b> may be fabricated from any conductive material. In one aspect, the material is a metal having a low resistivity.

<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The heater well <b>300</b> also comprises an electrically conductive second member <b>320</b>.

Alternatively, the electrically conductive second member <b>320</b> may be a thin solid body such as an elongated wire. The wire may be, for example, a solid wire, a braided wire or a cable.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The solid rod (or other conductive member) <b>320</b> has a top end <b>322</b> adjacent the earth surface <b>302</b>, and a lower end <b>324</b>. The lower end <b>324</b> is completed at a second depth within the wellbore <b>305</b>. This second depth is below the first depth, and extends to or near the bottom of the wellbore <b>305</b>. It is preferred that the conductive second member <b>320</b> have a weight (not shown) proximate the lower end <b>324</b> so as to place the second member <b>320</b> in greater tension.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The solid rod <b>320</b> may be fabricated from any conductive material. In one aspect, the material is a metal having a low resistivity. For example, the solid rod <b>320</b> may have a resistivity less than about 0.00001 (1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>) ohm-meters.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In order to practice the method <b>2900</b>, an electrical current is provided between the electrically conductive first member <b>310</b> and the electrically conductive second member <b>320</b>. Therefore, a power source <b>330</b> is employed. The power source <b>330</b> delivers an electrical current to either the electrically conductive first member <b>310</b> or the electrically conductive second member <b>320</b>. Conductive wire <b>332</b> provides electrical communication between the power source <b>330</b> and the solid rod <b>320</b>, while conductive wire <b>334</b> provides electrical communication between the power source <b>330</b> and the string of casing <b>310</b>. A third wire <b>336</b> optionally goes to ground.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">In one aspect, a positive pole is set up at conductive wire <b>334</b>, while a negative pole is set up at conductive wire <b>332</b>. Current flows down the wellbore <b>305</b> through the string of casing <b>310</b>, and then up the wellbore <b>305</b> through the solid rod <b>320</b>. In this manner, the heater well <b>300</b> forms a circuit. Alternatively, the polarity of this circuit may be reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">It is necessary to provide a form of electrical communication between the string of casing <b>310</b> and the solid rod <b>320</b>. In accordance with method <b>2900</b>, an electrically conductive granular material <b>340</b> is used. The granular material <b>340</b> is placed in the wellbore <b>305</b> around the solid rod <b>320</b> and within the string of casing <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Suitable granular material <b>340</b> may include calcined coke, graphite, metal oxides, or ceramic particles coated with thin metal layers. The granular material <b>340</b> may be hollow, solid, porous, sintered, or agglomerated, so long as the material <b>340</b> conducts electricity and provides an in-place resistance generally higher than the string of casing <b>310</b> and the solid rod <b>320</b>. The granular material may comprise regularly or irregularly shaped particles. The particles may have a range of sizes or be geometrically configured to increase the total particle-to-particle contact area. This serves to improve electrical conductivity. It is preferred that the lower end <b>324</b> of the second member <b>320</b> is sharpened so as to facilitate downward movement through the granular material in the event of thermal expansion of the second member <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The resistance of the in-place granular material <b>340</b> should be high enough that sufficient amounts of heat can be generated with moderate voltages, for example, about 600 to 2400 volts. In one aspect, the in-place resistivity of the bulk material <b>340</b> is on the order of 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>ohm-meters. This value is several orders of magnitude higher than the resistivity of most metals, and is intentionally higher than the resistivity of the first conductive first member <b>310</b> and the second conductive member <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">It is noted that the range of resistivity provided above is for the in-place bulk granular material and not the individual granular particles. The resistivity of the individual particles necessarily will be less than the resistivity of the bulk value due to added resistance caused by limited contact area between the granular particles.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref> provides a graph charting in-place resistivity of the bulk granular metal versus heated length required so that the bulk granular material suffers 2,000 Watts per meter of energy dissipation (e.g., &#x201c;line loss&#x201d;). The calculations are made at three different voltage levels: line <b>360</b> charts conductive length versus in-place resistivity at 500 volts; line <b>370</b> charts conductive length versus in-place resistivity at 1,000 volts; and line <b>380</b> charts conductive length versus in-place resistivity at 2,000 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The length of the heated bulk material is measured in meters, while the resistivity of the granular material is measured in ohm-meters. The calculations assume that the electricity flows longitudinally through the granular material. The granular material is packed in a tubular form having a 0.10 meter (about 4 inches) inner diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">It is noted in the graph that resistivity varies depending upon the voltage applied through the granular material. Along each voltage line <b>360</b>, <b>370</b>, <b>380</b>, the required resistivity decreases with length of heated material. For example, for line <b>370</b> representing 1,000 volts of electrical energy, the resistivity at 100 meters is about 3.9&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>ohm-meters, while at 400 meters the resistivity drops to about 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>ohm-meters. However, the required overall resistivities increase when the voltage is increased. Thus, for line <b>380</b> representing 2,000 volts of electrical energy, the resistivity at 100 meters is about 1.6&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>ohm-meters, while at 400 meters the resistivity drops to about 9.8&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>ohm-meters. This demonstrates that the resistivity of the granular material must be tailored to the heating length and supplied voltage so to achieve a desired heat dissipation.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref>, the granular material <b>340</b> may be mixed with materials of greater or lower conductivity to adjust the bulk resistivity. Materials with greater conductivity may include metal filings or shot. Materials with lower conductivity may include quartz sand, ceramic particles, clays, gravel, or cement. To achieve repeatable and uniform performance, such a granular material <b>340</b> mix may be further mixed with another material to aid dry flowability. An example is silica powder.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The granular material <b>340</b> may be placed in the wellbore <b>305</b> by pouring it in dry, by blowing it in through moveable and removable tubing (e.g., coiled tubing), or by slurrying it in. Slurrying the material with a liquid is not the preferred method since the liquid will then need to be removed if the heater well <b>300</b> is to be heated above its boiling point. Moreover, heating the well <b>300</b> to vaporize the liquid may result in void spaces forming in the granular material <b>340</b> and interfere with the electrical properties. Whatever method is used for placing the granular material into the wellbore <b>305</b>, reciprocating the casing <b>310</b>, the solid rod <b>320</b>, or both can aid the settling and packing of the granular material <b>340</b>. Additionally, a mass of substantially nonconducting granular material (not shown) may be placed on top of the granular material <b>340</b> to be heated so to provide weight for compaction.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">It is desirable to prevent a short circuit in the heater well <b>300</b>. To inhibit shorting, an insulative coating <b>326</b> may be provided around the electrically conductive second member <b>320</b>. The insulative coating <b>326</b> may be a ceramic coating, a cement coating, or other protective and nonconductive material. The insulative coating <b>326</b> extends through most of the targeted formation <b>308</b>, but leaves the lower portion <b>324</b> of the electrically conductive second member <b>320</b> exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">In the illustrative heater well <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref>, the insulative coating <b>326</b> extends from the surface <b>302</b> to about the targeted formation <b>308</b>. However, the insulative coating <b>326</b> may optionally start just above the targeted formation <b>308</b>. In that instance, nonconductive centralizers (not shown) would preferably be employed along the solid rod <b>320</b> to prevent contact with the surrounding casing <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref> that the wellbore <b>305</b> is completed with a metal casing <b>310</b> that extends down to the shallowest depth of the formation <b>308</b> desired to be heated. Below this depth, the wellbore <b>305</b> is left uncased. Alternatively, a nonconductive casing (not shown) may be used below the shallowest depth to be heated. An electrical connection <b>334</b> is made to the metal casing <b>310</b> from the power source <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The conductive rod or wire <b>320</b>, with or without insulation, is placed in the wellbore <b>305</b> and proceeds down in one aspect to the deepest depth desired to be heated.

<p id="p-0229" num="0228">In operation, the power supply <b>330</b> is activated. A voltage is applied across the string of casing <b>310</b>, through the electrically conductive granular material <b>340</b>, and up the solid rod <b>320</b>. It is understood that the current may flow the opposite direction by changing the polarity of the power supply <b>330</b>. Alternatively, alternating current may be used. The amount of power supplied may be approximately 500 to 4,000 Watts per meter of heated length or, alternatively, 1,000 to 3,000 Watts per meter.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The process of operating the heater well <b>300</b> causes heat to be generated within the granular material. This heat is thermally conducted into the surrounding formation <b>308</b>. This, in turn, pyrolyzes solid hydrocarbons into hydrocarbon fluids. To prevent hydrocarbon fluids and potentially corrosive gases from entering the wellbore <b>305</b>, the wellbore <b>305</b> may optionally be sealed to formation gases at the bottom. In one aspect, the wellbore <b>305</b> is pressurized with an inert gas such as nitrogen. The pressure is preferably at least 50 psia.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">There are other ways of forming a heater well for resistively heating a subsurface formation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a heater well <b>3100</b>, in an alternate embodiment.

Electricity travels downward through the granular material <b>340</b> until it reaches the uninsulated lower portion <b>324</b> of the conductive member <b>320</b>. However, in wellbore arrangement <b>3100</b>, electricity flows between an electrically conductive second member <b>3120</b> and a surrounding electrically conductive first member <b>3110</b>.

<p id="p-0286" num="0285">The use of heater wells <b>300</b>, <b>3100</b>, <b>3200</b>, <b>3300</b> will generate and recover hydrocarbons from oil shale or other organic-rich rocks or source rocks. Preferably, at least two adjacent heater wells representing heater wells <b>300</b>, <b>3100</b>, <b>3200</b>, or <b>3300</b> are used for the hydrocarbon recovery. Electrical current is sent through electrically conductive granular material in order generate resistive heat. An AC voltage is preferred, as alternating current is more readily generated and minimizes electrochemical corrosion. Heat is transferred to the surrounding organic-rich rock <b>308</b>, <b>3108</b>, <b>3208</b> or <b>3308</b> by thermal conduction. As a result, the organic-rich rock is heated sufficiently to convert the kerogen in the rock to hydrocarbons. The generated hydrocarbons may then be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">During the thermal conversion process, shale permeability is expected to increase. This may be caused by increased pore volume available for flow as solid kerogen is converted to liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons, or it may result from the formation of fractures. As kerogen converts to hydrocarbons, it undergoes a substantial volume increase that increases pore pressure in a confined system. If initial permeability is too low to allow release of the hydrocarbons, excess pore pressure will eventually cause fractures. The generated hydrocarbons may be produced via the same wells (after recompletion) by which the electric power is delivered, or preferably via additional wells.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">Although the process is applied in this example to generate hydrocarbons from oil shale, the idea may also be applicable to heavy oil reservoirs, tar sands, or gas hydrates. In these instances, the electrical heat supplied would serve to reduce hydrocarbon viscosity or to melt hydrates. U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,911 discusses the use of an electrically conductive proppant to release gas from a hydrate formation. It is also known to apply a voltage across a formation using brine as the electrical conductor and heating element. U.S. Pat. No. 3,547,193 discusses a method and apparatus in which electrical current is caused to flow through water in a mineral bearing, subsurface formation to produce heating of the mineral. However, it is believed that the use of formation brine as a heating element is inadequate for shale conversion as it is limited to temperatures below the in situ boiling point of water. This means that the circuit fails when water vaporizes.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">For in situ development of shale oil, high temperatures must be generated and maintained within the targeted formation. Shale oil development typically requires temperatures in the formation in excess of about 270&#xb0; C. To achieve such high temperatures throughout a target formation, the heater wells should be even hotter, typically greater than 400&#xb0; C. However, even with high well temperatures, the heat substantially travels a relatively short distance in the course of several years, typically only about 20 to 50 meters. The short travel distance is a result of the fact that conductive heat transfer is the main mechanism in the formation. Thus, many heater wells are desired to treat a large formation. Rock has relatively low thermal diffusivity values and many oil shale formations have very limited permeability and hence ability to support substantial convective heat transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">Using the heater wells <b>300</b>, <b>3100</b>, <b>3200</b>, or <b>3300</b>, various methods for heating a subsurface formation may be practiced. In one aspect, the method includes forming a wellbore to the subsurface formation, and then filling at least a part of the wellbore with an electrically conductive granular material to act as a resistive heating element. Electricity is passed through the granular material in order to generate resistive heat. Electricity continues to be passed through the granular material to generate additional resistive heat in the subsurface formation. This causes pyrolysis of at least some solid hydrocarbons in the subsurface formation into hydrocarbon fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The method may further comprise placing a string of conductive casing proximate the bottom of the wellbore, and running an elongated conductive element into the wellbore and within the string of casing. In this way an annular region between the string of conductive casing and the elongated conductive element is formed. At least a portion of the granular material is disposed in the annular region. In this embodiment, the steps of passing electricity through the electrically conductive granular material comprise radially passing an electrical current through the casing, through the granular material, and through the conductive element within the casing in order to generate resistive heat in the granular material.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">In another embodiment, two elongated conductive members are run into the wellbore and within the surrounding casing string. A first elongated conductive member extends down to a first depth, while a second elongated conductive member extends down to a second depth below the first depth. Each of the conductive materials is insulated from except at its lower end. The conductive granular material is packed into the wellbore so as to contact the exposed lower ends of the respective conductive members. In this arrangement, a heating method includes the step of passing electricity longitudinally through the first conductive member, through the electrically conductive granular material, and through the exposed portion of the second conductive member in order to generate resistive heat in the granular material.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">In another embodiment, the string of conductive casing is placed into the wellbore at a first depth. The method also includes running an elongated conductive element into the wellbore and within the string of casing. The elongated conductive element extends to a second depth that is proximate the bottom of the wellbore. Here, the conductive element is insulated from about the first depth in the wellbore to the second depth. An exposed portion is left in the conductive element proximate the bottom of the wellbore. The steps of passing electricity through the electrically conductive granular material comprise longitudinally passing an electrical current through the casing, through the granular material, and through the exposed portion of the conductive element in order to generate resistive heat in the granular material.</p>

<p id="p-0311" num="0310">From the heater well arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</figref>, certain methods for heating a subsurface formation are disclosed. In one aspect, a method is provided which first includes providing a first wellbore to the subsurface formation, and also a second wellbore to the subsurface formation. Preferably, the first wellbore is vertical. The second wellbore has a bottom portion that intersects the first wellbore within the subsurface formation. Thus, a point of convergence is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">A conductive member is run into the first wellbore. Similarly, a conductive member is also run into the second wellbore. The conductive members in the first and second wellbores comprise either a tubular body or a solid body. Examples include casing, a metal rod, a metal wire, a bar, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">The method includes filling at least a part of each of the first and second wellbores with an electrically conductive granular material. In this way an electrical connection between the conductive member in the first wellbore and the conductive member in the second wellbore is provided at the point of convergence. The granular material also acts as a resistive heating element. An electrical current is passed through the conductive member in the first wellbore, the granular material, and the conductive member in the second wellbore. Heat is thereby generated via electrical resistance primarily within the granular material.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">In one aspect, the first and second wellbores are spaced from about 10 to 120 feet apart. More preferably, the first and second wellbores are spaced from about 20 to 80 feet apart.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">In one aspect, the method further includes the step of providing a third wellbore. The third wellbore also has a bottom portion that intersects the first wellbore within the subsurface formation. A conductive member is also run into the third wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">In accordance with this embodiment, at least a part of the third wellbore is filled with the electrically conductive granular material. In this way an electrical connection is provided between the conductive members in the first, second and third wellbores at a point of convergence. The granular material again acts as the resistive heating element. In this embodiment, the step of passing an electrical current further comprises passing an electrical current through the conductive member in the third wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">The purpose for heating the organic-rich rock formation is to pyrolyze at least a portion of the solid formation hydrocarbons to create hydrocarbon fluids. The solid formation hydrocarbons may be pyrolyzed in situ by raising the organic-rich rock formation, (or zones within the formation), to a pyrolyzation temperature. In certain embodiments, the temperature of the formation may be slowly raised through the pyrolysis temperature range. For example, an in situ conversion process may include heating at least a portion of the organic-rich rock formation to raise the average temperature of the zone above about 270&#xb0; C. at a rate less than a selected amount (e.g., about 10&#xb0; C., 5&#xb0; C.; 3&#xb0; C., 1&#xb0; C., 0.5&#xb0; C., or 0.1&#xb0; C.) per day. In a further embodiment, the portion may be heated such that an average temperature of the selected zone may be less than about 375&#xb0; C. or, in some embodiments, less than about 400&#xb0; C. The formation may be heated such that a temperature within the formation reaches (at least) an initial pyrolyzation temperature (e.g., a temperature at the lower end of the temperature range where pyrolyzation begins to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">The pyrolysis temperature range may vary depending on the types of formation hydrocarbons within the formation, the heating methodology, and the distribution of heating sources. Some formations by their nature are not expected to become significantly more electrically conductive upon heating. For example, a formation may be or become sufficiently fractured that gaps prevent electrical conduction over significant distances (e.g., 10 meters or more). Alternatively, a formation may have an unfavorable pore structure such that continuous electrical pathways are absent over significant distances. Further, the formation may include high amounts of inorganic constituents (e.g., sulfur) such that concentrated relatively pure coke is not appreciable formed upon pyrolysis of the hydrocarbons. In addition, heating may be controlled such that a majority of the heated portion of the formation does not reach the high temperatures expected to be required to appreciable increase the electrical connectivity of the formation itself. For example, a pyrolysis temperature range may include temperatures between about 270&#xb0; C. and about 900&#xb0; C. Alternatively, the bulk of the target zone of the formation may be heated to between 300&#xb0; to 600&#xb0; C. In an alternative embodiment, a pyrolysis temperature range may include temperatures between about 270&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C. Literature studies (for example see: R. N. Nottenburger et al., &#x201c;Temperature and stress dependence of electrical and mechanical properties of Green River oil shale&#x201d;, <i>Fuel, </i>58, 144-148, February 1979) have shown that temperatures of about 500&#xb0; C. or more are needed for some oil shales to have electrical resistivities below 10<sup>6 </sup>ohm-cm, which is still largely non-conductive. Metals tend to have resistivities 11-12 orders of magnitude lower and even semiconductors (e.g., germanium or silicon) may have resistivities 3-5 orders of magnitude lower than the resistivity of at least some oil shales at about 500&#xb0; C. The required high temperatures for electrical conductivity of oil shales is aligned with known electrical behavior of petroleum coke upon calcination (see for example, Z. I. Syunyaev, et al., &#x201c;Change in the Resistivity of Petroleum Coke on Calcination&#x201d;, Chemistry and Technology of Fuels and Oils, 1(4), 292-295, April 1965).</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">Preferably, for in situ processes the heating of a production zone takes place over a period of months, or even four or more years. Alternatively, the formation may be heated for one to fifteen years, alternatively, 3 to 10 years, 1.5 to 7 years, or 2 to 5 years. The bulk of the target zone of the formation may be heated to between 270&#xb0; to 800&#xb0; C. Preferably, the bulk of the target zone of the formation is heated to between 300&#xb0; to 600&#xb0; C. Alternatively, the bulk of the target zone is ultimately heated to a temperature below 400&#xb0; C. (752&#xb0; F.).</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">In the production of oil and gas resources, it may be desirable to use the produced hydrocarbons as a source of power for ongoing operations. This may be applied to the development of oil and gas resources from oil shale. In this respect, when electrically resistive heaters are used in connection with in situ shale oil recovery, large amounts of power are required.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">Electrical power may be obtained from turbines that turn generators. It may be economically advantageous to power the gas turbines by utilizing produced gas from the field. However, such produced gas must be carefully controlled so not to damage the turbine, cause the turbine to misfire, or generate excessive pollutants (e.g., NO<sub>x</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">One source of problems for gas turbines is the presence of contaminants within the fuel. Contaminants include solids, water, heavy components present as liquids, and hydrogen sulfide. Additionally, the combustion behavior of the fuel is important. Combustion parameters to consider include heating value, specific gravity, adiabatic flame temperature, flammability limits, autoignition temperature, autoignition delay time, and flame velocity. Wobbe Index (WI) is often used as a key measure of fuel quality. WI is equal to the ratio of the lower heating value to the square root of the gas specific gravity. Control of the fuel's Wobbe Index to a target value and range of, for example, &#xb1;10% or &#xb1;20% can allow simplified turbine design and increased optimization of performance.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">Fuel quality control may be useful for shale oil developments where the produced gas composition may change over the life of the field and where the gas typically has significant amounts of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and H<sub>2 </sub>in addition to light hydrocarbons. Commercial scale oil shale retorting is expected to produce a gas composition that changes with time.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">Inert gases in the turbine fuel can increase power generation by increasing mass flow while maintaining a flame temperature in a desirable range. Moreover inert gases can lower flame temperature and thus reduce NO, pollutant generation. Gas generated from oil shale maturation may have significant CO<sub>2 </sub>content. Therefore, in certain embodiments of the production processes, the CO<sub>2 </sub>content of the fuel gas is adjusted via separation or addition in the surface facilities to optimize turbine performance.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">Achieving a certain hydrogen content for low-BTU fuels may also be desirable to achieve appropriate burn properties. In certain embodiments of the processes herein, the H<sub>2 </sub>content of the fuel gas is adjusted via separation or addition in the surface facilities to optimize turbine performance. Adjustment of H<sub>2 </sub>content in non-shale oil surface facilities utilizing low BTU fuels has been discussed in the patent literature (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,684,644 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,858,049, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">The process of heating formation hydrocarbons within an organic-rich rock formation, for example, by pyrolysis, may generate fluids. The heat-generated fluids may include water which is vaporized within the formation. In addition, the action of heating kerogen produces pyrolysis fluids which tend to expand upon heating. The produced pyrolysis fluids may include not only water, but also, for example, hydrocarbons, oxides of carbon, ammonia, molecular nitrogen, and molecular hydrogen. Therefore, as temperatures within a heated portion of the formation increase, a pressure within the heated portion may also increase as a result of increased fluid generation, molecular expansion, and vaporization of water. Thus, some corollary exists between subsurface pressure in an oil shale formation and the fluid pressure generated during pyrolysis. This, in turn, indicates that formation pressure may be monitored to detect the progress of a kerogen conversion process.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">The pressure within a heated portion of an organic-rich rock formation depends on other reservoir characteristics. These may include, for example, formation depth, distance from a heater well, a richness of the formation hydrocarbons within the organic-rich rock formation, the degree of heating, and/or a distance from a producer well.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">It may be desirable for the developer of an oil shale field to monitor formation pressure during development. Pressure within a formation may be determined at a number of different locations. Such locations may include, but may not be limited to, at a wellhead and at varying depths within a wellbore. In some embodiments, pressure may be measured at a producer well. In an alternate embodiment, pressure may be measured at a heater well. In still another embodiment, pressure may be measured downhole of a dedicated monitoring well.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">The process of heating an organic-rich rock formation to a pyrolysis temperature range not only will increase formation pressure, but will also increase formation permeability. The pyrolysis temperature range should be reached before substantial permeability has been generated within the organic-rich rock formation. An initial lack of permeability may prevent the transport of generated fluids from a pyrolysis zone within the formation. In this manner, as heat is initially transferred from a heater well to an organic-rich rock formation, a fluid pressure within the organic-rich rock formation may increase proximate to that heater well. Such an increase in fluid pressure may be caused by, for example, the generation of fluids during pyrolysis of at least some formation hydrocarbons in the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">Alternatively, pressure generated by expansion of pyrolysis fluids or other fluids generated in the formation may be allowed to increase. This assumes that an open path to a production well or other pressure sink does not yet exist in the formation. In one aspect, a fluid pressure may be allowed to increase to or above a lithostatic stress. In this instance, fractures in the hydrocarbon containing formation may form when the fluid pressure equals or exceeds the lithostatic stress. For example, fractures may form from a heater well to a production well. The generation of fractures within the heated portion may reduce pressure within the portion due to the production of produced fluids through a production well.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">Once pyrolysis has begun within an organic-rich rock formation, fluid pressure may vary depending upon various factors. These include, for example, thermal expansion of hydrocarbons, generation of pyrolysis fluids, rate of conversion, and withdrawal of generated fluids from the formation. For example, as fluids are generated within the formation, fluid pressure within the pores may increase. Removal of generated fluids from the formation may then decrease the fluid pressure within the near wellbore region of the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">In certain embodiments, a mass of at least a portion of an organic-rich rock formation may be reduced due, for example, to pyrolysis of formation hydrocarbons and the production of hydrocarbon fluids from the formation. As such, the permeability and porosity of at least a portion of the formation may increase. Any in situ method that effectively produces oil and gas from oil shale will create permeability in what was originally a very low permeability rock. The extent to which this will occur is illustrated by the large amount of expansion that must be accommodated if fluids generated from kerogen are unable to flow. The concept is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides a bar chart comparing one ton of Green River oil shale before <b>50</b> and after <b>51</b> a simulated in situ, retorting process. The simulated process was carried out at 2,400 psi and 750&#xb0; F. on oil shale having a total organic carbon content of 22 wt. % and a Fisher assay of 42 gallons/ton. Before the conversion, a total of 15.3 ft<sup>3 </sup>of rock matrix <b>52</b> existed. This matrix comprised 7.2 ft<sup>3 </sup>of mineral <b>53</b>, i.e., dolomite, limestone, etc., and 8.1 ft<sup>3 </sup>of kerogen <b>54</b> imbedded within the shale. As a result of the conversion the material expanded to 26.1 ft<sup>3 </sup><b>55</b>. This represented 7.2 ft<sup>3 </sup>of mineral <b>56</b> (the same number as before the conversion), 6.6 ft<sup>3 </sup>of hydrocarbon liquid <b>57</b>, 9.4 ft<sup>3 </sup>of hydrocarbon vapor <b>58</b>, and 2.9 ft<sup>3 </sup>of coke <b>59</b>. It can be seen that substantial volume expansion occurred during the conversion process. This, in turn, increases permeability of the rock structure.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">In an embodiment, heating a portion of an organic-rich rock formation in situ to a pyrolysis temperature may increase permeability of the heated portion. For example, permeability may increase due to formation of thermal fractures within the heated portion caused by application of heat. As the temperature of the heated portion increases, water may be removed due to vaporization. The vaporized water may escape and/or be removed from the formation. In addition, permeability of the heated portion may also increase as a result of production of hydrocarbon fluids from pyrolysis of at least some of the formation hydrocarbons within the heated portion on a macroscopic scale.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">Certain systems and methods described herein may be used to treat formation hydrocarbons in at least a portion of a relatively low permeability formation (e.g., in &#x201c;tight&#x201d; formations that contain formation hydrocarbons). Such formation hydrocarbons may be heated to pyrolyze at least some of the formation hydrocarbons in a selected zone of the formation. Heating may also increase the permeability of at least a portion of the selected zone. Hydrocarbon fluids generated from pyrolysis may be produced from the formation, thereby further increasing the formation permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">Permeability of a selected zone within the heated portion of the organic-rich rock formation may also rapidly increase while the selected zone is heated by conduction. For example, permeability of an impermeable organic-rich rock formation may be less than about 0.1 millidarcy before heating. In some embodiments, pyrolyzing at least a portion of organic-rich rock formation may increase permeability within a selected zone of the portion to greater than about 10 millidarcies, 100 millidarcies, 1 Darcy, 10 Darcies, 20 Darcies, or 50 Darcies. Therefore, a permeability of a selected zone of the portion may increase by a factor of more than about 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000. In one embodiment, the organic-rich rock formation has an initial total permeability less than 1 millidarcy, alternatively less than 0.1 or 0.01 millidarcies, before heating the organic-rich rock formation. In one embodiment, the organic-rich rock formation has a post heating total permeability of greater than 1 millidarcy, alternatively, greater than 10, 50 or 100 millidarcies, after heating the organic-rich rock formation.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">In connection with heating the organic-rich rock formation, the organic-rich rock formation may optionally be fractured to aid heat transfer or hydrocarbon fluid production. In one instance, fracturing may be accomplished naturally by creating thermal fractures within the formation through application of heat. Thermal fracture formation is caused by thermal expansion of the rock and fluids and by chemical expansion of kerogen transforming into oil and gas. Thermal fracturing can occur both in the immediate region undergoing heating, and in cooler neighboring regions. The thermal fracturing in the neighboring regions is due to propagation of fractures and tension stresses developed due to the expansion in the hotter zones. Thus, by both heating the organic-rich rock and transforming the kerogen to oil and gas, the permeability is increased not only from fluid formation and vaporization, but also via thermal fracture formation. The increased permeability aids fluid flow within the formation and production of the hydrocarbon fluids generated from the kerogen.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">In connection with the production of hydrocarbons from a rock matrix, particularly those of shallow depth, a concern may exist with respect to earth subsidence. This is particularly true in the in situ heating of organic-rich rock where a portion of the matrix itself is thermally converted and removed. Initially, the formation may contain formation hydrocarbons in solid form, such as, for example, kerogen. The formation may also initially contain water-soluble minerals. Initially, the formation may also be substantially impermeable to fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">The in situ heating of the matrix pyrolyzes at least a portion of the formation hydrocarbons to create hydrocarbon fluids. This, in turn, creates permeability within a matured (pyrolyzed) organic-rich rock zone in the organic-rich rock formation. The combination of pyrolyzation and increased permeability permits hydrocarbon fluids to be produced from the formation. At the same time, the loss of supporting matrix material also creates the potential for subsidence relative to the earth surface.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">In some instances, subsidence is sought to be minimized in order to avoid environmental or hydrogeological impact. In this respect, changing the contour and relief of the earth surface, even by a few inches, can change runoff patterns, affect vegetation patterns, and impact watersheds. In addition, subsidence has the potential of damaging production or heater wells formed in a production area. Such subsidence can create damaging hoop and compressional stresses on wellbore casings, cement jobs, and equipment downhole.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">In order to avoid or minimize subsidence, it is proposed to leave selected portions of the formation hydrocarbons substantially unpyrolyzed. This serves to preserve one or more unmatured, organic-rich rock zones. In some embodiments, the unmatured organic-rich rock zones may be shaped as substantially vertical pillars extending through a substantial portion of the thickness of the organic-rich rock formation.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">The heating rate and distribution of heat within the formation may be designed and implemented to leave sufficient unmatured pillars to prevent subsidence. In one aspect, heat injection wellbores are formed in a pattern such that untreated pillars of oil shale are left therebetween to support the overburden and prevent subsidence.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">It is preferred that thermal recovery of oil and gas be conducted before any solution mining of nahcolite or other water-soluble minerals present in the formation. Solution mining can generate large voids in a rock formation and collapse breccias in an oil shale development area. These voids and brecciated zones may pose problems for in situ and mining recovery of oil shale, further increasing the utility of supporting pillars.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">In some embodiments, compositions and properties of the hydrocarbon fluids produced by an in situ conversion process may vary depending on, for example, conditions within an organic-rich rock formation. Controlling heat and/or heating rates of a selected section in an organic-rich rock formation may increase or decrease production of selected produced fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">In one embodiment, operating conditions may be determined by measuring at least one property of the organic-rich rock formation. The measured properties may be input into a computer executable program. At least one property of the produced fluids selected to be produced from the formation may also be input into the computer executable program. The program may be operable to determine a set of operating conditions from at least the one or more measured properties. The program may also be configured to determine the set of operating conditions from at least one property of the selected produced fluids. In this manner, the determined set of operating conditions may be configured to increase production of selected produced fluids from the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">Certain heater well embodiments may include an operating system that is coupled to any of the heater wells such as by insulated conductors or other types of wiring. The operating system may be configured to interface with the heater well. The operating system may receive a signal (e.g., an electromagnetic signal) from a heater that is representative of a temperature distribution of the heater well. Additionally, the operating system may be further configured to control the heater well, either locally or remotely. For example, the operating system may alter a temperature of the heater well by altering a parameter of equipment coupled to the heater well. Therefore, the operating system may monitor, alter, and/or control the heating of at least a portion of the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">In some embodiments, a heater well may be turned down and/or off after an average temperature in a formation may have reached a selected temperature. Turning down and/or off the heater well may reduce input energy costs, substantially inhibit overheating of the formation, and allow heat to substantially transfer into colder regions of the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">Temperature (and average temperatures) within a heated organic-rich rock formation may vary, depending on, for example, proximity to a heater well, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of the formation, type of reaction occurring, type of formation hydrocarbon, and the presence of water within the organic-rich rock formation. At points in the field where monitoring wells are established, temperature measurements may be taken directly in the wellbore. Further, at heater wells the temperature of the immediately surrounding formation is fairly well understood. However, it is desirable to interpolate temperatures to points in the formation intermediate temperature sensors and heater wells.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">In accordance with one aspect of the production processes of the present inventions, a temperature distribution within the organic-rich rock formation may be computed using a numerical simulation model. The numerical simulation model may calculate a subsurface temperature distribution through interpolation of known data points and assumptions of formation conductivity. In addition, the numerical simulation model may be used to determine other properties of the formation under the assessed temperature distribution. For example, the various properties of the formation may include, but are not limited to, permeability of the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">The numerical simulation model may also include assessing various properties of a fluid formed within an organic-rich rock formation under the assessed temperature distribution. For example, the various properties of a formed fluid may include, but are not limited to, a cumulative volume of a fluid formed in the formation, fluid viscosity, fluid density, and a composition of the fluid formed in the formation. Such a simulation may be used to assess the performance of a commercial-scale operation or small-scale field experiment. For example, a performance of a commercial-scale development may be assessed based on, but not limited to, a total volume of product that may be produced from a research-scale operation.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">Some embodiments include producing at least a portion of the hydrocarbon fluids from the organic-rich rock formation. The hydrocarbon fluids may be produced through production wells. Production wells may be cased or uncased wells and drilled and completed through methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">Some embodiments further include producing a production fluid from the organic-rich rock formation where the production fluid contains the hydrocarbon fluids and an aqueous fluid. The aqueous fluid may contain water-soluble minerals and/or migratory contaminant species. In such case, the production fluid may be separated into a hydrocarbon stream and an aqueous stream at a surface facility. Thereafter the water-soluble minerals and/or migratory contaminant species may be recovered from the aqueous stream. This embodiment may be combined with any of the other aspects of the invention discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">The produced hydrocarbon fluids may include a pyrolysis oil component (or condensable component) and a pyrolysis gas component (or non-condensable component). Condensable hydrocarbons produced from the formation will typically include paraffins, cycloalkanes, mono-aromatics, and di-aromatics as components. Such condensable hydrocarbons may also include other components such as tri-aromatics and other hydrocarbon species.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">In certain embodiments, a majority of the hydrocarbons in the produced fluid may have a carbon number of less than approximately 25. Alternatively, less than about 15 weight % of the hydrocarbons in the fluid may have a carbon number greater than approximately 25. The non-condensable hydrocarbons may include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbons having carbon numbers less than 5.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">In certain embodiments, the API gravity of the condensable hydrocarbons in the produced fluid may be approximately 20 or above (e.g., 25, 30, 40, 50, etc.). In certain embodiments, the hydrogen to carbon atomic ratio in produced fluid may be at least approximately 1.7 (e.g., 1.8, 1.9, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">One embodiment of the invention includes an in situ method of producing hydrocarbon fluids with improved properties from an organic-rich rock formation. Applicants have surprisingly discovered that the quality of the hydrocarbon fluids produced from in situ heating and pyrolysis of an organic-rich rock formation may be improved by selecting sections of the organic-rich rock formation with higher lithostatic stress for in situ heating and pyrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">The method may include in situ heating of a section of the organic-rich rock formation that has a high lithostatic stress to form hydrocarbon fluids with improved properties. The method may include creating the hydrocarbon fluid by pyrolysis of a solid hydrocarbon and/or a heavy hydrocarbon present in the organic-rich rock formation. Embodiments may include the hydrocarbon fluid being partially, predominantly or substantially completely created by pyrolysis of the solid hydrocarbon and/or heavy hydrocarbon present in the organic-rich rock formation. The method may include heating the section of the organic-rich rock formation by any method, including any of the methods described herein. For example, the method may include heating the section of the organic-rich rock formation by electrical resistance heating. Further, the method may include heating the section of the organic-rich rock formation through use of a heated heat transfer fluid. The method may include heating the section of the organic-rich rock formation to above 270&#xb0; C. Alternatively, the method may include heating the section of the organic-rich rock formation between 270&#xb0; C. and 500&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">The method may include heating in situ a section of the organic-rich rock formation having a lithostatic stress greater than 200 psi and producing a hydrocarbon fluid from the heated section of the organic-rich rock formation. In alternative embodiments, the heated section of the organic-rich rock formation may have a lithostatic stress greater than 400 psi. In alternative embodiments, the heated section of the organic-rich rock formation may have a lithostatic stress greater than 800 psi, greater than 1,000 psi, greater than 1,200 psi, greater than 1,500 psi or greater than 2,000 psi. Applicants have found that in situ heating and pyrolysis of organic-rich rock formations with increasing amounts of stress lead to the production of hydrocarbon fluids with improved properties.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">The lithostatic stress of a section of an organic-rich formation can normally be estimated by recognizing that it will generally be equal to the weight of the rocks overlying the formation. The density of the overlying rocks can be expressed in units of psi/ft. Generally, this value will fall between 0.8 and 1.1 psi/ft and can often be approximated as 0.9 psi/ft. As a result the lithostatic stress of a section of an organic-rich formation can be estimated by multiplying the depth of the organic-rich rock formation interval by 0.9 psi/ft. Thus the lithostatic stress of a section of an organic-rich formation occurring at about 1,000 fit can be estimated to be about (0.9 psi/ft) multiplied by (1,000 ft) or about 900 psi. If a more precise estimate of lithostatic stress is desired the density of overlying rocks can be measured using wireline logging techniques or by making laboratory measurements on samples recovered from coreholes. The method may include heating a section of the organic-rich rock formation that is located at a depth greater than 200 fit below the earth's surface. Alternatively, the method may include heating a section of the organic-rich rock formation that is located at a depth greater than 500 ft below the earth's surface, greater than 1,000 ft below the earth's surface, greater than 1,200 ft below the earth's surface, greater than 1,500 ft below the earth's surface, or greater than 2,000 ft below the earth's surface.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">The organic-rich rock formation may be, for example, a heavy hydrocarbon formation or a solid hydrocarbon formation. Particular examples of such formations may include an oil shale formation, a tar sands formation or a coal formation. Particular formation hydrocarbons present in such formations may include oil shale, kerogen, coal, and/or bitumen.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">The hydrocarbon fluid produced from the organic-rich rock formation may include both a condensable hydrocarbon portion (e.g. liquid) and a non-condensable hydrocarbon portion (e.g. gas). The hydrocarbon fluid may additionally be produced together with non-hydrocarbon fluids. Exemplary non-hydrocarbon fluids include, for example, water, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, ammonia, and/or carbon monoxide.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">The condensable hydrocarbon portion of the hydrocarbon fluid may be a fluid present within different locations associated with an organic-rich rock development project. For example, the condensable hydrocarbon portion of the hydrocarbon fluid may be a fluid present within a production well that is in fluid communication with the organic-rich rock formation. The production well may serve as a device for withdrawing the produced hydrocarbon fluids from the organic-rich rock formation. Alternatively, the condensable hydrocarbon portion may be a fluid present within processing equipment adapted to process hydrocarbon fluids produced from the organic-rich rock formation. Exemplary processing equipment is described herein. Alternatively, the condensable hydrocarbon portion may be a fluid present within a fluid storage vessel. Fluid storage vessels may include, for example, fluid storage tanks with fixed or floating roofs, knock-out vessels, and other intermediate, temporary or product storage vessels. Alternatively, the condensable hydrocarbon portion may be a fluid present within a fluid transportation pipeline. A fluid transportation pipeline may include, for example, piping from production wells to processing equipment or fluid storage vessels, piping from processing equipment to fluid storage vessels, or pipelines associated with collection or transportation of fluids to or from intermediate or centralized storage locations.</p>

For clarity, when referring to gas chromatography chromatograms of hydrocarbon gas samples, graphical data is provided for one unstressed experiment through Example 1, two 400 psi stressed experiments through Examples 2 and 3, and two 1,000 psi stressed experiments through Examples 4 and 5. When referring to whole oil gas chromatography (WOGC) chromatograms of liquid hydrocarbon samples, graphical data is provided for one unstressed experiment through Example 1, one 400 psi stressed experiments through Example 3, and one 1,000 psi stressed experiment through Example 4.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a graph of the weight percent of each carbon number pseudo component occurring from C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>38 </sub>for each of the three stress levels tested and analyzed in the laboratory experiments discussed herein. The pseudo component weight percentages were obtained through the experimental procedures, liquid sample collection procedures, whole oil gas chromatography (WOGC) analysis methodology, whole oil gas chromatography (WOGC) peak identification and integration methodology, and pseudo component analysis methodology discussed in the Experiments section. For clarity, the pseudo component weight percentages are taken as a percentage of the entire C<sub>3 </sub>to pseudo C<sub>38 </sub>whole oil gas chromatography areas and calculated weights. Thus the graphed C<sub>3 </sub>to C<sub>38 </sub>weight percentages do not include the weight contribution of the associated gas phase product from any of the experiments which was separately treated. Further, the graphed weight percentages do not include the weight contribution of any liquid hydrocarbon compounds heavier than (i.e. having a longer retention time than) the C<sub>38 </sub>pseudo component. The y-axis <b>2000</b> represents the concentration in terms of weight percent of each C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>38 </sub>pseudo component in the liquid phase.

It is noted that the C<sub>17 </sub>pseudo component data for both the 400 psi and 1,000 psi stressed experiments are about equal. Further, it is apparent that the weight percentage of heavier hydrocarbon components in the C<sub>20 </sub>to C<sub>29 </sub>pseudo component range for the intermediate stress level experiment represented by line <b>2003</b> falls between the unstressed experiment (Line <b>2002</b>) hydrocarbon liquid and the 1,000 psi stress experiment (Line <b>2004</b>) hydrocarbon liquid. Lastly, it is apparent that the high level 1,000 psi stress experiment produced a hydrocarbon liquid having C<sub>8 </sub>to C<sub>17 </sub>pseudo component concentrations greater than both the unstressed experiment represented by line <b>2002</b> and the 400 psi stressed experiment represented by line <b>2003</b>.

Thus the graphed methane to normal C6 molar percentages for all of the experiments do not include the molar contribution of any associated non-hydrocarbon gas phase product (e.g., hydrogen, CO<sub>2 </sub>or H<sub>2</sub>S), any of the unidentified hydrocarbon gas species listed in Tables 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9 (e.g., peak numbers 2, 6, 8-11, 13, 15-22, 24-26, and 28-78 in Table 2) or any of the gas species dissolved in the liquid phase which were separately treated in the liquid GC's. The y-axis <b>3080</b> represents the concentration in terms of molar percent of each gaseous compound in the gas phase. The x-axis <b>3081</b> contains the identity of each hydrocarbon compound from methane to normal hexane. The bars <b>3082</b>A-I represent the molar percentage of each gaseous compound for the unstressed experiment of Example 1. That is <b>3082</b>A represents methane, <b>3082</b>B represents ethane, <b>3082</b>C represents propane, <b>3082</b>D represents iso-butane, <b>3082</b>E represents normal butane, <b>3082</b>F represents iso-pentane, <b>3082</b>G represents normal pentane, <b>3082</b>H represents 2-methyl pentane, and <b>3082</b>I represents normal hexane. The bars <b>3083</b>A-I and <b>3084</b>A-I represent the molar percent of each gaseous compound for samples from the duplicate 400 psi stressed experiments of Examples 2 and 3, with the letters assigned in the manner described for the unstressed experiment. While the bars <b>3085</b>A-I and <b>3086</b>A-I represent the molar percent of each gaseous compound for the duplicate 1,000 psi stressed experiments of Examples 4 and 5, with the letters assigned in the manner described for the unstressed experiment. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> it can be seen that the hydrocarbon gas produced in all the experiments is primarily methane, ethane and propane on a molar basis. It is further apparent that the unstressed experiment, represented by bars <b>3082</b>A-I, contains the most methane <b>3082</b>A and least propane <b>3082</b>C, both as compared to the 400 psi stress experiments hydrocarbon gases and the 1,000 psi stress experiments hydrocarbon gases. Looking now at bars <b>3083</b>A-I and <b>3084</b>A-I, it is apparent that the intermediate level 400 psi stress experiments produced a hydrocarbon gas having methane <b>3083</b>A &#x26; <b>3084</b>A and propane <b>3083</b>C &#x26; <b>3084</b>C concentrations between the unstressed experiment represented by bars <b>3082</b>A &#x26; <b>3082</b>C and the 1,000 psi stressed experiment represented by bars <b>3085</b>A &#x26; <b>3085</b>C and <b>3086</b>A &#x26; <b>3086</b>C. Lastly, it is apparent that the high level 1,000 psi stress experiments produced hydrocarbon gases having the lowest methane <b>3085</b>A &#x26; <b>3086</b>A concentration and the highest propane concentrations <b>3085</b>C &#x26; <b>3086</b>C, as compared to both the unstressed experiments represented by bars <b>3082</b>A &#x26; <b>3082</b>C and the 400 psi stressed experiment represented by bars <b>3083</b>A &#x26; <b>3084</b>A and <b>3083</b>C &#x26; <b>3084</b>C. Thus pyrolizing oil shale under increasing levels of lithostatic stress appears to produce hydrocarbon gases having decreasing concentrations of methane and increasing concentrations of propane.</p>

<p id="p-0405" num="0404">The discovery that lithostatic stress can affect the composition of produced fluids generated within an organic-rich rock via heating and pyrolysis implies that the composition of the produced hydrocarbon fluid can also be influenced by altering the lithostatic stress of the organic-rich rock formation. For example, the lithostatic stress of the organic-rich rock formation may be altered by choice of pillar geometries and/or locations and/or by choice of heating and pyrolysis formation region thickness and/or heating sequencing.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">Pillars are regions within the organic-rich rock formation left unpyrolized at a given time to lessen or mitigate surface subsidence. Pillars may be regions within a formation surrounded by pyrolysis regions within the same formation. Alternatively, pillars may be part of or connected to the unheated regions outside the general development area. Certain regions that act as pillars early in the life of a producing field may be converted to producing regions later in the life of the field.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">Typically in its natural state, the weight of a formation's overburden is fairly uniformly distributed over the formation. In this state the lithostatic stress existing at particular point within a formation is largely controlled by the thickness and density of the overburden. A desired lithostatic stress may be selected by analyzing overburden geology and choosing a position with an appropriate depth and position.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">Although lithostatic stresses are commonly assumed to be set by nature and not changeable short of removing all or part of the overburden, lithostatic stress at a specific location within a formation can be adjusted by redistributing the overburden weight so it is not uniformly supported by the formation. For example, this redistribution of overburden weight may be accomplished by two exemplary methods. One or both of these methods may be used within a single formation. In certain cases, one method may be primarily used earlier in time whereas the other may be primarily used at a later time. Favorably altering the lithostatic stress experienced by a formation region may be performed prior to instigating significant pyrolysis within the formation region and also before generating significant hydrocarbon fluids. Alternately, favorably altering the lithostatic stress may be performed simultaneously with the pyrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">A first method of altering lithostatic stress involves making a region of a subsurface formation less stiff than its neighboring regions. Neighboring regions thus increasingly act as pillars supporting the overburden as a particular region becomes less stiff. These pillar regions experience increased lithostatic stress whereas the less stiff regions experience reduced lithostatic stress. The amount of change in lithostatic stress depends upon a number of factors including, for example, the change in stiffness of the treated region, the size of the treated region, the pillar size, the pillar spacing, the rock compressibility, and the rock strength. In an organic-rich rock formation, a region within a formation may be made to experience mechanical weakening by pyrolyzing the region and creating void space within the region by removing produced fluids. In this way a region within a formation may be made less stiff than neighboring regions that have not experienced pyrolysis or have experienced a lesser degree of pyrolysis or production.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">A second method of altering lithostatic stress involves causing a region of a subsurface formation to expand and push against the overburden with greater force than neighboring regions. This expansion may remove a portion of the overburden weight from the neighboring regions thus increasing the lithostatic stress experienced by the heated region(s) and reducing the lithostatic stress experienced by neighboring regions. If the expansion is sufficient, horizontal fractures will form in the neighboring regions and the contribution of these regions to supporting the overburden will decrease. The amount of change in lithostatic stress depends upon a number of factors including, for example, the amount of expansion in the treated region, the size of the treated region, the pillar size, the pillar spacing, the rock compressibility, and the rock strength. A region within a formation may be made to expand by heating it so to cause thermal expansion of the rock. Fluid expansion or fluid generation can also contribute to expansion if the fluids are largely trapped within the region. The total expansion amount may be proportional to the thickness of the heated region. It is noted that if pyrolysis occurs in the heated region and sufficient fluids are removed, the heated region may mechanically weaken and thus may alter the lithostatic stresses experienced by the neighboring regions as described in the first exemplary method.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">Embodiments of the method may include controlling the composition of produced hydrocarbon fluids generated by heating and pyrolysis from a first region within an organic-rich rock formation by increasing the lithostatic stresses within the first region by first heating and pyrolyzing formation hydrocarbons present in the organic-rich rock formation and producing fluids from a second neighboring region within the organic-rich rock formation such that the Young's modulus (i.e., stiffness) of the second region is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">Embodiments of the method may include controlling the composition of produced hydrocarbon fluids generated by heating and pyrolysis from a first region within an organic-rich rock formation by increasing the lithostatic stresses within the first region by heating the first region prior to or to a greater degree than neighboring regions within the organic-rich rock formation such that the thermal expansion within the first region is greater than that within the neighboring regions of the organic-rich rock formation.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">Embodiments of the method may include controlling the composition of produced hydrocarbon fluids generated by heating and pyrolysis from a first region within an organic-rich rock formation by decreasing the lithostatic stresses within the first region by heating one or more neighboring regions of the organic-rich rock formation prior to or to a greater degree than the first region such that the thermal expansion within the neighboring regions is greater than that within the first region.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">Embodiments of the method may include locating, sizing, and/or timing the heating of heated regions within an organic-rich rock formation so as to alter the in situ lithostatic stresses of current or future heating and pyrolysis regions within the organic-rich rock formation so as to control the composition of produced hydrocarbon fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">Some production procedures include in situ heating of an organic-rich rock formation that contains both formation hydrocarbons and formation water-soluble minerals prior to substantial removal of the formation water-soluble minerals from the organic-rich rock formation. In some embodiments of the invention there is no need to partially, substantially or completely remove the water-soluble minerals prior to in situ heating. For example, in an oil shale formation that contains naturally occurring nahcolite, the oil shale may be heated prior to substantial removal of the nahcolite by solution mining. Substantial removal of a water-soluble mineral may represent the degree of removal of a water-soluble mineral that occurs from any commercial solution mining operation as known in the art. Substantial removal of a water-soluble mineral may be approximated as removal of greater than 5 weight percent of the total amount of a particular water-soluble mineral present in the zone targeted for hydrocarbon fluid production in the organic-rich rock formation. In alternative embodiments, in situ heating of the organic-rich rock formation to pyrolyze formation hydrocarbons may be commenced prior to removal of greater than 3 weight percent, alternatively 7 weight percent, 10 weight percent or 13 weight percent of the formation water-soluble minerals from the organic-rich rock formation.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">The impact of heating oil shale to produce oil and gas prior to producing nahcolite is to convert the nahcolite to a more recoverable form (soda ash), and provide permeability facilitating its subsequent recovery. Water-soluble mineral recovery may take place as soon as the retorted oil is produced, or it may be left for a period of years for later recovery. If desired, the soda ash can be readily converted back to nahcolite on the surface. The ease with which this conversion can be accomplished makes the two minerals effectively interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0416">In some production processes, heating the organic-rich rock formation includes generating soda ash by decomposition of nahcolite. The method may include processing an aqueous solution containing water-soluble minerals in a surface facility to remove a portion of the water-soluble minerals. The processing step may include removing the water-soluble minerals by precipitation caused by altering the temperature of the aqueous solution.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417">The water-soluble minerals may include sodium. The water-soluble minerals may also include nahcolite (sodium bicarbonate), soda ash (sodium carbonate), dawsonite (NaAl(CO<sub>3</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>), or combinations thereof. The surface processing may further include converting the soda ash back to sodium bicarbonate (nahcolite) in the surface facility by reaction with CO<sub>2</sub>. After partial or complete removal of the water-soluble minerals, the aqueous solution may be reinjected into a subsurface formation where it may be sequestered. The subsurface formation may be the same as or different from the original organic-rich rock formation.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">In some production processes, heating of the organic-rich rock formation both pyrolyzes at least a portion of the formation hydrocarbons to create hydrocarbon fluids and makes available migratory contaminant species previously bound in the organic-rich rock formation. The migratory contaminant species may be formed through pyrolysis of the formation hydrocarbons, may be liberated from the formation itself upon heating, or may be made accessible through the creation of increased permeability upon heating of the formation. The migratory contaminant species may be soluble in water or other aqueous fluids present in or injected into the organic-rich rock formation.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">Producing hydrocarbons from pyrolyzed oil shale will generally leave behind some migratory contaminant species which are at least partially water-soluble. Depending on the hydrological connectivity of the pyrolyzed shale oil to shallower zones, these components may eventually migrate into ground water in concentrations which are environmentally unacceptable. The types of potential migratory contaminant species depend on the nature of the oil shale pyrolysis and the composition of the oil shale being converted. If the pyrolysis is performed in the absence of oxygen or air, the contaminant species may include aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. anthracene, pyrene, naphthalene, chrysene), metal contaminants (e.g. As, Co, Pb, Mo, Ni, and Zn), and other species such as sulfates, ammonia, Al, K, Mg, chlorides, fluorides and phenols. If oxygen or air is employed, contaminant species may also include ketones, alcohols, and cyanides. Further, the specific migratory contaminant species present may include any subset or combination of the above-described species.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">It may be desirable for a field developer to assess the connectivity of the organic-rich rock formation to aquifers. This may be done to determine if, or to what extent, in situ pyrolysis of formation hydrocarbons in the organic-rich rock formation may create migratory species with the propensity to migrate into an aquifer. If the organic-rich rock formation is hydrologically connected to an aquifer, precautions may be taken to reduce or prevent species generated or liberated during pyrolysis from entering the aquifer. Alternatively, the organic-rich rock formation may be flushed with water or an aqueous fluid after pyrolysis as described herein to remove water-soluble minerals and/or migratory contaminant species. In other embodiments, the organic-rich rock formation may be substantially hydrologically unconnected to any source of ground water. In such a case, flushing the organic-rich rock formation may not be desirable for removal of migratory contaminant species but may nevertheless be desirable for recovery of water-soluble minerals.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">Following production of hydrocarbons from an organic-rich formation, some migratory contaminant species may remain in the rock formation. In such case, it may be desirable to inject an aqueous fluid into the organic-rich rock formation and have the injected aqueous fluid dissolve at least a portion of the water-soluble minerals and/or the migratory contaminant species to form an aqueous solution. The aqueous solution may then be produced from the organic-rich rock formation through, for example, solution production wells. The aqueous fluid may be adjusted to increase the solubility of the migratory contaminant species and/or the water-soluble minerals. The adjustment may include the addition of an acid or base to adjust the pH of the solution. The resulting aqueous solution may then be produced from the organic-rich rock formation to the surface for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">After initial aqueous fluid production, it may further be desirable to flush the matured organic-rich rock zone and the unmatured organic-rich rock zone with an aqueous fluid. The aqueous fluid may be used to further dissolve water-soluble minerals and migratory contaminant species. The flushing may optionally be completed after a substantial portion of the hydrocarbon fluids have been produced from the matured organic-rich rock zone. In some embodiments, the flushing step may be delayed after the hydrocarbon fluid production step. The flushing may be delayed to allow heat generated from the heating step to migrate deeper into surrounding unmatured organic-rich rock zones to convert nahcolite within the surrounding unmatured organic-rich rock zones to soda ash. Alternatively, the flushing may be delayed to allow heat generated from the heating step to generate permeability within the surrounding unmatured organic-rich rock zones. Further, the flushing may be delayed based on current and/or forecast market prices of sodium bicarbonate, soda ash, or both as further discussed herein. This method may be combined with any of the other aspects of the invention as discussed herein</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">Upon flushing of an aqueous solution, it may be desirable to process the aqueous solution in a surface facility to remove at least some of the migratory contaminant species. The migratory contaminant species may be removed through use of, for example, an adsorbent material, reverse osmosis, chemical oxidation, bio-oxidation, and/or ion exchange. Examples of these processes are individually known in the art. Exemplary adsorbent materials may include activated carbon, clay, or fuller's earth.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">In certain areas with oil shale resources, additional oil shale resources or other hydrocarbon resources may exist at lower depths. Other hydrocarbon resources may include natural gas in low permeability formations (so-called &#x201c;tight gas&#x201d;) or natural gas trapped in and adsorbed on coal (so called &#x201c;coalbed methane&#x201d;). In some embodiments with multiple shale oil resources it may be advantageous to develop deeper zones first and then sequentially shallower zones. In this way, wells need not cross hot zones or zones of weakened rock. In other embodiments in may be advantageous to develop deeper zones by drilling wells through regions being utilized as pillars for shale oil development at a shallower depth.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">Simultaneous development of shale oil resources and natural gas resources in the same area can synergistically utilize certain facility and logistic operations. For example, gas treating may be performed at a single plant. Likewise personnel may be shared among the developments.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of an embodiment of surface facilities <b>70</b> that may be configured to treat a produced fluid.

The produced fluid may include any of the produced fluids produced by any of the methods as described herein. The subsurface formation <b>84</b> may be any subsurface formation, including, for example, an organic-rich rock formation containing any of oil shale, coal, or tar sands for example. A production scheme may involve quenching <b>72</b> produced fluids to a temperature below 300&#xb0; F., 200&#xb0; F., or even 100&#xb0; F., separating out condensable components (i.e., oil <b>74</b> and water <b>75</b>) in an oil separator <b>73</b>, treating the noncondensable components <b>76</b> (i.e. gas) in a gas treating unit <b>77</b> to remove water <b>78</b> and sulfur species <b>79</b>, removing the heavier components from the gas (e.g., propane and butanes) in a gas plant <b>81</b> to form liquid petroleum gas (LPG) <b>80</b> for sale, and generating electrical power <b>82</b> in a power plant <b>88</b> from the remaining gas <b>83</b>. The electrical power <b>82</b> may be used as an energy source for heating the subsurface formation <b>84</b> through any of the methods described herein. For example, the electrical power <b>82</b> may be feed at a high voltage, for example 132 kV, to a transformer <b>86</b> and let down to a lower voltage, for example 6600 V, before being fed to an electrical resistance heater element located in a heater well <b>87</b> located in the subsurface formation <b>84</b>. In this way all or a portion of the power required to heat the subsurface formation <b>84</b> may be generated from the non-condensable portion of the produced fluids <b>85</b>. Excess gas, if available, may be exported for sale.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">Produced fluids from in situ oil shale production contain a number of components which may be separated in surface facilities. The produced fluids typically contain water, noncondensable hydrocarbon alkane species (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutane), noncondensable hydrocarbon alkene species (e.g., ethene, propene), condensable hydrocarbon species composed of (alkanes, olefins, aromatics, and polyaromatics among others), CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, and NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0428">In a surface facility, condensable components may be separated from non-condensable components by reducing temperature and/or increasing pressure. Temperature reduction may be accomplished using heat exchangers cooled by ambient air or available water. Alternatively, the hot produced fluids may be cooled via heat exchange with produced hydrocarbon fluids previously cooled. The pressure may be increased via centrifugal or reciprocating compressors. Alternatively, or in conjunction, a diffuser-expander apparatus may be used to condense out liquids from gaseous flows. Separations may involve several stages of cooling and/or pressure changes.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0429">Water in addition to condensable hydrocarbons may be dropped out of the gas when reducing temperature or increasing pressure. Liquid water may be separated from condensable hydrocarbons via gravity settling vessels or centrifugal separators. Demulsifiers may be used to aid in water separation.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0430">Methods to remove CO<sub>2</sub>, as well as other so-called acid gases (such as H<sub>2</sub>S), from produced hydrocarbon gas include the use of chemical reaction processes and of physical solvent processes. Chemical reaction processes typically involve contacting the gas stream with an aqueous amine solution at high pressure and/or low temperature. This causes the acid gas species to chemically react with the amines and go into solution. By raising the temperature and/or lowering the pressure, the chemical reaction can be reversed and a concentrated stream of acid gases can be recovered. An alternative chemical reaction process involves hot carbonate solutions, typically potassium carbonate. The hot carbonate solution is regenerated and the concentrated stream of acid gases is recovered by contacting the solution with steam. Physical solvent processes typically involve contacting the gas stream with a glycol at high pressure and/or low temperature. Like the amine processes, reducing the pressure or raising the temperature allows regeneration of the solvent and recovery of the acid gases. Certain amines or glycols may be more or less selective in the types of acid gas species removed. Sizing of any of these processes requires determining the amount of chemical to circulate, the rate of circulation, the energy input for regeneration, and the size and type of gas-chemical contacting equipment. Contacting equipment may include packed or multi-tray countercurrent towers. Optimal sizing for each of these aspects is highly dependent on the rate at which gas is being produced from the formation and the concentration of the acid gases in the gas stream.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">Acid gas removal may also be effectuated through the use of distillation towers. Such towers may include an intermediate freezing section wherein frozen CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>S particles are allowed to form. A mixture of frozen particles and liquids fall downward into a stripping section, where the lighter hydrocarbon gasses break out and rise within the tower. A rectification section may be provided at an upper end of the tower to further facilitate the cleaning of the overhead gas stream.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432">The hydrogen content of a gas stream may be adjusted by either removing all or a portion of the hydrogen or by removing all or a portion of the non-hydrogen species (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, etc.) Separations may be accomplished using cryogenic condensation, pressure-swing or temperature-swing adsorption, or selective diffusion membranes. If additional hydrogen is needed, hydrogen may be made by reforming methane via the classic water-shift reaction.</p>

<p id="p-0434" num="0433">Heating experiments were conducted on several different oil shale specimens and the liquids and gases released from the heated oil shale examined in detail. An oil shale sample from the Mahogany formation in the Piceance Basin in Colorado was collected. A solid, continuous block of the oil shale formation, approximately 1 cubic foot in size, was collected from the pilot mine at the Colony mine site on the eastern side of Parachute Creek. The oil shale block was designated CM-1B. The core specimens taken from this block, as described in the following examples, were all taken from the same stratigraphic interval. The heating tests were conducted using a Parr vessel, model number 243HC5, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and is available from Parr Instrument Company.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">Oil shale block CM-1B was cored across the bedding planes to produce a cylinder 1.391 inches in diameter and approximately 2 inches long. A gold tube <b>7002</b> approximately 2 inches in diameter and 5 inches long was crimped and a screen <b>7000</b> inserted to serve as a support for the core specimen <b>7001</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). The oil shale core specimen <b>7001</b>, 82.46 grams in weight, was placed on the screen <b>7000</b> in the gold tube <b>7002</b> and the entire assembly placed into a Parr heating vessel. The Parr vessel <b>7010</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, had an internal volume of 565 milliliters. Argon was used to flush the Parr vessel <b>7010</b> several times to remove air present in the chamber and the vessel pressurized to 500 psi with argon. The Parr vessel was then placed in a furnace which was designed to fit the Parr vessel. The furnace was initially at room temperature and was heated to 400&#xb0; C. after the Parr vessel was placed in the furnace. The temperature of the Parr vessel achieved 400&#xb0; C. after about 3 hours and remained in the 400&#xb0; C. furnace for 24 hours. The Parr vessel was then removed from the furnace and allowed to cool to room temperature over a period of approximately 16 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">The room temperature Parr vessel was sampled to obtain a representative portion of the gas remaining in the vessel following the heating experiment. A small gas sampling cylinder 150 milliliters in volume was evacuated, attached to the Parr vessel and the pressure allowed to equilibrate. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis testing and non-hydrocarbon gas sample gas chromatography (GC) (GC not shown) of this gas sample yielded the results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, Table 2 and Table 1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> the y-axis <b>4000</b> represents the detector response in pico-amperes (pA) while the x-axis <b>4001</b> represents the retention time in minutes. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> peak <b>4002</b> represents the response for methane, peak <b>4003</b> represents the response for ethane, peak <b>4004</b> represents the response for propane, peak <b>4005</b> represents the response for butane, peak <b>4006</b> represents the response for pentane and peak <b>4007</b> represents the response for hexane. From the GC results and the known volumes and pressures involved the total hydrocarbon content of the gas (2.09 grams), CO<sub>2 </sub>content of the gas (3.35 grams), and H2S content of the gas (0.06 gram) were obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0438" num="0437">The Parr vessel was then vented to achieve atmospheric pressure, the vessel opened, and liquids collected from both inside the gold tube and in the bottom of the Parr vessel. Water was separated from the hydrocarbon layer and weighed. The amount collected is noted in Table 1. The collected hydrocarbon liquids were placed in a small vial, sealed and stored in the absence of light. No solids were observed on the walls of the gold tube or the walls of the Parr vessel. The solid core specimen was weighed and determined to have lost 19.21 grams as a result of heating. Whole oil gas chromatography (WOGC) testing of the liquid yielded the results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, Table 3, and Table 1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> the y-axis <b>5000</b> represents the detector response in pico-amperes (pA) while the x-axis <b>5001</b> represents the retention time in minutes.

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0440" num="0439">Oil shale block CM-1B was cored in a manner similar to that of Example 1 except that a 1 inch diameter core was created. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the core specimen <b>7050</b> was approximately 2 inches in length and weighed 42.47 grams. This core specimen <b>7050</b> was placed in a Berea sandstone cylinder <b>7051</b> with a 1-inch inner diameter and a 1.39 inch outer diameter. Berea plugs <b>7052</b> and <b>7053</b> were placed at each end of this assembly, so that the core specimen was completely surrounded by Berea. The Berea cylinder <b>7051</b> along with the core specimen <b>7050</b> and the Berea end plugs <b>7052</b> and <b>7053</b> were placed in a slotted stainless steel sleeve and clamped into place. The sample assembly <b>7060</b> was placed in a spring-loaded mini-load-frame <b>7061</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. Load was applied by tightening the nuts <b>7062</b> and <b>7063</b> at the top of the load frame <b>7061</b> to compress the springs <b>7064</b> and <b>7065</b>. The springs <b>7064</b> and <b>7065</b> were high temperature, Inconel springs, which delivered 400 psi effective stress to the oil shale specimen <b>7060</b> when compressed. Sufficient travel of the springs <b>7064</b> and <b>7065</b> remained in order to accommodate any expansion of the core specimen <b>7060</b> during the course of heating. In order to ensure that this was the case, gold foil <b>7066</b> was placed on one of the legs of the apparatus to gauge the extent of travel. The entire spring loaded apparatus <b>7061</b> was placed in the Parr vessel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) and the heating experiment conducted as described in Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">As described in EXAMPLE 1, the room temperature Parr vessel was then sampled to obtain a representative portion of the gas remaining in the vessel following the heating experiment. Gas sampling, hydrocarbon gas sample gas chromatography (GC) testing, and non-hydrocarbon gas sample gas chromatography (GC) was conducted as in Example 1. Results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, Table 4 and Table 1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> the y-axis <b>4010</b> represents the detector response in pico-amperes (pA) while the x-axis <b>4011</b> represents the retention time in minutes. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> peak <b>4012</b> represents the response for methane, peak <b>4013</b> represents the response for ethane, peak <b>4014</b> represents the response for propane, peak <b>4015</b> represents the response for butane, peak <b>4016</b> represents the response for pentane and peak <b>4017</b> represents the response for hexane. From the gas chromatographic results and the known volumes and pressures involved the total hydrocarbon content of the gas was determined to be 1.33 grams and CO<sub>2 </sub>content of the gas was 1.70 grams.</p>

<p id="p-0443" num="0442">At this point, the Parr vessel was vented to achieve atmospheric pressure, the vessel opened, and liquids collected from inside the Parr vessel. Water was separated from the hydrocarbon layer and weighed. The amount collected is noted in Table 1. The collected hydrocarbon liquids were placed in a small vial, sealed and stored in the absence of light. Any additional liquid coating the surface of the apparatus or sides of the Parr vessel was collected with a paper towel and the weight of this collected liquid added to the total liquid collected. Any liquid remaining in the Berea sandstone was extracted with methylene chloride and the weight accounted for in the liquid total reported in Table 1. The Berea sandstone cylinder and end caps were clearly blackened with organic material as a result of the heating. The organic material in the Berea was not extractable with either toluene or methylene chloride, and was therefore determined to be coke formed from the cracking of hydrocarbon liquids. After the heating experiment, the Berea was crushed and its total organic carbon (TOC) was measured. This measurement was used to estimate the amount of coke in the Berea and subsequently how much liquid must have cracked in the Berea. A constant factor of 2.283 was used to convert the TOC measured to an estimate of the amount of liquid, which must have been present to produce the carbon found in the Berea. This liquid estimated is the &#x201c;inferred oil&#x201d; value shown in Table 1. The solid core specimen was weighed and determined to have lost 10.29 grams as a result of heating.</p>

<p id="p-0447" num="0446">Conducted in a manner similar to that of Example 2 on a core specimen from oil shale block CM-1B; however, in this example the applied effective stress was 1,000 psi. Results for the gas collected and analyzed by hydrocarbon gas sample gas chromatography (GC) and non-hydrocarbon gas sample gas chromatography (GC) (GC not shown) are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, Table 7 and Table 1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> the y-axis <b>4030</b> represents the detector response in pico-amperes (pA) while the x-axis <b>4031</b> represents the retention time in minutes. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> peak <b>4032</b> represents the response for methane, peak <b>4033</b> represents the response for ethane, peak <b>4034</b> represents the response for propane, peak <b>4035</b> represents the response for butane, peak <b>4036</b> represents the response for pentane and peak <b>4037</b> represents the response for hexane. Results for the liquid collected and analyzed by whole oil gas chromatography (WOGC) are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, Table 8 and Table 1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> the y-axis <b>6000</b> represents the detector response in pico-amperes (pA) while the x-axis <b>6001</b> represents the retention time in minutes.

<p id="p-0450" num="0449">Conducted in a manner similar to that of Example 2 on a core specimen from oil shale block CM-1B; however, in this example the applied effective stress was 1,000 psi. Results for the gas collected and analyzed by hydrocarbon gas sample gas chromatography (GC) and non-hydrocarbon gas sample gas chromatography (GC) (GC not shown) are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, Table 9 and Table 1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> the y-axis <b>4040</b> represents the detector response in pico-amperes (pA) while the x-axis <b>4041</b> represents the retention time in minutes. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> peak <b>4042</b> represents the response for methane, peak <b>4043</b> represents the response for ethane, peak <b>4044</b> represents the response for propane, peak <b>4045</b> represents the response for butane, peak <b>4046</b> represents the response for pentane and peak <b>4047</b> represents the response for hexane.</p>

<p id="p-0479" num="0478">For Examples 1-5, a stainless steel sample cylinder containing gas collected from the Parr vessel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) was fitted with a two stage gas regulator (designed for lecture bottle use) to reduce gas pressure to approximately twenty pounds per square inch. A septum fitting was positioned at the outlet port of the regulator to allow withdrawal of gas by means of a Hamilton model 1005 gas-tight syringe. Both the septum fitting and the syringe were purged with gas from the stainless steel sample cylinder to ensure that a representative gas sample was collected. The gas sample was then transferred to a stainless steel cell (septum cell) equipped with a pressure transducer and a septum fitting. The septum cell was connected to the fixed volume sample loop mounted on the GC by stainless steel capillary tubing. The septum cell and sample loop were evacuated for approximately 5 minutes. The evacuated septum cell was then isolated from the evacuated sample loop by closure of a needle valve positioned at the outlet of the septum cell. The gas sample was introduced into the septum cell from the gas-tight syringe through the septum fitting and a pressure recorded. The evacuated sample loop was then opened to the pressurized septum cell and the gas sample allowed to equilibrate between the sample loop and the septum cell for one minute. The equilibrium pressure was then recorded, to allow calculation of the total moles of gas present in the sample loop before injection into the GC inlet. The sample loop contents were then swept into the inlet by Helium carrier gas and components separated by retention time in the capillary column, based upon the GC oven temperature program and carrier gas flow rates.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0479">Calibration curves, correlating integrated peak areas with concentration, were generated for quantification of gas compositions using certified gas standards. For hydrocarbon gases, standards containing a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane and hexane in a helium matrix in varying concentrations (parts per million, mole basis) were injected into the GC through the fixed volume sample loop at atmospheric pressure. For non-hydrocarbon gases, standards containing individual components, i.e., carbon dioxide in helium and hydrogen sulfide in natural gas, were injected into the GC at varying pressures in the sample loop to generate calibration curves.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0480">The hydrocarbon gas sample molar percentages reported in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> were obtained using the following procedure. Gas standards for methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane and hexane of at least three varying concentrations were run on the gas chromatograph to obtain peak area responses for such standard concentrations. The known concentrations were then correlated to the respective peak area responses within the Chemstation software to generate calibration curves for methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane and hexane. The calibration curves were plotted in Chemstation to ensure good linearity (R2&#x3e;0.98) between concentration and peak intensity. A linear fit was used for each calibrated compound, so that the response factor between peak area and molar concentration was a function of the slope of the line as determined by the Chemstation software. The Chemstation software program then determined a response factor relating GC peak area intensity to the amount of moles for each calibrated compound. The software then determined the number of moles of each calibrated compound from the response factor and the peak area. The peak areas used in Examples 1-5 are reported in Tables 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9. The number of moles of each identified compound for which a calibration curve was not determined (i.e., iso-butane, iso-pentane, and 2-methyl pentane) was then estimated using the response factor for the closest calibrated compound (i.e., butane for iso-butane; pentane for iso-pentane; and hexane for 2-methyl pentane) multiplied by the ratio of the peak area for the identified compound for which a calibration curve was not determined to the peak area of the calibrated compound. The values reported in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> were then taken as a percentage of the total of all identified hydrocarbon gas GC areas (i.e., methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane, n-pentane, 2-methyl pentane, and n-hexane) and calculated molar concentrations. Thus the graphed methane to normal C<sub>6 </sub>molar percentages for all of the experiments do not include the molar contribution of the unidentified hydrocarbon gas species listed in Tables 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9 (e.g., peak numbers 2, 6, 8-11, 13, 15-22, 24-26, and 28-78 in Table 2).</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0481">Liquid samples collected during the heating tests as described in Examples 1, 3 and 4 were analyzed by whole oil gas chromatography (WOGC) according to the following procedure. Samples, QA/QC standards and blanks (carbon disulfide) were analyzed using an Ultra 1 Methyl Siloxane column (25 m length, 0.32 &#x3bc;m diameter, 0.52 &#x3bc;m film thickness) in an Agilent 6890 GC equipped with a split/splitless injector, autosampler and flame ionization detector (FID). Samples were injected onto the capillary column in split mode with a split ratio of 80:1. The GC oven temperature was kept constant at 20&#xb0; C. for 5 min, programmed from 20&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C. at a rate of 5&#xb0; C.min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and then maintained at 300&#xb0; C. for 30 min (total run time=90 min.). The injector temperature was maintained at 300&#xb0; C. and the FID temperature set at 310&#xb0; C. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow of 2.1 mL min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Peak identifications and integrations were performed using Chemstation software Rev.A.10.02 [1757] (Agilent Tech. 1990-2003) supplied with the Agilent instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0482">Standard mixtures of hydrocarbons were analyzed in parallel by the WOGC method described above and by an Agilent 6890 GC equipped with a split/splitless injector, autosampler and mass selective detector (MS) under the same conditions. Identification of the hydrocarbon compounds was conducted by analysis of the mass spectrum of each peak from the GC-MS. Since conditions were identical for both instruments, peak identification conducted on the GC-MS could be transferred to the peaks obtained on the GC-FID. Using these data, a compound table relating retention time and peak identification was set up in the GC-FID Chemstation. This table was used for peak identification.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0483">The gas chromatograms obtained on the liquid samples (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>11</b>) were analyzed using a pseudo-component technique. The convention used for identifying each pseudo-component was to integrate all contributions from normal alkane to next occurring normal alkane with the pseudo-component being named by the late eluting n-alkane. For example, the C-10 pseudo-component would be obtained from integration beginning just past normal-C<sub>9 </sub>and continue just through normal-C<sub>10</sub>. The carbon number weight % and mole % values for the pseudo-components obtained in this manner were assigned using correlations developed by Katz and Firoozabadi (Katz, D. L., and A. Firoozabadi, 1978. Predicting phase behavior of condensate/crude-oil systems using methane interaction coefficients, J. Petroleum Technology (November 1978), 1649-1655). Results of the pseudo-component analyses for Examples 1, 3 and 4 are shown in Tables 10, 11 and 12.</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0484">An exemplary pseudo component weight percent calculation is presented below with reference to Table 10 for the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component for Example 1 in order to illustrate the technique. First, the C-10 pseudo-component total area is obtained from integration of the area beginning just past normal-C<sub>9 </sub>and continued just through normal-C<sub>10 </sub>as described above. The total integration area for the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component is 10551.700 pico-ampere-seconds (pAs). The total C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component integration area (10551.700 pAs) is then multiplied by the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component density (0.7780 g/ml) to yield an &#x201c;area X density&#x201d; of 8209.22 pAs g/ml. Similarly, the peak integration areas for each pseudo component and all lighter listed compounds (i.e., nC3, iC4, nC4, iC5 &#x26; nC5) are determined and multiplied by their respective densities to yield &#x201c;area X density&#x201d; numbers for each respective pseudo component and listed compound. The respective determined &#x201c;area X density&#x201d; numbers for each pseudo component and listed compound is then summed to determine a &#x201c;total area X density&#x201d; number. The &#x201c;total area X density&#x201d; number for Example 1 is 96266.96 pAs g/ml. The C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component weight percentage is then obtained by dividing the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component &#x201c;area X density&#x201d; number (8209.22 pAs g/ml) by the &#x201c;total area X density&#x201d; number (96266.96 pAs g/ml) to obtain the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component weight percentage of 8.53 weight percent.</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0485">An exemplary pseudo component molar percent calculation is presented below with reference to Table 10 for the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component for Example 1 in order to further illustrate the pseudo component technique. First, the C-10 pseudo-component total area is obtained from integration of the area beginning just past normal-C<sub>9 </sub>and continued just through normal-C<sub>10 </sub>as described above. The total integration area for the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component is 10551.700 pico-ampere-seconds (pAs). The total C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component integration area (10551.700 pAs) is then multiplied by the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component density (0.7780 g/ml) to yield an &#x201c;area X density&#x201d; of 8209.22 pAs g/ml.

The C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component &#x201c;area X density&#x201d; number (8209.22 pAs g/ml) is then divided by the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component molecular weight (134.00 g/mol) to yield a C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component &#x201c;area X density/molecular weight&#x201d; number of 61.26 pAs mol/ml. Similarly, the &#x201c;area X density&#x201d; number for each pseudo component and listed compound is then divided by such components or compounds respective molecular weight to yield an &#x201c;area X density/molecular weight&#x201d; number for each respective pseudo component and listed compound. The respective determined &#x201c;area X density/molecular weight&#x201d; numbers for each pseudo component and listed compound is then summed to determine a &#x201c;total area X density/molecular weight&#x201d; number. The total &#x201c;total area X density/molecular weight&#x201d; number for Example 1 is 665.28 pAs mol/ml. The C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component molar percentage is then obtained by dividing the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component &#x201c;area X density/molecular weight&#x201d; number (61.26 pAs mol/ml) by the &#x201c;total area X density/molecular weight&#x201d; number (665.28 pAs mol/ml) to obtain the C<sub>10 </sub>pseudo component molar percentage of 9.21 molar percent.</p>

<p id="p-0490" num="0489">TOC and Rock-eval tests were performed on specimens from oil shale block CM-1B taken at the same stratigraphic interval as the specimens tested by the Parr heating method described in Examples 1-5. These tests resulted in a TOC of 21% and a Rock-eval Hydrogen Index of 872 mg/g-toc.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0490">The TOC and rock-eval procedures described below were performed on the oil shale specimens remaining after the Parr heating tests described in Examples 1-5. Results are shown in Table 13.</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0491">The Rock-Eval pyrolysis analyses described above were performed using the following procedures. Rock-Eval pyrolysis analyses were performed on calibration rock standards (IFP standard #55000), blanks, and samples using a Delsi Rock-Eval II instrument. Rock samples were crushed, micronized, and air-dried before loading into Rock-Eval crucibles. Between 25 and 100 mg of powdered-rock samples were loaded into the crucibles depending on the total organic carbon (TOC) content of the sample. Two or three blanks were run at the beginning of each day to purge the system and stabilize the temperature. Two or three samples of IFP calibration standard #55000 with weight of 100&#xb1;1 mg were run to calibrate the system. If the Rock-Eval T<sub>max </sub>parameter was 419&#xb0; C.&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. on these standards, analyses proceeded with samples. The standard was also run before and after every 10 samples to monitor the instrument's performance.</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0492">The Rock-Eval pyrolysis technique involves the rate-programmed heating of a powdered rock sample to a high temperature in an inert (helium) atmosphere and the characterization of products generated from the thermal breakdown of chemical bonds. After introduction of the sample the pyrolysis oven was held isothermally at 300&#xb0; C. for three minutes. Hydrocarbons generated during this stage are detected by a flame-ionization detector (FID) yielding the S<sub>1 </sub>peak. The pyrolysis-oven temperature was then increased at a gradient of 25&#xb0; C./minute up to 550&#xb0; C., where the oven was held isothermally for one minute. Hydrocarbons generated during this step were detected by the FID and yielded the S<sub>2 </sub>peak.</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0493">Hydrogen Index (HI) is calculated by normalizing the S<sub>2 </sub>peak (expressed as mg<sub>hydrocarbons</sub>/g<sub>rock</sub>) to weight % TOC (Total Organic Carbon determined independently) as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>HI</i>=(<i>S</i><sub>2</sub><i>/TOC</i>)*100<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where HI is expressed as mg<sub>hydrocarbons</sub>/g<sub>TOC </sub>
</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0494">Total Organic Carbon (TOC) was determined by well known methods suitable for geological samples&#x2014;i.e., any carbonate rock present was removed by acid treatment followed by combustion of the remaining material to produce and measure organic based carbon in the form of CO2.</p>

<p id="p-0498" num="0497">The specific gravity of each liquid sample was estimated using the following procedure. An empty 50 &#x3bc;l Hamilton Model 1705 gastight syringe was weighed on a Mettler AE 163 digital balance to determine the empty syringe weight. The syringe was then loaded by filling the syringe with a volume of liquid. The volume of liquid in the syringe was noted. The loaded syringe was then weighed. The liquid sample weight was then estimated by subtracting the loaded syringe measured weight from the measured empty syringe weight. The specific gravity was then estimated by dividing the liquid sample weight by the syringe volume occupied by the liquid sample.</p>

<p id="p-0500" num="0499">The above-described processes may be of merit in connection with the recovery of hydrocarbons in the Piceance Basin of Colorado. Some have estimated that in some oil shale deposits of the Western United States, up to 1 million barrels of oil may be recoverable per surface acre. One study has estimated the oil shale resource within the nahcolite-bearing portions of the oil shale formations of the Piceance Basin to be 400 billion barrels of shale oil in place. Overall, up to 1 trillion barrels of shale oil may exist in the Piceance Basin alone.</p>
