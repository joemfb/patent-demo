<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/252,046 filed on Oct. 15, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to refinery, chemical plant and similar industrial processes, employing compressors, and more particularly, to a lubricant reclaiming process and system for use with compressors, typically flooded screw or liquid ring type, employed in such processes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Prior Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In all refinery operations, numerous processes are employed. Non-limiting examples of such processes include crude distillation, hydrotreating, isomerization, catalytic reforming, hydrocracking, fluid catalytic cracking, alkylation etc. In some, and typically all of these processes, a light fraction (e.g., a gas stream) may be produced. While some components of the gas stream are undesirable (i.e., waste gases), many of those gases contain valuable products (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, etc.), which need to be recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In typical refinery operations, gas streams, from whatever upstream process, are usually compressed and then sent for further processing. As is well known to those skilled in the art, compressors like other rotating machinery, require careful lubrication to prolong the life and ensure efficient operation. Lubricant, used to lubricate the compressor, and the gas stream being compressed discharges from the compressor as a lubricant/compressed gas stream. This stream is sent to a separator to remove the compressed gases from the recycled lubricant. Compressor refinery operations such as the processes noted above are complex and it is not uncommon for abnormal operations (so-called upsets) to occur. A typical upset can result in a given stream being contaminated with unwanted components. For example, as it pertains to one aspect of the present invention, upsets in upstream refinery operations can result in carry over of so-called light naphthas, which are generally speaking, a mixture comprising mainly straight-chain and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons having from about five to about nine carbon atoms per molecule. Accordingly, when an upset occurs, the gas stream will contain light naphtha which cannot exit with the compressed gases and will accumulate in the lubricant circuit. It will be understood that the reference to the light naphtha is by example only, since there may be cases when even heavier molecules are entrained in the incoming gas stream. In any event, when this gas stream containing light naphtha is compressed, the lubricant can become contaminated with the light naphtha. In this regard, while the compressed gas/lubricant discharged from the compressor can, as noted above, be readily separated into compressed gases and lubricant, prior art systems do not separate the light naphtha or similar materials from the lubricant. Accordingly, after the separation process, the lubricant as it recycles to the compressor contains light naphtha. As will be readily understood, light naphtha lowers the viscosity of the lubricant, interfering with the function of the lubricant which in turn results in failure, or at least reduced reliability and life, of the seals and/or bearings in the compressor.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While the present invention will be described with particular reference to refinery processes, it is to be understood that it is not so limited. The process and system of the present invention can be employed in any industrial environment where a compressor is handling gas streams from upstream processes and wherein the gas stream contains components that must also be removed from the lubricant used to lubricate the compressor. The terms &#x201c;contaminant&#x201d; or &#x201c;lubricant contaminant&#x201d; is used herein to refer to any substance in a compressor lubricant which deleteriously affects its properties in anyway such as lowering viscosity, decreasing lubricity, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring then to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a typical prior art process comprising three circuits: a gas circuit, a gas/lubricant circuit, and a lubricant circuit. A gas stream comprising low to mid pressure gases via line <b>10</b>, enters the suction side of compressor <b>12</b>, where it is compressed and discharged into line <b>14</b> as a compressed lubricant/gas stream. The compressed lubricant/gas stream is sent via line <b>14</b> to separator <b>16</b> where an overhead, compressed gas stream is removed via line <b>18</b> and a lubricant stream is removed via line <b>11</b> and pumped by lube pump <b>22</b> to utility cooler <b>26</b> via line <b>24</b>, filter <b>30</b> via line <b>28</b>, and then returned to compressor <b>12</b> via line <b>32</b>. It can be appreciated from the description above that the gas circuit comprises lines <b>10</b> and <b>18</b>, the gas/lubricant circuit comprises line <b>14</b> and the lubricant circuit comprises lines <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As noted above, it is not uncommon, particularly in refinery operations, that upsets in various upstream units or processes occur. In many instances, such upsets result in the carry-over in the gas streams of contaminants having a lower boiling point and/or lower specific gravity and/or less viscosity than the lubricant, deleteriously affecting the lubricating ability of the lubricant. For example, assuming that a typical gas stream, which may be comprised of many gas streams from many upstream processes, is being handled by compressor <b>12</b> and ideally the gas stream comprises non-hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons in the range of C<sub>1 </sub>up to about C<sub>5</sub>. If an upset occurs upstream from compressor <b>12</b>, the gas stream in line <b>10</b> entering the suction side of compressor <b>12</b> may contain hydrocarbons (e.g., light naphtha) that have higher boiling points than the gases but lower boiling points than the lubricant. The problem with these higher hydrocarbons (light naphtha) is that in the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, rather than being removed as an overhead or even an intermediate fraction in separator <b>16</b>, they exit separator <b>16</b> together with the lubricant stream in line <b>20</b> from the bottoms of separator <b>16</b> and are returned to compressor <b>12</b>. As noted, these naphtha type hydrocarbons reduce the viscosity and lubricating characteristics of the lubricant, which in turn results in the seals and bearings in the compressor failing or at least having a reduced life span. It is the goal of the present invention to minimize, if not eliminate, this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring then to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the process flow scheme shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is modified by the addition of liquid/liquid separator <b>34</b>. Thus, rather than the naphtha type hydrocarbons, which have accumulated in the lubricant, being recycled to compressor <b>12</b>, they are removed. To accomplish this, the output from lube pump <b>22</b> is fed to liquid-liquid separator <b>34</b> wherein these naphtha type hydrocarbons, including so-called &#x201c;wild material&#x201d;, is removed as a light hydrocarbon stream via line <b>36</b>. This light hydrocarbon stream can be further treated, if necessary, to recover valuable products and further processed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The net result of the process depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is that the lubricant returned to compressor <b>12</b> is substantially free of any component that interferes with the properties and purpose of the lubricant as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Separator <b>34</b> can take many different forms, the goal being to use a separator or separator technology in which the light hydrocarbons or fraction (including entrained gases) can be separated from the lubricant. The liquid/liquid separators used in the process and system of the present invention can include entrainment separators, coalescers and coalescing filters, liquid/liquid centrifugal separators, liquid/liquid membrane separators, etc. depending upon the nature of the contaminant vis-&#xe0;-vis the lubricant. It is also possible, again depending upon the nature of the contaminant to employ extraction technology to separate the contaminant from the lubricant.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">While in the process and system described above, the reclaimed lubricant is recycled to the compressor in a closed loop system, it will be understood that the reclaimed lubricant can simply be recovered. For example, if it was desired to further treat the lubricant for some reason, it could be recovered, treated and then returned to the compressor loop.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">While in the process described above, a single compressor and its associated lubricant circuit has been described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art, that the process could involve multiple compressors and lubricant circuits. The process of the present invention is particularly suited to liquid ring and flooded screw compressors. In the latter, the lubricant is used to bridge the space between the rotors to provide a hydraulic seal and transfer mechanical energy between the driving and driven rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In experimental testing, it has been shown that when using the process depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (i.e., the prior art process), run times are limited to hours or days before remedial action is required to avoid damage to the compressor components. By utilizing the process of the present invention as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, run times have been extended to weeks or years.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In actual plant operations it was found that with the prior art system as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the reclaimed lubricant specific gravity varied between 1.085 and 1.04, typically 1.07&#xb1;0.02. Using the process of the present invention as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reclaimed lubricant almost consistently had a specific gravity of 1.095&#xb1;0.003, and in fact the lowest specific gravity observed was 1.085.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A surprising result of the process of the present invention is that the light hydrocarbon fraction separated from the lubricant (e.g., in separator <b>34</b>), not only contains liquid hydrocarbon, but traces of entrained gases as well. This is particularly important since the presence of gases in the recycled lubricant, as well as lowering viscosity of the lubricant can interfere with the compressor performance and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein in some detail, this has been done solely for the purposes of explaining the various aspects of the invention, and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the claims which follow. Those skilled in the art will understand that the embodiment shown and described is exemplary, and various other substitutions, alterations and modifications, including but not limited to those design alternatives specifically discussed herein, may be made in the practice of the invention without departing from its scope.</p>
