<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Aspects of the present disclosure relate to a current multiplier that can generate an output current with high linearity and/or high temperature compensation. Such current multipliers can be implemented by complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit elements. In one embodiment, the current multiplier can include a current divider and a core current multiplier. The current divider can generate a divided current by dividing an input current by an adjustable division ratio. The division ratio can be adjusted, for example, based on a comparison of the input current with a reference current. The core current multiplier can generate the output current based on multiplying the divided current and a different current. According to certain embodiments, the output current can be maintained within a predetermined range as the input current to the current divider varies within a relatively wide range.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/512,857 filed on Jul. 28, 2011, titled &#x201c;LOW VARIATION CMOS CURRENT MULTIPLIER WITH HIGH TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION AND HIGH LINEARITY,&#x201d; the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosed technology relates to electronic systems and, more particularly, to circuits configured to multiply currents.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electronic systems can use current multipliers to multiply two or more currents in a variety of applications, such as in a power amplifier controller. Certain current multipliers can receive three input currents and generate an output current proportional to the product of two of the input currents divided by the other input current.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It can be desirable to have good linearity of the output current in the presence of variations in an electronic system. For instance, it can be desirable to have good linearity of the output current as one or more of the input currents vary, as temperature of the current multiplier varies, as supply voltage of the current multiplier varies, in the presence of process variations, or any combination thereof. In certain implementations, as one of the inputs to the current multiplier varies, temperature compensation can become more difficult, for example, due to two or more of these parameters working against each other.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a power amplifier module that includes a power amplifier controller having a current multiplier, any of the variations described herein can cause gain variations, gain slope issues, impact other metrics by which power amplifier modules are rated, or any combination thereof. Accordingly, such variations can make designing a power amplifier module that meets a design specification more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, when implementing current multipliers in complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, yields can be relatively low. Low yields increase costs of manufacturing dies that include such current multipliers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF CERTAIN INVENTIVE ASPECTS</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The innovations described in the claims each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of this invention, some prominent features will now be briefly discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One aspect of this disclosure is a current multiplier that includes a compare circuit, a current divider, and a core current multiplier. The compare circuit is configured to compare a first current from a first current source with a reference current and generate one or more compare signals based on comparing the first current from the first current source with the reference current. The current divider is configured to adjust a division ratio based on at least one of the one or more compare signals and divide a current divider input current by the division ratio to generate a divided output current. The core current multiplier is configured to generate a current multiplier output current based on multiplying the divided output current by a different current.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some implementations, the current divider input current can be based on the first current.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The current multiplier can be implemented with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit elements on a CMOS die, according to a number of implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with certain implementations, the current multiplier can be implemented in a power amplifier control circuit.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Generally described, aspects of the present disclosure relate to current multipliers. The current multipliers described herein can be implemented using complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The current multipliers described herein can multiply a first current that varies within a relatively wide range by a second current to generate an output current. The output current can be kept within a predetermined range while the first current varies within the relatively wide range (for example, a range that spans at least about two orders of magnitude). This can, for example, maintain a power amplifier bias within a predefined specification. The output current can be kept within the predetermined range by adjusting a division ratio of one or more current dividers coupled to one or more inputs of a core current multiplier. Such adjustment to the division ratio of one or more current dividers can be implemented based on a comparison of the first current and a reference current, for example, using a Schmitt trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Using the systems, apparatus, and methods related to current multiplication described herein, electronic systems, such as power amplifier systems, can be manufactured cost effectively with relatively high yields. Any combination of features of the current multipliers described can be integrated into an existing CMOS die while consuming a relatively small die area. Alternatively or additionally, the current multipliers described herein can be implemented without adding additional fuse pads and/or supporting circuits for a fuse on a die. In certain implementations, a need to develop a subsequent probe, test and blow fuse procedure in production can be eliminated. Accordingly, it can be cheaper, smaller, and less complicated to fabricate and/or achieve a high yield of CMOS dies in accordance with one or more aspects of this disclosure. According to certain implementations, current multipliers can implement additional power amplifier operating modes with the same number of logic control signal inputs (such as one or more mode control signals and/or one or more band select signals), or even with fewer logic control signal inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the claims.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Current Multiplier</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A current multiplier can be implemented with relatively low cost CMOS technology. This can reduce manufacturing costs compared to a BiCMOS process or other processes that are more expensive than CMOS processes. In addition, yield can be improved in a CMOS current multiplier implementing one or more features described herein compared to comparable conventional CMOS current multipliers. Current multipliers implementing one or more aspects of this disclosure can reap the benefits of a relatively low cost CMOS process while achieving high yields.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As used herein, a current multiplier can refer to a circuit configured to generate a product of two or more currents. Such current multipliers can include other circuit elements that perform other functions than current multiplication. For instance, current multipliers can include one or more compare circuits and/or one or more current dividers. The circuit in the current multiplier that is configured to generate the product of two or more currents can be referred to as a core current multiplier. As discussed herein, the core current multiplier can compute a product of two currents divided by a third current in certain implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref> are block diagrams of illustrative current multipliers according to certain embodiments. The current multipliers <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref> include a compare circuit <b>32</b>, one or more current dividers <b>34</b>, and a core current multiplier <b>36</b>. Any of current multipliers of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref> can be implemented by CMOS circuit elements on a CMOS die.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The compare circuit <b>32</b> can compare a first current from a first current source with a first reference current. In accordance with some implementations, the first current can have any combination of features of the first input current I<sub>1 </sub>described herein. The compare circuit <b>32</b> can generate one or more compare signals indicative of whether the first current is greater than the first reference current. As one example, the compare circuit can include a Schmitt trigger that compares the first current with the first reference current. The compare circuit <b>32</b> can include logic control, such as digital logic, that generates the one or more compare signals. For instance, the one or more compare signals can be based on an output of the Schmitt trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the current multipliers <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3C</figref>, the compare circuit <b>32</b> can compare the first current I<sub>1 </sub>with a first reference current I<sub>REF1</sub>. In the current multipliers <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3D</figref>, the compare circuit <b>32</b> can compare the first current I<sub>1 </sub>with a plurality of reference currents I<sub>REF1 </sub>to I<sub>REFN</sub>. With two or more reference currents as inputs, the compare circuit <b>32</b> of the current multiplier <b>30</b> can perform additional comparisons to obtain more data regarding the current level of the first current I<sub>1</sub>. Logic control can then generate one or more control signals based one or more of the comparisons. As shown by the busses coupled to the outputs of the compare circuits <b>32</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3D</figref>, with multiple comparisons, a plurality of signals can be provided to one or more current dividers <b>34</b>. When the compare circuit <b>32</b> provides two or more bits of data to a current divider <b>34</b>, the current divider <b>34</b> can be configured to adjust its division ratio among more than two different values. For instance, with two input bits form a compare circuit <b>32</b>, a current divider <b>34</b> can adjust its division ratio to a selected one of four values. Alternatively or additionally, when the compare circuit <b>32</b> generates two or more compare signals, different signals can be provided to different current dividers of the current dividers, for example, in the current dividers <b>34</b><i>a </i>to <b>34</b><i>m </i>of the current multiplier <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. In this way, adjustment of the division ratios of the current dividers <b>34</b><i>a </i>to <b>34</b><i>m </i>can be tailored based on the comparisons performed by the compare circuit. Any suitable number of comparisons can be performed for a particular application. One or more of the reference currents I<sub>REF1 </sub>to I<sub>REFN </sub>provided to the current multipliers <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3D</figref> can be programmable.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The current divider <b>34</b> can divide a current divider input current by a division ratio to generate a divided output current. For instance, when the current divider has a division ratio of k, then the current divider input current can have k times the current of the divided output current. The division ratio can be adjusted based on at least one of the one or more compare signals. In this way, the output of the current multiplier <b>30</b> can be adjusted based on the one or more compare signals. In certain implementations, the current divider input current can be the first input current I<sub>1</sub>. In accordance with some other implementations, the current divider input current can be a different current that is being multiplied by the current multiplier <b>30</b>, such as the second input current I<sub>2 </sub>or the third input current I<sub>3</sub>. For instance, the different current can be a current that the current multiplier <b>30</b> multiplies by the first input current I<sub>1</sub>. As another example, the different current can be a current by which the current multiplier <b>30</b> divides the first current I<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The current multipliers <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> include one current divider <b>34</b>. According to some implementations, the division ratio of two or more current dividers <b>34</b> can be adjusted based on the one or more compare signals. The current multipliers <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref> include a plurality of current dividers <b>34</b><sub>A </sub>to <b>34</b><sub>M </sub>that can each adjust a respective division ratio based on one or more compare signals generated by the compare circuit <b>32</b>. In certain implementations, additional current dividers without adjustable division ratios can be implemented in a current multiplier <b>30</b> along with one or more current dividers <b>34</b> with adjustable division ratios. As discussed above, the division ratios can be adjusted among two or more different values.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The core current multiplier <b>36</b> can generate a current multiplier output current based on multiplying the divided output current from the current divider <b>34</b> by a different current. The different current can be generated by a different current divider <b>34</b>, for example, in accordance with the current multipliers <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>. In some other implementations, the different current can be provided by a current divider with a division ratio that is not adjusted based on an output of the compare circuit <b>32</b>. According to some other implementations, the different current can be provided from different circuit elements than a current divider. In accordance with certain implementations, the core current multiplier <b>36</b> can receive three inputs and generate an output current that is proportional to the products of two of the three inputs divided by the third input. Accordingly, the different current can be the first input current I<sub>1</sub>, the second input current I<sub>2</sub>, the third input current I<sub>3</sub>, the second divided current I<sub>2</sub>/m, the third divided current I<sub>3</sub>/n, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Current multipliers <b>30</b> can be used in a variety of different applications with a need for multiplying currents. For example, any power amplifier control circuit with a need for a current multiplication function can include a current multiplier <b>30</b>. The power amplifier control circuit can be implemented, for example, in a multimode power amplifier controller. Such a power amplifier controller can be implemented on a separate die than the power amplifier it controls.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some implementations, such as the current multiplier <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the current multiplier can be configured to receive a first input current I<sub>1</sub>, a second input current I<sub>2</sub>, and a third input current I<sub>3</sub>. Although the current multipliers <b>30</b> described herein may be described as having input currents, it will be understood that any of the current multipliers <b>30</b> described herein can receive an input voltage and convert the received voltage to any of the input currents described herein. Further, it will be understood that any of the output currents Iout described herein can be converted to an output voltage. The first input current I<sub>1 </sub>can have a current value that varies within a relatively wide range. In some implementations, the first input current I<sub>1 </sub>can vary from about 10 uA to 10 mA. The first input current I<sub>1 </sub>can vary by at least one, two, or three orders of magnitude, according to certain implementations. The second input current I<sub>2 </sub>can vary with temperature. For example, the second input current I<sub>2 </sub>can have proportional to the absolute temperature (PTAT) characteristics. The third input current I<sub>3 </sub>can be indicative of a bandgap current. For instance, the third input current I<sub>3 </sub>can be proportional to the bandgap voltage divided by a resistance. The output current Iout of the current multiplier <b>30</b> can be proportional to the product of the first input current I<sub>1 </sub>and the second input current I<sub>2 </sub>divided by the third input current I<sub>3</sub>. In some implementations, the output current Iout of the current multiplier <b>30</b> can be approximately equal to the product of the first input current I<sub>1 </sub>and the second input current I<sub>2 </sub>divided by the third input current I<sub>3</sub>, in accordance with Equation 1.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>I</i>out=<i>I</i><sub>1</sub><i>*I</i><sub>2</sub><i>/I</i><sub>3</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(Eq. 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">There can be stringent requirements for the output current Iout of the current multiplier <b>30</b> in some implementations. One of the stringent requirements can be linearity. For instance, Iout can deviate from the relationship represented by Equation 1 without compensating for one or more of the variations described herein. Such deviation can result from, for example, second order effects such as channel length modulation, component mismatches, mobility reduction in pure CMOS process, or any combination thereof. Alternatively or additionally, deviation in Iout from the relationship represented by Equation 1 can be exacerbated by the relatively wide range of the first input current I<sub>1</sub>. It can be desirable for the output current Iout to have good linearity over an entire range of the first input current I<sub>1</sub>, processes, temperatures, supply voltages, the like, or any combination thereof. Linearity can be proportional to a difference between actual Iout as measured and Iout as calculated from Equation 1. In some implementations, linearity can be represented by the difference between actual Iout as measured and Iout as calculated from Equation 1 divided by actual Iout, which can be represented as a percentage. In some other implementations, linearity can be represented by the difference between actual Iout as measured and Iout as calculated from Equation 1 divided by Iout as calculated by Equation 1, which can be represented as a percentage. An example linearity requirement, represented by dividing the difference between actual Iout and Iout computed by Equation 1 by Iout computed by Equation 1, can be within +/&#x2212;3% across the range of the first input current I<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Alternatively or additionally, it can be desirable for the output current lout to have high temperature compensation. For example, in some implementations, the output current Iout can have a temperature compensation ranging from about 5% to 60% as calculated by Equation 2 below. Temperature compensation TC can be measured, for example, by the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>TC</i>=(<i>I</i><sub>OUT 85&#xb0; C.</sub><i>&#x2212;I</i><sub>OUT &#x2212;15&#xb0; C.</sub>)/<i>I</i><sub>OUT ROOM TEMP</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(Eq. 2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In Equation 2, I<sub>OUT 85 &#xb0; C. </sub>can represent the output current Iout at 85&#xb0; C., I<sub>OUT &#x2212;15&#xb0; C. </sub>can represent the output current Iout at &#x2212;15&#xb0; C., and I<sub>OUT ROOM TEMP </sub>can represent the output current Iout at room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">However, in CMOS implementations, the output current Iout can vary substantially due to the core current multiplier utilizing the square-law characteristic of a CMOS transistor. Such variation can be exacerbated by implementing high temperature compensation of the output current Iout because temperature compensation, linearity and variation in the output current Iout can be competing design constraints that work against each other.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Variation in the output current Iout can be undesirable. For instance, variation in the output current Iout can cause a low power gain variation of a power amplifier at Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) mode and/or gain slope issues in a power amplifier, among other things. Accordingly, variation in the output current Iout can complicate the design of a power amplifier system at a module level.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In order to ensure power amplifier module performance at an acceptable level, a CMOS die on a wafer can be screened by a probe to accept or reject dies based on certain threshold limits to make sure that only those dies with variations satisfying the threshold limits are selected. As a result, the CMOS wafer yield can suffer significantly due to variation in the output current Iout of some conventional current multipliers. This can increase cost of an end product considerably.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Meeting the stringent requirements of the output current Iout characteristics such as high linearity, low variation, high temperature compensation, or any combination thereof over a wide range of the first input current I<sub>1 </sub>can be difficult to implement. Typically, it is desirable to meet certain relationships between the first input current I<sub>1</sub>, the second input current I<sub>2</sub>, and the third input current I<sub>3 </sub>for a pure CMOS multiplier to work based on a square-law characteristic.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Accordingly, the current multiplier <b>30</b> can be adjusted and/or optimized according to different ranges of the first input current I<sub>1</sub>. This can lead to avoiding the engineering tradeoffs between variation, high temp compensation, linearity, the like, or any combination thereof. In fact, simulation results have shown that standard deviation of the Iout can be reduced by about 30-50% in some implementations compared to comparable conventional current multipliers. Variation in Iout can depend on the range of first input current I<sub>1</sub>. Moreover, simulations results indicate that yields for parts meeting certain Iout specifications can be increased by about 30-50% compared to some comparable conventional CMOS current multipliers for the same Iout specifications when the first input current I<sub>1 </sub>varies within a relatively wide range. Simulation results also show linearity remaining substantially the same with relatively high temperature compensation for Iout.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Advantageously, the current multiplier <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> can be implemented without additional input or output bits from external to the current multiplier <b>30</b>, such as from a baseband processor to produce the output current Iout within a specified range.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The logic control <b>39</b> can generate logic signals based on the first compare signal and/or the second compare signal. These logic signals can be provided to, for example, a power amplifier bias and control logic block <b>40</b>. The generated logic signals can be combined with a band select signal and/or a mode select signal in the power amplifier bias and control logic block <b>40</b>. Accordingly, the power amplifier bias and control logic block <b>40</b> can provide a tailored bias for a power amplifier for twice as many modes for each extra bit generated based on one of the compare signals. For instance, with one extra bit generated based on a comparison performed by a Schmitt trigger, a tailored bias for the power amplifier can be provided for 8 different modes instead of 4 modes. In particular, one mode control bit, one band control bit, and one bit generated based on the compare circuit <b>32</b> can select 1 of 8 different modes of operation. Other control functions at different bands and/or modes can also be controlled at least in part by at least one of the compare signals. Thus, using one or more compare signals in the power amplifier bias controller can simplify the design for a multi-mode multi-band (MMMB) power amplifier module, such as the power amplifier module <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, the interface between a baseband processor, which can be the processor <b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in some implementations, and the power amplifier module (PAM) can be simplified since fewer control signals can be provided from the baseband processor. This can reduce the PAM size. In some implementations, reducing the PAM size can also reduce the size of a phone board, which can be desirable in an MMMB smart phone system.</p>

Such compensation can be dynamic. The current generated by the current divider with the adjustable division ratio can be provided to a core current multiplier.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to certain implementations, a second division ratio of a second current divider can be adjusted at block <b>56</b> based on the one or more comparisons at block <b>52</b>.

The second current source can be separate and/or independent from the first current source. It will be understood that the one or more comparisons at block <b>52</b> can be used to adjust any suitable number of division ratios in different current dividers. It will also be understood that the one or more comparisons at block <b>52</b> can be used to perform other functionalities in an electronic system.

The power amplifier bias control block <b>29</b> can include a current multiplier <b>30</b> with any combination of features of the current multipliers described herein. The power amplifier bias control block <b>29</b> can be used, for example, to provide bias signals to the power amplifier die, such as the output current Iout of a current multiplier <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a bipolar transistor power amplifier configuration, the controller die <b>26</b> can be used to provide a reference voltage for biasing a current mirror used to generate a base current for a power amplifier, such as a base current for a bipolar transistor. The controller die <b>26</b> can also be used to enable and/or disable a power amplifier disposed on the power amplifier die <b>24</b>, which can aid in selectively activating a power amplifier associated with a particular transmission path. For example, the controller die <b>26</b> can receive one or more control signals on one or more pins CONTROL, and can use the one or more control signal to vary the bias signal provided to the power amplifier die so as to selectively enable or disable the power amplifier. The one or more control signals can include a mode select signal to select a particular mode of operation of the power amplifier, such a low power mode, a medium power mode, or a high power mode. Alternatively or additionally, the one or more control signals can include a band select signal to select a high band mode of operation of the power amplifier or a low band mode of operation of the power amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The power amplifier module <b>20</b> can be modified to include more or fewer components, including, for example, additional power amplifier dies, capacitors and/or inductors. For instance, the power amplifier module <b>20</b> can include an additional power amplifier die, as well as an additional capacitor and inductor configured to operate as an LC circuit disposed between the additional power amplifier die and the V<sub>CC </sub>pin of the power amplifier module <b>20</b>. The power amplifier module <b>20</b> can be configured to have additional pins, such as in implementations in which a separate power supply is provided to an input stage disposed on the power amplifier die and/or implementations in which the multi-chip module operates over a plurality of bands.</p>
