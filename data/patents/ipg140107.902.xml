<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to fluid flow control and regulation devices and, more particularly, to one-way flow control devices and valves for pressurized fluids, especially gas. Specifically, the present invention relates to such flow control devices particularly adaptable as inlet valves for first and second stage regulator members used in scuba diving units to prevent the entry of water and other contaminates into the regulator member without interfering with the proper flow of breathable gas.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fluid flow regulator and control devices of various types are well known in the art. Both liquid and gas regulator devices have been adapted for a wide variety of commercial and industrial assemblies and apparatus. However, the adaptation of such devices to high-pressure environments having relatively small fluid control apertures and valves is highly specialized. This is particularly true in the field of scuba (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) diving equipment and regulators.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Within the past several decades, the sport of scuba diving has enjoyed considerable popularity so that there exists an entire industry for supplying equipment for the sport. Moreover, the popularity of the sport continues to increase dramatically. This industry manufactures and sells a wide variety of instruments, devices and equipment to enable a person to properly breathe underwater and remain beneath the water's surface for extended periods of time. One of the most vital concerns in the manufacture of underwater breathing apparatus is the need for a source of air or other breathable gas mixtures at substantially constant pressure. That is, in order to allow a person to breathe properly, it is necessary to have a source of air or other breathable gas, the pressure of which does not fluctuate randomly at the point of intake.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typically, scuba divers utilize a pressurized source of breathable gas, such as compressed air as well as mixed gas blends, at a relatively high initial pressure which may exceed 3,000 psi and even reach 4500-5000 psi in certain technical diving situations. Pressure regulators have been developed over the years to deliver such breathable gas to a diver at ambient pressure regardless of the depth of the scuba diver. Consequently, the breathable gas is typically reduced in pressure in staged steps. The first step is performed by a first stage regulator member of a dual stage regulator assembly which reduces the tank pressure of approximately 3,000 psi or greater to a constant intermediate pressure of about 120-140 psi. The first stage regulator is mounted directly to the high pressure source of gas, such as a scuba tank outlet valve, and the intermediate pressure gas is then directed through a pressure hose exiting the first stage regulator member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The intermediate pressure gas from the pressure hose is then delivered to a second stage regulator member which generally has a diaphragm arrangement to further reduce gas pressure and provide breathable gas to the diver at a usable, that is ambient, pressure. The second stage regulator member may be in, the form of a primary regulator utilized by the scuba diver as a primary source of breathing gas, or it may be in the form of what is commonly called an alternate gas or air source, or an octopus. The alternate air source is utilized for emergency breathing situations and is frequently combined with an inflator valve for use with buoyancy control devices. Moreover, intermediate gas pressure lines or hoses may also extend from the first stage regulator member to provide gas for other purposes, such as use with a dry exposure suit and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Once the dual stage regulator assembly is attached to a scuba tank gas outlet valve to create an entire scuba unit, the scuba unit is an environmentally, closed or sealed, system. In other words, the system wherein compressed gas passes from the tank through the first stage regulator, the intermediate pressure hoses and to the inner side of the second stage regulator member diaphragm, is limited only to compressed gas and is not exposed to the environment in any manner. The exterior or outer side of the second stage regulator member diaphragm, however, is exposed to the ambient environment, including water. It is essential, then, that the regulator assembly gas delivery system remain dry both during its use when connected to a scuba tank as well as when it is not being used and is disconnected from a scuba tank. Otherwise, contaminants, such as salt water, fresh water, wash water, airborne particulates and the like, will contaminate the assembly if allowed to enter the interior of the regulator assembly, such as at the gas inlet opening. Such contamination can include the rusting and corrosion of internal metal air filters and other internal parts of the regulator assembly as well as possibly clogging small apertures or orifices and thus preventing the regulator assembly from operating property if even at all.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While it is simple to observe how a regulator assembly can remain dry when fully installed to a scuba tank and in use, a problem occurs once the regulator assembly is disconnected from a tank after a dive is over. As previously mentioned, the gas in the tank is delivered to the first stage regulator member through a tank outlet valve. There are two basic and most common types of valve connection arrangements between a scuba tank and the first stage regulator member which are standard in the art. However, other less common connection arrangements are also available, such as those utilized in technical diving and rebreather units. The first typical connection is the most common and is known as a yoke connection wherein the first stage regulator member has a round opening plugged by a metal filter surrounded by a raised collar with a ring thereabout. In this arrangement, the tank outlet valve has a small aperture at the middle of a round recessed area, the raised collar snugly fitting within the recessed area so that the O-ring is fitted against it. A yoke fitting is secured to the first stage regulator member and surrounds the tank outlet valve, and a hand knob is hand tightened against the back of the tank valve to force the raised collar-against the round recessed area so that the O-ring is snugly compressed therebetween. The second common connection arrangement is called a DIN valve connection wherein the first stage regulator member simply screws directly into the tank valve outlet opening using five or seven threads depending upon the pressure to be contained within the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Heretofore, a dust and water cap has generally been used as standard equipment for covering the opening of an air pressure inlet valve of the first-stage regulator member, when the regulator is not in use. The dust cover is typically either plastic or rubber and is held in place by the yoke and hand knob. Moreover, the valve, connection of the DIN valve arrangement as well as the alternate air source for the intermediate pressure hose also generally have removable caps which cover the inlet opening when not in use. When a scuba diver completes his or her diving, the gas cylinder valve is released from the regulator inlet valve. At this time, ideally the dust and water cap is attached to the top of the air inlet valve to prevent water and contaminates such as described above from entering the air inlet valve and contaminating, rusting and/or corroding the internal air filter and other internal parts inside the valve. Unfortunately, as can be imaged, divers often forget to install the dust cap on the air inlet valve and/or the cap on the alternate air regulator member inlet, and the internal regulator filter then becomes contaminated when the scuba equipment is washed down after a dive or later when the valve is exposed to outdoor elements. This is particularly true of new or student divers. The contamination can cause a gas restriction inside the regulator assembly and a potential breathing hazard to the diver. Also, the gas restriction can cause the high pressure gas to break apart portions of the air filter, which can cause internal damage and failure of working parts inside the regulator assembly. Further, water entering the regulator assembly at either the first or second stage regulator members can cause internal rusting and corrosion of the working parts and failure of the regulator. While significant technical advances have been made over the years since the advent of the scuba diving system, this problem of preventing inadvertent or negligent contamination of the regulator system has never been satisfactorily addressed. In almost 60 years of scuba diving equipment development, a dust cover manually put into place by the diver is the best that has been achieved to date.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,226,257, 5,685,297 and 5,687,712 all disclose scuba diving regulator assemblies and valves therein, but none address the problem discussed above nor are they directed to regulator inlet valve construction in any particular manner. Consequently, there remains a significant need in general and more specifically in the diving industry, for a fluid, and in particular breathable gas, control system that will allow gas to flow into regulator members as required yet prevent any fluid or particulate contaminants from passing into the regulator inlet valves inadvertently without requiring one to remember to physically place a cover or cap over the inlet valve when not in use. The present invention addresses this significant problem in fluid flow systems in general and more particularly in the use of breathable gas regulators for scuba diving systems, oxygen delivery systems, emergency breathing systems and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide an improved fluid flow regulation device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is another object of the present invention to provide a one-way control valve arrangement wherein fluid may flow through the valve only at preset pressures.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a valve arrangement for use with compressed gas wherein the valve prevents entry of any fluid or other particulate matter yet enables easy flow of pressurized gas therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Still another object of the present invention is to provide an inlet valve construction for use in scuba regulator assemblies which allows the free flow of gas to the diver yet prevents the entry of water or other fluid as well as airborne contaminates.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A further object of the present invention is to provide an inlet valve assembly for use in both first and second stage members of scuba regulator assemblies which eliminates the need for separate cover elements to prevent the entry of water or other fluid as well as airborne contaminates into the regulator assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To achieve the foregoing and other objects and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a fluid flow control valve is disclosed. This valve includes a housing which defines a central passageway having fluid inlet and fluid outlet openings. A pressure responsive element is disposed within the passageway for selectively opening and closing of the inlet opening to fluid flow in response to fluid pressure exerted thereon at the inlet opening. A mechanism is provided within the passageway for exerting a bias force against the pressure responsive element which is sufficient to close the inlet opening to fluid flow absent a pre-established level of fluid pressure exerted on the pressure responsive element. A fluid filter element is also disposed within the passageway; and a retainer device is positioned for removably securing the filter element within the passageway.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The present invention is directed to a valve arrangement, both removable as well as integral, for controlling fluid flow: in devices of various types. More particularly, the valve of the present invention is designed as an inlet valve to enable one-way fluid flow into a device while preventing undesirable materials from entering the device. The preferred embodiments of the invention which are illustrated in detail herein are particularly adapted for use in gas pressure regulators for scuba, (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) diving units. It should be understood, however, that the present invention may be utilized with or incorporated as a part of any type of device or apparatus wherein fluid in the form of liquid or gas must enter the device under pressure. Other such examples may include fire, rescue and air emergency breathing units as well as oxygen units.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a scuba unit <b>10</b> of standard well-known design is illustrated having a regulator assembly <b>12</b> and a tank <b>14</b> for compressed breathable gas. Typically, the scuba tank <b>14</b> is a steel or aluminum cylinder designed to contain compressed gas at substantial pressures, i.e., well over 3000 psi. The most preferred breathable gas is simply compressed air. However, a variety of gas mixtures, such as nitrogen/oxygen blends commonly referred to as Nitrox as well as other gas blends which may include various other inert gases, are becoming more commonly used by the recreational scuba diver. It should be understood, therefore, that when the terms breathable gas or compressed air are used in this application, such terms are intended to also include other types of gas mixtures both common and uncommon to the scuba diving industry. Another compressed gas mixture which may benefit from the present invention includes argon which is occasionally used in conjunction with dry suit inflation rather than breathable gas mixtures. These applications will be discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The tank <b>14</b> of the scuba unit <b>10</b> includes a gas inlet/outlet valve <b>16</b> which typically includes a valve body portion <b>18</b> threadable into the tank <b>14</b>, a hand operated control knob <b>20</b> for opening and closing the valve <b>16</b>, and an inlet/outlet opening <b>22</b>. In one form of tank valve connection, that is the yoke-type valve, the opening <b>22</b> generally includes a recessed area <b>24</b> which contains a small orifice <b>26</b> that communicates with the interior of the tank <b>14</b> through the valve body portion <b>18</b>. An annular ridge <b>28</b> surrounds the recess <b>24</b> to form an annular groove wherein a removable O-ring <b>30</b> is provided between the ridge <b>28</b> and the recess <b>24</b>. This arrangement insures an airtight seal with any device that is secured to the opening <b>22</b>. This particular arrangement for the valve <b>16</b> is for attachment to a yoke-type regulator as described below. The other basic tank inlet/outlet arrangement (not illustrated is designed for attachment to a DIN valve, and in this embodiment the ridge <b>28</b> is in the form of a collar which projects substantially outwardly from the valve body <b>18</b> and includes threads that are designed for threaded engagement with a DIN valve regulator as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The regulator assembly <b>12</b> is a dual or two-stage regulator and typically includes a first stage regulator member <b>32</b> and a second stage regulator member <b>33</b>. The first stage regulator member <b>32</b> is removably secured to the tank valve outlet <b>22</b> and is designed to reduce the gas pressure from the tank <b>14</b> of 3000 or more psi to an intermediate gas pressure of approximately 140 psi. The intermediate pressure gas then passes through a hose <b>36</b> to the second stage regulator member <b>33</b>, wherein the gas pressure is further reduced to ambient pressure which is dependent upon the depth of the scuba diver. In this manner, the diver can readily breathe the gas from the second stage regulator member <b>33</b> at any depth.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a yoke-type regulator, the housing <b>34</b> includes a gas inlet opening <b>38</b> which is surrounded by a raised collar or flange <b>40</b>. A metal filter member <b>42</b> is positioned within the housing <b>34</b> below the opening <b>38</b> for the purpose of filtering any and all gas and other materials entering the opening <b>38</b>. A C-clip <b>44</b> is utilized to hold the filter <b>42</b> in the opening <b>38</b>. A nut <b>46</b> maintains a yoke <b>48</b> in position at the opening <b>38</b>. The yoke <b>48</b> is typically a U-shaped or an A-shaped element that is sized sufficiently to permit the tank valve <b>16</b> to be positioned between the collar <b>40</b> and the top of the yoke <b>48</b>. A hand knob <b>50</b> with a screw member <b>52</b> passes through the top of the yoke <b>48</b> in is designed to tighten against the backside <b>53</b> of the tank valve <b>16</b> to press the collar <b>40</b> against the ridge <b>28</b> and O-ring <b>30</b> of the tank valve <b>16</b> to secure the two members together. In certain regulator designs, the nut <b>46</b>, the collar <b>40</b>, the filter <b>42</b> and the C-clip <b>44</b> are all part of a valve housing which is threadably secured within a bore disposed, in the regulator housing <b>32</b>. In other designs, these components are individually mounted within the bore as an integral part of the housing <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As is clearly evident, when the first stage regulator member <b>32</b> is not secured to a tank valve <b>16</b>, liquid and other contaminants including airborne particulates can enter the inlet opening <b>38</b> and pass into the filter <b>42</b> and the rest of the regulator assembly <b>12</b>. Since it is a recommended procedure to thoroughly rinse or soak all scuba diving equipment in clean fresh water after each use, entry of water into the inlet opening <b>38</b> would prove disastrous to the proper operation of the regulator assembly <b>12</b>. This is because water will rust and corrode the internal metal components of the regulator assembly <b>12</b> as well as damage other attached components such as a dive computer, and particulate contaminants can block small orifices and otherwise cause galvanic or other reactions within the regulator assembly <b>12</b>, all of which will at least negatively affect the operation of the regulator and possibly cause it or its attached components to fail entirely. It would be a dangerous situation if the first stage regulator member failed during its use by a scuba diver while under water.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">This problem has been well recognized since the advent of the scuba unit, and for well over 50 years the answer has been to provide a dust cover <b>54</b>. The dust cover <b>54</b> is generally made of plastic or rubber and is removably positioned over or against the collar <b>40</b> when the first stage regulator member <b>32</b> is not in use. The screw <b>52</b> is tightened against the top <b>56</b> of the dust cover <b>54</b> to press the dust cover <b>54</b> firmly against the inlet opening <b>38</b>, thereby preventing entry of water and other contaminants. A similar removable cap arrangement is utilized for the second stage regulator alternate air source as described below. Unfortunately, it is a common mistake to forget to place the dust cover <b>54</b> over the inlet opening <b>38</b> before rinsing the regulator assembly <b>12</b>, thereby flooding the first or second stage regulator members <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>. Alternatively, the dust cover <b>54</b> may be positioned property but is not sufficiently tight to prevent entry of water into the inlet opening <b>38</b>. The present invention obviates the requirement for the dust cover <b>54</b> and the entire problem inherent with its use.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The fluid flow control valve of the present invention can be constructed and designed as a separate valve unit which is threadably secured within a regulator member housing. Alternatively, the valve assembly of the present invention can be formed as an integral part of the regulator assembly housing so that only the individual components are removable rather than the entire valve assembly containing the individual components as in the first instance. Therefore, it should be understood that while the specific embodiments illustrated herein may be in one form or the other, the present invention is not to be specifically limited to either form. Moreover, while the specific embodiments illustrated and discussed below are specific adaptations for use with a scuba diving regulator assembly, the present invention is not to be limited thereby and may be utilized with any type of fluid inlet control valve wherein the fluid is under compression. Thus, the present invention should be limited only by the claims as set forth at the end of this application and as interpreted in view of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring now with particularity to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-14</figref>, a fluid flow control valve <b>60</b> includes a housing <b>62</b> having a top or inlet end <b>64</b>, a central shaft <b>65</b> and a bottom or outlet end <b>66</b>. The housing <b>62</b> may be made of any suitable water-resistant material and is preferably galvanized metal. The inlet end <b>64</b> of the housing <b>62</b> is the functional equivalent of the inlet opening <b>38</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The housing shaft <b>65</b> includes a threaded portion <b>68</b> which is designed to engage a bore <b>69</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) disposed within the first stage regulator housing <b>34</b>. A nut-shaped portion <b>70</b> is the functional equivalent of the nut <b>46</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and is designed to assist in threadably engaging the valve housing <b>62</b> into the regulator housing <b>34</b> as well as to hold the yoke <b>48</b> in position. A removable O-ring <b>72</b> is provided to help maintain a watertight seal and keep the interior of the regulator housing <b>34</b> dry as well as prevent the escape of pressurized gas. A raised collar <b>74</b> is provided for engagement against the O-ring <b>30</b> of the tank valve inlet opening <b>22</b>, and a groove <b>76</b> is disposed radially inwardly from the collar <b>74</b> to assist in the engagement of collar <b>74</b> against the tank valve inlet opening <b>22</b> as well as providing a channel for draining loose water away from the inlet opening. This enables the inlet end <b>64</b> to remain free from water to prevent its inadvertent entry into the housing <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">An axial bore <b>78</b> extends along the interior length of the housing <b>62</b>. The diameter &#x201c;y&#x201d; of the bore <b>78</b> is substantially uniform along its entire length except for the portion adjacent the upper or inlet end <b>64</b>. The end opening the <b>80</b> of the bore <b>78</b> has a diameter &#x201c;x&#x201d; narrower than the diameter &#x201c;y&#x201d; of the bore <b>80</b>. In preferred form, an annular curved radial lip <b>82</b> is formed in the upper end portion of the bore <b>78</b> so as to narrow the diameter &#x201c;y&#x201d; of the bore <b>78</b> gradually to form the opening <b>80</b> having a diameter &#x201c;x&#x201d;. An annular internal groove <b>84</b> is provided within the bore <b>78</b> proximate the lower or bottom end portion <b>66</b> of the housing <b>62</b> and is sized to mount a removable C-clip <b>86</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A pressure responsive member or element <b>88</b> is positioned within the bore <b>78</b> proximate the upper or inlet end <b>64</b>. In this particular embodiment, the pressure responsive element <b>88</b> is in the form of a piston <b>90</b> having a head portion <b>92</b> terminating in an upper curved surface <b>94</b> which seals against the lip <b>82</b> and projects outwardly from the opening <b>80</b>. This outward projection also assists in keeping-water away from the junction of the opening <b>80</b>. It should be understood that while curved upper surfaces at the end of the pressure responsive element <b>88</b>, such as the surface <b>94</b>, are preferred and illustrated throughout this application, other surface shapes and arrangements may be used to plug or seal the opening <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">An internal pocket <b>96</b> is formed in the lower portion, of the piston <b>90</b> and terminates in an end opening <b>98</b>. A plurality of fluid channeling elements preferably in the form of longitudinal channels or grooves <b>100</b> are disposed along the outer surface of the piston <b>90</b> and extend from the end opening <b>98</b> and terminate short of the upper curved surface <b>94</b>. In this manner, fluid cannot flow along the channels <b>100</b> unless the head portion <b>92</b> has been disengaged from the lip <b>82</b> and the opening <b>80</b>. In preferred form, a bias mechanism in the form of a coiled spring <b>102</b> is provided and is sized to fit within the pocket <b>96</b>. The upper end portion <b>104</b> of the coiled spring <b>102</b> terminates at the upper end portion of the pocket <b>96</b>, while the lower end portion <b>106</b> of the coiled spring <b>102</b> extends outwardly from the pocket <b>96</b>. In preferred form, a spring containment sleeve <b>108</b> is provided having an internal cavity <b>110</b> for receiving the lower end portion <b>106</b> of the coiled spring <b>102</b>. The sleeve <b>108</b> terminates a base portion <b>110</b> which includes a plurality of notches <b>112</b> which are preferably sized and spaced according to the longitudinal channels <b>100</b> of the piston <b>90</b>. A metal filter element <b>114</b> having an enlarged base <b>115</b> is provided below the containment sleeve <b>108</b> and is sized and shaped to block the entire bore <b>78</b> so that any fluid passing through the bore <b>78</b> must pass through the filter <b>114</b>. The c-clip <b>86</b> is preferably positioned within the annular groove <b>84</b> below the metal filter <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the inlet valve <b>60</b> is illustrated in a closed position wherein the upper curved surface <b>94</b> of the piston <b>90</b> is in firm contact with the annular lip <b>82</b> so as to seal the opening <b>80</b> to the bore <b>78</b>. The bias mechanism in the preferred form of the coil spring <b>102</b> creates a bias force against the piston <b>90</b> and the bottom of the containment sleeve <b>108</b> so as to press the upper surface <b>94</b> against the internal lip <b>82</b>. The containment sleeve <b>108</b>, the filter <b>114</b> and the c-clip <b>86</b> are all sized, shaped and positioned so that the bias mechanism <b>102</b> provides sufficient bias force to close the piston <b>90</b> against the lip <b>82</b> and seal the opening <b>80</b>. In this closed position, neither fluid, liquid nor particulate matter of any kind can pass into the bore <b>78</b> through the inlet <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when a compressive force is exerted axially against the upper surface <b>94</b> of the piston <b>90</b> and is of sufficient strength to overcome the bias force of the spring <b>102</b>, the piston <b>90</b> moves axially into the bore <b>78</b>. This movement of the piston <b>90</b> disengages the upper surface <b>94</b> from the annular lip <b>82</b> thereby opening the end <b>80</b>. Fluid may then pass through the opening <b>80</b> and into the bore <b>78</b>. The channels <b>100</b> and the notches <b>112</b> permit such fluid entering the opening <b>80</b> to pass along the exterior length of the piston <b>90</b> and the containment sleeve <b>108</b>, through the filter <b>114</b>, and to exit out the end opening <b>116</b> of the bore <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As a result of the above arrangement and referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when the valve <b>60</b> forms the inlet opening for a first stage regulator member <b>32</b>, the normally closed position of the valve <b>60</b> resulting from the bias force of the spring member <b>102</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> prevents water and airborne particulates from entering the first stage regulator housing. This construction eliminates the need for the dust cap <b>54</b> in that the piston <b>90</b> which is engaged against the annular lip <b>82</b> will seal the inlet valve <b>60</b> from any exterior fluid or contaminant material. When a first stage regulator member <b>32</b> containing the valve <b>60</b> of the present invention is attached to a scuba tank-outlet valve <b>16</b>, however, the force from the compressed gas in the tank <b>14</b> overcomes the bias force of the spring <b>102</b> to press the piston <b>90</b> into the bore <b>78</b>. This action permits the compressed gas to pass through the bore <b>78</b>, out the exit opening <b>116</b> and into the regulator housing <b>34</b>. The bias force of the spring <b>102</b> may be adjusted to any desired strength. However, in order to permit the maximum amount of breathable gas from the tank <b>14</b> to be utilized by a scuba diver through the first stage regulator member, the bias force is preferably set as low as possible yet of sufficient strength to firmly engage the upper surface <b>94</b> against the annular lip <b>82</b> to close the opening <b>80</b> when the first stage regulator member <b>12</b> is not attached to a scuba tank <b>14</b>. While this bias strength force may be selected at any level, a minimum force of preferably 5-10 psi should probably be established to prevent inadvertent entry of fluid or contaminants into the bore <b>78</b> and regulator member <b>32</b> when the regulator member <b>32</b> is disconnected from a scuba tank outlet valve <b>16</b>. It should be understood, however, that this minimum force is a variable which may be selected and adjusted as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>, a second embodiment of the fluid flow control valve of the present invention is disclosed.

In this particular embodiment, the bias mechanism is also a coil spring <b>102</b>. However, in this embodiment, the lower end portion <b>106</b> of the spring <b>102</b> is positioned around the filter member <b>114</b> against the base <b>115</b> thereof. There is no spring containment sleeve in this embodiment.

The upper end portion <b>104</b> of the spring <b>102</b> is sized to surround the shoulder <b>130</b> to securely engage the end portion <b>126</b> of the piston head <b>120</b>. When the valve member <b>118</b> is in its closed position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the piston head upper surface <b>122</b> engages the annular tip <b>82</b> so as to close the opening <b>80</b>.

Again, when the valve member <b>118</b> is utilized with a scuba regulator, the fluid exerting the pressure on the piston head upper surface <b>122</b> is preferably compressed breathable gas.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>, a third embodiment of the fluid flow control valve of the present invention is disclosed. This embodiment is preferably in the form of a valve member <b>132</b> that includes a housing <b>62</b> constructed substantially identical to the prior embodiments for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-17</figref>. The housing <b>62</b> of this embodiment includes the upper or inlet end portion <b>64</b>, a bottom or outlet end portion <b>66</b>, a central bore <b>78</b>, an annular inner tip <b>82</b> forming a narrowed end opening <b>80</b>, and an exit opening <b>116</b>. In this embodiment, the bias mechanism is also a coil spring <b>102</b>, and the lower end portion <b>106</b> of the spring <b>102</b> is positioned to be engaged within a spring containment sleeve <b>108</b> having a base portion <b>110</b> with notches <b>112</b>, as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-14</figref>. In this particular embodiment, however, the filter member <b>134</b> is substantially flat as opposed to the conical shape of the prior embodiments, the c-clip <b>86</b> holding all the internal components of the valve <b>132</b> in place within the bore <b>78</b>. The upper end portion <b>104</b> of the spring <b>102</b> is engaged with a pressure responsive element <b>88</b> as in the prior embodiments.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Yet another embodiment of the fluid flow control valve of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref>. This embodiment includes a valve member <b>164</b> that is substantially similar to the valve member <b>150</b> of the prior embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-23</figref> except for the construction of the pressure responsive element <b>88</b>. In this particular embodiment, the pressure responsive element <b>88</b> is preferably in the form of an orb or ball <b>166</b> having a continuous curved outer surface, any portion of which may serve as an upper curved surface <b>168</b> similar to the surface <b>154</b> of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-23</figref>. The ball <b>166</b> is sized to have a diameter greater than the diameter &#x201c;x&#x201d; of the opening <b>80</b>, yet smaller than the diameter &#x201c;y&#x201d; of the bore <b>78</b>. The ball <b>166</b> is seated in the upper end portion <b>104</b> of the spring <b>102</b> and held in position on the spring <b>102</b>.

Again, when the valve member <b>164</b> is utilized with a scuba regulator, the fluid exerting the pressure on the ball upper surface <b>168</b> is preferably compressed breathable gas.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32-34</figref>, still another embodiment of the fluid flow control valve of the present invention is illustrated. This embodiment is very similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref> and includes a valve member <b>170</b> having a housing <b>62</b> structured substantially identical to the prior embodiments. The internal components of the valve member <b>170</b> are similar to those of the valve member <b>164</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref> except for the construction of the spring bias element <b>172</b> and its connection to the pressure responsive or sensing member <b>88</b>. In this particular embodiment, the pressure responsive element <b>88</b> is again preferably in the form of an orb or ball <b>174</b> having a continuous curved outer surface. The spring bias element <b>172</b> includes an upper end portion <b>176</b> projecting from a spring lever arm <b>178</b>, and a base cage portion <b>180</b>. The cage portion <b>180</b> is sized and shaped to slidingly fit over a conical shaped metal filter <b>114</b> and rest on the filter base <b>115</b>. The ball <b>174</b> is fixed to the distal end of the end portion <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The ball <b>174</b> is fixed to the upper portion <b>176</b> of the spring bias element lever arm <b>178</b> so that a portion of its upper outer surface may serve as an upper curved surface <b>182</b> similar to the surface <b>168</b> of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref>. The ball <b>174</b> is sized to have a diameter greater than the diameter &#x201c;x&#x201d; of the opening <b>80</b>, yet smaller than the diameter &#x201c;y&#x201d; of the bore <b>78</b>.

Again, when the valve member <b>170</b> is utilized with a scuba regulator, the fluid exerting the pressure on the ball upper surface <b>182</b> is preferably compressed breathable gas. Upon cessation of the axial force from the compressed gas or other fluid, the lever arm <b>178</b> moves the ball <b>174</b> back into its closed position wherein the upper surface <b>182</b> engages the annular tip <b>82</b> and closes the opening <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-31</figref>, another embodiment of the invention is illustrated wherein it is adapted for use in a DIN valve arrangement. As previously explained, the DIN valve <b>184</b> includes a housing <b>186</b> with rear exterior thread members <b>188</b> that are designed to screw the housing <b>184</b> into a first stage regulator housing similar to the housing <b>32</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, only adapted for a DIN-style valve rather than a yoke-style valve. A separate attachment element <b>190</b> is designed to slide over the housing <b>184</b> and engage the nut portion <b>192</b> of the housing <b>184</b>. The exterior threads <b>194</b> are designed to screw into a compatible aperture located in the outlet/inlet valve housing <b>16</b> of a scuba tank cylinder <b>14</b>. The aforementioned elements of the DIN-style housing <b>184</b> are all standard features well known to the art. However, the remaining features of the valve <b>184</b> including the internal components thereof are call adapted in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The upper or fluid inlet end portion <b>196</b> of the housing <b>186</b> includes the nut <b>192</b>, and the lower or fluid outlet end portion <b>198</b> of the housing <b>186</b> includes the exterior threads <b>188</b>. A center shaft portion <b>200</b> interconnects the inlet portion <b>196</b> with the outlet portion <b>198</b>. The upper end portion <b>196</b> includes an annular groove <b>202</b> disposed in the end surface <b>204</b> of the nut <b>192</b>, and an O-ring <b>206</b> is disposed within the groove <b>202</b>. An end collar <b>208</b> projects outwardly from the surface <b>204</b> of the nut <b>192</b>. A central bore <b>210</b> is disposed within the housing <b>186</b> similar to the bore <b>78</b> of the prior embodiments and has a diameter &#x201c;y&#x201d;. The bore <b>210</b> includes an inlet opening <b>212</b> having a diameter &#x201c;x&#x201d; which is less than the diameter &#x201c;y&#x201d; of the bore <b>210</b>, again similar to the prior embodiments. The end opening <b>212</b> is disposed in the collar <b>208</b> and defines a curved annular interior lip <b>214</b>. A pressure responsive or sensitive element <b>88</b>, a spring bias mechanism <b>102</b> and a spring containment sleeve <b>108</b> similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-13</figref> are preferably utilized within the bore <b>210</b> of the housing <b>186</b> of the present embodiment. Due to the fact that DIN-type valves <b>184</b> are considerably longer than yoke-type valves <b>60</b>, a tubular spacer element <b>216</b> is positioned between the bottom of the containment sleeve base <b>112</b> and the base plate <b>115</b> of the fibrous metal filter <b>114</b>. A c-clip <b>86</b> is utilized to maintain the position of all the aforementioned components within the bore <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As described in the previous embodiments, the pressure responsive element <b>88</b> preferably in the form of a piston <b>92</b> includes a curved upper surface <b>94</b>. The upper surface <b>94</b> is shaped to firmly engage the inner annular lip <b>214</b> when the valve <b>184</b> is in its closed position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. When fluid pressure, as in the form of compressed gas from a scuba tank, is exerted in an inward axial direction against the surface <b>94</b> of the piston <b>92</b> and is of sufficient strength to overcome the bias force applied by the spring <b>102</b>, the spring <b>102</b> is compressed and the piston <b>92</b> moved axially inwardly into the bore <b>210</b>. When this occurs, the fluid may then pass through the opening <b>212</b>, through the fluid channels or grooves <b>100</b>, through the notches <b>112</b>, through the interior of the spacer <b>216</b>, through the fibrous metal filter <b>114</b> and out the exit opening <b>218</b>. As with the prior embodiments, undesirable fluids and particulate material cannot enter the valve <b>184</b> when it is in its closed position due to the bias force of the spring <b>102</b> against the piston <b>92</b>. However, when pressurized fluid, such as in the form of compressed gas or air from a scuba tank, is exerted against the surface <b>94</b> of the piston <b>92</b>, the piston <b>92</b> is moved and the gas or air passes through the valve <b>184</b> and into the first stage regulator.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35-38</figref>, a second stage regulator member <b>220</b> is illustrated in the form of an alternate air or gas source as previously described.

The quick disconnect valve <b>224</b> of standard exterior design is arranged for connecting an intermediate pressure hose such as hose <b>226</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to the second stage regulator member <b>220</b>. As previously described, the second stage regulator member <b>220</b> is designed to reduce the intermediate pressure of the compressed breathable gas from the hose <b>226</b> to ambient pressure so that a diver may readily breathe it through a mouth piece <b>228</b>. The valve <b>224</b> includes a housing <b>230</b> which is threadably positioned within the regulator member <b>220</b>. The housing <b>230</b> includes an inlet end portion <b>232</b> and an outlet end portion <b>234</b>. The outlet end portion <b>234</b> includes exterior thread members <b>236</b> for engagement with a receiver nut which is part of the regulator assembly <b>220</b>. A pair flanges <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> and a pair of O-rings <b>244</b>, <b>246</b> assist in maintaining the valve housing <b>230</b> within the regulator member <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The housing <b>230</b> preferably includes an interior axial bore <b>248</b> which extends the length thereof.

An interior annular lip <b>252</b> is formed at the inlet portion <b>232</b> to define the opening <b>250</b>. A pressure responsive or sensitive element <b>254</b> is preferably formed as a piston <b>256</b> having elongated channeling elements <b>258</b> in the form of grooves-along the exterior surface thereof. An upper curved surface <b>260</b> is sized and shaped to engage the annular lip <b>252</b> so as to seal the opening <b>250</b> when the valve <b>224</b> is in its closed position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. The spring bias member <b>262</b> is provided for engaging the interior of the piston <b>256</b> at its upper end portion <b>264</b>. The lower end portion <b>266</b> of the spring bias member <b>262</b> is positioned within a containment sleeve <b>268</b> having a base <b>270</b> with fluid passage notches <b>272</b>. The base <b>270</b> of the containment sleeve <b>268</b> rests against a fibrous metallic filter <b>114</b>, and a C-clip <b>86</b> is utilized as in the prior embodiments to maintain the components discussed above within the central bore <b>248</b>. When an intermediate hose <b>226</b> is attached to the inlet end portion <b>232</b> of the valve <b>224</b> and compressed gas introduced therein, the pressure from the gas against the upper surface <b>260</b> of the piston <b>254</b> presses the piston <b>254</b> into the bore <b>248</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>) against the force of the bias member <b>262</b>. As in prior embodiments, the compressed gas can then enter the inlet opening <b>250</b> to pass along the grooves <b>258</b> into the central bore <b>248</b>, through the notches <b>272</b>, through the filter <b>114</b> and then out the exit opening <b>274</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39 &#x26; 40</figref>, a standard and known first stage regulator member <b>276</b> is illustrated.

An end cap or yoke retainer element <b>280</b> is utilized to seal the regulator end opening <b>278</b>. This regulator member <b>280</b> may be modified for use with the present invention as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>. In this instance, the end cap or yoke retainer nut <b>280</b> and the metal filter within the opening <b>278</b> are removed. In their place, an inlet valve <b>282</b> is inserted into the opening <b>278</b>. The valve <b>282</b> includes a housing <b>284</b> having threads <b>286</b> and O-ring elements <b>288</b>, <b>290</b> to engage the threads <b>292</b> to secure the housing <b>284</b> to the regulator member <b>276</b>.

A spring <b>336</b>, an O-ring <b>338</b> and a backup ring <b>340</b> are all disposed about the high-pressure seat <b>330</b>. A spring block <b>342</b> is provided for engaging the upper end of the high-pressure seat <b>330</b>. A second spring element <b>344</b> is positioned on the upper end of the spring block <b>342</b>, and a filter member <b>0</b>.<b>346</b> is positioned thereon and maintained in place by a c-clip <b>86</b>. An end cap <b>348</b>, a yoke <b>48</b>, a hand knob <b>50</b> and a dust cover <b>54</b> are also all provided. As can be seen by this assembly, the integral valve components within the valve housing <b>322</b> are all potentially exposed to water and solid contaminants if the dust cover <b>54</b> is not properly positioned as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, the standard regulator <b>320</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> has been modified to incorporate the present invention as an integral part thereof. In this particular embodiment, the regulator member <b>350</b> includes a housing <b>352</b> having an inlet end portion <b>354</b>. The housing <b>352</b> includes a central bore <b>356</b> which passes axially along the length thereof. An end cap <b>358</b> is threadably engageable with the base of the housing <b>352</b>. A diaphragm of standard design <b>360</b> is positioned at the inner surface of the end cap <b>358</b>. Disposed within the lower portion of the bore <b>356</b> within the housing <b>352</b> is a pin <b>332</b>, a pin support <b>334</b>, a high-pressure seat <b>330</b>, a high-pressure seat spring element <b>336</b>, an O-ring <b>338</b>, the backup ring <b>340</b>, and a spring block <b>342</b>, all components standard to the known regulator member <b>320</b>. In this particular in embodiment, however, a pressure responsive or sensitive element in the form of a piston <b>362</b> is positioned within the bore <b>356</b> at the inlet end portion <b>354</b>. The piston <b>362</b> includes an upper curved surface <b>364</b>, and an inner annular lip <b>366</b> is provided to define the end opening <b>368</b> of the bore <b>356</b>. The diameter of the end opening <b>368</b> is less than the diameter of the bore <b>356</b> as in the prior embodiments. In this manner, the upper curved surface <b>364</b> of the piston <b>362</b> engages the annular lip <b>366</b> to seal the end opening <b>368</b> when the valve <b>350</b> is in its closed position as illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The lower end portion of the piston member <b>362</b> includes a projection <b>370</b> having a diameter less than the piston member <b>362</b> thereby forming an annular shoulder <b>372</b>. A bias mechanism <b>374</b> preferably in the form of a coil spring is positioned between the piston element <b>362</b> and the filter <b>346</b>, the upper end portion of the spring <b>374</b> being disposed about the annular shoulder <b>372</b>. A removable high-pressure crown <b>376</b> with an O-ring <b>378</b> is provided below the high-pressure seat <b>330</b>. A spacer element <b>380</b> is positioned between the crown <b>376</b>, and a c-clip <b>86</b> is provided to maintain all the components in position within the bore <b>372</b>. Finally, an intermediate spring <b>382</b> is provided on the intermediate pressure side of the diaphragm <b>360</b> and is disposed within the tightener element <b>384</b> which is engageable within the end cap <b>358</b>. The tightener member <b>384</b> can be utilized to adjust the intermediate pressure of the diaphragm <b>360</b>. As a result of this construction, the piston element <b>362</b> maintains the opening <b>368</b> in a sealed condition as a result of the bias from the spring <b>374</b>. Once the housing <b>350</b> is attached to a source of pressurized gas, the force from the pressurized gas against the curved surface <b>364</b> presses the piston element <b>362</b> into the bore <b>356</b> to allow compressed gas to pass into the bore <b>356</b> and against the diaphragm <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As can be seen from the above, the present invention solves a problem which has existed from the very beginning of the sport of scuba diving. The present invention provides for a relatively simple yet very effective arrangement for preventing the inadvertent entry of water and other contaminants into the first or second stage regulator members of a scuba diving unit. The present invention eliminates the need for a manual dust cap and, more importantly, for the requirement that the user of a scuba diving unit remember to place the dust cap in position prior to cleaning and/or storing the equipment. The present invention can be constructed in any number of different forms so as to be compatible with virtually every type of first stage regulator member presently manufactured and sold. The present invention can be in the form of an independent valve-member which may be utilized to retrofit existing first stage regulator members as well as used with newly manufactured regulator assemblies. In the alternative, the present invention can be constructed as an integral part of a regulator member with its components readily accessible for repair and/or replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The present invention may also be utilized with second stage regulators when in the form of alternate air sources. Additionally, the present invention may be utilized with any type of gas used in the scuba diving industry, including all types of breathable gas mixtures as well as other types of systems that are used in scuba diving but not necessarily for breathing. Specifically, cylinders of compressed argon are utilized to inflate dry suits and are separate and apart from the breathing mixture for a scuba diver. The present invention may be utilized with the gas regulator for such compressed argon systems. Moreover, extended range scuba divers require the use of multiple compressed breathing gas tanks for decompression purposes. As such, the scuba diver, when performing such extended range functions, must change regulator connections between tanks while underwater. Heretofore, this process flooded the regulators, creating, initial breathing problems as well as creating the difficulty of cleaning and drying the internal components of the regulators after the extended range dive was concluded. The present invention obviates these problems and permits easy changing of compressed gas bottles, while underwater. Moreover, the present invention may also be utilized in an inlet valve arrangement for rebreather scuba units.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Finally, it should be understood that while the present invention was initially developed for the scuba diving industry, it has much broader implications and applications. It can be utilized with any type of fluid flow environment and device and should not be simply limited to gaseous fluids. Any type of device or system wherein fluid under pressure is directed into a one-way inlet valve may benefit from the present invention by being adapted in accordance therewith. Therefore, the present invention should not be limited by the specific illustrations and embodiments described in detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The fore going description and the illustrative embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail in varying modifications and alternate embodiments. It should be understood, however, that the foregoing description of the present invention is exemplary only, and that the scope of the present invention is to be limited only to the claims as interpreted in view of the prior art. Moreover, the invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the absence of any element which is not specifically disclosed herein.</p>
