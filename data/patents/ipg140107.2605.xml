<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely illustrative of the invention that may be embodied in various forms. In addition, each of the examples given in connection with the various embodiments of the invention are intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Further, the figures are not necessarily to scale, some features may be exaggerated to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure relate to methods and structures for producing electrical devices, such as semiconductor devices. As used herein, &#x201c;semiconductor device&#x201d; refers to an intrinsic semiconductor material that has been doped, that is, into which a doping agent has been introduced, giving it different electrical properties than the intrinsic semiconductor. Doping involves adding dopant atoms to an intrinsic semiconductor, which changes the electron and hole carrier concentrations of the intrinsic semiconductor at thermal equilibrium. Dominant carrier concentration in an extrinsic semiconductor determines the conductivity type of the semiconductor. Some examples of semiconductor devices include but are not limited to field effect transistors, such as metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices; bipolar junction transistors and memory devices, such as flash, DRAM, and eDRAM devices. As used herein a &#x201c;field effect transistor&#x201d; is a transistor in which output current, i.e., source-drain current, is controlled by the voltage applied to the gate. A field effect transistor (FET) has three terminals, i.e., gate, source and drain. As used herein, the term &#x201c;memory device&#x201d; means a structure in which the electrical state can be altered and then retained in the altered state, in this way a bit of information can be stored. As noted above, any suitable electrical device having an interconnect may utilize the present invention including capacitors, diodes and resistors.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, a single interconnect provides electrical communication to the gate conductor of a semiconductor device's gate structure, and one, but not both, of the source region and the drain region of the semiconductor device. The gate structure typically includes at least one gate conductor and at least one spacer abutting the at least one gate conductor. In one embodiment, a metal semiconductor alloy provides a contact pad for the interconnect, and is formed on an upper surface of the gate structure, an outer sidewall of the spacer and an upper surface of one of the source region and the drain region. The metal semiconductor alloy may also function as an etch stop during the formation of the via that contains the interconnect. In some embodiments, by utilizing the metal semiconductor alloy as an etch stop, the present method may ensure that the underlying spacer is not damaged by the etch. Because, the spacer is present over a portion of the channel region, and the metal semiconductor alloy ensures that the integrity of the spacer is not compromised by the etch process that produces the via for the interconnect, the present method may eliminate the possibility that the interconnect to one of the source and the drain region does not contact the channel region of the memory device.

In one example, the semiconductor device <b>100</b> is a static random access memory device (SRAM). Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is a type of semiconductor memory, in which the word static indicates that, unlike dynamic RAM (DRAM), it does not need to be periodically refreshed, as SRAM uses bistable latching circuitry to store each bit. SRAM exhibits data remanence, but is still volatile in the conventional sense that data is eventually lost when the memory is not powered.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each bit in an SRAM is stored on four transistors, such as field effect transistors, that form two cross-coupled inverters. This storage cell has two stable states, which are used to denote 0 and 1. Two additional access transistors serve to control the access to a storage cell during read and write operations. A typical SRAM uses six MOSFETs to store each memory bit. In addition to such 6T SRAM, other kinds of SRAM chips use 8T, 10T, or more transistors per bit. This is sometimes used to implement more than one (read and/or write) port, which may be useful in certain types of video memory and register files implemented with multi ported SRAM circuitry. For the purposes of simplicity, the following description and figures describe a single transistor, but the method disclosed herein is applicable to any number of transistors in an SRAM memory device configuration. In addition to SRAM devices, the present method is suitable for forming any semiconductor device that includes transistors, such as field effect transistors.</p>

In one embodiment, following formation of the metal semiconductor alloy region <b>35</b>, a dielectric material can be blanket deposited atop the entire substrate and planarized to provide the interlevel dielectric <b>60</b>. The blanket dielectric may be selected from the group consisting of silicon-containing materials, such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, SiC, SiCO, SiCOH, and SiCH compounds; the above-mentioned silicon-containing materials with some or all of the Si replaced by Ge; carbon-doped oxides; inorganic oxides; inorganic polymers; hybrid polymers; organic polymers such as polyamides or SiLK&#x2122;; other carbon-containing materials; organo-inorganic materials such as spin-on glasses and silsesquioxane-based materials; and diamond-like carbon (DLC, also known as amorphous hydrogenated carbon, &#x3b1;-C:H). Additional choices for the interlevel dielectric layer <b>60</b> include: any of the aforementioned materials in porous form, or in a form that changes during processing to or from being porous and/or permeable to being non-porous and/or non-permeable.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the interlevel dielectric <b>60</b> is patterned and etched to form a first via <b>65</b><i>a </i>to the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> that extends from the upper surface of the gate conductor <b>3</b> over the outer sidewall S<b>2</b> of the spacer <b>14</b> into electrical communication with one of the source region <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the drain region <b>7</b><i>b</i>. A second via <b>65</b><i>b </i>is formed to expose the alloyed region <b>51</b> that in present on an upper surface of the other of the source region <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the drain region <b>7</b><i>b</i>, which is not in contact with the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts that the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> is in contact with the drain region <b>7</b><i>b </i>and the alloyed region <b>51</b> in contact with the source region <b>7</b><i>a</i>, but embodiments have been contemplated in which the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> is in contact with the source region <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the alloyed region <b>51</b> is in contact with the drain region <b>7</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The first and second via <b>65</b><i>a</i>, <b>65</b><i>b </i>may be formed using deposition, photolithography and etch processes. In one embodiment, a second etch mask may be patterned to expose the portions of the interlevel dielectric <b>60</b> that are overlying the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> and the alloyed region <b>51</b>. The second etch mask (not shown) may comprise soft and/or hardmask materials and can be formed using deposition, photolithography and etching. In one embodiment, the second etch mask comprises a photoresist. A photoresist second etch mask can be produced by applying a photoresist layer to the surface of the interlevel dielectric <b>60</b>, exposing the photoresist layer to a pattern of radiation, and then developing the pattern into the photoresist layer utilizing a resist developer.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, using the second etch mask, a selective etch process forms the first and second via <b>65</b><i>a</i>, <b>65</b><i>b </i>stopping on the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> and the alloyed region <b>51</b>. The term &#x201c;selective&#x201d; in reference to a material removal process denotes that the rate of material removal for a first material, e.g., interlevel dielectric <b>60</b>, is greater than the rate of removal for at least another material, e.g., metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> and alloyed region <b>51</b>, of the structure to which the material removal process is being applied. In one embodiment, the etch chemistry for removing the interlevel dielectric <b>60</b> selective to the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> and the alloyed region <b>51</b> ranges from 10:1 to 200:1. In another embodiment, the etch chemistry for removing the interlevel dielectric <b>60</b> selective to the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> and the alloyed region <b>51</b> ranges from 50:1 to 150:1. In yet another embodiment, the etch chemistry for removing the interlevel dielectric <b>60</b> selective to the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> and the alloyed region <b>51</b> ranges from 75:1 to 100:1. In one embodiment, the etch chemistry for etching the interlevel dielectric layer selective to the metal semiconductor alloy includes H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>and Ar. The etch process may further employ end point detection methods.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, the etching process includes, but is not limited to chemical reactive ion etching (RIE), plasma etching, ion beam etching or laser ablation. In another embodiment, a wet etch, such as dilute HF, buffered HF and/or phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) solutions, may be utilized to remove the exposed portion of the interlevel dielectric <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The etch process may be an anisotropic etch process or an isotropic etch process. One example of an anisotropic etch process is reactive ion etching (RIE). Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) is a form of plasma etching in which during etching, the surface to be etched is placed on an RF powered electrode. Moreover, during RIE the surface to be etched takes on a potential that accelerates the etching species extracted from plasma toward the surface, in which the chemical etching reaction is taking place in the direction normal to the surface. Other examples of anisotropic etching that can be used at this point of the disclosure include ion beam etching, plasma etching or laser ablation. Isotropic etching may be achieved using a wet chemical etch.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Following via formation, interconnects <b>70</b> are formed by depositing a conductive metal into the via holes <b>65</b><i>a</i>, <b>65</b><i>b </i>using deposition methods, such as CVD or plating. The conductive metal may include, but is not limited to tungsten, copper, aluminum, silver, gold and alloys thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts one embodiment of a transistor of a semiconductor device <b>100</b> in accordance with the present method. In one embodiment, the semiconductor device <b>100</b> includes a gate structure <b>20</b> present on a first portion P<b>1</b> of a substrate <b>5</b>, in which the gate structure <b>20</b> includes at least a gate conductor <b>3</b> and a at least one spacer <b>14</b> that is present in direct contact with a sidewall S<b>1</b> of the gate conductor <b>3</b>. Source and drain regions <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>are present in a second portion P<b>2</b> of the substrate that is laterally adjacent to the first portion P<b>1</b> of the substrate <b>5</b>. A metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> is present on an upper surface of the gate conductor <b>3</b>, present on an outer sidewall surface S<b>2</b> of the at least one spacer <b>14</b>, and present on an upper surface of one of the source and drain region <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b</i>. An interlevel dielectric <b>60</b> is present having an interconnect <b>70</b> in electrical communication to the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b>. The channel portion of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> is in the first portion P<b>1</b> of the substrate <b>5</b>, which is present between the source and drain region <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b</i>. The gate dielectric <b>2</b>, the gate conductor <b>3</b> and the at least one spacer <b>14</b> are present over the first portion P<b>1</b> of the substrate, in which the channel is present. The metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> is present overlying the at least one spacer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> protects the spacer <b>14</b> from being etched during the formation of the first via <b>65</b><i>a </i>in the interlevel dielectric <b>60</b> for the interconnect <b>70</b> to at least one of the source region <b>7</b><i>a</i>, drain region <b>7</b><i>b </i>and the gate conductor <b>3</b>. In prior structures, in which the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> is not present, etching vias in the interlevel dielectric etches the spacer that abuts the gate conductor to expose a portion of the channel, wherein the subsequently formed interconnect to the source and/or drain region contacts the channel and shorts the device. In one embodiment, the metal semiconductor alloy <b>50</b> of the present method eliminates the likelihood of etching the spacer in a manner that results in an interconnect contacting the channel and shorting the semiconductor device <b>100</b>.</p>
