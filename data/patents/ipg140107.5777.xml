<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a distributed embedded system that provides extensible task and message scheduling and, more particularly, to a distributed embedded system that provides extensible task and message scheduling, where the system includes a system configuration manager and a plurality of electronic control units each having a configuration manager.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Distributed embedded systems typically include a group of processors, referred to as electrical control units (ECU), that are coupled to each other by a communication bus/network, such as a controller area network (CAN) bus, a time-triggered protocol (TTP) bus, a FlexRay bus, a wireless network, etc. A set of tasks are allocated to each ECU, such as actuating an actuator, and messages are transmitted between the ECUs on the bus/network. For a time-triggered bus, only one message is transmitted on the bus at a time. When the system is designed, the execution of the tasks must be scheduled for each ECU and the transmission of the messages must be scheduled on the bus/network. The scheduling of the messages may have different forms, including task priority assignments for priority-based task scheduling, message identifier assignments for message scheduling on CAN buses, time slot assignments for task and message scheduling in time triggered systems, such as TTP and FlexRay, or frequency/code assignments from message scheduling in wireless networks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The tasks are periodic and have hard deadlines that may produce catastrophic results if not met. For example, in an automotive steer-by-wire embedded system, it is necessary that the outputs from the various ECUs in the system have strict deadlines. There are also precedent constraints for the tasks where one task may need to be executed before another task is executed, possibly within a single execution period. Therefore, it is necessary that the system properly schedule the execution of the tasks in each ECU and the transmission of the task messages on the bus so that all of the deadlines are met and all of the constraints are satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, once the schedules for the ECUs and the bus/network are determined, they are hard coded into the system and cannot be changed after the ECUs are built. This prevents re-using the ECUs for different systems, and also makes it impossible to reconfigure the system at run-time in response to a fault or to be adapted to different operation environments.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is desirable that the scheduling employed in an embedded system be extensible so that if changes are needed or upgrades are developed after the initial implementation of the system, such as adding or removing ECUs and/or adding or removing tasks, the original schedule can be changed. For example, if a task set is changed for one ECU or a new ECU is added to the system, then it is desirable that this change not affect the schedules for the tasks and message transmissions of the other ECUs. If the new messages can be transmitted on the bus without affecting the transmission of the existing messages, then no change is needed for the scheduling of the other ECUs already in use. Otherwise, it may be necessary to reprogram the bus schedule at great expense.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a distributed embedded system is disclosed that allows for the reconfiguration of tasks and messages. The system includes a system configuration manager and a plurality of electronic control units (ECU) each having an ECU configuration manager. Each ECU configuration manager stores the current configuration data for task scheduling and bus/network accessing for the current schedule for that ECU. The system configuration manager includes a separate configuration data table for each ECU that can be reconfigured by programming signals sent on a system bus. The system configuration manager transmits the new configuration data from the data table on the bus to the ECU configuration manager if the scheduling of the tasks, message retrieval from the bus and message transmission on the bus changes for an ECU as a result of adding new tasks or new ECUs to the system.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following discussion of the embodiments of the invention directed to a system and method for providing reconfigurable data in a distributed and embedded system is merely exemplary in nature, and is in no way intended to limit the invention or its applications or uses.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a distributed embedded system <b>10</b> including a plurality of ECUs <b>1</b>-n, where only two ECUs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are shown, according to an embodiment of the present invention. As is well understood in the art, the ECUs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> perform certain tasks, such as actuate an actuator in response to control signals transmitted as messages. Each ECU <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> includes an ECU configuration manager <b>16</b> that manages the operation of the ECU, particularly the tasks to be performed, when data is received and when data is transmitted for the particular ECU <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Further, the embedded system <b>10</b> includes a system configuration manager <b>18</b> that stores the configuration of message transmission and task performance for all of the ECUs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. As will be discussed in detail below, when the system <b>10</b> is run, the system configuration manager <b>18</b> may send updated configuration data to each ECU configuration manager <b>16</b> depending on whether any of the tasks, task scheduling or message scheduling has changed. The ECU configuration managers <b>16</b> and the system configuration manager <b>18</b> communicate with each through the system <b>10</b> on a communications bus/network <b>20</b>. The bus/wireless network <b>20</b> can be any suitable communication bus/network including, but not limited to, a CAN bus, a TTP bus, a FlexRay bus, a wireless network, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">After each ECU configuration manager <b>16</b> receives the configuration data from the system configuration manager <b>18</b>, it updates the configuration data stored in the ECU <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, where the updated configuration data will be used for the subsequent operation of the ECU <b>12</b>,<b>14</b>. The system configuration manager <b>18</b> includes a separate configuration data table <b>30</b> for each of the ECUs <b>12</b>,<b>14</b>. If a particular ECU <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> is assigned a new task, or a new ECU is added to the system <b>10</b>, then the task scheduling, message receiving from the bus <b>20</b> and message sending on the bus <b>20</b> may need to be reconfigured for one or more of the ECUs <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> to handle the new task or the new ECU. When the new task or the new ECU is identified by reprogramming signals sent on the bus/wireless network <b>20</b> to the system configuration manager <b>18</b>, the system configuration manager <b>18</b> will take the appropriate steps to add a table for the new ECU and update each table <b>30</b> for each separate ECU <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> as required so that the new task scheduling, message sending on the bus <b>20</b> and message retrieval from the bus <b>20</b> is provided to accommodate the new task or the new ECU. The system configuration manager <b>18</b> then sends the new configuration data for the particular ECU <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> on the communication bus/wireless network <b>20</b> when the system is initialized at run time. Further, if there is a fault in the operation of the system <b>10</b> where improper messages would be sent, the system configuration manager <b>18</b> can reload the scheduling for each of the ECUs <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> from the tables <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The configuration data for each ECU <b>12</b> includes three parts. Particularly, the configuration data includes a configuration data for task scheduling table <b>22</b>, a configuration data for bus/network message accessing table <b>24</b>, and a configuration data for message retrieving table <b>26</b> from the bus/network <b>20</b>. The task scheduling table <b>22</b> is used to schedule task execution. The task scheduling data could be in the form of priority assignments for event-triggered operating systems or in the form of time slot assignments for time-triggered operating systems. The task scheduling table <b>22</b> is included for updating because it is closely related to the message accessing table <b>24</b> and the message receiving table <b>26</b>. For example, if the transmission time of a message is reconfigured at an earlier time, then the task that generates the message must finish earlier than before. Thus, the task scheduling table <b>22</b> should be changed along with the change of the message accessing table <b>24</b> and the message retrieving table <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The message accessing table <b>24</b> is used for scheduling messages on the bus/network <b>20</b>. The message accessing table <b>24</b> has different forms for different bus/networks. For example, the message retrieving table <b>24</b> can include message identifier assignments for a CAN bus, transmission time slots for a time-triggered bus, or transmission frequency code assignments for wireless networks.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The message retrieving table <b>26</b> is used for obtaining the messages it needs from the bus/network <b>20</b>. The configuration data for the message retrieving table <b>26</b> may take different forms for different buses. For example, it may be the message identifier filtering assignments for CAN buses, the receiving time slot assignments for time-triggered buses, or the frequency/code filtering assignments for wireless networks. The message retrieving table <b>26</b> is included for updating because it is closely related to the message accessing table <b>24</b>. The message retrieving table <b>26</b> will be changed for the ECU <b>12</b> that receives messages with changes for the message accessing table <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Two requirements are necessary for the system <b>10</b> to be able to reconfigure data as discussed above. The configuration implementation for each ECU <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> for the task scheduling table <b>22</b>, the message accessing table <b>24</b> and the message retrieving table <b>26</b> are not hard-coded, and are based on the configuration data that is stored in each ECU <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> that can be updated at run time. Further, the ECU configuration managers <b>16</b> need to have a unique ID. The ECU ID is assigned statically and will not be changed as long as the ECU <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> is not rebuilt. The system configuration manager <b>18</b> will use the ECU ID to send the configuration data from the particular table <b>30</b> to the corresponding ECU configuration manager <b>16</b>. The ECU configuration manager <b>16</b> will only retrieve the configuration data from the bus/network <b>20</b> that has its ECU ID in it.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The benefits that can be realized by the reconfigurable communication in distributed embedded systems discussed above include good ECU reusability, good system extensibility and the enabling of self-reconfiguration. To see how the ECUs <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are reusable across different system platforms, consider the two ECUs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> that form one sub-system and communicate with each other over a CAN bus. In a first system platform, the ECUs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> share the CAN bus with two other ECUs. In a second system platform, the two ECUs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> share the CAN bus with two other ECUs. Consider the case that the message identifier assignments for the ECUs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in the first platform do not work in the second platform, i.e., either there is a conflict in identifier assignments, or if the same message identifier assignments are used, then some deadlines may be missed. With the present invention, the ECUs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can be reused from the first platform to the second platform because the message identifier assignments can be derived from the system configuration manager <b>18</b> in the initialization phase of the system, and the ECUs <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> will perform correctly with different identifier assignments in the two different platforms.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For system extensibility, consider a system that consists of a number of ECUs that are connected through a time-triggered bus. Now consider adding two more ECUs to the system <b>10</b> where the bus schedule must be changed and the transmission/slot assignments for most of the ECUs must be changed. With the present invention, there is no need to change those ECUs because the only thing that needs to be changed is the configuration data in the system configuration manager <b>18</b>. The changed configuration will be communicated to each ECU configuration manager <b>16</b> at run-time in the initialization phase of the system <b>10</b>. The present invention also enables the self-reconfiguration of the system <b>10</b> provided that there is an intelligent run-time configuration generator in the system <b>10</b>, which could provide run-time updating of the configuration data. The system configuration manager <b>18</b> could communicate the run-time updated configuration data to the corresponding ECU configuration manager <b>16</b> for the subsequent operation of the ECU <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Note that it has not been specifically stated how the configuration data for each ECU <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> is generated for the system configuration manager <b>18</b>. The configuration data could be generated off-line and stored in the system <b>10</b> for the system configuration manager <b>18</b> to use. For example, an ECU could be reused without any change from one system platform to another system platform because it receives its configuration data from the system configuration manager <b>18</b> at the initialization time of the system <b>10</b>, and this configuration could remain unchanged for the whole mission time. Or, the configuration data could be generated on-line by some intelligent run-time configuration manager, as in the case of system self-configuration in the presence of failures.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The foregoing discussion discloses and describes merely exemplary embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from such discussion and from the accompanying drawings and claims that various changes, modifications and variations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>
