<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to the field of fabrication of microstructures, and, more particularly, to a tool for chemically mechanically polishing substrates, bearing for instance a plurality of dies for forming integrated circuits, wherein the tool is equipped with a slurry delivering unit for delivering slurry onto the surface of a polishing pad of the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In microstructures, such as integrated circuits, a large number of elements, e.g., transistors, capacitors and resistors, are fabricated on a single substrate by depositing semi-conductive, conductive and insulating material layers and patterning those layers by photolithography and etch techniques. Frequently, the problem arises that the patterning of a subsequent material layer is adversely affected by a pronounced topography of the previously formed material layers. Moreover, the fabrication of microstructures often requires the removal of excess material of a previously deposited material layer. For example, individual circuit elements may be electrically connected by means of metal lines that are embedded in a dielectric, thereby forming what is usually referred to as a metallization layer. In modern integrated circuits, a plurality of such metallization layers is typically provided, wherein the layers are stacked on top of each other to maintain the required functionality. The repeated patterning of material layers, however, creates an increasingly non-planar surface topography, which may cause deterioration of subsequent patterning processes, especially for microstructures including features with minimum dimensions in the submicron range, as is the case for sophisticated integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It has thus turned out to be necessary to planarize the surface of the substrate between the formation of specific subsequent layers. A planar surface of the substrate is desirable for various reasons, one of them being the limited optical depth of the focus in photolithography which is used to pattern the material layers of microstructures.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is an appropriate and widely used process to remove excess material and to achieve global planarization of a substrate. In the CMP process, a wafer is mounted on an appropriately formed carrier, a so-called polishing head, and the carrier is moved relative to a polishing pad while the wafer is in contact with the polishing pad. A slurry is supplied to the polishing pad during the CMP process and contains a chemical compound reacting with the material or materials of the layer to be planarized by, for example, converting into a reaction product that may be less stable and easier removed, while the reaction product, such as a metal oxide, is then mechanically removed with abrasives contained in the slurry and/or the polishing pad. To obtain a required removal rate while at the same time achieving a high degree of planarity of the layer, parameters and conditions of the CMP process must be appropriately chosen, thereby considering factors such as construction of the polishing pad, type of slurry, pressure applied to the wafer while moving relative to the polishing pad and the relative velocity between the wafer and the polishing pad. The removal rate further significantly depends on the temperature of the slurry, affected by the amount of friction created by the relative motion of the polishing pad and the wafer, the degree of saturation of the slurry with ablated particles and, in particular, the state of the polishing surface of the polishing pad.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Most polishing pads are formed of a cellular microstructure polymer material having numerous voids which are filled with slurry during operation. A densification of the slurry within the voids occurs due to the absorbed particles that have been removed from the substrate surface and accumulated in the slurry. As a consequence, the removal rate steadily decreases, thereby disadvantageously affecting the reliability of the planarizing process and thus reducing yield and reliability of the completed semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To partly overcome this problem, a so-called pad conditioner is typically used that &#x201c;reconditions&#x201d; the polishing surface of the polishing pad. The pad conditioner includes a conditioning surface that may be comprised of a variety of materials, e.g., diamond that is embedded in a resistant material. In such cases, the exhausted surface of the pad is ablated and/or reworked by the relatively hard material of the pad conditioner once the removal rate is assessed to be too low. In other cases, as in sophisticated CMP apparatus, the pad conditioner is continuously in contact with the polishing pad while the substrate is polished.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In modern integrated circuits, process requirements concerning uniformity of the CMP process are very strict so that the state of the polishing pad has to be maintained as constant as possible over the entire area of a single substrate as well as for the processing of as many substrates as possible. Consequently, the pad conditioners are usually provided with a drive assembly and a control unit that allow the pad conditioner, that is, at least a carrier including the conditioning surface, to be moved with respect to the polishing head and the polishing pad to rework the polishing pad substantially uniformly while avoiding interference with the movement of the polishing head. Therefore, one or more electric motors are typically provided in the conditioner drive assembly to rotate and/or sweep the conditioning surface suitably.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One problem with conventional CMP systems resides in the fact that a wafer removal profile, as well as a wafer removal rate, depends on many factors, e.g., the type of slurry, the slurry thickness, the temperature of the slurry, the pressure applied to the wafer while moving relative to the polishing pad, the relative velocity between the wafer and the polishing pad and the curvature of the wafer. Controlling a conventional CMP system therefore requires complex controlling of multiple parameters. Moreover, the deterioration of one or more of the consumables of a CMP renders it difficult to maintain process stability and to reliably predict an optimum time point for consumable replacement. Generally, replacing the consumables at an early stage significantly contributes to the cost of ownership and a reduced tool availability, whereas a replacement in a very advanced stage of the consumables of a CMP system may jeopardize process stability.</p>

However, respective parts of the other embodiments may be configured accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Generally, the subject matter disclosed herein is based on the principle of controlling a CMP system by locally varying the supply of slurry while polishing a substrate. Hence, a desired slurry distribution can be obtained on a polishing pad of the CMP system. According to one embodiment, the desired slurry distribution is obtained by locally varying the slurry output according to a fixed slurry output program according to which the slurry output is locally varied with time. According to other embodiments, the desired slurry distribution is obtained by measuring one or more parameters and controlling the slurry output in response to the measured at least one parameter. The locally varying slurry output can be obtained by controlling at least one controllably movable slurry outlet. According to other embodiments, the locally varying slurry output can be obtained by any other suitable means, e.g., by a slurry distribution device which has at least two slurry outlets which can be selectively activated to dispense slurry in order to locally vary the slurry output. While the aforementioned embodiments can provide a locally varying slurry output, the local variation of which can vary with time, according to still another embodiment, the slurry distribution device is configured to provide a locally varying but temporally fixed slurry distribution.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preferably, the assemblies for measuring a process parameter are inline measuring assemblies, i.e., the wafer does not need to be taken out of the process line for performing the respective measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The signal paths of the process parameters <b>133</b>, <b>135</b>, <b>137</b>, <b>139</b>, <b>141</b> and the control signals <b>130</b>, <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may be of any appropriate kind, e.g., formed by wire, wireless communication paths, optical communication paths, etc. The signal paths are shown exemplarily in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and have been omitted for the sake of clarity of the drawings in the remaining figures. Further, measuring assemblies are shown only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. However, it should be understood that each of the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> may comprise one or more of the measurement assemblies disclosed herein or one or more other assemblies suitable for providing a process parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A process parameter may be a measured process parameter, as discussed above, or a target process parameter which is to be obtained by appropriately controlling the CMP system, in particular by appropriately controlling the at least one slurry outlet <b>109</b>. An example of such a target process parameter is a predetermined, e.g., an even, slurry distribution over the wafer diameter while polishing. Without restricting the invention to the following discussion, it is believed that such an even slurry distribution over the wafer diameter can be obtained by way of performing experiments or computer simulations for establishing a table relating specific process parameters, such as a wafer profile, a process temperature, a relative speed of the polishing pad <b>102</b> and the polishing head <b>104</b>, a force applied between the polishing head <b>104</b> (wafer <b>107</b>) and polishing pad <b>102</b>, etc., to a radial slurry distribution which has to be established on the polishing pad in front of the polishing head in order to obtain the desired slurry distribution under the polishing head, between the wafer <b>107</b> and the polishing pad <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In accordance with the subject matter disclosed herein, the process parameters have been used to control the movement of the at least one slurry outlet. However, it should be understood that each process parameter or each combination of process parameters can be used not only for controlling the movement of the at least one slurry outlet but also for controlling, e.g., the slurry delivering unit as a whole and in particular for controlling the slurry transport assembly <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, or for controlling any other part of the CMP system. Hence, the control unit <b>125</b> may be configured accordingly. In particular, the control unit <b>125</b> may be further configured to control the slurry transport assembly <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> in response to the at least one process parameter in order to obtain a desired slurry distribution, e.g., an even slurry distribution over the platen radius or the wafer diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The control unit <b>125</b> may further be configured to control any other part of the CMP system. One example is zone pressures <b>135</b> which are established between the polishing pad <b>102</b> and specific zones of the wafer <b>107</b>. Accordingly, the CMP system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> comprises a zone pressure establishing assembly <b>136</b> for establishing zone pressures according to the respective control signals <b>135</b> of the control unit <b>125</b>. The control unit <b>125</b> may be configured to automatically control the movement of the at least one slurry outlet <b>109</b> in response to control signals for controlling other parts of the CMP system. Accordingly, with regard to the above example, the control unit <b>125</b> may be configured to control the movement of the at least one slurry outlet <b>109</b> in response to the zone pressures <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to a further embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a controllably movable slurry distribution device <b>211</b> is coupled to a linear drive assembly <b>220</b> for linearly moving the controllably movable slurry distribution device <b>211</b> over the polish platen <b>101</b>. To this end, the controllably movable slurry distribution device <b>211</b> may be movably mounted on a support (not shown) for guiding the movable slurry distribution device <b>211</b>. The linear drive assembly may be oriented in a radial direction, indicated at <b>221</b>, with respect to the polish platen <b>101</b>, the controllably movable distribution device <b>211</b> being thereby controllably movable in the radial direction <b>221</b>. In other embodiments, the linear drive assembly may be oriented in any other direction which is suitable to move the slurry distribution device over the polish platen such that a desired slurry distribution can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, in still another embodiment, the linear drive assembly <b>220</b> may be attached to a rotational drive assembly <b>214</b> (shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that is configured to rotatably drive the linear drive assembly <b>220</b>. The drive assembly <b>214</b> for rotationally driving the linear drive assembly <b>220</b> may be configured similar to the drive assembly <b>114</b> for rotatably driving the movable distribution device <b>111</b> of the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It should be understood that an embodiment having a distribution device <b>211</b> which is linearly movable can be provided with the rotational drive assembly <b>214</b> or without the rotational drive assembly <b>214</b>. The drive assembly <b>220</b> for linearly moving the slurry distribution device <b>211</b> may be provided in a highly space-efficient manner. The drive assemblies <b>214</b> and <b>220</b> may be configured as the drive assembly <b>114</b> described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b> have only one slurry delivering unit <b>108</b>, a CMP system according to the present disclosure may comprise two or more of the slurry delivering units <b>108</b> acting on a single polishing platen <b>101</b>. Two (or more) slurry delivering units <b>108</b> may distribute the same slurry. Moreover, two or more slurry delivering units <b>108</b> allow for the slurry delivering units <b>108</b> distributing different slurries or different slurry components. In this case, the composition of the slurry on the polishing pad <b>102</b> can be varied over the polishing pad area, in particular in a radial direction of the polishing platen <b>101</b>. For example, an uneven radial concentration profile of different slurry components can be reduced by delivering the slurry components at appropriate positions, in particular appropriate radial positions on the polishing pad <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, showing a CMP system with two slurry delivering units <b>108</b>, each slurry delivering unit <b>108</b> comprises a linearly movable slurry distribution device <b>211</b>, e.g., a slurry distribution device <b>211</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The two slurry delivering units <b>108</b> are arranged in parallel. Alternatively, the two (or more) slurry delivering units may be arranged in a tilted configuration with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a CMP system in accordance with one illustrative embodiment may comprise at least two of the slurry delivering units <b>108</b> and control unit <b>125</b> operable to control the slurry delivering units <b>108</b> so as to distribute different slurry volumes per time unit.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A CMP system in accordance with the present disclosure, in particular of the CMP systems shown in the drawings, may comprise a pad conditioning assembly <b>126</b>, as is exemplarily shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The pad conditioning assembly <b>126</b> may comprise a head <b>127</b> attached to which is a conditioning member <b>128</b> including a conditioning surface which comprises an appropriate material, such as diamond. The conditioning surface may have a specified texture designed to obtain an optimum conditioning effect on the polishing pad <b>102</b>. The head <b>127</b> is coupled to a drive assembly <b>129</b> which is configured to rotate the head <b>127</b> and/or move it radially with respect to the platen <b>101</b>. Moreover, the drive assembly <b>129</b> may be configured so as to provide the head <b>127</b> with any movability required for yielding the appropriate conditioning effect.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a CMP system in accordance with one illustrative embodiment may comprise a slurry delivering unit <b>108</b> having a stationary, i.e., a spatially fixed slurry distribution device <b>311</b>. The stationary slurry distribution device <b>311</b> has at least two spatially fixed slurry outlets <b>309</b> which produce a locally varying supply of slurry <b>110</b>. The temporally fixed but locally varying slurry supply has the advantage of a relatively inexpensive slurry delivering unit <b>108</b>. Except for the slurry delivering unit <b>108</b>, the CMP system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the corresponding parts share the same reference numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As a result, the subject matter disclosed herein provides a system and a method for enhancing the performance of a CMP system or of a process tool chain including a CMP system, since at least one slurry delivering unit configured for a locally varying supply of slurry while polishing said substrate is used to optimize the slurry distribution while polishing. In particular, one or more slurry delivering units may comprise at least one controllably movable slurry outlet. The movable slurry outlet may be implemented by fixing the at least one slurry outlet at a controllably movable slurry distribution device which can be controllably moved above the platen area while polishing. The slurry distribution device is movable linearly and/or rotationally. There can be one or more controllably movable slurry distribution devices, distributing different slurry components and/or slurry volumes above the platen area. While polishing, the movement of the slurry outlet(s) can be controlled and changed automatically, depending on process conditions such as inline wafer removal profile measurement, even slurry distribution over platen radius or wafer diameter, process temperature, minimizing slurry consumption, reducing defects due to uneven slurry distribution over wafer area, and others. Thus, the cost of ownership, due to a more efficient usage of consumables, is reduced while tool availability is enhanced. Using the controllably movable slurry outlet also improves the process stability in that CMP specific variations may be compensated for with the CMP tool.</p>
