<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A communication system is provided that routes a bearer path of a communication session between an originating Node B and a terminating Node B via an X2 interface, bypassing an IMS core network, while continuing to route the signaling path to an IMS network, thereby allowing the IMS network to retain control of the bearer path while avoiding delay, potential for data loss and jitter to the bearer stream, and additional backhaul capacity requirements that result from routing the bearer path between the originating and terminating Node Bs via the IMS core network. In determining whether the bearer path may bypass the IMS core network, the communication system determines whether IMS core network bearer associated services are required for the communication session such that a bearer path of the call will need to be routed to the IMS core network in order to provide such services.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from provisional application Ser. No. 61/088,963, entitled &#x201c;METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ROUTING OF A BEARER PATH IN AN INTERNET PROTOCOL MULTIMEDIA SUBSYSTEM-BASED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,&#x201d; and filed Aug. 14, 2008, which is commonly owned and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems, and more specifically to bearer path routing in an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)-based communication system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In fourth generation communication systems such as a 3GPP LTE (Third Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution) system, a 3GPP2 UMB (Third Generation Partnership Project 2 Ultra Mobile Broadband) system, or a WiMAX system, real time packet data services such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) are expected to be supported using an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) core network and session aware edge/border routers (SARs). As a result, it is planned to route all bearer traffic through the IMS core network and the SARs even when there is no need for IMS core services for a call. However, the routing of all calls through the IMS core network adds delay to each call, enhances the potential for data loss and jitter to the bearer stream, and increases the backhaul capacity requirements of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, a need exists for an improved method and apparatus for propagating bearer data in a fourth generation, IMS-based communication system.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To address the need that exists for an improved method and apparatus for propagating bearer data in a fourth generation, IMS-based communication system, a communication system is provided that routes a bearer path of a communication session between an originating Node B and a terminating Node B via an X2 interface, bypassing an IMS core network, while continuing to route the signaling path to an IMS network, thereby allowing the IMS network to retain control of the bearer path while avoiding delay, potential for data loss and jitter to the bearer stream, and additional backhaul capacity requirements that result from routing the bearer path between the originating and terminating Node Bs via the IMS core network. In determining whether the bearer path may bypass the IMS core network, the communication system determines whether IMS core network bearer associated services are required for the communication session such that a bearer path of the call will need to be routed to the IMS core network in order to provide such services.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Generally, an embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for routing a bearer path in a wireless communication system. The method includes receiving an invitation to a communication session between an originating mobile station M(S) and a terminating MS and determining whether Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) core network bearer associated services are required for the communication session such that a bearer path of the call will need to be routed to the IMS core network in order to provide such services. The method further includes, when the communication session does not require IMS core network bearer associated services that require that a bearer path of the communication session be routed to the IMS core network, routing a bearer path over an interface between a first Node B serving the originating MS and a second Node B serving the terminating MS and, concurrent with routing the bearer path over an interface between the first Node B and the second Node B, routing a signaling path for the communication session between the first Node B and the second Node B via the IMS core network.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for routing a bearer path in a wireless communication system. The method includes routing a bearer path via an X2 tunnel over an X2 interface between a first Node B serving an originating MS and a second Node B serving a terminating MS, determining to reroute the bearer path through an IMS core network, routing the bearer path through the IMS core network, and canceling the X2 tunnel.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for handing off a bearer path in a wireless communication system. The method includes routing a bearer path of a communication session via a first tunnel in a first X2 interface between a first Node B serving an originating MS and a second Node B serving a terminating MS and routing a signaling path of the communication session between the first Node B and the second Node B via an IMS core network. The method further includes determining to handoff the terminating MS from the second Node B to a third Node B, switching the bearer path from the first tunnel to a second tunnel in a second X2 interface between the first Node B and the third Node B, and modifying an S1 interface between the third Node B and a gateway such that the signaling path, but not the bearer path, is routed over the S1 interface.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Turning now to the drawings, the present invention may be more fully described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a wireless communication system <b>100</b> in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. Communication system <b>100</b> includes multiple mobile stations (MSs) <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> (two shown), for example but not limited to a cellular telephone, a radiotelephone, or a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), personal computer (PC), or laptop computer equipped for wireless communications. In various radio technologies, a mobile station (MS) such as MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b> may be referred to as a user equipment (UE), a subscriber station (SS), an access terminal (AT), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Communication system <b>100</b> further includes multiple Radio Access Networks (RANs) <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> (three shown), preferably evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Networks (E-UTRANs), that each provides wireless communication services to MSs, such as MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b>, located in a coverage area of the RANs via a respective air interface <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>109</b>.

Each air interface <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>109</b> further includes a reverse link that includes at least one reverse link traffic channel, reverse link common and dedicated signaling channels, and an access channel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each RAN <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> includes a respective Node B, preferably an evolved Node B (eNode B) <b>112</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>132</b>. Node Bs <b>112</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>132</b> may communicate directly with each other via an X2 interface, such as X2 interface <b>116</b> between Node Bs <b>112</b> and <b>122</b> and X2 interface <b>118</b> between Node Bs <b>112</b> and <b>132</b>, that provides both control and user plane signaling. Communication system <b>100</b> further includes an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) <b>140</b> that includes a gateway <b>142</b>, preferably a Mobility Management Entity and System Architecture Evolution (MME/SAE) gateway that is coupled to each of Node Bs <b>112</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>132</b> via a respective S1 interface <b>114</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>134</b>. For purposes of the present description, gateway <b>142</b> includes an MME, a Serving Gateway (S-GW), and a Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW); however, in other embodiments of the present invention one or more of the MME, S-GW, and P-GW may be implemented in a network entity separate from, and in communication with, the others.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment of the present invention, both MS <b>102</b> and MS <b>106</b> may be in communication with a same RAN, such as RAN <b>110</b>, and a corresponding Node B, such as Node B <b>112</b>. In another embodiment of the present invention, each of MS <b>102</b> and MS <b>106</b> may be in communication with a different RAN, such as RANs <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, and their respective Node Bs <b>112</b> and <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Communication system <b>100</b> further includes an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) <b>150</b> and a Session Border Controller (SBC) <b>170</b> that each are in communication with gateway <b>142</b> via an Internet Protocol (IP)-based data network <b>144</b>. IMS <b>150</b> comprises an IMS core network <b>152</b> and multiple application servers <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> (three shown), such as a SIP server and multiple application servers. IMS core network <b>152</b> includes a Call Session Control Function (CSCF) <b>156</b> in communication with a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) <b>154</b>. Together, RANs <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>130</b>, EPC <b>140</b>, data network <b>144</b>, IMS <b>150</b>, and SBC <b>170</b> collectively may be referred to as a network of communication system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As is known in the art, the CSCF implements one or more of a Proxy CSCF (P-CSCF), a Serving CSCF (S-CSCF), and an Interrogating CSCF (I-CSCF). The CSCF serves as a centralized routing engine, policy manager, and policy enforcement point to facilitate the delivery of multiple real-time applications using IP transport. It is application-aware and uses dynamic session information to manage network resources (feature servers, media gateways, and edge devices) and to provide advance allocation of these resources depending on the application and user context. The I-CSCF is the contact point within an operator's network for all connections destined for a user of that network, or for a roaming user currently located within that network's service area. The S-CSCF is responsible for identifying the user's service privileges, selecting access to an application server coupled to the IMS network, and providing access to those servers. The P-CSCF is the SIP signaling contact point in the IMS core network for an MS, such as MSs <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. The P-CSCF is responsible for forwarding Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) registration messages from a subscriber's endpoint, that is, for forwarding call set-up requests and responses to the S-CSCF. P-CSCF maintains a mapping between a logical subscriber SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) address and an MS IP (Internet Protocol) address and a security association for both authentication and confidentiality. Unless otherwise specified herein, the functions performed by IMS <b>150</b> preferably are performed by CSCF <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram of an MS <b>200</b>, such as MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b>, is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. MS <b>200</b> includes a processor <b>202</b>, such as one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), combinations thereof or such other devices known to those having ordinary skill in the art, which processor is configured to execute the functions described herein as being executed by MS <b>200</b>. MS <b>200</b> further includes an at least one memory device <b>204</b>, such as random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or read only memory (ROM) or equivalents thereof, that is coupled to the processor and that maintains data and programs that may be executed by the associated processor and that allows the UE to perform all functions necessary to operate in communication system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a block diagram of gateway <b>142</b> is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Gateway <b>142</b> includes a processor <b>302</b>, such as one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), combinations thereof or such other devices known to those having ordinary skill in the art, which processor is configured to execute the functions described herein as being executed by the feature server. Gateway <b>142</b> further include an at least one memory device <b>304</b> that may comprise random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or read only memory (ROM) or equivalents thereof, that maintain data and programs that may be executed by the associated processor and that allow the feature server to perform all functions necessary to operate in communication system <b>100</b>. The at least one memory device <b>304</b> further maintains a tunnel management table, which table includes a tunnel identifier (TEIDs) assigned by the gateway in association with each tunnel to a Node B served by the gateway and further maps logical radio channel path identifiers, that is, radio bearer identifiers (RBIDs), that identify radio paths to MSs served by the gateway, such as MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b>, to the TEIDs. Preferably, gateway <b>142</b> is implemented by processor <b>302</b> based on programs and data maintained by at least one memory device <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The functionality described herein as being performed by MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b> and by gateway <b>142</b> is implemented with or in software programs and instructions stored in the respective at least one memory device <b>204</b>, <b>304</b> of the MSs and gateway and executed by a processor <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> of the MSs and gateway. One of ordinary skill in the art realizes, however, that the embodiments of the present invention alternatively may be implemented in hardware, for example, integrated circuits (ICs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and the like, such as ASICs implemented in one or more of the MSs and gateway. Based on the present disclosure, one skilled in the art will be readily capable of producing and implementing such software and/or hardware without undue experimentation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, communication system <b>100</b> is a 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) LTE (Long Term Evolution) communication system that provides packet data communication services to subscribers serviced by the network; however, other applicable packet data systems include, but are not limited to, 3GPP2 UMB and WiMAX packet data systems and any one of a variety of wireless packet data communication systems that support multimedia packet data-based communication sessions. To ensure compatibility, radio system parameters and call processing procedures are specified by the standards, including call processing steps that are executed by an MS and a RAN or other access network serving the MS and between the RAN or other access network and associated infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In order to avoid the data delays associated with routing a bearer path through an IMS network and to minimize the potential for data loss and jitter to a bearer stream, and further to minimize the requirements for backhaul capacity in the system, communication system <b>100</b> provides for a routing of bearer traffic over an X2 interface between originating and terminating Node Bs, bypassing the IMS network, when IMS core network services are not required by a communication session. Meanwhile signaling still is routed to the IMS network, thereby allowing the IMS network to maintain control over the communication session.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a signal flow diagram <b>400</b> is provided that depicts a routing of a bearer path between an originating MS, such as MS <b>102</b>, and a terminating MS, such as MS <b>106</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Signal flow diagram <b>400</b> begins when a first, originating MS, such as MS <b>102</b>, attempts to set up a communication session with a second, terminating MS, such as MS <b>106</b>, via IMS <b>150</b>. MS <b>102</b> initiates the communication session by conveying a first session invitation, preferably a first Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Invite, to MS <b>106</b>. More particularly, originating MS <b>102</b> conveys <b>402</b> the session invitation to IMS <b>150</b>, and in particular the SIP server, via a first Node B serving the MS, that is, Node B <b>112</b>, and gateway <b>142</b>, which session invitation invites the terminating MS <b>106</b> to participate in a call. The session invitation includes a callee (calling party) identifier, such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address, associated with the calling party, that is, MS <b>102</b>, and a destination identifier, such as a Uniform Resource Indicator (URI), associated with the terminating party, that is, MS <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In response to receiving the session invitation, IMS <b>150</b> determines a called party identifier, preferably an IP address, for MS <b>106</b> based on the destination identifier, stores <b>404</b> at least a portion of the session invitation, including the calling party identifier and the called party identifier, and conveys <b>406</b> a second session invitation to MS <b>106</b> via a second Node B serving MS <b>106</b>. As referred to herein, MS <b>102</b>, RAN <b>110</b>, and Node B <b>112</b> are on an originating side of the call and may be referred to herein an originating MS, RAN, and Node B. Similarly, MS <b>106</b>, and a RAN and Node B serving MS <b>106</b>, are on a terminating side of the call and may be referred to herein as a terminating MS, RAN, and Node B. It may be noted that in one embodiment of the present invention, MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b> may be served by a same RAN and Node B, that is, RAN <b>110</b> and Node B <b>112</b>, in which event RAN <b>110</b> and Node B <b>112</b> serve as both the originating and the terminating RAN and Node B. However, in another embodiment of the present invention, MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b> may be served by different RANs and Node Bs, for example, where MS <b>102</b> is served by RAN <b>110</b> and Node B <b>112</b> while MS <b>106</b> is served by RAN <b>120</b> and Node B <b>122</b>, in which event RAN <b>120</b> and Node B <b>122</b> are the terminating RAN and Node B.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In response to receiving the session invitation, terminating MS <b>106</b> generates a session description protocol (SDP) proposal. As is known in the art, an SDP proposal identifies the parties to the session and identifies the sending MS's capabilities by proposing parameters for participating in the session, for example, a session name and purpose, a type of media involved (video, audio, etc.), a format of the media, a transport protocol, and information needed to receive the media, such as addresses, ports, media formats, and the like. In response to receiving the session invitation from IMS <b>150</b> and when a user of terminating MS <b>106</b> then answers the call, MS <b>106</b> notifies <b>408</b> originating MS <b>102</b> that the call has been answered by conveying a SIP 200 OK message back to MS <b>102</b> via the terminating Node B, gateway <b>142</b>, IMS <b>150</b>, and originating Node B, which SIP 200 OK message includes the SDP proposal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Based on the session invitation and the SDP proposal included in the SIP 200 OK message, IMS <b>150</b> determines <b>410</b> whether any IMS core network bearer associated services are needed for the call, such as PSTN termination, transcoding, CALEA, E911, three-way calling, voice mail, and packet/bit metering for billing. IMS <b>150</b> further obtains <b>412</b> routing information, such as IP addresses, of the gateways serving originating MS <b>102</b> and terminating MS <b>106</b> based on the session invitation received from MS <b>102</b> and the SIP 200 OK message received from MS <b>106</b> and/or from HSS <b>154</b> based on location information, such as a Node B, serving each MS and a corresponding gateway serving each Node B, which location and serving gateway information is maintained by the HSS.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When IMS <b>150</b> determines <b>410</b> that IMS core network bearer associated services are needed for the communication session such that a bearer path of the call will need to be routed to IMS core network <b>152</b> in order to provide such services, for example, PSTN termination, transcoding, CALEA, E911, three-way calling, voice mail, and packet/bit metering for billing, then the IMS routes the call through the IMS system in accordance with well known techniques. However, when IMS <b>150</b> determines that the communication session does not require IMS core network bearer associated services that require a routing of a bearer path of the communication session to IMS core network <b>152</b>, then communication system <b>100</b> optimizes the bearer path between originating MS <b>102</b> and terminating MS <b>106</b>, and more particularly between originating Node B <b>112</b> and terminating Node B <b>122</b>, by routing the bearer path directly between the originating and terminating Node Bs, bypassing IMS <b>150</b>. Meanwhile, the signaling path between the originating and terminating Node Bs will continue to be routed through IMS <b>150</b>. For example, since signaling information is still being sent to IMS core network <b>152</b>, IMS core network services that use signaling information only can still be supported when the bearer path bypasses IMS <b>150</b>, such as billing based on call hold times and call waiting indication. Thus, the delay and potential for data loss and jitter resulting from routing the bearer stream through IMS <b>150</b> may be avoided and the backhaul capacity requirements of the system are reduced relative to the prior art while the IMS core is able to maintain control of the call and can connect to the bearer path if a need arises.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">More particularly, in response to determining that IMS core network services are not needed for the call, IMS <b>150</b> instructs <b>414</b> gateway <b>142</b> to determine whether user bearer paths for both the originating MS <b>102</b> and the terminating MS <b>106</b> are handled by a same gateway, by conveying a first Bearer Optimization Request to the gateway. The Bearer Optimization Request includes routing information, preferably IP addresses, for each of MS <b>102</b> and MS <b>106</b>. In response to receiving the Bearer Optimization Request, gateway <b>142</b> determines <b>416</b> whether user bearer paths for both MS <b>102</b> and MS <b>106</b> are handled by the same gateway, that is, gateway <b>142</b>. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, gateway <b>142</b> may check the tunnel management table maintained in the at least one memory device <b>304</b> of the gateway to determine whether user bearer paths for both the originating and terminating Node Bs, respectively serving each of MS <b>102</b> and MS <b>106</b>, are handled by the same gateway <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In response to determining that user bearer paths for both MS <b>102</b> and MS <b>106</b> are handled by gateway <b>142</b>, the gateway executes a bearer optimization process. That is, gateway <b>142</b> assigns a flow identifier (flow ID) to a dialogue being set up between the originating and terminating MSs <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> and conveys <b>418</b> a second Bearer Optimization Request to originating Node B <b>112</b>. The second Bearer Optimization Request includes the flow ID, a first tunnel identifier (TEID) that is associated with a pre-existing tunnel between the gateway and originating Node B <b>112</b> (an originating TEID), and a second TEID that is associated with a pre-existing tunnel between the gateway and the terminating Node B (terminating TEID), and routing information, such as an IP address, associated with the terminating Node B.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In response to receiving the second Bearer Optimization Request and based on the IP address associated with the terminating Node B, originating Node B <b>112</b> determines <b>418</b> whether both originating MS <b>102</b> and terminating MS <b>106</b> are under a same Node B. That is, Node B <b>112</b> determines whether the IP address associated with the terminating Node B matches Node B <b>112</b>'s own IP address. In one embodiment of the present invention, where MS <b>102</b> and MS <b>106</b> are both served by a same Node B, that is Node B <b>112</b>, then the two IP addresses should match and, in response, originating Node B <b>112</b> bridges <b>420</b>, <b>428</b> logical radio channel paths of each of originating and terminating MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b> by linking, or bridging, logical radio channel path identifiers, that is, radio bearer identifiers (RBIDs), associated with the TEIDs of the originating and terminating Node Bs (that is, Node B <b>112</b>), and with each of MS <b>102</b> and <b>106</b>, thereby internally (to the Node B) bridging the bearer paths to each of MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the two IP addresses do not match, then originating Node B <b>112</b> sets up <b>428</b> an X2 bearer tunnel with the terminating Node B, that is, Node B <b>122</b>. Preferably, originating Node B <b>112</b> sets up the tunnel by conveying <b>424</b> a request to set up an X2 bearer tunnel, preferably an X2 Create Bearer Request, to terminating Node B <b>122</b> via X2 interface <b>116</b>, which request includes the flow ID, the originating TEID, and the terminating TEID. In response to receiving the X2 bearer tunnel set up request, terminating Node B <b>122</b> conveys <b>426</b> a response to the request, preferably an X2 Create Bearer Response, that includes the flow ID and the terminating TEID. Based on the exchanged identifiers, Node Bs <b>112</b> and <b>122</b> set up <b>428</b> an X2 bearer tunnel for data communications between MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b> via X2 interface <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Originating Node B <b>112</b> informs <b>430</b> gateway <b>142</b> of the X2 tunnel set up between Node Bs <b>112</b> and <b>122</b>, or the bridging of the radio channel paths within Node B <b>112</b>, by conveying a first Bearer Optimization Response to the gateway. In response to being informed of the set up of the X2 tunnel or the bridging of radio channel paths, gateway <b>142</b> informs <b>432</b> IMS <b>150</b> of the X2 tunnel set up, or the bridging of the radio channel paths, by conveying a second Bearer Optimization Response to IMS <b>150</b>. IMS <b>150</b> then acknowledges the message and confirms <b>434</b> being bypassed in the bearer path between Node B <b>112</b> and Node B <b>122</b> by conveying a Bearer Optimization Confirmation to gateway <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Gateway <b>142</b> and each of the originating and terminating Node Bs, that is, Node Bs <b>112</b> and <b>122</b> if they are different Node Bs, then modify the existing S1 tunnels <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> between the Node Bs and the gateway to permit signaling to continue to be routed through IMS <b>150</b> while the bearer path is rerouted to bypass IMS <b>150</b>. Preferably, gateway <b>142</b> instructs <b>436</b> originating Node B <b>112</b> to no longer tunnel bearer data associated with a communication session between MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b> to the gateway (while continuing to tunnel signaling associated with the communication session to the gateway via S1 tunnel <b>114</b>) by conveying a first S1 Bearer Request to the Node B. In response to receiving the first S1 Bearer Request, Node B <b>112</b> modifies <b>444</b> S1 tunnel <b>114</b> with gateway <b>142</b> accordingly and confirms <b>438</b> the modification of the tunnel by conveying a first S1 Bearer Response back to gateway <b>142</b>. Similarly, gateway <b>142</b> instructs <b>440</b> the terminating Node B, such as Node B <b>122</b>, to no longer tunnel bearer data associated with a communication session between MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b> to the gateway (while continuing to tunnel signaling associated with the communication session to the gateway via S1 tunnel <b>124</b>) by conveying a second S1 Bearer Request to the terminating Node B. In response to receiving the S1 Bearer Request, the terminating Node B modifies <b>444</b> its S1 tunnel, such as S1 tunnel <b>124</b>, with gateway <b>142</b> accordingly and confirms <b>442</b> the modification by conveying a second S1 Bearer Response back to gateway <b>142</b>. Signal flow diagram <b>400</b> then ends.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Communication system <b>100</b> further provides for IMS <b>150</b> to reroute, to the IMS, a bearer path that is currently routed over an intra- or inter-Node B interface (bypassing IMS <b>150</b>) and to cancel the intra- or inter-Node B bearer path. For example, IMS <b>150</b> may decide to return bring back the bearer path in order to add IMS services to a communication session, such as interception services. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a signal flow diagram <b>500</b> is provided that depicts a process whereby IMS <b>150</b> brings the bearer path back to the IMS in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Signal flow diagram <b>500</b> begins when an inter-Node B X2 tunnel has already been established <b>502</b> between an originating Node B, such as Node B <b>112</b>, and a terminating Node B, such as Node B <b>122</b>, via an intervening X2 interface, that is, X2 interface <b>116</b>. IMS <b>150</b> then determines <b>503</b> to reroute the bearer path through the IMS <b>150</b> network and initiates the rerouting of the bearer path by instructing <b>504</b> gateway <b>142</b> to cancel the X2 tunnel between originating Node B <b>112</b> and terminating Node B <b>122</b> and to reroute the bearer path back to IMS <b>150</b>. Preferably IMS <b>150</b> instructs the gateway to cancel the X2 tunnel and to reroute the bearer path back to the IMS by conveying a first Bearer Optimization Cancel message that includes the flow ID associated with the communication session between MS <b>102</b> and MS <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In response to receiving the instruction to cancel the X2 tunnel from IMS <b>150</b>, gateway <b>142</b> instructs <b>506</b> originating Node B <b>112</b> to cancel the X2 tunnel by conveying, to the Node B, a second Bearer Optimization Cancel message that includes the flow ID. In conveying the second Bearer Optimization Cancel message, gateway <b>142</b> may just forward the first Bearer Optimization Cancel message. In response to receiving the instruction to cancel the X2 tunnel from gateway <b>142</b>, originating Node B <b>112</b> requests <b>508</b> of gateway <b>142</b>, preferably by conveying a first Update Bearer Request, that the modification of the S1 bearer tunnel between the originating Node B and the gateway be undone so that the bearer path may be rerouted to gateway <b>142</b> over S1 interface <b>114</b>, and via the gateway to IMS <b>150</b>. Gateway <b>142</b> acknowledges <b>510</b> receipt of the request to undo the modification of the bearer tunnel by conveying a first Update Bearer Response to Node B <b>112</b>, and the Node B and gateway modify <b>512</b> the S1 tunnel between the Node B and the gateway to tunnel the bearer path over S1 tunnel <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further in response to receiving the instruction to cancel the X2 tunnel from gateway <b>142</b>, originating Node B <b>112</b> requests <b>514</b> that terminating Node B <b>122</b> cancel the X2 tunnel between the originating Node B and the terminating Node B, preferably by conveying an X2 Delete Bearer Request to the terminating Node B. In response to receiving the request to cancel the X2 tunnel, terminating Node B <b>122</b> requests <b>516</b> of gateway <b>142</b>, preferably by conveying a second Update Bearer Request, that the modification of the S1 bearer tunnel between the terminating Node B and the gateway be undone so that the bearer path may be rerouted to gateway <b>142</b> over S1 interface <b>124</b>, and via the gateway to IMS <b>150</b>. Gateway <b>142</b> acknowledges <b>518</b> receipt of the request to undo the modification of the bearer tunnel by conveying a second Update Bearer Response to Node B <b>112</b>, and the Node B and gateway modify <b>520</b> the S1 tunnel between the Node B and the gateway to tunnel the bearer path over S1 interface <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In response to the modification of the S1 bearer tunnel between terminating Node B <b>122</b> and gateway <b>142</b>, that is, to the rerouting of the bearer path over S1 interface <b>124</b>, terminating Node B <b>122</b> confirms <b>522</b> to originating Node B <b>112</b> that the X2 tunnel may be torn down by conveying an X2 Delete Bearer Response to the originating Node B. Originating Node B <b>122</b> and terminating Node B <b>112</b> then tear down <b>524</b> the X2 tunnel that they had set up for the communication session between originating MS <b>102</b> and terminating MS <b>106</b>. Further, in response to receiving the X2 Delete Bearer Response from terminating Node B <b>122</b>, originating Node B <b>112</b> confirms <b>526</b> to gateway <b>142</b> that the X2 tunnel has been torn down and that the bearer path is being rerouted over S1 interfaces <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> by conveying a first Bearer Optimization Confirm message to gateway <b>142</b>. In turn, in response to receiving the first Bearer Optimization Confirm message, gateway <b>142</b> informs IMS <b>150</b> that the bearer path has been rerouted back to the IMS by conveying a second Bearer Optimization Confirm message to IMS <b>150</b>. Logic flow <b>500</b> then ends.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">By routing a bearer path between originating Node B <b>112</b> and terminating Node B <b>122</b> via X2 interface <b>116</b> and bypassing IMS core network <b>152</b>, while continuing to route the signaling path to IMS network <b>150</b>, communication system <b>100</b> avoids delay, potential for data loss and jitter to the bearer stream, and additional backhaul capacity requirements that result from routing the bearer path between the originating and terminating Node Bs via the IMS core network while allowing the IMS network to retain control of the bearer path. In order to determine whether the bearer path may bypass the IMS core network, communication system <b>100</b> determines whether IMS core network bearer associated services are required for the communication session such that a bearer path of the call will need to be routed to the IMS core network in order to provide such services. Communication system <b>100</b> then may route the bearer path over the X2 interface, bypassing the IMS core network, when the communication session does not require such IMS core network bearer associated services.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Communication system <b>100</b> further provides for a handoff of an inter-Node B bearer path wherein IMS <b>150</b> continues to be bypassed by the bearer path. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a signal flow diagram <b>600</b> is provided that depicts a handoff of the bearer path in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Signal flow diagram <b>600</b> begins when a first, originating MS <b>102</b> and a second, terminating MS <b>106</b> are engaged in a communication session wherein bearer data is exchanged <b>602</b> between a first, originating Node B, such as Node B <b>112</b>, and a second, terminating Node B, such as Node B <b>122</b>, via a first X2 tunnel over a first X2 interface, such as X2 interface <b>116</b>. Concurrent with the bearer path being routed over the first X2 tunnel, a signaling path for the communication session is routed between Node Bs <b>112</b> and <b>122</b> via IMS <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At some point during the communication session, terminating MS <b>106</b> roams to a coverage area of a target terminating Node B, such as Node B <b>132</b>. As a result, a decision is made to handoff the target MS <b>106</b> from the source terminating Node B, that is, Node B <b>122</b>, to the target terminating Node B, that is, Node B <b>132</b>. Assuming the handoff is MS-initiated, terminating MS <b>106</b> requests of the Node B serving the MS, that is, source terminating Node B <b>122</b>, that the MS be handed off to the third, target terminating Node B <b>132</b> by conveying a Handover Request to the source terminating Node B <b>122</b>. However, in other embodiments of the invention, the handoff may be network-initiated and may be based on air interface measurements made by either the MS or the network, as the basis for the handoff and the device initiating the handoff are not critical to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In response to receiving the handover request, source terminating Node B <b>122</b> requests <b>604</b> a handoff of MS <b>106</b> to target terminating Node B <b>132</b>, preferably by conveying a Handover Request to the target terminating Node B. The Handover Request includes all relevant handoff information, such as identifiers of the MS and the target terminating Node B, a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) context, and so on. In response to receiving the Handover Request, target terminating Node B <b>132</b> sets up connections to support the MS <b>106</b>'s packet data communication session and conveys <b>606</b> a Handover Request ACK message back to source terminating Node B <b>122</b>, which message includes information for establishment of the new radio link at the target terminating Node B, such as radio channels allocated to the MS at the target terminating Node B. Source terminating Node B <b>122</b> then instructs MS <b>106</b> to move to the radio channels allocated to the MS at target terminating Node B <b>132</b> by conveying a Handover Command message to the MS.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Terminating MS <b>106</b> then tunes to the indicated radio channels at target terminating Node B <b>132</b> and informs source terminating Node B <b>132</b> of the success of the handover by conveying a Handover Confirmation message to the source terminating Node B <b>132</b>. Source terminating Node B forwards the Handover Confirmation message to target terminating Node B <b>132</b> and the target terminating Node B informs <b>610</b> gateway <b>132</b> that it has established a connection with MS <b>106</b> and initiates a bearer path switch by conveying a conveying a Handover Complete message to the gateway <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As part of the handoff, the bearer path for the communication session is being switched from the first X2 interface and X2 tunnel to a second X2 tunnel over a second X2 interface <b>118</b> between originating Node B <b>112</b> and target terminating Node B <b>132</b>. Meanwhile the signaling path will continue to be routed though IMS <b>150</b>. That is, in response to being informed that target terminating Node B <b>132</b> has acquired terminating MS <b>106</b>, gateway <b>142</b> negotiates <b>612</b> a modification of an S1 bearer tunnel between the gateway and target terminating Node B <b>132</b>, as the bearer path for MS <b>106</b> will not be routed over S1 interface <b>134</b> between the gateway and target terminating Node B while the signaling path will be routed over the S1 interface. Gateway <b>142</b> conveys <b>614</b> a Bearer Optimization Request to originating Node B <b>112</b>, which Bearer Optimization Request includes a flow identifier (flow ID) associated with the communication session, a tunnel identifier (TEID) that is associated with the tunnel between the gateway and originating Node B <b>112</b> (an originating TEID), a TEID that is associated with a pre-existing tunnel between the gateway and target terminating Node B <b>132</b> (target terminating TEID), and an IP address associated with the target terminating Node B.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Originating Node B <b>112</b> then sets up <b>622</b> an X2 bearer tunnel with the target terminating Node B <b>132</b>. Preferably, originating Node B <b>112</b> sets up the tunnel by conveying <b>616</b> a request to set up an X2 bearer tunnel, preferably an X2 Create Bearer Request, to target terminating Node B <b>132</b>, which request includes the flow ID associated with the communication session, the originating TEID, and the target terminating TEID. In response to receiving the X2 bearer tunnel set up request, target terminating Node B <b>132</b> conveys <b>618</b> a response to the request, preferably an X2 Create Bearer Response, that includes the flow ID and the terminating TEID. Based on the exchanged identifiers, Node Bs <b>112</b> and <b>132</b> set up <b>622</b> the second X2 bearer tunnel over X2 interface <b>118</b> for data communications between MSs <b>102</b> and <b>106</b>. Originating Node B <b>112</b> then conveys data to MS <b>106</b> via each of the first X2 tunnel existing with source terminating Node B <b>112</b> and the second X2 tunnel set up with target terminating Node B <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Originating Node B <b>112</b> further informs <b>620</b> gateway <b>142</b> of the X2 tunnel set up between Node Bs <b>112</b> and <b>132</b> by conveying a Bearer Optimization Response to the gateway. In response to being informed of the set up of the X2 tunnel, gateway <b>142</b> initiates <b>624</b> a switch of the bearer path from the X2 tunnel between originating Node B <b>112</b> and source terminating Node B <b>122</b> to the X2 tunnel between originating Node B <b>112</b> and target terminating Node B <b>132</b>, by conveying a Handover Complete ACK message to target terminating Node B <b>132</b>. In response to receiving the Handover Complete ACK message, target terminating Node B <b>132</b> conveys a release resource message to source terminating Node B <b>122</b> and the source terminating Node B flushes its downlink data buffer of any data stored for retransmissions to MS <b>106</b>. However, any in-transit data packets received by source terminating Node B <b>122</b> still are forwarded to MS <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In response to receiving the release resource message, source terminating Node B <b>122</b> releases all resources allocated to MS <b>106</b> and instructs <b>628</b> originating Node B <b>112</b> to cancel the X2 tunnel between the originating Node B and source terminating Node B <b>122</b>, preferably by conveying an X2 Delete Bearer Request to the originating Node B. Originating Node B <b>112</b> acknowledges <b>630</b> receipt of the request to cancel the X2 tunnel by conveying an X2 Delete Bearer Request to source terminating Node B <b>122</b>, and the originating Node B and the source terminating Node B and tear down <b>632</b> the X2 bearer tunnel between them. Signal flow <b>600</b> then ends.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">By providing for a handing off of a bearer path from one X2 interface to another X2 interface when a terminating MS is handed off from one terminating Node B to another terminating Node B, communication system <b>100</b> maintains a routing of a bearer path between originating and terminating MSs that bypasses an IMS core network even when a communication session is handed off. Meanwhile, the signaling path continues to routed to the IMS network, allowing the IMS network to retain control of the bearer path.</p>
