<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a wearable action-assist device and a method and program for controlling a wearable action-assist device which assists or executes an action of the wearer by substituting for the wearer. More particularly, the present invention relates to a wearable action-assist device and a method and program for controlling a wearable action-assist device which can suppress the sense of incongruity given to the wearer when controlling the wearable action-assist device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many cases, it is difficult for physically handicapped or elderly people to perform an operation which can be performed easily by a healthy person.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Until today, various action-assist devices have been developed and put in practical use for such people. The action-assist devices may include a wheelchair or a care bed on which the user rides and operates a switch to drive an actuator, such as a motor, so as to assist the insufficient power. The action-assist devices may also include a wearable device which is worn by the human being and assists power needed for operation of the device based on the wearer's intention.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is called a wearable action-assist device that can be worn by the wearer can generate a required power at any time based on the wearer's intention and a care worker is not needed. Thus, the wearable action-assist device is very useful for rehabilitation of injured or sick people and care of physically disabled persons, elderly people, etc. and its utilization is expected to grow.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There has been proposed such a wearable action-assist device in which a myoelectricity signal accompanied with a wearer's muscular line activity is detected, and an actuator is driven based on the detection result. In this wearable action-assist device, the actuator is controlled optionally according to the wearer's intention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">See the non-patent literature 1 (Takao Nakai, Suwoong Lee, Hiroaki Kawamoto and Yoshiyuki Sankai, &#x201c;Development of Power Assistive Leg for Walking Aid using EMG and Linux&#x201d;, Second Asian Symposium on Industrial Automation and Robotics, BITECH, Bangkok, Thailand, May 17-18, 2001).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the meantime there is a problem in a wearable action-assist device in that, if the timing which gives the wearer the power for assistance does not harmonize with a motion of the wearer, the wearer's action becomes awkward and a sense of incongruity is given to the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is known that, in order to harmonize the timing of power application with the motion of the wearer, it is necessary to make the timing of power application earlier than the motion of the wearer by a minute time.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in the wearable action-assist device of the non-patent literature 1, the processing for causing an actuator to generate power is started after the myoelectricity signal from the wearer is detected, and there is a possibility that the timing of power application later than the motion of the wearer may give the wearer a remarkable sense of incongruity.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To avoid the problem, a conventional device is proposed in which a drive control of an actuator is carried out in the following manner. The human being's action is classified into a plurality of patterns (tasks) and each task is divided into a plurality of predetermined minimum action units (phases), and a predetermined amount of current is supplied to the actuator for every phase.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">See the non-patent literature 2 (&#x201c;Predictive Control Estimating Operator's Intention for Stepping-up Motion by Exo-Skeleton Type Power Assist System HAL&#x201d;, Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE/RSJ and International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, Maui, Hi., Oct. 29-Nov. 3, 2001, pp. 1578-1583), and the non-patent literature 3 (Hideo Lee and Yoshiyuki Sankai, &#x201c;Power Assist Control of Walking Aid by HAL Based on Phase Sequence and EMG&#x201d;, the collection (2001) of academic lecture meeting drafts of the 19th Robotics Society of Japan).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the wearable action-assist devices of the non-patent literatures 2 and 3, a phase of a wearer's task is estimated based on a physical quantity, such as a joint angle, which is detected from the wearer, and an actuator is controlled according to the estimated phase (autonomous control), in order to reduce the sense of incongruity accompanied with the delay of the timing of power application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, the control systems of the wearable action-assist devices of the above-mentioned non-patent literatures 2 and 3 are provided to depend on the autonomous control, and if an unexpected change to the action, such as a stumble, occurs, it is difficult to smoothly perform switching to a phase of a corresponding task. And there is a possibility that a remarkable sense of incongruity may be given to the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a wearable action-assist device and a method and program for controlling a wearable action-assist device in which the above-mentioned problems are eliminated and the sense of incongruity given to the wearer can be suppressed as much as possible.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Effects of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to this invention, the myoelectricity signal is acquired from the biosignal, and the nerve transfer signal which precedes with it or is located in the head part of the myoelectricity signal is acquired. The acquired nerve transfer signal is used as a signal (trigger signal) for stating the driving of the actuator, the actuator can be operated promptly when the current supply to the actuator is started. For this reason, it is possible to provide a smooth, comfortable operation which does not feel the delay at the time of starting of the wearable action-assist device.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to this invention, the optional command signal for causing the actuator to generate the power according to the wearer's intention, and the autonomous command signal for causing the actuator to generate the power according to the phase of the task estimated by the comparison of the detected physical quantity and the standard parameter stored in the database are combined. The starting of the actuator can be carried out quickly, and the optional operation can be performed smoothly and comfortably.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to this invention, by controlling the hybrid ratio of the optional command signal and the autonomous command signal, no delay of the starting of power assistance arises and the optimal assistance to the wearer's muscular power can be performed. If the hybrid ratio stored in the database is read out for every phase, the hybrid ratio can be changed automatically. Thereby, a more smooth action can be carried out by using the hybrid ratio suitable for each operation.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to this invention, the total current of the pulse current generated according to the nerve transfer signal and the current generated so that it is substantially proportional to the myoelectricity signal is supplied to the actuator, and the operation of the actuator is started by the supply of the pulse current. Therefore, the delay of the start of the driving of the actuator can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the pulse current or the total current is less than the current that can start the driving of the actuator, the pulse current or the total current is amplified so that it is above the actuator drive starting current. It is possible to make the amplified pulse current correctly respond to the nerve transfer signal when the driving of the actuator is started.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to this invention, when the wearer operates by reflexes, the current for driving the actuator in an opposite direction of the operation concerned for a predetermined time is supplied, and, after the predetermined time, the current for driving the actuator in a direction towards the operation is supplied. Thus, the wearer's operation can be made smooth using the wearer's reflexes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to this invention, the actuator is caused to generate the power which meets the power assist rate according to the phase of the task estimated by comparing the physical quantity with the standard parameter. It is possible to give the optimal power to another wearer of a different physical strength, and the power assistance to the wearer can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the wearable action-assist device of this invention having the above features is used, wearers having no sufficient muscular power, like physically handicapped persons or elderly people, are allowed to smoothly and comfortably perform a physical action which would be difficult to perform without the action-assist device. As for people who must wear a heavy protector in order to perform dangerous work, like the processing of an explosive, the wearable action-assist device of this invention can be used to work lightly as if the heavy protector was not worn.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0090">A description will now be given of an embodiment of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">[1] First Embodiment</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(A) Composition of Wearable Action-Assist Device</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0091">The wearable action-assist device of the first embodiment comprises an action-assist tool having an actuator, a biosignal sensor which detects a wearer's biosignal, a biosignal processing unit which acquires a nerve transfer signal and a myoelectricity signal from the biosignal, an optional control unit which generates a command signal for causing the actuator to generate power according to a wearer's intention by using the nerve transfer signal and the myoelectricity signal, and a driving current generating unit which generates a current according to the nerve transfer signal and a current according to the myoelectricity signal, respectively, based on the command signal from the optional control unit, to supply the respective currents to the actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0092">When causing the actuator to generate the power that meets the power assist rate according to the phase of the task which the wearer is trying to perform, this wearable action-assist device is provided with a physical quantity sensor which detects a physical quantity related to the action of the wearer.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(1) Drive System</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the composition of the whole wearable action-assist device as the drive system (hard system). This wearable action-assist device includes an action-assist tool <b>2</b> (the illustration of the other leg is omitted) which is attached to the lower half of the body of the man (called the wearer) <b>1</b>, a biosignal sensor <b>221</b> which detects a biosignal a from the lower half of the body (for example, the thigh), a barycenter sensor <b>222</b> which is attached to the sole of the wearer and detects a wearer's center of gravity, a biosignal processing unit <b>3</b> which acquires a nerve transfer signal b and a myoelectricity signal c from the biosignal detected by the biosignal sensor <b>221</b>, a control device <b>20</b> which controls the drive of the actuator <b>201</b> of the action-assist tool <b>2</b> based on the nerve transfer signal b and the myoelectricity signal c, and a power supply (a battery, an external power supply) <b>21</b> for supplying electric power to the control device <b>20</b> and the actuator <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the action-assist tool <b>2</b> comprises a waist joint <b>203</b><i>a </i>for coupling an upper arm <b>202</b><i>a </i>and a middle arm <b>202</b><i>b </i>rotatably, a knee joint <b>203</b><i>b </i>for coupling the middle arm <b>202</b><i>b </i>and a lower arm <b>202</b><i>c </i>rotatably, a heel joint <b>203</b><i>c </i>for coupling the lower arm <b>202</b><i>c </i>and a heel part <b>205</b> rotatably, an actuator <b>201</b><i>a </i>provided in the waist joint <b>203</b><i>a</i>, and an actuator <b>201</b><i>b </i>provided in the knee joint <b>203</b><i>b</i>. Fixtures <b>205</b><i>a </i>and <b>205</b><i>b</i>, such as a magic tape (registered trademark), which are fixed to the wearer's thigh and calf, are attached to the middle arm <b>202</b><i>b </i>and the lower arm <b>202</b><i>c</i>. Each of the actuators <b>201</b><i>a </i>and <b>201</b><i>b </i>includes a motor and a reduction gear.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0095">The upper arm <b>202</b><i>a </i>is fixed to the waist part <b>204</b> which is wound around and fixed to the wearer's body. Projection parts <b>204</b><i>a </i>which are open to the top and the bottom are formed in the upper peripheral edge on the back side of the waist part <b>204</b>, and bottom projections <b>220</b><i>a </i>of a bag <b>220</b> which accommodates the control device <b>20</b> and the power supply <b>21</b> are engaged with the openings of the projection parts <b>204</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the load of the bag <b>220</b> can be received by the waist part <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0096">The heel part <b>205</b> is provided in an integral formation which fully covers the wearer's heel. A side wall of the heel part <b>205</b> is extended to be higher than the other side wall of the heel part <b>205</b>, and the heel joint <b>203</b><i>c </i>is attached to the top end of the higher side wall. For this reason, all the loads of the action-assist tool <b>2</b> and the bag <b>220</b> are supported by the heel part <b>205</b>, and are not applied to the wearer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(2) Control System</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the control system of the wearable action-assist device of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0098">The wearer <b>1</b> and the action-assist tool <b>2</b> constitute a man-machine system <b>10</b>. A control device <b>20</b> has an optional control unit <b>4</b>. The biosignal sensor <b>221</b> which detects the wearer's biosignal a is connected to the input terminal of the optional control unit <b>4</b>, and the driving current generating unit <b>5</b> is connected to the output terminal of the optional control unit <b>4</b>. The driving current generating unit <b>5</b> is connected to the actuators <b>201</b><i>a </i>and <b>201</b><i>b </i>(which are collectively called the actuator <b>201</b>) of the action-assist tool <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(a) Sensors</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0099">The wearable action-assist device of the first embodiment includes as the indispensable element the biosignal sensor <b>221</b> which detects the biosignal a from the wearer <b>1</b> in a state where the wearable action-assist device is worn by the wearer <b>1</b>. The biosignal sensor <b>221</b> is usually attached to the wearer's skin. Alternatively, it may be embedded inside of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0100">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is preferred that the wearable action-assist device of the first embodiment includes the barycenter sensor <b>222</b>. Usually, a plurality of barycenter sensors <b>222</b> are attached to the sole of the wearer. It is possible to predict the direction of a motion of the human body by detecting which of the plurality of barycenter sensors <b>222</b> the relatively maximum weight is applied to.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0101">Moreover, in order to raise the control accuracy, the wearable action-assist device of the first embodiment may be provided with the following: (1) the sensor for acquiring a signal which indicates the state of motion of the wearer <b>1</b>, (for example, a force sensor, a torque sensor, a current sensor, an angle sensor, an angular velocity sensor, an acceleration sensor, a floor-reaction-force sensor, etc.); (2) the sensor for acquiring information on the external environment (for example, existence of an obstacle), (for example, a CCD, a laser sensor, an infrared sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, etc.); (3) the sensor for acquiring a biosignal other than the nerve transfer signal b and the myoelectricity signal c, (for example, a body temperature sensor, a pulse sensor, a brain-waves sensor, a cardiac potential sensor, a perspiration sensor, etc.). Since these sensors are publicly known, a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">(b) The Biosignal Processing Unit</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0102">The biosignal a detected by the biosignal sensor <b>221</b> includes the nerve transfer signal b and the myoelectricity signal c. The nerve transfer signal b can also be called as an intention transfer signal. The nerve transfer signal b is provided such that (i) it precedes the head of the myoelectricity signal c (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), or (ii) it is superimposed with the head of the myoelectricity signal c (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0103">Since the frequency of the nerve transfer signal b is generally higher than the frequency of the myoelectricity signal c, they can be separated from each other by using different band pass filters. The nerve transfer signal b can be acquired by using a band pass filter <b>32</b> of high bandwidth (for example, in a range from 33 Hz to several kilohertz) after the biosignal a is amplified by the amplifier <b>31</b>. The myoelectricity signal c can be acquired by using a band pass filter <b>33</b> of middle bandwidth (for example, in a range from 33 Hz to 500 Hz) after the biosignal a is amplified by the amplifier <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0104">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the filters are connected in parallel. The present invention is not limited to this embodiment. Alternatively, the filters may be connected in series. Moreover, the nerve transfer signal b may be superimposed not only with the head of the myoelectricity signal c but also with the subsequent part of the myoelectricity signal c. In such a case, what is necessary is just to use only the head part of the nerve transfer signal b for generation of a pulse current which will be mentioned later.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0105">Smoothing processing is carried out to the nerve transfer signal b and the myoelectricity signal c. Each current shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is generated by the driving current generating unit <b>5</b> by inputting a command signal d, acquired by performing the smoothing of the signals from the biosignal processing unit <b>3</b>, to the driving current generating unit <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, since the nerve transfer signal b has a narrow width and the nerve transfer signal b after the smoothing becomes a pulse-like shape, the current generated by the driving current generating unit <b>5</b> based on this nerve transfer signal b also becomes a pulse-like shape. The current (pulse current) acquired based on the nerve transfer signal b may be configured in the shape of a square wave.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0107">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, since the myoelectricity signal c has a wide width and the myoelectricity signal c after the smoothing becomes a crest-like shape which potential is substantially proportional to the myoelectricity, the current generated by the driving current generating unit <b>5</b> based on this myoelectricity signal c also becomes a crest-like shape.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0108">When a total current of the pulse current generated based on the nerve transfer signal b and the current generated proportionally based on the myoelectricity signal c is supplied to the actuator <b>201</b>, the actuator <b>201</b> generates a torque with the magnitude proportional to this total current. Since the total current is set up in each case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> so that it rises with a sufficiently large current, the actuator <b>201</b> is driven in accordance with the wearer's intention without delay, and the wearer <b>1</b> can perform operation according to his intention without giving the sense of incongruity to the wearer. Although the pulse current is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as being so large, this is to emphasize the role of the pulse current. The illustration does not show the actual relation between the pulse current and the driving current acquired from the myoelectricity signal c. The magnitude of each current can be suitably set up by the feeling of the wearer <b>1</b> at the time of action.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">(c) Optional Control Unit</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0109">The optional control unit <b>4</b> has a function which generates a command signal d for causing the actuator <b>201</b> to generate the power according to the wearer's intention, by using the nerve transfer signal b and the myoelectricity signal c. Proportional control is applicable to the optional control unit <b>4</b> as the control method being used. In accordance with the proportional control, the command signal value and the driving current value have a proportional relation, and the driving current value and the generating torque value of the actuator <b>201</b> have a proportional relation in accordance with the characteristics of the actuator <b>201</b>. Therefore, a power assist rate is controllable to be a desired value by generating a predetermined command signal d using the optional control unit <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0110">Alternatively, a combination of proportional control, derivative control, and/or integral control may be applied to the optional control unit <b>4</b> as the control method being used.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0111">A power assist rate is a distribution ratio of the power generated by the wearer <b>1</b> and the power generated by the action-assist tool <b>2</b>, and it is adjusted by manual operation or automatic operation. This power assist rate may have a negative value or a positive value. In case of a power assist rate having a positive value, the force generated by the action-assist tool <b>2</b> is added to the wearer's generating force. In a case of a power assist rate having a negative value, the force generated by the action-assist tool <b>2</b> is reduced from the wearer's generating force (namely, the load is put on the wearer <b>1</b>), and the wearer <b>1</b> must generate a force that is larger than the usually generating force.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">(d) Driving Current Generating Unit</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0112">When a command signal d from the optional control unit <b>4</b> is inputted, the driving current generating unit <b>5</b> generates, based on this command signal d, a current according to the nerve transfer signal b and a driving current according to the myoelectricity signal c, respectively, and supplies them to the actuator <b>201</b> to drive the actuator <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">(B) Controlling Method and Controlling Program</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart for explaining the controlling method of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0114">In a preferred example of the controlling method of the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the action-assist tool <b>2</b> having the actuator <b>201</b> which gives power to the wearer <b>1</b> is attached to the wearer <b>1</b> (ST<b>501</b>), and the wearer's biosignal a is detected (ST<b>502</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0115">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the nerve transfer signal b and the myoelectricity signal c are acquired from the biosignal a by using the biosignal processing unit <b>3</b> (ST<b>503</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0116">The optional command signal d<b>1</b> for causing the actuator <b>201</b> to generate the power according to the wearer's intention is generated by using the acquired nerve transfer signal b and myoelectricity signal c (ST<b>504</b>). This optional command signal d<b>1</b> is composed of a command signal d which generates the pulse current according to the nerve transfer signal b, and a command signal d which generates the driving current proportional to the myoelectricity signal c. By inputting each command signal d to the driving current generating unit <b>5</b>, the current being supplied to the actuator <b>201</b> is generated by the driving current generating unit <b>5</b>. Other signals (for example, signals acquired from the sensors other than the biosignal sensor <b>221</b> included in the first embodiment) may also be used instead for generation of the optional command signal d<b>1</b>. Also in the subsequent embodiments, unless otherwise specified, the other signals which are the same as mentioned above may be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0117">The current that can drive the actuator <b>201</b> has a lower limit (threshold). When the pulse current according to the nerve transfer signal b (when the pulse current and the driving current are not superimposed), or the total current of the pulse current and the driving current (when the pulse current and the driving current are superimposed) is less than the lower limit, the pulse current is not useful for a quick drive start of the actuator <b>201</b>, and the driving of the actuator <b>201</b> is not started until the driving current reaches the lower limit. Then, a considerable delay arises between the time of the wearer's cerebrum emission of the signal (the nerve transfer signal b) and the time of start of the action-assist device action. This will cause the sense of incongruity to be given to the wearer <b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0111" num="0126">Before explaining the details of the wearable action-assist device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a description will be given of tasks and phases. Each action pattern of the wearer is classified into tasks. Phases are a series of minimum action units which constitute each task.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the human being's basic actions: walking (task A), rising (task B), sitting (task C), and going up or down stairs (task D). Naturally, the tasks are not necessarily limited to these tasks. Each task is composed of the phases. For example, the walking task A is composed of phase <b>1</b> in which the both legs align, phase <b>2</b> in which the right leg is forwarded, phase <b>3</b> in which the left leg is forwarded and the state where the both legs align is reached, and phase <b>4</b> in which the left leg is forwarded. Such a series of phases are called phase sequence. A suitable power for assisting the action of the wearer <b>1</b> differs depending on each of the series of phases. Therefore, the optimal assistance can be carried out for every phase by assigning different power assist rates PAR<b>1</b>, PAR<b>2</b>, PAR<b>3</b> and PAR<b>4</b> for the respective phases <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0128">As a result of the analysis of actions of each person, it is turned out that the rotation angle and angular velocity of each joint, the walking speed and acceleration, the posture, and the movement of the center of gravity are determined for each phase. For example, a typical walking pattern of respective persons is determined, and when a person walks in that walking pattern, the most natural feeling arises. Therefore, what is necessary is to experientially determine each of rotation angles, angular velocities, etc. of each joint for all the phases of all the tasks, and store them in the database as standard parameters (reference rotation angle, reference angular velocity, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0129">The wearable action-assist device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> comprises the man-machine system <b>10</b> which is composed of the wearer <b>1</b> and the action-assist tool <b>2</b>, the biosignal processing unit <b>3</b> which acquires the nerve transfer signal b and the myoelectricity signal c from the wearer's biosignal a, and the database <b>6</b> in which the standard parameters of the respective phases and the power assist rates PAR assigned for the respective phases are stored. Moreover, the wearable action-assist device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> comprises: the optional control unit <b>14</b> which acquires the biosignal a (in which the nerve transfer signal b and the myoelectricity signal c are included) and the physical quantity (the rotation angle and angular velocity of each joint, the walking speed and acceleration, the posture, and the movement of the center of gravity etc. and, if needed, the signals from the other sensors) detected by the physical quantity sensor <b>13</b>, and generates the optional command signal d (in which the power assist rate PAR etc. is included) which is acquired by comparing the acquired physical quantity with the standard parameter of the database <b>6</b>; and the driving current generating unit <b>5</b> which generates the driving current, which is supplied to the actuator <b>201</b> of the action-assist tool <b>2</b>, according to the command signal d of the optional control unit <b>14</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0157">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, in this controlling method, the action-assist tool <b>2</b> having the actuator <b>201</b> which gives power to the wearer <b>1</b> is attached to the wearer <b>1</b> (ST<b>801</b>). The wearer's biosignal a is detected (ST<b>802</b>), the physical quantity of the man-machine system <b>10</b> which is composed of the wearer <b>1</b> and the action-assist tool <b>2</b> is detected (ST<b>803</b>), and the optional command signal d<b>1</b> according to the detected physical quantity is generated (ST<b>804</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0158">While presuming the phase of the task which (ST <b>805</b>-<b>807</b>) and the wearer <b>1</b> are trying to perform by comparing the detected physical quantity with the standard parameter of each phase stored in database <b>6</b>, the hybrid ratio &#x3b1; corresponding to this phase and the power assist rate PAR are specified (ST<b>808</b>), and the autonomous command signal d<b>2</b> for driving actuator <b>201</b> under the power according to this phase is generated (ST<b>809</b>).</p>

<p id="h-0021" num="0000">[3] Other Functions</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Drive Control at the Time of Starting</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">(1) In the Case of Reflective Action</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0161">For example, when pushed suddenly from behind, it is necessary to forward one leg reflectively and to support the body, in order to avoid falling to the ground. If control of forwarding one leg is merely performed, it causes the leg to be pushed in front suddenly and the wearer stretches the leg instinctively. The wearer's operation of forwarding one leg will become awkward. In such a case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, when supplying the current <b>91</b> which makes the actuator <b>201</b> drive in the direction, the current <b>92</b> of a short-time (ranging from 0.01 to 0.3 seconds) in the opposite direction is supplied just before supplying the current <b>91</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, so that the actuator <b>201</b> is driven in the opposite direction. The wearer <b>1</b> will try to forward one leg reflectively, so the operation will become rather smooth. The control using such reflexes cannot be adapted for the usual robot, and it demonstrates an effect for the first time in the case of the wearable action-assist device of this invention which is attached to the wearer <b>1</b></p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">(2) In the Case of the Usual Action</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0162">When autonomous control which raises a leg is performed also in the case of usual operation like a walk, it may become the touch which had the leg pushed suddenly. If the current <b>91</b> which makes the actuator <b>201</b> drive in the direction is supplied after that which supplies current <b>92</b> of a counter direction too at the time of starting, and makes a counter direction drive actuator <b>201</b> in order to remove such sense of incongruity, a comfortable smooth motion can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0163">Some examples of the present invention will now be described. However, the present invention is not limited to these examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0149" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows the experimental result when applying the pulse current according to the nerve transfer signal in the example 1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (<i>a</i>) shows the change of the knee rotation angle &#x3b8;, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (<i>b</i>) shows the change of the biosignal which is amplified, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (<i>c</i>) shows the change of the torque of the knee actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0165"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows the experimental result when not applying the pulse current according to the nerve transfer signal in the example 1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> (<i>a</i>) shows the change of the knee rotation angle &#x3b8;, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> (<i>b</i>) shows the change of the biosignal which is amplified, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> (<i>c</i>) shows the change of the torque of the knee actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0166">This example is for explaining the effect of the first embodiment. When the wearer performs expansion action of the knee joint from the state in which the wearer relaxes and sits on the chair, the torque of the knee actuator <b>201</b><i>b </i>is measured respectively under the conditions for using the nerve transfer signal b as a trigger signal (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (<i>a</i>)-(<i>c</i>)), and under the conditions for not using the nerve transfer signal b as a trigger signal (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> (<i>a</i>)-(<i>c</i>)) (i.e., the conditions in which only the driving current according to the myoelectricity signal c is supplied to the actuator <b>201</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0167">In the case of the former conditions (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (<i>c</i>)), the torque was obtained in which the pulse current of the predetermined magnification corresponding to the nerve transfer signal b is superimposed at the front edge of the torque obtained from the detected biosignal a. The change of the knee rotation angle &#x3b8; was started 0.2 seconds after the detection of the biosignal a.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0168">On the other hand, in the case of the latter conditions (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> (<i>c</i>)), the torque in the state that is the same as the waveform of the biosignal a was obtained. Since the rise of this torque was loose, it took 0.3 second from the detection of the biosignal a to start the change of the knee rotation angle &#x3b8;.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0169">From these results, it is found out that the driving of the actuator <b>201</b><i>b </i>can be started quickly by using the nerve transfer signal b as a trigger signal and supplying the pulse current (square wave) having a predetermined width corresponding to the front edge of the biosignal a.</p>
<heading id="h-0026" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0155" num="0170">This example is for explaining the effect of the second embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows the experimental result of the rising action in which the wearer rises from the state in which he sat on the chair and the power application is carried out with the combination of autonomous control and optional control. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> (<i>c</i>) shows the change of the torque of the knee actuator according to the command signal d<b>1</b> by autonomous control. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> (<i>d</i>) shows the change of the torque of the knee actuator according to the command signal d<b>2</b> by optional control. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> (<i>e</i>) shows the change of the torque of the knee actuator according to the total command signal d<b>3</b> which is obtained by combining the command signal d<b>1</b> by autonomous control and the command signal d<b>2</b> by optional control. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> (<i>a</i>) shows a phase number and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> (<i>b</i>) shows the change of the knee rotation angle &#x3b8;.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows the experimental result of the rising action when the wearer rises from the state in which the wearer sat on the chair but he sits down after rising to the middle, and the power application is carried out with the combination of autonomous control and optional control. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> (<i>a</i>) shows a phase number and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> (<i>b</i>) shows the change of the knee rotation angle &#x3b8;.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0172">As is apparent from the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> (<i>e</i>), the torque of the actual knee actuator increased rapidly in the rising of phase <b>2</b>, and fell rapidly in the falling of phase <b>3</b>. Since the torque increased rapidly at the front edge of phase <b>2</b> corresponding to the rising from the chair, the knee actuator started rotation in accordance with the wearer's intention, and the wearer was able to perform the rising action comfortably while having a good feeling of power assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0173">In the falling of phase <b>3</b>, the torque by autonomous control is promptly set to 0, and the situation which gives the wearer the torque which pushes out the wearer carelessly can be prevented, and the sense of incongruity given to the wearer can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0174">As a result, in all the processes of phases <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>, the wearer was able to have a good feeling of power assistance and was able to operate smoothly and comfortably.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0175">On the other hand, when the torque according to command signal d by the optional control is used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> (<i>d</i>), the rising is inadequate, the driving of the knee actuator cannot be started quickly in a comfortable manner. Since the torque according to the command signal d by the autonomous control shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> (<i>c</i>) is a fixed torque which differs from the torque which changes in process, a series of comfortable and smooth actions cannot be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0176">That is, it is turned out that both the quick starting and the torque matched with the action of the wearer can be obtained only with the combination of the optional control and the autonomous control mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0177">On the other hand, as is apparent from the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> (<i>e</i>), when the wearer sits down immediately after rising, the torque increased rapidly at the front edge of phase <b>2</b> corresponding to the rising from the chair. The knee actuator started rotation in accordance with the wearer's intention, and the wearer was able to perform the rising action comfortably while having a good feeling of power assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0178">In the middle of phase <b>3</b>, generation of the biosignal a is controlled, even if the torque by the optional control decreases and the torque by the autonomous control in the rising direction is added, the influence is cancelled by each other and the whole torque was not so large as to give the sense of incongruity in the action to sit on the chair. As a result, even if the wearer changes the action (task) suddenly, the wearer was able to have a good feeling of power assistance, and was able to perform the action smoothly and comfortably.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0179">On the other hand, when the torque according to the command signal d by the optional control is used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> (<i>d</i>), the rising is inadequate, and the driving of the knee actuator cannot be started quickly in a comfortable manner. When the torque according to the command signal d by the autonomous control is used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> (<i>c</i>), changing suddenly from phase <b>3</b> to phase <b>1</b> caused the fixed torque to exert in the opposite direction of the action, and it was uncomfortable.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0180">Thus, even when performing suddenly an action which is not a series of actions, the combination of the optional control and the autonomous control mentioned above is useful to prevent the sense of incongruity from being given to the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0181">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments and variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
