<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a semiconductor package, a semiconductor device may be embedded inside a molded plastic or ceramic casing, for example. A wire bond may electrically connect an active side of the semiconductor device (i.e., a side proximal an electrical component such as, for example, a transistor, resistor, capacitor or inductor formed in the semiconductor device) to a substrate, on which the semiconductor device is supported. The bond pads or other electrical connectors at the active side of the semiconductor device may face-up and be embedded in the molded casing. For example, a semiconductor device that is a microprocessor or an operational amplifier and may be used within an electronic circuit, is wire bonded in a semiconductor package.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The presence of the molded casing directly above the semiconductor device limits heat dissipation and in turn limits the power level of the semiconductor device. To help move heat generated in the semiconductor device away from the semiconductor device and towards the top of the semiconductor package, the wire bond semiconductor package may include a heat spreader embedded inside the molded casing. A heat sink may be disposed on top of the wire bond semiconductor package to aid the transfer of heat from the semiconductor package to surrounding fluid or environment.</p>

Other intervening layers may be provided, such as associated with a stack of electrical components, for example. In other embodiments, the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor may be adhered to the top surface <b>200</b> of the substrate <b>104</b> instead of or in addition to the top surface <b>308</b> of the conducting member <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the top surface <b>308</b> of the conducting member <b>302</b> may be adjacent to, in thermal contact with, in physical contact with and/or abut the entire active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> to provide a thermal dissipation path for heat generated in the semiconductor device <b>300</b>. In other embodiments, the top surface <b>308</b> of the conducting member <b>302</b> may be larger, smaller and/or a different shape than the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The semiconductor device <b>300</b> also includes through vias <b>316</b> (e.g., two through-silicon vias (TSVs) <b>316</b>). The through vias <b>316</b> pass at least partly through the semiconductor device <b>300</b>, connecting the integrated circuit of the active side <b>304</b> to the passive side <b>306</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>. The through vias <b>316</b> may extend in a direction generally perpendicular to the active side <b>304</b> and/or the passive side <b>306</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>. &#x201c;Generally&#x201d; allows for other angles while still extending in a direction away from the passive side <b>306</b> and/or the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>. The through vias <b>316</b> may be filled with any number of electrically conductive materials (e.g., an electrically conductive plating <b>318</b>) including, for example, copper. The semiconductor device <b>300</b> may include more or fewer through vias <b>316</b>. The through vias <b>316</b> may be located anywhere on the semiconductor device <b>300</b> including, for example, at the perimeter of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> or internal to the perimeter of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The semiconductor device <b>300</b> may also include bonding pads <b>320</b> deposited on the passive side <b>306</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>. The bonding pads <b>320</b> are connected to the electrically conductive plating <b>318</b> of the through vias <b>316</b>. The bonding pads <b>320</b> may be made of a different material than or the same material as the electrically conductive plating <b>318</b> of the through vias <b>316</b> (e.g., aluminum or copper). The bonding pads <b>320</b> may be formed as a single piece with the electrically conductive plating <b>318</b> of the through vias <b>316</b>. The bonding pads <b>320</b> are deposited using electroplating or electroless plating, for example. The bonding pads <b>320</b> may also be adhered to the electrically conductive plating <b>318</b> of the through vias <b>316</b> with solder, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the semiconductor device <b>300</b> includes a redistribution layer at the passive side <b>306</b> for signal or power. The redistribution layer may include a first dielectric layer (e.g., a polyimide layer) deposited at the passive side <b>306</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>, a plurality of metal layers (e.g., titanium, copper and/or nickel), and a second dielectric layer deposited on top of the plurality of metal layers. Part of the first dielectric layer is removed such that one or more of the bonding pads <b>320</b> are exposed. The plurality of metal layers is patterned for redistribution of signal or power, and at least one metal layer of the plurality is in contact with one or more of the bonding pads. Part of the second dielectric layer is removed such that new bonding pads (e.g., part of one metal layer of the plurality) are exposed. The first dielectric layer may be a plurality of dielectric layers of different dielectric materials (e.g., silicon nitride and polyimide).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Wire bonds <b>322</b> (e.g., two wire bonds <b>322</b>) electrically connect the bonding pads <b>320</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>, and thus the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> (e.g., through the TSVs <b>316</b>), to the top surface <b>200</b> of the substrate <b>104</b> (e.g., via contact pads of the substrate <b>104</b>). The wire bonds <b>322</b> may be attached to the bonding pads <b>320</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> and the top surface <b>200</b> of the substrate <b>104</b> in any number of wire bonding processes (e.g., using some combination of heat, pressure and ultrasonic energy). The semiconductor package <b>100</b> may include more or fewer wire bonds <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The wire bonds <b>322</b> may be any number of materials including, for example, copper or gold. Copper wire is harder than gold wire, so copper wire is more difficult to bond. Copper wire, however, is less expensive than gold wire, bringing down the manufacturing costs for the semiconductor package <b>100</b>. A greater bond force is applied to the wire bonds <b>322</b> when copper wire is used. Thus, a greater bond force is applied to the semiconductor device <b>300</b>. The active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> may be very fragile, and a greater bond force may cause failures within the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>. In the present embodiments, however, the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> may be embedded in the layer of thermal adhesive <b>314</b>. The bonding pads <b>320</b> are located at the passive side <b>306</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>, so the bonding force is applied to the bulk semiconductor material (e.g., silicon) at the passive side <b>306</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>. This may lead to fewer failures within the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> when bonding copper wire bonds <b>322</b> to the semiconductor device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The semiconductor device <b>300</b> and the wire bonds <b>322</b> are embedded in a molding compound <b>324</b>. The molding compound <b>324</b> may be any number of non-conductive material compounds including, for example, a silicon dioxide, epoxy-based resin compound. The molding compound <b>324</b> may only partially embed the semiconductor device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The molding compound <b>324</b> provides structural support for the semiconductor package <b>100</b> and protects the embedded semiconductor device <b>300</b>. The difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion between the semiconductor material (e.g., silicon) of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> and the molding compound <b>324</b>, however, may cause high thermal stresses on the semiconductor device <b>300</b> during thermal cycling (e.g., power up/power down). Again, the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> may be very fragile, and high thermal stresses may cause failures within the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b>. In the present embodiments, however, the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> may be embedded in the layer of thermal adhesive <b>314</b> (e.g., instead of the molding compound <b>324</b>), shifting the delicate active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> away from the high thermal stress regions of the semiconductor package <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The semiconductor package <b>100</b> may also include a heat spreader <b>326</b> embedded in the molding compound <b>324</b>. The heat spreader <b>326</b> may be made of a material with a high thermal conductivity such as, for example, nickel-plated copper and may move heat away from the heat source (e.g., the semiconductor device <b>300</b>) and towards a secondary heat exchanger. The secondary heat exchanger may be a heat sink attached to the semiconductor package <b>100</b>, for example. The heat spreader <b>326</b> may be completely or partially embedded in the molding compound <b>324</b>. A top surface of the heat spreader <b>326</b> may be exposed to the surrounding fluid (e.g., the surrounding air) and may be air-cooled by fans.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the bottom surface <b>310</b> of the conducting member <b>302</b> may be attached to a top surface <b>204</b> of the PCB <b>106</b> in any number of ways including, for example, with solder <b>328</b> or a conductive adhesive. The conducting member <b>302</b> located below the active side <b>304</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> provides an additional dissipation path for heat. Heat may flow from the source (e.g., the semiconductor device <b>300</b>) to the surrounding air via the layer of thermal adhesive <b>314</b>, the conducting member <b>302</b>, the solder <b>328</b> and the PCB <b>106</b>. The additional dissipation path for heat increases the thermal performance of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> and thus increases the power at which the wire bond semiconductor package <b>100</b> may be operated.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, another heat sink or other heat exchanger may be attached to a bottom surface <b>330</b> of the PCB <b>106</b> to further aid the heat transfer from the semiconductor device <b>300</b> to the surrounding air. The other heat sink may be air-cooled by one or more fans.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a perspective cross-sectional view of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> or a different semiconductor device with through vias. The semiconductor device <b>300</b> includes six through vias <b>316</b> with corresponding bonding pads <b>320</b>. The bonding pads <b>320</b> may be re-distributed such that the bonding pads extend in a direction away from the corresponding through vias <b>316</b> (e.g., a &#x201c;dog-bone&#x201d; bonding pad design). The re-distributed bonding pads <b>320</b> may be used as a re-distribution layer for signal or power, for example. As described above, the bonding pads <b>320</b> may be made of a different material (e.g., aluminum) than the electrically conductive plating <b>318</b> (e.g., copper) of the through vias <b>316</b>. A copper (e.g., the wire bonds <b>322</b>) to aluminum (e.g., the bonding pads <b>320</b>) bond may provide a stronger bond than a copper to copper bond.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At block <b>500</b>, an opening is created in a substrate. The opening may be created in any number of ways including, for example, with a drill or saw, by pressing, or by forming the substrate with the opening. The opening may extend from a top surface of the substrate to a bottom surface of the substrate. In one embodiment, the opening may extend from the top surface of the substrate but only a portion of the way through the substrate. The opening may be any number of shapes including, for example, a square or rectangle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At block <b>502</b>, a metal slug is disposed in the opening in the substrate. The metal slug may be made of copper. The metal slug may be sized to match the shape and size of the opening in the substrate. The metal slug may be a continuous, solid piece of metal or may be hollow. The metal slug may be attached to the substrate using an organic adhesive, for example. In one embodiment, the metal slug may be friction fit in the opening, with or without the use of an adhesive. Other arrangements of flanges, grooves, tabs and other extensions or indentations may be provided for the metal slug to attach and/or seat the metal slug to the substrate. A top surface of the metal slug may be in line with (i.e., flush), above or below the top surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At block <b>504</b>, an active side of a silicon device is attached to the metal slug such that the entire active side of the silicon device is adjacent to, contacts, is in thermal communication with, and/or abuts the metal slug. The active side of the silicon device may include a plurality of layers that forms an integrated circuit. The active side of the silicon device may be attached to the top surface of the metal slug with a layer of thermal adhesive disposed on the top surface of the metal slug and/or the active side of the silicon device. The layer of thermal adhesive may be silver-filled epoxy, for example. The metal slug may be sized and shaped to match the size and shape of the silicon device.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Through silicon vias (TSVs) may be created in the silicon device, such as by etching, laser drilling or other semiconductor process. The TSVs may be filled with an electrically conductive material such as, for example, copper. Bonding pads may be deposited on the plating of the TSVs at a passive side of the silicon device. The bonding pads may be made of a different material (e.g., aluminum) than the plating of the TSVs. The bonding pads may be deposited on the passive side using, for example, electroplating or electroless plating.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The bonding pads of the silicon device may be wire bonded to the top surface of the substrate to electrically connect the active side of the silicon device to the substrate. The wire of the wire bond may be copper or gold, for example. The bonding pads and the substrate may be wire bonded using some combination of heat, pressure and/or ultrasonic energy, for example, at each of the wire bond connections.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The metal slug may be attached to a top surface of a printed circuit board by solder, for example. Heat generated in the silicon device may flow to a surrounding fluid or environment via the layer of thermal adhesive, the metal slug, the solder and the printed circuit board.</p>
