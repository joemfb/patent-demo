<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to wireless communication systems and techniques for wireless communications using one or more relay stations in addition to base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless communication systems use electromagnetic waves to communicate with fixed and mobile wireless communication devices, e.g., mobile wireless phones and laptop computers with wireless communication cards, that are located within cells of coverage areas of the systems. A radio spectral range or band designated or allocated for a wireless communication service or a particular class of wireless services may be divided into different radio carrier frequencies for generating different communication frequency channels. Such systems use base stations spatially distributed to provide radio coverage in a geographic service area which is divided into cells. In such a cellular deployment, each base station (BS) is conceptually located at the center of a respective cell to provide radio coverage for that cell and transmits information to a wireless subscriber station (SS) such as a mobile SS (MSS) via BS-generated downlink (DL) radio signals. A subscriber station at a particular cell transmits information to its serving base station for that particular cell via uplink (UL) radio signals. The base stations can include directional antennas to further divide each cell into different cell sectors where each antenna covers one sector. This sectorization of a cell increases the communication capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The radio coverage of a network of fixed base stations may be limited due to various factors. Various structures may block the radio signals of certain base stations. For example, a tall building may shield a particular area from the radio signal from a base station, thus creating an undesired shadowing. At the edge of a radio cell, the signal strength can be weak and hence can increase the error rate in the wireless communications. One approach to mitigating these and other limitations is to increase the number of base stations in a given service area. In one implementation under this approach, one or more relay stations (RSs) can be deployed among certain fixed base stations to relay communication signals between a subscriber station and a base station, thus extending the coverage and improving the communication capacity and quality of the base station. A relay station may be a fixed transceiver or a mobile transceiver station depending on the specific conditions for deploying such as relay station. A subscriber station (SS) signal may hop through one or more RSs before reaching a serving base station. The proposed IEEE 802.16j provides Multi-hop Relay (MR) modes to use relay stations for enhanced coverage and service to subscribers. A multi-hop relay wireless network under IEEE 802.16j can include MR base stations (MR-BSs) with the support of the Multi-hop Relay modes. A relay station can be fixed, nomadic or mobile. A wireless relay access network supports data transmission between BS and MS either directly or through one or more RSs. IEEE 802.16j defines air interface standard for a wireless relay access network based on OFDMA technology.</p>

In an OFDMA wireless relay network, for multi-BS MBS, a group of BSs and attached RSs form the service region to provide MBS service to MSs. For single-BS MBS, a BS and its attached RS form the service region to transmit the MBS data to MBs in the cell coverage. A MS, depending on its channel condition, may receive signals from multiple BSs, which may occur via one or more RSs subtending from a BS in addition to directly from the BS itself, if the transmissions are synchronized. If multiple BSs transmit data for an MBS service flow in a synchronized fashion, the MS can receive and combine the signals from multiple BSs to achieve macro-diversity for the MBS service flow. In an OFDMA wireless system, such synchronized transmission of MBS data to enable macro-diversity reception implies all BSs and any subtending RSs involved should transmit the same block of data at the same Frame/Slot/subchannel and with the same modulation scheme. In an OFDMA wireless relay network, synchronized transmission of MBS data implies all the BSs and RSs involved should transmit the same block of data at the same frame/Slot/Subchannel and with the same modulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively, synchronization of the transmission of the same data from multiple BSs may be less strict in that synchronization is only to within a certain window of time but the transmissions may not be exactly aligned in time and frequency within this time window. While this latter looser form of synchronization cannot support macro-diversity reception of the transmissions, it nevertheless can provide power savings at the MS since it is not required to actively receive except during the known time windows within which the data transmissions occur even as the MS moves between the coverage areas of the various BSs that form the MBS service region.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one implementation, a MBS scheduler can be used to synchronize data transmission to either an exact time or a specified time window that covers different times. A MBS scheduler can be centralized or distributed in the network. In an OFDMA wireless system, the centralized MBS scheduler can be located in one Access Network Gateway as a functionality entity, and the distributed MBS scheduler can be located in several Access Network Gateways and negotiate each other. In an OFDMA wireless relay system, for multi-BS MBS, the centralized MBS scheduler can be located in Access Network Gateway as a functionality entity. For single-BS MBS, the centralized MBS scheduler could be located in BS. Generally, the centralized MBS scheduler is used for MBS service in the current OFDMA wireless system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The centralized MBS scheduler determines the transmission time of each MBS packet and informs each BS within the MBS service region of its decision. In a wireless relay network, the centralized MBS scheduler can encounter one or more of the following and other issues when determining the transmission time:</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">1. Each RS introduces a delay to the transmission relay path from BS to a subscriber or mobile station (SS/MS). The value of the delay varies depending on traffic loading, QoS requirements of each connection and system implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">2. An access station through which an SS/MS accesses the network can be either a BS or RS. An access relay path, defined as the transmission path from an RS access station (access RS) to the BS, exists if transmissions between BS and SS/MS occur through one or more RSs and therefore, can contain a variable number of hops (each RS in the path is considered to be a hop).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">3. RSs can enter or exit the network which causes changes in cumulative delay of an access relay path. This change can in turn impact the overall delay that the MBS scheduler needs to impose on MBS data if such change affects the path with longest delay from centralized MBS scheduler to any access station (i.e. BS or access RS) of the MBS service region.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The synchronization mechanism presented herein, in one implementation, can be configured to adaptively support variable access relay path delays introduced by the delay of RS and the number of hops on the path. This mechanism is defined to allow network reconfiguration due to RS entering/exiting network without additional signaling. The same mechanism can also be used to provide data synchronization between BS and MBS scheduler.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the message flow of the synchronization method for synchronizing BS/RS data. The operation at each numbered circle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is detailed as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">(1) RS optionally reports its processing delay to BS. This processing delay represents a commitment made by an RS that on reception of an MBS data packet for a particular MBS service flow that the RS will be able transmit the MBS data packet over its radio access link to the SS/MS or if applicable, be able to transmit the MBS data packet to the next hop towards the access RS with a delay no longer than that reported. Therefore, this processing delay needs to account for the RS processing of the MBS data packet for transmission over its radio access link and for any required queuing of the MBS data packet from reception at the RS to that transmission or if applicable, for the RS processing of the MBS data packet for transmission over the relay link to the next hop towards the access RS and for any required queuing from reception at the RS and that transmission. The processing delay reported to the BS is the delay from reception to transmission over the RS's access link or if applicable, the larger of this processing delay and the processing delay from reception and transmission on the relay link to the next hop towards the access RS. The BS determines its cumulative path delay based on RS reporting. The cumulative path delay is the largest path delay of any access relay path (an access relay path might include one or more hops).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">(2) MBS scheduler determines the transmission delay based on information received from all BSs involved in the MBS connection. For each MBS data packet, MBS scheduler sends the transmission time along with the packet to each BS. As examples, frame number or absolute time referenced to a common time clock reference such as Greenwich Mean Time can be used as forms of transmission time.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">(3) BS composes a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol data unit (PDU) for MBS connection and forwards it to RS. For each MBS MAC PDU, the transmission time is attached to it. As an example, frame number can be included as part of MAC header for the MAC PDU.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">(4) If RS receives MBS MAC PDU before its designated transmission time, the RS sends the MAC PDU to MS at the transmission time; if RS fails to receive the MBS MAC PDU on time, the RS sends a failure indication for late arrival, such as in the form of a negative acknowledgement (NACK) message or some other kind of feedback indication, to BS indicating the late arrival of the packet. The RS also includes the arrival delay in the failure indication to facilitate readjustment of time alignment between the RS and the BS.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, the RS may send a warning indication for abnormal early arrival, such as in the form of a negative acknowledgement (NACK) message or some other kind of feedback indication, to report abnormal early arrival of MBS data. The warning indication for abnormal early arrival detection can be triggered by a pre-determined threshold, referred to as Allowed Early Arrival or Data Early Arrival Report Threshold. This threshold value can be pre-provisioned or determined and possibly adjusted dynamically. If an MBS MAC PDU arrives at a RS prior to a time equal to (Transmission Time&#x2014;Allowed Early Arrival), the RS sends a warning indication for abnormal early arrival including the amount of time by which the arrival was early to the BS.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">(5) When BS receives failure indication for late arrival or warning indication for abnormal early arrival from one or more RSs, it determines its new cumulative path delay based on the information and reports the adjustment to MBS scheduler. If one or more RS's within the span of control of a BS reports a failure indication for late arrival, the cumulative path delay is increased by an amount that is at least equal to the largest reported late arrival amount, and if at the same time, one or more RS's report warning indications for abnormal early arrival, their Allowed Early Arrival threshold can be increased accordingly since these warning indications are extraneous. If no RSs report failure indications for late arrival and one or more RSs report warning indications for abnormal early arrival, then the cumulative path delay can be reduced by the amount of the smallest reported early arrival duration.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">(6) As in step 2, MBS scheduler determines the transmission delay based on information received from all BSs involved in the MBS service flow. For each MBS data packet, MBS scheduler sends the transmission time along with the packet to each BS. As an example, frame number can be used as a form of transmission time.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the message flow for the synchronization method as applied to MBS scheduler/BS data synchronization in the above example implementation. The operation at each numbered circle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is detailed as following:</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">(1) BS optionally reports its delay in transmitting MBS data to MBS scheduler. If the BS is not an MR-BS (that is, if there is no access relay network that subtends from the BS), then this delay needs to account for the processing delay through the BS only. If the BS is an MR-BS, then this delay needs to account for the processing delay of the BS and the access relay path with the longest delay.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">(2) MBS scheduler determines the transmission delay based on information received from all BSs involved in the transmissions for the MBS service flow. For each MBS data packet, MBS scheduler sends the transmission time along with the packet to each BS. As an example, frame number can be used as a form of transmission time.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(3) If BS receives MBS MAC PDU before its designated transmission time, the BS sends the MAC PDU to MS at the transmission time; if BS fails to receive the MBS MAC PDU on time, the BS sends a failure indication for late arrival to MBS scheduler indicating the late arrival of the packet. The BS also includes the arrival delay in the failure indication to facilitate readjustment of time alignment between the MBS Scheduler and the BS. In addition, the BS may send a warning indication for abnormal early arrival to report abnormal early arrival of MBS data. The warning indication for abnormal early arrival detection can be triggered by a pre-determined threshold, referred to as Allowed Early Arrival or Data Early Arrival Report Threshold, for the network. When a MBS MAC PDU arrives at a BS prior to a time, called the early arrival duration, that is equal to Transmission Time&#x2014;Allowed Early Arrival, the BS sends a warning indication for abnormal early arrival including the early arrival duration to the MBS scheduler.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">(4) When MBS scheduler receives failure indication for late arrival or warning indication for abnormal early arrival from one or more BSs, it re-determines the transmission delay based on information received from all BSs involved in transmissions for the MBS service flow.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If one or more BS's report a failure indication for late arrival, the MBS scheduler increases the transmission delay by an amount that is at least equal to the largest reported late arrival amount, and if at the same time, one or more BS's report warning indication for abnormal early arrival, their Allowed Early Arrival threshold can be increased accordingly to prevent extraneous warning indications. If none of BSs reports failure indication for late arrival and one or more BSs report warning indications for abnormal early arrival, then the transmission delay can be reduced by the amount of the smallest reported early arrival duration.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For each MBS data packet, MBS scheduler sends the transmission time along with the packet to each BS. As an example, frame number can be used as a form of transmission time.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">IEEE 802.16j defines a mobile relay network which supports MBS services with synchronized transmissions for an MBS service flow, including exact synchronization required for macro-diversity, from BSs of an MBS service region. The method as described herein for synchronizing transmissions among a group of BSs and including any subtending RSs, such as within an MBS service region, can be introduced to 802.16j to provide synchronized transmission of MBS data. The following changes should be made to that standard to support this mechanism:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">1. For MBS data transmission with multi-MR-BS MBS, each MAC PDU begins with a relay MAC header. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> show formats of a relay MAC header and a MAC PDU, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">2. A new MBS subheader is defined. The MBS subheader contains a Target Transmission Time field that contains a sufficient number of the least significant bits of the over-the-air sequential transmission frame number, such as the least significant 16 bits or the least significant 6 bits of the over-the-air frame number, to allow a sufficient transmission time range to be specified. The full frame number that identifies the transmission frame for the MBS data is the concatenation of the lower bits as specified by the Target Transmission Time in the MBS subheader and the upper N bits of the current transmission frames, where N is the difference between the full length of the transmission frame number and the number of least significant bits specified by the Target Transmission Time. This full frame number indicates the target transmission frame number at which the RS transmits the MBS MAC PDU to MS over the access link. The MR-BS includes one MBS subheader in the MBS MAC PDU sending to the access RS.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Example formats for this MBS subheader are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, where in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, the Target Transmission Time field is 16 bits long and is defined in a separate MBS subheader format, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>, the Target Transmission Time field is 6 bits long and is included as part of a more general Allocation subheader. For the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>, the other fields of this exemplary Allocation subheader are not pertinent to the synchronization method described herein and therefore, are not described or discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">3. The intermediate RS forwards the MBS MAC PDU to the access RS.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">4. The access RS removes the relay MAC Header and subheader and transmits the access link MAC PDU to MS at the target transmission frame specified by the Target Transmission Time in the relevant subheader in the MBS MAC Header.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">5. The RS sends a failure indication for late arrival in the form of an MBS NACK feedback header, an exemplary format of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to MR-BS if RS fails to transmit MBS MAC PDU at the designated transmission time. RS includes arrival delay in MBS NACK feedback header. The arrival delay is the number of additional frames in advance in which RS requires to receive MBS data from MR-BS. Optionally, RS may transmit a warning indication for abnormal early arrival also in the form of an MBS NACK feedback header, an exemplary format of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to MR-BS if MBS MAC PDU arrives at RS too early. The triggering of the generation of the MBS NACK feedback header as a warning indication for abnormal early arrival is based on the Allowed Early Arrival threshold as described in Clause [0034].</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Relay MAC PDU is transmitted between MR-BS and RS. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that Relay MAC PDU can include relay MAC Header. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows that, for MBS MAC PDU, Relay MAC Header indicates the inclusion of a separately defined MBS subheader, an example format of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, by setting MBS bit to 1. Although the MBS bit is shown as the second bit of the first byte of the Relay MAC Header, this is for illustration purposes only and the MBS bit may be located in any suitable location within the Relay MAC Header.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows another example format for the Relay MAC Header when the Target Transmission Time information is included as part of a more general Allocation subheader, an example format of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>. For the example of Allocation subheader, inclusion of Target Transmission Time information in the MBS MAC PDU is indicated by the ASH bit set to 1.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An MBS subheader can be included for all MBS MAC PDU from MR-BS to RS and from RS to subordinate RS. For example, the MBS subheader can contain the least 16 bits of frame number of the frame for which the RS shall transmit the MBS MAC PDU to the MS. The following table illustrates an example for such a subheader.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example of MBS NACK Feedback header that is used both for failure indication for late arrival and warning indication for abnormal early arrival. The Feedback Type can be set to any available value, such as binary 1100 or binary 1110. An Early/Late Indication (ELI) bit indicates whether a failure indication for late arrival or a warning indication for abnormal early arrival is applicable. For example, an Early/Late Indication bit value equal to 0 can represent a failure indication for late arrival and a bit value equal to 1 can represent a warning indication for abnormal early arrival, or the converse interpretation of the Early/Late Indication bit values can be defined. The MBS NACK Feedback header can include Arrival Delta information to indicate the number of frames RS receive MBS data from MR-BS late or early with the interpretation corresponding to the respective setting of the Early/Late Indication bit. CID is set to CID of the MBS transport connection for which the RS is sending MBS failure or warning indication feedback header.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Hence, based on the above, a method can be provided to provide synchronized data transmission for an MBS service flow in wireless relay network having relay stations and base stations. In this method, a centralized MBS scheduler entity is provided to determine the transmission time of each MBS data packet for all BSs; each BS is operated to send the Target Transmission Time along with the MBS data packet to all RSs attached to it that carries data packets for the MBS service flow; an RS is operated to transmit MBS data packet to MS at the Target Transmission Time; and an RS is operated to send a failure indication for late arrival, such as in the form of an MBS NACK Feedback header with the Early/Late Indication bit set accordingly, to BS if the RS is not able to transmit the MBS data packet due to late arrival. Optionally, the RS is operated to send warning indication for abnormal early arrival, such as in the form of an MBS NACK Feedback header with the Early/Late Indication bit set accordingly, to BS if RS detects abnormal early arrival of MBS data packets. In this method, BS is operated to adjust the applicable access relay path delay for synchronized data transmission based on MBS NACK Feedback headers received as failure indications for late arrival or in the absence of failure indications, as warning indications for abnormal early arrival according to method described in Clause [0035] and sends the adjusted access relay path delay to centralized MBS scheduler. The centralized MBS scheduler is further operated to determine the transmission time for each MBS data packet based on BS reporting.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">5. The MBS NACK Feedback header can include an indication whether duration for early arrival or late arrival is included.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">6. When detecting early arrival of MBS data packet at a RS, a threshold can be used to determine if a warning indication for abnormal early arrival, such as in the form of an MBS NACK Feedback header, should be sent to BS.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">7. The method can use an algorithm to allow the BS to use the failure indications for late arrival or warning indications for abnormal early arrival, such as in the form of MBS NACK Feedback headers, and duration information contained therein to recalculate the longest cumulative path delay to the access RSs within the span of control of the BS, and possibly to adjust the thresholds triggering abnormal early arrival detection in one or more of these RSs.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Also based on the above, another method can be provided for synchronized data transmission for a MBS service in wireless network having base stations.
