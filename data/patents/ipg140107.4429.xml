<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest), and in particular to controlling the allocation of transmission resources for ARQ re-transmissions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) denotes a family of protocols used to provide robustness to a communication link, such as a telecommunication link. One example ARQ scheme is denoted Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (Hybrid ARQ or HARQ), and is a technique used, for example, in the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) standard for the HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) protocols, and is being proposed for use in the UMTS LTE (UMTS Long Term Evolution) standard that is under development within the 3GPP (3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project) framework.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally in ARQ schemes, the receiver indicates to the sender if a packet has been received in error and, if so, the sender automatically re-transmits the packet. This process may be iterated until the packet is correctly received or until a maximum number of re-transmissions have been carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a HARQ scheme, the receiver combines the information in the erroneously received packet with the information in the re-transmitted packet and uses the combined information in the demodulation and decoding. This principle of operation is denoted soft combining and enhances the reception performance. The re-transmitted packet in a HARQ scheme may either comprise the same information as it did in the previous transmission, or it may comprise alternative information compared to the previous transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the re-transmitted packet comprises the same information as it did in the previous transmission, the scheme is denoted chase combining. In chase combining, the combination of information from the erroneously received packet and from the re-transmitted packet may be carried out using either the received symbols before demodulation or the demodulated bits before decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the re-transmitted packet comprises alternative information compared to the previous transmission, the scheme is denoted incremental redundancy. The packet to be re-transmitted may, for example, be exposed to a different puncturing pattern than in the previous transmission of the packet. This may result in that the re-transmitted packet comprises additional redundancy bits compared to the previous transmission. Alternatively, it may result in that some bits of the previous transmission have been excluded and additional bits have been comprised in the re-transmitted packet. In this way, new redundancy may be added to the information in the received packet for each re-transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An incremental redundancy scheme may typically be based on a low-rate channel code, where only a limited number of the encoded bits are included in the first transmission (i.e., a large number of the encoded bits are punctured). This effectively results in that the first transmission is carried out using a high-rate channel code. If this first transmission of the packet results in an erroneous reception and the packet is to be re-transmitted in response to a re-transmission request, a different puncturing pattern may be used to puncture the packet before re-transmission (i.e., the encoded bits sent in the re-transmission differs from the ones sent in the previous transmission). Thus, successive combining of the information from the transmission and re-transmissions of a packet results in effective channel codes of gradually lower rates.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Hence, in the case of incremental redundancy, each re-transmission is, in general, different from the previous transmission. This leads to that the combination of information from the erroneously received packet and from the re-transmitted packet may not be carried out using the received symbols before demodulation, in contrast to the case of chase combining. Instead, it may be advisable to demodulate each received transmission or re-transmission of a packet separately and buffer the demodulated bits in the receiver. The soft combining may then be carried out implicitly as part of the decoding process. The decoding process may still use soft information to decode the demodulated bits.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a communication system, transmission resources such as channelization codes in UMTS and physical resource blocks in UMTS LTE may be assigned to a user or a process by a scheduler. A user equipment (UE) may thus be assigned one or several transmission resources. Each base station (or possibly each base station controller) of a communication system commonly comprises a scheduler. Alternatively, each base station may comprise a plurality of schedulers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Transmission resources are orthogonal to each other in most communication systems. In UMTS/HSPA, for example, the channelization codes are made up by Hadamard-Walsh codes, which are known to be mutually orthogonal. In the uplink of UMTS/HSPA, however, the codes are not orthogonal. Thus, the more codes are used in uplink transmission, the more interference is experienced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In UMTS LTE, the physical resource blocks (PRB) are confined within a restricted time-frequency interval. Thus, each PRB is orthogonal in time and frequency to every other PRB used in a particular geographical area (cell).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There exist various strategies applicable to ARQ schemes for controlling transmissions of a packet and for determining when a packet in need for re-transmission should be scheduled. For synchronous traffic, which is characterized by a constant offering of data, a scheduler could reserve a large number of transmission resources for packet transmissions in advance. For example, a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) packet may arrive every 20 ms on the average. Hence, it may be reasonable to schedule a transmission of a VoIP-packet for an ongoing VoIP-process in each time interval of 20 ms in advance. This strategy is also known as persistent scheduling or persistent reservation technique, and reduces the control overhead signaling on the link.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, if a packet needs to be re-transmitted or not, and how many times it needs to be re-transmitted, depends on the error probability of the communication link (that is, the properties of the propagation path). This is a statistical process and may not be predictable. Hence, it is not possible to predict the need for re-transmissions in advance. In persistent scheduling, the re-transmission opportunities are also reserved in advance. Under most (except the worst) channel conditions a large number of these scheduled re-transmission opportunities are not used and the corresponding transmission resources remain empty, which may severely reduce the capacity of the communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An alternative technique for controlling the assignment of re-transmission opportunities is denoted dynamic scheduling. In dynamic scheduling, the re-transmissions are handled by the scheduler in connection to each request for re-transmission. This technique is not as detrimental to the capacity of the communication link as the persistent scheduling technique, but instead it increases the control overhead and the latency. For example, for each re-transmission request in an uplink situation, a scheduling assignment signal may need to be supplied to the scheduler and a scheduling grant message that includes a resource allocation may need to be transmitted to the sender.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is clear from the above that it is not obvious how to control the use of transmission resources for ARQ re-transmissions efficiently. Thus, there is a need for methods and devices for controlling transmission resources for ARQ processes to optimize the link capacity while introducing moderate or no overhead control signaling and latency.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In U.S. Pat. No. 7,181,666 B2 a method to reduce transmission latency is provided, in which a group of users in a system that employs a re-transmission mechanism such as Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) is divided into multiple sub-groups of users. Transmission intervals are altered among the multiple sub-groups of users.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In US 2004/0013102 A1 a wireless communication system is disclosed, which includes a shared time division multiplexed (TDM) data channel. The TDM data channel can be used for automatic re-transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Hou C. et al., &#x201c;Sharing of ARQ slots in Gilbert-Elliot channels&#x201d;, IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 52, no. 12, December 2004, pp. 2070-2072, treat the problem of m transmission slots sharing a pool of n automatic repeat request slots.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is an object of the invention to obviate at least some of the above disadvantages and to provide improved methods and devices for controlling transmission resources for transmission and re-transmission of ARQ processes.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a first aspect of the invention, this is achieved by a method for controlling transmission resources for transmission and re-transmission of packets of a plurality of automatic repeat request processes. The method comprises allocating, for each of the plurality of automatic repeat request processes, a transmission resource for transmission of a packet of the automatic repeat request process, and allocating transmission resources as one or more re-transmission opportunities for re-transmission of the packet of at least two of the automatic repeat request processes such that at least two of the at least two automatic repeat request processes share transmission resource for at least one of the re-transmission opportunities. The method also comprises transmitting at least one control message indicating the allocated transmission resources.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The packet may be punctured by a first puncturing pattern before transmission and by a second puncturing pattern before at least one re-transmission of the packet.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The step of allocating transmission resources for re-transmission may comprise allocating transmission resources for a pre-defined maximum number of re-transmission opportunities of the packet for each of the automatic repeat request processes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method may further comprise grouping the plurality of automatic repeat request processes into a number of groups, and allocating transmission resources as re-transmission opportunities such that the automatic repeat request processes of the same group share transmission resource, and automatic repeat request processes that do not belong to the same group do not share transmission resource.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The grouping step may further comprise letting at least one of the automatic repeat request processes that belongs to a first group for a first re-transmission opportunity of the packet belong to a second group for a second re-transmission opportunity of the packet.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The grouping step may further comprise letting the automatic repeat request processes of a group change between subsequent re-transmission opportunities.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The method may be performed when a first re-transmission opportunity precedes a second re-transmission opportunity. The grouping step may then further comprise letting an average number of groups associated with the first re-transmission opportunity of automatic repeat request processes in a group be smaller than the average number of groups associated with the second re-transmission opportunity of automatic repeat request processes in a group.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The grouping step may further comprise letting the number of groups associated with the first re-transmission opportunity be larger than the number of groups associated with the second re-transmission opportunity.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As already touched upon, it is not obvious how to control the use of transmission resources for ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) re-transmissions efficiently. In the following, embodiments of the invention will be described where transmission resources for ARQ processes are controlled to optimize the link capacity while introducing moderate or no overhead control signalling and latency.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Some of these embodiments are particularly useful for controlling the use of transmission resources for re-transmissions in the uplink. In the uplink, it may be particularly difficult to use dynamic scheduling for allocation of transmission resources due to the increased overhead and latency as explained above. It should be noted, however, that the presented embodiments of the invention may be equally applicable for controlling allocation of transmission resources in the downlink.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Embodiments of the invention will be described with focus on HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest) schemes. It is emphasized, however, that embodiments of the invention are equally applicable to other ARQ schemes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Strictly speaking, a user refers to a user equipment and an ARQ process refers to the process of transmissions and re-transmissions of a packet and to the combining of stored and re-transmitted versions of the packet. In general, each user may have more than one on-going ARQ process, and a transmission resource may be allocated to a user equipment or to an actual ARQ process. Throughout the description, the allocation of transmission resources to ARQ processes will be focused on. It should be noted, however, that embodiments of the invention are equally applicable for the allocation of transmission resources to users.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the description and in the claims, the term transmission resource will be frequently used. This term is meant to denote any physical entity that may be used for transmission during a specified time interval. For example, the transmission resource may be a time slot or transmission time interval. The transmission resource may also be a specific frequency interval or time-frequency block, such as a physical resource block, or a channelization code.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Controlling the allocation of transmission resources for transmissions and re-transmissions of ARQ protocols has, until now, been based on contention-free access. Contention-free scheduling in ARQ protocols implies that no transmission resource is scheduled to be used by more than one process simultaneously, meaning that orthogonality is achieved and there is no possibility of collisions between transmitted packets.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">However, if the load on a transmission resource allocated as a re-transmission opportunity becomes lower, e.g. due to favourable channel conditions, sharing the resource between more than one process would be more efficient. This technique of sharing transmission resources may be denoted contention-based scheduling.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For ARQ protocols in general, and for HARQ protocols in particular, the re-transmission load (the number of allocated transmission resources needed for successful reception of a packet) is reduced for every additional re-transmission. The reason is that the probability of correct packet reception increases for each re-transmission. For ARQ in general the probability increases because the number of transmission trials increases. For HARQ, the probability increases also because the information received in the re-transmitted packet can be combined with the information previously retrieved, and, for the incremental redundancy case, because more redundancy is included in each re-transmission. Hence, it may be advantageous to move from a contention-free scheduling for the initial transmission of a packet, via a contention-based scheduling for the initial re-transmissions where a few processes share the same transmission resource, to a contention-based scheduling for the later re-transmissions where a larger number of processes share the same transmission resource.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">With contention-based access, if two or more processes access the allocated transmission resource at the same time to transmit a packet, a collision results, the deliveries fail, and the packets need to be re-transmitted. Therefore, it may be advantageous if the processes that share transmission resources differ between subsequent re-transmissions. In that way there is a better probability of successful delivery, since, if the processes that share transmission resources would be the same for subsequent re-transmissions, packets that collided during a previous re-transmission will collide again. This variation of which processes are sharing transmission resources may be applied between the different re-transmissions of the same packet, but also between different subsequent packets.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the following example embodiments, the transmission resources will be exemplified by transmission time intervals (TTIs) that may hold e.g. physical resource blocks (PRB) according to the UMTS LTE standard. This is not meant to be limiting to the invention. Contrarily, the transmission resources may comprise any other time intervals such as time slots. The transmission resources may also comprise other physical entities, such as frequency intervals or channelization codes as mentioned before.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of allocation of transmission and re-transmission opportunities according to a contention-free persistent scheduling technique. In this example, there are five processes that can each produce a packet in a time interval <b>110</b>. To further exemplify, the five processes may be associated with VoIP users that each produce a packet every 20 ms. In UMTS LTE, 20 TTIs <b>111</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, <b>113</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, each of 1 ms, fit into a 20 ms VoIP-interval <b>110</b>. Thus, each process may be scheduled for a first transmission and three re-transmissions of a packet within the interval <b>110</b>. Process <b>1</b> may, for example, be scheduled for a first transmission in TTI <b>111</b><i>a</i>, and for re-transmissions in TTIs <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>113</b><i>a </i>and <b>114</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Correspondingly, process <b>2</b> may be scheduled for a first transmission in TTI <b>111</b><i>b</i>, and for re-transmissions in TTIs <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>113</b><i>b </i>and <b>114</b><i>b</i>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In contention-free scheduling, the re-transmissions for each process are allocated separate transmission resources. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the scheduler has reserved 15 TTIs for re-transmissions. As explained before, these TTIs may or may not be used, depending on the error conditions on the communication link. It is realized that the link capacity is efficiently used only at high error probabilities. When the error probability is zero, 75% of the capacity is wasted for the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an example was provided where the data traffic was represented by synchronous traffic such as VoIP, where one data packet needs to be transmitted every 20 ms. It should be noted, however, that other traffic types and other time intervals between packets are equally relevant for embodiments of the invention. It should also be noted that other TTI lengths than 1 ms are possible. For example, a 10 ms TTI is defined in UMTS, a 2 ms TTI is defined for HSPA, and a 1 ms TTI is defined in UMTS LTE. The TTI lengths are usually fixed when a system is deployed. In some systems, the operator may choose different TTI settings.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> show various allocation examples in which a contention-free first transmission is combined with contention-based re-transmissions according to some embodiments of the invention. The time intervals <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>240</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> comprise a various number of TTIs. As mentioned above, it should be noted that the average time between packet arrivals (corresponding to the time intervals <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, . . . , <b>280</b>) may be of any length, and that the transmission resources may comprise any time intervals or other transmission resources as mentioned before.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the first example time interval <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the first five TTIs <b>211</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are used for initial transmissions in the same manner as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For the first re-transmission, however, the allocation is no longer orthogonal. Instead process <b>1</b> and process <b>2</b> share TTI <b>212</b><i>a</i>, and process <b>3</b> and process <b>4</b> share TTI <b>212</b><i>b</i>, while process <b>5</b> is alone to be allocated TTI <b>212</b><i>c</i>. Instead of five reserved TTIs for the first re-transmission as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, only three TTIs are reserved for the first re-transmissions. For the second re-transmission, the load should be lower than for the first re-transmission. Thus, process <b>1</b>, process <b>3</b> and process <b>5</b> share TTI <b>213</b><i>a</i>, and process <b>2</b> and process <b>4</b> share TTI <b>213</b><i>b</i>. It is noteworthy that, in this example, the processes that shared the same TTI during the first re-transmission are not sharing the same TTI during the second re-transmission. In this way, each process may have different contenders for the shared resources during subsequent re-transmissions. Finally, in a third and last re-transmission, all the processes share the same TTI <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">From this example it is clear that the capacity of a link using contention-based scheduling may be much increased compared to a contention-free scheme when practicing embodiments of the invention. With the example scheme used for scheduling interval <b>210</b> only 11 TTIs are required to support five processes with three re-transmissions, compared to the 20 TTIs required in the contention-free scheme illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This is a capacity improvement of almost 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">However, since several processes may share a single TTI in a contention-based scheme, the identity of a re-transmitted packet (i.e., which process it belongs to) is not uniquely defined by the TTI. Hence, there need to be a way to distinguish between re-transmitted packets of different processes. This may be achieved by including a UE identification (UE ID), or a shortened UE ID, in the packet at each re-transmission. Other techniques to distinguish between packets may be used, such as, for example, a UE specific scrambling code. Returning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and turning to the example scheduling interval <b>220</b>, the capacity increase obtained when practicing embodiments of the invention will be demonstrated. In this example, the first eleven TTIs <b>221</b><i>a</i>-<i>k </i>are used for initial transmissions in the same manner as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For the first re-transmission, processes <b>1</b> to <b>10</b> are grouped into pairs of two processes, which share the same TTI <b>222</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>while process <b>11</b> is alone to be allocated TTI <b>222</b><i>f</i>. For the second re-transmission, processes <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>, and <b>11</b> share TTI <b>223</b><i>a</i>, and processes <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>10</b> share TTI <b>223</b><i>b</i>. Again, the processes that shared the same TTI during the first re-transmission are not sharing the same TTI during the second re-transmission. In the third and last re-transmission, all the processes share the same TTI <b>224</b>. Hence, comparing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is clear that more processes may be handled with the same transmission resources and the same number of re-transmission opportunities when practicing embodiments of the invention. In this particular example, eleven processes were handled in 20 TTIs compared to five processes as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The allocation of TTIs in the example scheduling interval <b>230</b> demonstrates how the capacity increase obtained when practicing embodiments of the invention may be utilized for more re-transmissions instead of more processes. In this example, the first five TTIs <b>231</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are used for initial transmissions in the same manner as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For the first, second, third and fourth re-transmissions, four of the processes <b>1</b> to <b>5</b> are grouped into pairs of two processes which share the same TTI <b>232</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>233</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>234</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>235</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, while one process is allocated its own TTI <b>232</b><i>c</i>, <b>233</b><i>c</i>, <b>234</b><i>c</i>, <b>235</b><i>c</i>. For the fifth re-transmission, processes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> share TTI <b>236</b><i>a</i>, and processes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> share TTI <b>236</b><i>b</i>. In the sixth and last re-transmission, all the processes share the same TTI <b>237</b>. Again, the processes that share the same TTI change between different re-transmissions. Comparing again with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is clear that more re-transmissions may be handled with the same transmission resources and the same number of processes when practicing embodiments of the invention. In this particular example, six re-transmissions were handled in 20 TTIs compared to three re-transmissions as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In other embodiments, the capacity increase may be utilized to allow a combination of more processes and more re-transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Studying now <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and the allocation of TTIs in the example scheduling interval <b>240</b>, the use of priority information according to some embodiments of the invention will be elaborated on.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this example, the first six TTIs <b>241</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>are used for initial transmissions. For the first re-transmission, process <b>2</b> is allocated TTI <b>242</b><i>a</i>, processes <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> are allocated TTI <b>242</b><i>b</i>, and processes <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> are allocated TTI <b>242</b><i>c</i>. For the second re-transmission, process <b>2</b> is allocated TTI <b>243</b><i>a</i>, and processes <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> are allocated TTI <b>243</b><i>b</i>. In the fourth and last re-transmission, all the processes share the same TTI <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The processes in a scheduling scheme may be assigned different priorities according to some embodiments of the invention. A process that has been assigned a high priority may be allocated a TTI with less or no contenders. In the above example, process <b>2</b> has no contenders in the first and second re-transmissions allocated in TTIs <b>242</b><i>a </i>and <b>243</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, process <b>2</b> has a better success rate than the other processes.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The use of priority information according to some embodiments of the invention is further exemplified through the allocation of TTIs in the example scheduling interval <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this example, processes <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> are assumed to have been assigned a high priority. The first eight TTIs <b>251</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>are used for initial transmissions. For the first re-transmission, processes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> are organized into two groups of three processes each, and the processes in each group share a TTI <b>252</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. Processes <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> on the other hand are each allocated their own TTI <b>252</b><i>c</i>-<i>d</i>. For the second and last re-transmission, processes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> are allocated TTI <b>253</b><i>a</i>, and processes <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> are allocated TTI <b>253</b><i>b</i>. Hence, in this example processes <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> have better success rates than the other processes.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It should also be noted from the previous examples that all the processes may be scheduled in the same TTI for the last re-transmission but that this is not compulsory, which is seen, for example, in the allocation of transmission resources in interval <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The allocation of TTIs in the example scheduling interval <b>260</b> illustrates that, according to some embodiments of the invention, it is not necessary to apply a contention-based scheduling for all of the re-transmission opportunities.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the example, the first three TTIs <b>261</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are used for initial transmissions. For the first re-transmission, processes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> are each allocated their own TTI <b>262</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. Thus, a contention-free scheduling scheme is used for the first re-transmission. For the second re-transmission, processes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are allocated TTI <b>263</b><i>a</i>, and process <b>3</b> is allocated TTI <b>263</b><i>b</i>. In the fourth and last re-transmission, all the processes share the same TTI <b>264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to example embodiments of the invention, the allocation schemes may also differ between subsequent scheduling intervals. This is demonstrated in the example subsequent scheduling intervals <b>270</b> and <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In scheduling interval <b>270</b>, the first four TTIs <b>271</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are used for initial transmissions. For the first re-transmission, processes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are allocated TTI <b>272</b><i>a </i>and processes <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are allocated TTI <b>272</b><i>b</i>. In the third and last re-transmission, all the processes share the same TTI <b>273</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the subsequent scheduling interval <b>280</b>, the first four TTIs <b>281</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are used for initial transmissions in the same way as for scheduling interval <b>270</b>. For the first re-transmission, however, processes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> are allocated TTI <b>282</b><i>a </i>and process <b>4</b> is allocated TTI <b>282</b><i>b</i>. This may, for example, be because process <b>4</b> was assigned a higher priority before delivering the packet associated with scheduling interval <b>280</b>. In the third and last re-transmission, all the processes share the same TTI <b>283</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It should be noted that, according to example embodiments of the invention, the allocation schemes may differ between subsequent scheduling intervals in other ways, such as, the number of supported processes, the number of re-transmission opportunities for each process, the number of members in a group for a re-transmission, and the identity of the group members for a re-transmission. The example above was illustrating that one reason for changing the scheduling scheme between subsequent re-transmissions may be that one or more processes are assigned new priorities. Other reasons for changing scheduling schemes between subsequent packet arrivals may, for example, be a change in the individual channel conditions of the users associated with the respective process. Processes associated with users having good channel conditions may not need to be allocated many re-transmission opportunities, while processes associated with users having poor channel conditions may need to be allocated more re-transmission opportunities. Information regarding the channel conditions of different users may be derived, for example, from received signal power, packet error rate, or dispersion (using e.g. RAKE finger information or equalizer information).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It should be noted from the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> that the number of TTIs in a scheduling interval may vary. This may be due to that there may be TTIs of various lengths or due to that the packets may arrive in cycles of different lengths, or both. It should also be noted from the examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> that the number of re-transmissions and the number of processes supported may vary. A further variation (not shown in the Figures) is that, in some embodiments, the different processes may each be allocated a different number of re-transmission opportunities.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> a flow chart is shown illustrating a method <b>300</b> for controlling the allocation of transmission resources for transmissions and re-transmissions of a packet according to some embodiments of the invention. The method begins in step <b>310</b>, where the first transmission of the packet is allocated a transmission resource, such as a PRB, TTI, or channelization code. Then, in step <b>320</b>, a transmission resource is allocated as a re-transmission opportunity for the packet. The transmission resource allocated for the re-transmission opportunity may also be allocated as a re-transmission opportunity for one or more other packets according to a contention-based scheduling technique.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Step <b>320</b> is iterated until a maximal number of re-transmission opportunities have been scheduled for the packet, which is tried in step <b>330</b>. Hence, if the maximal number of re-transmission opportunities have not been scheduled (NO path out of step <b>330</b>) the process returns to step <b>320</b>. If, on the other hand, the maximal number of re-transmission opportunities have been scheduled (YES path out of step <b>330</b>) the process continues to step <b>335</b>, where a message is transmitted that indicates the transmission resources that have been allocated for transmission and re-transmission of the packet. This message may comprise information regarding one or many processes and/or users. It may also be divided into several messages each comprising, for example, information regarding allocation for a single transmission or re-transmission. It should be noted that these messages might alternatively be transmitted after each allocation, that is, directly after steps <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> respectively. A further alternative is that the information may be collected for a number of subsequent scheduling intervals and transmitted less frequently. Finally, the process ends in step <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method <b>400</b> for controlling the allocation of transmission resources for transmissions and re-transmissions of packets of a plurality of HARQ processes according to some embodiments of the invention. The method begins in step <b>410</b>, where the first transmissions of the packets are each allocated a transmission resource such as a PRB, TTI, or channelization code. Then, in step <b>415</b>, groups of HARQ processes are formed, where at least one of the groups comprises at least two processes.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In step <b>420</b>, each of the processes is allocated a transmission resource for a re-transmission opportunity. The processes belonging to the same group are allocated the same transmission resource.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Steps <b>415</b> and <b>420</b> are iterated until a maximal number of re-transmission opportunities have been scheduled for the processes This is tried in step <b>430</b>. Hence, if the maximal number of re-transmission opportunities have not been scheduled (NO path out of step <b>430</b>) the process returns to step <b>415</b>. If, on the other hand, the maximal number of re-transmission opportunities have been scheduled (YES path out of step <b>430</b>) the process continues to step <b>435</b>, where a message is transmitted that indicates the transmission resources that have been allocated for trans-mission and re-transmission opportunities for the processes. This message may or may not be divided into several messages each comprising, for example, information regarding a single process and/or a single transmission or re-transmission. It should be noted that these messages might alternatively be transmitted after each allocation, that is, directly after steps <b>410</b> and <b>420</b>. Finally, the process ends in step <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">For the first re-transmission, step <b>415</b> may alternatively be performed before or in parallel with step <b>410</b>. For each re-transmission, step <b>415</b> may be performed less frequently than in each execution of the method <b>400</b>. For example, step <b>415</b> may be performed every 10<sup>th </sup>or every 100<sup>th </sup>execution of the method <b>400</b>. In such cases, the groupings for each re-transmission are remembered and used until new groupings are defined. In fact, step <b>415</b> may be entirely excluded from the method <b>400</b>. In that case, the groupings for the different re-transmissions may be pre-determined. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the process may return to step <b>420</b> instead of step <b>415</b> if the maximal number of re-transmission opportunities has not been scheduled. In these cases, step <b>415</b> may comprise forming the different groups for all of the maximal number of re-transmissions all at once.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">According to some embodiments of the invention, the message that indicates the transmission resources that have been allocated is received by one or more user equipments. If the message comprises information regarding the allocation for several users, each of the users singles out the information applicable to that user. Then each user equipment may transmit packets in accordance with the received allocation information. The packets are received by, for example, a base station, and the base station responds according to the HARQ procedure by sending positive or negative acknowledgement messages (ACK/NACK), which the respective user equipment receives. If a user equipment receives a negative acknowledgement message, it re-transmits the packet associated with the negative acknowledgement message in accordance with the received allocation information, until a positive acknowledgement message is received or a maximal number of re-transmissions have been sent. The user equipment may include distinguishing information, such as a user equipment identification, with each re-transmission of a packet.</p>

The increased capacity may also be used for increasing the number of processes (cf. scheduling interval <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), and/or for improving the robustness (cf. scheduling interval <b>230</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>).
