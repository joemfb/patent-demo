<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Japanese Patent Application 2009-263919, filed on Nov. 19, 2009, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to a lid lock apparatus for a vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND DISCUSSION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A known lid lock apparatus for a vehicle is disclosed in JP2000-8672A (i.e., hereinafter referred to as Patent reference 1). The known lid lock apparatus disclosed in Patent reference 1 includes a retainer provided at a support wall of a lid box formed on a vehicle body, a cap detachably assembled to the retainer, and a lock pin movable relative to the cap and arranged penetrating through the support wall to protrude inside the lid box (i.e., outside the vehicle body). Further according to the known lid lock apparatus disclosed in Patent reference 1, a fuel filler door for opening and closing an opening portion of the lid box is assembled to be tilting relative to the lid box. The fuel filler door is retainable at a closed state by the lock pin (i.e., locked state).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent reference 1 discloses a known lid lock apparatus for a vehicle in which a cap (i.e., referred to as a lock in Patent reference 1) is attachable to and detachable from a retainer assembled to a support wall of a lid box by a manual operation operated outside the lid box (i.e., inside a vehicle body). Patent reference 1 further discloses a modified lid lock apparatus for a vehicle based on the foregoing known lid lock apparatus, in which a cap is attachable to and detachable from a retainer assembled to a support wall of a lid box by a manual operation operated outside the lid box (i.e., inside a vehicle body) and the retainer assembled to the support wall of the lid box is removable from the support wall together with the cap by a manual operation operated inside the lid box (i.e., outside the vehicle body).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the known lid lock apparatus for the vehicle disclosed in the Patent reference 1, because the cap is detachable relative to the retainer provided at the support wall of the lid box by the manual operation operated outside the lid box (i.e., inside a vehicle body), manual operations operated inside the lid box (i.e., outside the vehicle body) are not necessary, which is advantageous. However, according to the constructions disclosed in Patent reference 1, when assembling the cap to the retainer, a positioning operation of the cap relative to the retainer, an inserting operation of the cap to the retainer, and a rotating operation of the cap relative to the retainer are required. Thus, according to the constructions disclosed in Patent reference 1, there are drawbacks that assembling man-hour is large and misassembling is likely to occur because it is difficult for an operator to recognize that the assembling of the cap to the retainer is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, according to the modified lid lock apparatus for the vehicle disclosed in Patent reference 1, notwithstanding the foregoing drawbacks are resolved, the retainer and the cap is removed from the support wall by the manual operation operated at an outside the lid box (i.e., inside the vehicle body) with plural steps including a rotational operation, which deteriorates the workability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A need thus exists for a lid lock apparatus for a vehicle which is not susceptible to the drawback mentioned above.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In light of the foregoing, the disclosure provides a lid lock apparatus for a vehicle, which includes a retainer provided at a support wall of a lid box formed at a vehicle body, a cap detachably assembled to the retainer, a lock pin assembled to move axially relative to the cap, the lock pin being arranged penetrating through the support wall and protruding within the lid box, a lid configured to tilt relative to the lid box and opening and closing an opening portion of the lid box, the lid being configured to be retained at a closed state by the lock pin, the retainer being formed with a fitting portion to which an end portion of the cap is configured to fit from an outside of the lid box towards an inside of the lid box and a first engaging portion formed to be positioned outward of the lid box relative to the fitting portion, and an operational lever portion formed on the cap, the operational lever portion configured to be elastically deformed to tilt by an operation at an outside of the lid box and including a second engaging portion configured to engage with and disengage from the first engaging portion. The second engaging portion of the operational lever portion is elastically engaged with the first engaging portion of the retainer to restrict a disengagement of the cap from the retainer when the operational lever portion is not operated in a state where the end portion of the cap is fitted to the fitting portion of the retainer. The second engaging portion of the operational lever portion is disengaged from the first engaging portion of the retainer to allow the cap to disengage from the retainer when the operational lever is operated to be a tilting state.</p>

The stepped portion <b>14</b> defines a fitting amount of the cap <b>20</b> relative to the retainer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cap <b>20</b> integrally formed with a housing <b>40</b> of the actuator ACT includes an operational lever portion <b>22</b>, and engaging projections <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>serving as a pair. The operational lever portion <b>22</b> is integrally formed with the cap <b>20</b> at a portion which is arranged to be positioned at a lower position in a state where the cap <b>20</b> is assembled to the retainer <b>10</b>. The operational lever <b>22</b> is elastically deformable by a manual operation at an outside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b> to tilt. The operational lever portion <b>22</b> includes a projection portion (i.e., serving as a second engaging portion) <b>22</b><i>a </i>which is engageable with/detachable from the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b>. In those circumstances, configurations of the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> and the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> may be changed. That is, an engaging portion having a projection may be formed at the retainer <b>10</b> and an engaging portion which engages with the engaging portion having the projection may be formed at the operational lever portion <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each of the engaging projections <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>is configured to slidably fit to each of the recess portions <b>12</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>, <b>12</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> of the retainer <b>10</b>, respectively, when the cap <b>20</b> is assembled to the retainer <b>10</b>. The engaging projections <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>are integrally formed with the cap <b>20</b>. Further, each of the engaging projections <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>forms a concave and convex fitting portion between the retainer <b>10</b> and the cap <b>20</b> together with each of the recess portions <b>12</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>, <b>12</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>. In those circumstances, alternatively, the engaging projections may be formed at the retainer <b>10</b> and the recess portions may be formed at the cap <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the lock pin <b>30</b> is assembled within the cap <b>20</b> extending in a moving direction thereof in a state where a seal ring S<b>3</b> is attached thereto. The lock pin <b>30</b> is arranged to penetrate through the cap <b>20</b> and the housing <b>40</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an end portion <b>31</b> of the lock pin <b>30</b> which protrudes into the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b> is configured to engage with and disengage from an engaging hole <b>221</b> formed on the fuel filler door <b>220</b> for opening and closing the opening portion <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b>. A manual operation portion <b>32</b> is provided at an end portion of the lock pin <b>30</b> which protrudes outside the housing <b>40</b>. The manual operation portion <b>32</b> is provided for manually retreating the lock pin <b>30</b> by means of a cable, or a wire, or the like, accessing from an inside of the vehicle in case that an electric motor <b>50</b> of the actuator ACT does not operate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the actuator ACT includes the electric motor <b>50</b> assembled within the housing <b>40</b> made of resin and a converting mechanism <b>60</b>. The electric motor <b>50</b> is activated or stopped by an ON-OFF operation of a switch which is provided at a key for wireless communications. The converting mechanism <b>60</b> converts a rotational output of the electric motor <b>50</b> to an axial output of the lock pin <b>30</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a cover <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is removed from the housing <b>40</b> which houses the electric motor <b>50</b> and the converting mechanism <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The converting mechanism <b>60</b> includes a resin made worm <b>61</b>, a resin made sector gear <b>62</b>, and a resin made pin <b>63</b>. The worm <b>61</b> is assembled to be integrally rotatable with an output shaft <b>51</b> of the electric motor <b>50</b>. The sector gear <b>62</b> is assembled to the housing <b>40</b> to be rotatable and to mesh with the worm <b>61</b>. The pin <b>63</b> is secured to the sector gear <b>62</b> to engage with a long bore <b>33</b> provided at the lock pin <b>30</b>. Because parts of the converting mechanism <b>60</b> are made of resin, the converting mechanism <b>60</b> is lighter than the electric motor <b>50</b> which includes metal parts. The long bore <b>33</b> is formed and arranged so that a longitudinal direction of the long bore <b>33</b> is approximately perpendicular to a moving direction of the lock pin <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to the constructions of the embodiment, when the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is not operated in a state where the end portion <b>21</b> of the cap <b>20</b> is fitted to the insertion hole portion (i.e., serving as a fitting portion) <b>13</b> of the retainer <b>10</b>, the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever <b>22</b> is elastically engaged with the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> to restrict the disengagement of the cap <b>20</b> from the retainer <b>10</b>. Further, when the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is operated upward to be in the tilted state, the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is disengaged from the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> to allow the cap <b>20</b> to be removed from the retainer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are removed from the retainer <b>10</b> together with the actuator ACT by manually pulling the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> towards outside the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b> together with the actuator ACT to disengage the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> from the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> in a state where the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is tilted by a predetermined amount by a manual operation at the outside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b>. By manually pushing the cap <b>20</b> to fit the end portion <b>21</b> of the cap <b>20</b> into the insertion hole portion (fitting portion) <b>13</b> of the retainer <b>10</b> from a state where the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> and the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> is engageable (i.e., the positioning of the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>is conducted), the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are assembled to the retainer <b>10</b> together with the actuator ACT applying an elastic deformation of the operational lever portion <b>22</b>. In the foregoing assembled state, because the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is elastically engaged with the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> to restrict the disengagement of the cap <b>20</b> from the retainer <b>10</b>, the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are appropriately retained by the retainer <b>10</b> together with the actuator ACT.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As explained above, according to the constructions of the embodiment, the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are attachable to and detachable from the retainer <b>10</b> together with the actuator ACT only by a manual operation at an outside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b>. Namely, the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are attachable to and detachable from the retainer <b>10</b> together with the actuator ACT without an operation at an inside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b> and without requiring tools. Further, when attaching and detaching the cap <b>20</b>, the lock pin <b>30</b>, and the actuator ACT, or the like, relative to the retainer <b>10</b>, a rotational operation of the cap <b>20</b>, the lock pin <b>30</b>, and the actuator ACT, or the like, relative to the retainer <b>10</b> is not required. Assembling of the cap <b>20</b>, the lock pin <b>30</b>, and the actuator ACT, or the like, relative to the retainer <b>10</b> is performed by a positioning operation and an inserting operation relative to the retainer <b>10</b>. Further, disassembling of the cap <b>20</b>, the lock pin <b>30</b>, and the actuator ACT, or the like, from the retainer <b>10</b> is performed by a tilting operation (gripping operation) of the operational lever portion and a pulling operation of the cap <b>20</b>, the lock pin <b>30</b>, and the actuator ACT, or the like. Accordingly, maintenance performance of the lid lock apparatus <b>100</b> (i.e., attaching and detaching performance of the cap <b>20</b>, the lock pin <b>30</b>, and the actuator ACT, or the like, relative to the retainer <b>10</b>) is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to the embodiment, because the elastic deformation of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is applied when the cap <b>20</b>, the lock pin <b>30</b>, and the actuator ACT, or the like, are assembled to the retainer <b>10</b>, an engaging noise is generated and an engaging feeling is transmitted to an operator when the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is engaged with the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> at the assembling of the cap <b>20</b>, the lock pin <b>30</b>, and the actuator ACT, or the like, to the retainer <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the operator recognizes the completion of the assembling of the cap <b>20</b>, the lock pin <b>30</b>, and the actuator ACT, or the like, to the retainer <b>10</b> appropriately by the engaging noise and the engaging feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, according to the construction of the embodiment, the concave and convex fitting portion is formed between the retainer <b>10</b> and the cap <b>20</b> by each of the recess portions <b>12</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>, <b>12</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> of the retainer <b>10</b> and each of the engaging projections <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the cap <b>20</b>, and an engaging position of the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> and the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> is positioned at a lower position compared to the concave and convex fitting portion. Accordingly, a supporting rigidity of the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b>, or the like, relative to the retainer <b>10</b> is enhanced by the concave and convex fitting portion, and thus, the vibration resistance performance of the lid lock apparatus <b>100</b> is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, according to the embodiment, the lock pin <b>30</b> is configured to move axially by the actuator ACT, the electric motor <b>50</b> and the converting mechanism <b>60</b> of the actuator ACT are arranged upward of the lock pin <b>30</b>, and the electric motor <b>50</b> is positioned closer to the support wall <b>211</b> compared to the converting mechanism <b>60</b> relative to the support wall <b>211</b>. According to the foregoing construction, compared to the construction in which the converting mechanism <b>60</b> is positioned closer to the support wall <b>211</b> compared to the electric motor <b>50</b> relative to the support wall <b>211</b>, the position of the center of the gravity of the lid lock apparatus <b>100</b> can be positioned closer to the support wall <b>211</b>, which enhances the vibration resistance performance of the lid lock apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the embodiment, the retainer <b>10</b> of the lid lock apparatus <b>100</b> is configured to be attached to and detached from the support wall <b>211</b> of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a retainer <b>10</b>A may be integrally formed on the support wall <b>211</b> of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b> so that the cap <b>20</b> of a lid lock apparatus <b>100</b>A for a vehicle is attached and detached relative to the retainer <b>10</b>A likewise as in the foregoing embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to the embodiment, the lock pin <b>30</b> of the lid lock apparatus <b>100</b> for the vehicle is activated by the actuator ACT. However, the construction of the embodiment is applicable to a lid lock apparatus in which a lock pin is operated by a manual operation (i.e., the actuator ACT is not applied).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the lid lock apparatus <b>100</b>, the operational lever portion <b>22</b> formed on the cap <b>20</b> is elastically deformed by a manual operation at the outside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b> to tilt. In a case where the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is operated to tilt, the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> comes to disengage from the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> to allow the cap <b>20</b> to detach from the retainer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, by pulling the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> towards the outside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b> in a state where the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is tilted in order to disengage the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> from the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b>, the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> can be removed from the retainer <b>10</b>. Further, the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> can be assembled to the retainer <b>10</b> by pushing the cap <b>20</b> to fit the end portion <b>21</b> of the cap <b>20</b> to the fitting portion of the retainer <b>10</b> using the elastic deformation of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> in a state where the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> and the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> are engageable (i.e., the positioning of the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> and the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> are performed). According to the foregoing assembling state, the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is elastically engaged with the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> to restrict the disengagement of the cap <b>20</b> from the retainer <b>10</b>. Thus, the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are appropriately retained by the retainer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the constructions of the embodiment, the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are attachable to and detachable from the retainer <b>10</b> only by a manual operation at an outside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b>, and thus the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are detachable from the retainer <b>10</b> without an operation at an inside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b> and without requiring tools. Further, when attaching or detaching the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> relative to the retainer <b>10</b>, a rotational operation of the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> relative to the retainer <b>10</b> is not required. Assembling of the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> relative to the retainer <b>10</b> is performed by a positioning operation and an inserting operation relative to the retainer <b>10</b>. Further, disassembling of the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> relative to the retainer <b>10</b> is performed by a tilting operation (gripping operation) of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> and a pulling operation of the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b>. Accordingly, maintenance performance of the lid lock apparatus <b>100</b> (i.e., attaching and detaching performance of the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> relative to the retainer <b>10</b>) is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the embodiment, because the elastic deformation of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is applied when the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are assembled to the retainer <b>10</b>, an engaging noise is generated and an engaging feeling is transmitted to an operator when the projection portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> is engaged with the engaging portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> at the assembling of the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> to the retainer <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the operator recognizes the completion of the assembling of the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> to the retainer <b>10</b> appropriately by the engaging noise and the engaging feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the embodiment, the lid lock apparatus <b>100</b> includes a pair of engaging projections (concave and convex fitting portions) <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>formed between the retainer <b>10</b> and the cap <b>20</b> to be fitted from an outside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b> towards an inside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b>. The engaging projections (concave and convex fitting portions) <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>are positioned away from the support wall <b>211</b> relative to the fitting portion <b>13</b>. An engaging position of the projection portion (second engaging portion) <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the operational lever portion <b>22</b> and the engaging portion (first engaging portion) <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>10</b> is positioned at a position which is offset from a facing direction of the engaging projections (concave and convex fitting portions) <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the construction of the embodiment, the support rigidity of the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b>, or the like, relative to the retainer <b>10</b> is enhanced by the concave and convex fitting portions, and thus the vibration resistance performance of the lid lock apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>A is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to the embodiment, the lock pin <b>30</b> is configured to move axially by means of the electric motor <b>50</b> and the actuator ACT which includes the converting mechanism <b>60</b> conversing a rotational output of the electric motor to an axial movement of the lock pin <b>30</b> and the housing <b>40</b> accommodating the electric motor <b>50</b> and the converting mechanism <b>60</b>. The housing <b>40</b> and the cap <b>20</b> are integrally formed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the construction of the embodiment, because the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are attachable to and detachable from the retainer <b>10</b> only by a manual operation at an outside of the fuel filler lid box <b>210</b>, even if the actuator ACT including the motor <b>50</b> and the converting mechanism <b>60</b> is provided for actuating the lock pin <b>30</b> to move along a longitudinal direction, the cap <b>20</b> and the lock pin <b>30</b> are attached to and detached from the support wall <b>211</b> together with the actuator ACT without increasing the size of the attaching hole formed on the support wall and the size of the retainer covering the attaching hole.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the embodiment, the electric motor <b>50</b> and the converting mechanism <b>60</b> are positioned upward of the lock pin <b>30</b> and the electric motor <b>50</b> is arranged closer to the support wall <b>211</b> compared to the converting mechanism <b>60</b> relative to the support wall <b>211</b> in a state where the lock pin <b>30</b> is assembled to the cap <b>20</b> attached to the retainer <b>10</b> provided at the support wall <b>211</b>.</p>
