<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Several chaos-based random bit generators have been proposed. Until now, systems, have theoretically been produced, which generate perfect random bit streams. However, the practical implementation is usually critical since often several constraints must be verified, e.g. over process variations, power supply, temperature, in order to keep the circuit in a chaotic evolution. Many problems are associated with designing a robust random bit generators based on a chaotic system, and many challenges stand in the way of producing a chaotic system which has none or minimal constraints to keep the system in a chaotic regime.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific details and embodiments in which the invention may be practiced.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration&#x201d;. Any embodiment or design described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or designs.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a synchronous frame/line sweep signal <b>110</b> of a synchronized saw-tooth oscillator. The synchronized saw-tooth oscillator may be used to generate synchronous frame/line sweep signals, e.g. as signals used in analog TV.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Every time a synchronization edge <b>102</b>, e.g. <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, arrives during the rising edge <b>104</b>, e.g. <b>104</b>A, <b>104</b>B, <b>104</b>C of the signal, the signal slope and direction change, e.g. to falling edge <b>106</b>, e.g. <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B, <b>106</b>C. If the synchronization signal, e.g. the synchronization edge <b>102</b>, forces a slope change, the change in slope may be referred to as a synchronization event <b>102</b>. As slope <b>106</b> after the synchronization trigger <b>102</b> is steeper, i.e. it falls faster, than the slope <b>104</b> before it, the oscillator gets synchronized.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a synchronization condition <b>210</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, if &#x394;T<sub>i </sub>is the delay between two rising edges, the delay after the synchronization event, e.g. after <b>102</b>B, will be:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;<i>T</i><sub>i+1</sub><i>=&#x394;T</i><sub>i</sub><i>S</i>1<i>/S</i>2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">S<b>1</b> may be the slope before synchronization event, e.g. <b>102</b>B. S<b>2</b> may be the slope after synchronization event <b>102</b>B. S<b>1</b> may be less than S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">After n synchs, it results that: &#x394;T<sub>i+n</sub>=&#x394;T<sub>i</sub>k<sup>n </sup></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">where k=|S<b>1</b>|/|S<b>2</b>| may be less than 1 (as gradient S<b>1</b> may be less than S<b>2</b>). Therefore the relative delay tends to zero which means the oscillator may become synchronized, independently from its starting phase.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Vice versa, if k is greater than 1, in other words if the gradient S<b>1</b> is greater than gradient of S<b>2</b>, the initial phase difference may be exponentially amplified and the oscillator may become chaotic. It may be understood that the synchronization condition may depend on the ratio of the absolute value of the slopes and it may not be necessary that the synchronization event changes the sign, i.e. direction, of the slope.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a chaotic saw tooth oscillator. The chaotic oscillator may have a different behavior, e.g. complementary behavior, to the synchronized saw-tooth oscillator. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the synchronization event <b>302</b>, e.g. synchronization signal <b>302</b>A, <b>302</b>B, <b>302</b>C etc, may be active on the falling edge <b>306</b> and, therefore, may result in k larger than 1 (as slope before synchronization event <b>302</b> is larger than slope after synchronization event <b>302</b>), therefore, forcing a a chaotic evolution.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a chaotic oscillator circuit <b>410</b>. A capacitor <b>412</b> with capacitance C may be charged up with a time constant R<sub>1</sub>C via resistor R<sub>1 </sub><b>414</b>, as long as a reference voltage Vmax <b>416</b> may be reached. Reaching Vmax <b>416</b> may set a set-reset SR-latch <b>418</b> which stops the charging phase and starts discharging C with a time constant R<sub>2</sub>C via resistor R<sub>2 </sub><b>422</b>. Resistance values R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>1 </sub>may be selected wherein time constants R<sub>2</sub>C may be smaller than R<sub>1</sub>C. In other words, the gradient of the discharge slope may be larger than the gradient in charging slope. If, during the discharging phase (falling edge), a synchronization event occurs, circuit <b>410</b> switches back to the charging phase. A drawback of the solution is the constraint on the frequency of the synchronization signal <b>402</b> which must be satisfied in order to maintain the chaotic evolution. In other words, the frequency of the synchronization signal must be fast enough to have at least one synchronization event <b>402</b> during the time the oscillator <b>410</b> needs for a complete falling edge <b>406</b> from Vmax to Vmin, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. If this condition is not satisfied and/or verified as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> and the oscillator <b>410</b> saturates at Vmin, the circuit may be synchronized by the next synchronization event <b>402</b> and may lose the memory of its previous chaotic evolution. i.e. the state is reset.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, if the frequency of the synchronization signal <b>402</b> is too high, the oscillator <b>410</b> may be forced to oscillate with very small amplitude close to Vmax and the non-idealities of the circuit, e.g. comparator offset, may become dominant. Therefore, a bilateral condition of the synchronization frequency must be satisfied, e.g. over corners, e.g. power supply, e.g. temperature in order to preserve the chaotic oscillation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Various embodiments provide a chaotic saw-tooth oscillator wherein the constraint of the frequency of the synchronization signal may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a generated chaotic signal <b>510</b> according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">If the signal generator, e.g. the oscillator, reaches Vmin before a synchronization event occurs, the oscillator may behave as a free oscillator, i.e. changing its slope and thus avoiding that the state be saturated.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In other words, only the ratio k between the absolute values of the two slopes (gradients), i.e. S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> may be important for the chaotic evolution. In other words, maintaining a chaotic evolution may no longer depend on frequency of the synchronization events.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, chaotic evolution may be guaranteed whenever the system evolves according to the following conditions (1), (2), (3) and (4):</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">(1) Fast [sync] to Slow. In other words, the synchronization event <b>502</b> may force a change from fast to slow slope. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, synchronization event <b>502</b>A may force a change from fast falling slope <b>506</b>A with gradient S<b>1</b> to a slow rising slope <b>504</b>A with gradient S<b>2</b>, wherein S<b>1</b> is larger than S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">(2) Slow [(v=Vmax) or (v=Vmin)] to Fast. In other words, saturation at Vmax and Vmin may force a change from slow to fast slope. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, saturation at Vmax of slow rising slope <b>504</b>A may force a change from slow slope <b>504</b>A with gradient S<b>2</b> to fast slope <b>506</b>B with gradient S<b>1</b>.</p>
