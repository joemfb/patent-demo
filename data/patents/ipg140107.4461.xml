<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention comprises a plurality of timely organized ad hoc data communications networks and a method for data communication. A network from the plurality of networks includes media-independent communications links and plurality of network nodes, where a network node in the plurality could be coupled to at least one other network node via a media independent communication link, and a plurality of access points, where each access point in the plurality is coupled to at least one other access point via another media-independent communications link. The network communicates during a data collection cycle that includes a broadcast interval, a time-slotted communications interval and a random access time-slotted communications interval. The plurality of network nodes are arranged in a self-assigned hierarchy where one or more nodes in the plurality of network nodes can be assigned more than one time slot to transmit the network information messages.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to computer networks, and in particular wireless computer networks and network protocols.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In certain locations, such as residential, commercial and industrial buildings, etc., it may be desirous to monitor, control and/or collect information (e.g., node information) generated by one or more sensors and/or measuring or control devices distributed throughout the location. Previous inventions have disclosed network nodes operable to wirelessly transmit and receive its respective network node information to and from a centralized location.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, it is believed that such a system is difficult to implement, considering low power transmission requirements and possibly disadvantageous environmental conditions, if at least one of the network nodes is blocked, for example, by an obstacle, ambient noise, interference, etc., from transmitting or receiving its related node information.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,850,511 and 7,002,944, hereby incorporated by reference herein, teach a timely organized wireless ad hoc network or networks to overcome these shortcomings. But, each network node in the plurality of network nodes is assigned only one time slot during the time-slotted communications interval. Such a network does not provide for the network node to report more information than can fit within an assigned time slot and does not provide advantageous error handling.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a need for improved communication protocols in a timely organized wireless ad hoc network.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention comprises a timely organized ad hoc data communications network's and a method for data communications. The networks includes a media-independent communications links and a plurality of access points, where some the access points from the plurality of access points is coupled to at least one other access point via the media-independent communications link and some other access points from the plurality of access points are coupled together via another media-independent communication link, thereby creating several non-synchronized data communication networks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The networks communicate data through a data collection cycle that includes a broadcast interval, a time-slotted communications interval and a random access time-slotted communications interval. The plurality of network nodes are arranged in a self-assigned hierarchy where to one or more nodes, having multiple appearances, in the plurality of network nodes will be assigned more than one time slot to transmit network node information messages.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The wireless networks communicates data using access points (APs), network nodes (NNs), media-independent network nodes (MINNs) and device radios (DRs) during a data collection cycle. The data collection cycle includes a broadcast interval, an assigned time-slotted communications interval and a random access time-slotted communications interval. Within each network, a plurality of network nodes are arranged in a self-assigned hierarchy where one or more nodes in the plurality of network nodes can be assigned more than one time slot to transmit network node information messages. Inside a network from the plurality of networks in order to reduce the number of intervening transmissions, groups of media-independent network nodes are connected together via media-independent communication links. Information transmitted wirelessly by a MINN appears on the media-independent communication link, thus allowing other MINN's connected to the same media-independent communication link to share the same wireless information no matter how disadvantageous the wireless environmental conditions is. A group of MINN's connected through a media-independent communication link could also be connected to at least one access point from the same timely organized ad hoc network in order to further reduce the number of intervening transmissions (number of hops) between a node in the network and the destination, for example, an access point.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">During the intervening transmissions the NN or DR or MINN do not need to wait until one of it's packet reaches the destination after a round trip. The device could start sending the next packet transmission (e.g., transmit several packets at the same time in the same network) thereby reducing the time required to transmit the whole message consisting of several packets.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is seen a first exemplary ad hoc wireless network <b>100</b> according to the present invention. Wireless network <b>100</b> includes a plurality of network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, some which are media independent network nodes (<b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>n</i>), at least one access point <b>120</b>, a local server (with database) <b>130</b> communicatively coupled to the access point <b>120</b>, media independent communication link <b>135</b> communicatively coupling media independent network nodes, an internal network <b>145</b> and an external network <b>140</b> communicatively coupled to the local server (with database) <b>130</b>, a device radio <b>160</b> communicatively coupled to at least one of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, and a central server (with database) <b>150</b> communicatively coupled to the external network <b>140</b>. Wireless ad hoc network <b>100</b> may be used, for example, to communicate node information within or outside a structure, such as an apartment building, a house, an office building, a residential building, a commercial building, an industrial building, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The local server (with database) <b>130</b> includes a workstation, which executes specific software algorithms for monitoring and controlling devices connected to at least one of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>or to the device radio <b>160</b>. The local server (with database) <b>130</b> collects and stores information and presents the information to a user connected to the same local network <b>145</b>, for example, an Intranet.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The at least one access point <b>120</b> is the final destination of node information transmitted by one or more of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>. The node information may be received from or transmitted to one or more sensors, measuring and control devices (not shown), and may include, for example, the temperature of a room, lighting conditions of a room, energy usage, smoke and CO detector data, elevator(s) conditions, door activation data, heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system parameters and controls, pressure data, vibration data, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The device radio <b>160</b> functions similarly to at least one of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, except that the device radio <b>160</b> is battery powered and does not participate in network routing. For this purpose, the device radio <b>160</b> is configured to communicate with at least one network node during the random access time interval (or specially assigned time interval), after which the device radio may, for example, enter a &#x201c;sleep mode&#x201d; to conserve energy.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The central server (with database) <b>150</b> is responsible for collecting information from at least one local server, as well as from at least one database. The central server (with database) <b>150</b> is also configured to monitor and control the one or more sensors and/or measuring devices (not shown) connected to the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>and/or to the device radio <b>160</b>. The central server (with database) <b>150</b> may also be communicatively coupled to other computers, for example, via an Internet connection. In this manner, the central server (with database) <b>150</b> is operable to provide services to users wishing to control the ad hoc wireless network <b>100</b> from at least one remote location.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The external network <b>140</b> may include, for example, a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), an Intranet, the Internet, etc. The external network <b>140</b> communicatively couples the local server (with database) <b>130</b> with the central server (with database) <b>150</b>. In this manner, the external network <b>140</b> permits the local server (with database) <b>130</b> and the central server (with database) <b>150</b> to communicate across relatively large distances.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The local server (with database) <b>130</b> is configured to provide information concerning the layout of the physical site, within which the ad hoc wireless network is implemented. The local server (with database) <b>130</b> is also configured to update newly added sensors and/or measuring devices (not shown) connected to the ad hoc network. The central server (with database) <b>150</b> may, for example, provide software updates, new administration information, new software parameters, etc., to the local server (with database) <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When wirelessly transmitting node information to the access point <b>120</b>, each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>may utilize any radio communication method suitable for multiple access communications, such as spread spectrum, Frequency Division Multiple Access, and/or Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A spread spectrum communication method, which may include Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) or Frequency Hoping Spread Spectrum (FHSS), &#x201c;spreads&#x201d; a transmitted signal across a frequency bandwidth much greater than that necessary to send the original signal. For this purpose, the signal may be spread using a pseudorandom code independent of the signal. This may result in many benefits, such as immunity to interference and jamming. After transmission, a spread spectrum receiver synchronizes to the spread spectrum signal (i.e., acquires the spread spectrum signal) and de-spreads the data. The use of independent respective pseudorandom codes allows multiple users, for example, the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, to simultaneously transmit in the same frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">FDMA is yet another radio communication method that permits multiple access communications. In FDMA, each of the multiple users, for example, the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, is assigned a unique frequency bandwidth, within which it may transmit its node information. The mutual exclusivity of each of the unique frequency bandwidths permits each of the multiple users, for example, the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, to transmit its respective node information at the same time without interference.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">TDMA is still another radio communication method that permits multiple access communications. In TDMA, each of multiple users, for example, the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, is assigned a specific time slot, during which it may transmit its node information. In this manner, TDMA permits the users to access the same frequency bandwidth at different times. As discussed below, any radio communications method that permits timely organized radio communication may be used. In this manner, it is believed that a timely organized radio communication method, introduces order into an otherwise random transmission multi-node ad hoc wireless network. In this manner, a timely organized radio communication method, may allow for a robust, self-building, self-routing, dynamic ad hoc network architecture, which is easily expandable.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the various exemplary ad hoc networks according to the present invention described below, a timely organized radio communication method is utilized. However, persons having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the present invention is independent of any modulation schemes, such as phase modulation schemes, frequency modulation schemes, amplitude modulation schemes, pulse modulation schemes and/or any combination of these modulation schemes. Furthermore, although the timely organized radio communication method described below utilizes a single frequency band, persons having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the present invention may simultaneously utilize different frequency bands to increase the number of network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>and/or the amount of information capable of being transmitted through the network.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is seen an exemplary timely organized data collection cycle <b>200</b> according to the present invention, data collection cycle <b>200</b> being indefinitely repetitive. Data collection cycle <b>200</b> is divided into a broadcast interval <b>210</b><i>c</i>, an assigned time-slotted communications interval <b>210</b><i>a</i>, and a random access time-slotted communications interval <b>210</b><i>b</i>. The assigned time-slotted communication interval <b>210</b><i>a </i>includes a plurality of assignable time slots <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n</i>, and the random access time-slotted communication interval <b>210</b><i>b </i>includes a plurality of random access time slots <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>220</b><i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">At any given time, each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, is either assigned to one of the assignable time slots <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n </i>or assigned to none of the assignable time slots <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n</i>. If a network node, for example, network node <b>110</b><i>a</i>, is not assigned to one of time slots <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n</i>, that node transmits node information during one of the random access time slots <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>220</b><i>n </i>of the random access time-slotted communication interval <b>210</b><i>b</i>, until the network node receives information from the access point <b>120</b> that permits it to determine which of time slots <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n </i>to transmit node information in.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">After determining the assignable time slot <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n </i>within which to transmit, the network node, for example, network node <b>110</b><i>a</i>, stops transmitting during the random access time-slotted communication interval <b>210</b><i>b </i>and begins transmitting during its newly assigned time slot <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n </i>of the assigned time-slotted communication interval <b>210</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, there is seen a block diagram of an exemplary network node (NN) <b>300</b> according to the present invention. Network node <b>300</b> includes a microprocessor <b>310</b>, a transceiver <b>315</b> communicatively coupled to the microprocessor <b>310</b>, a device <b>320</b> also communicatively coupled to the microprocessor <b>310</b>, a communication buffer <b>312</b>, and a power supply <b>325</b> for providing power to each of the microprocessor <b>310</b>, the transceiver <b>315</b>, the communication buffer <b>312</b>, and the device <b>320</b> via power bus <b>330</b>. The device <b>320</b> may be, for example, a sensor, a measuring and/or controlling device, or an interface. Network Node <b>300</b> could include an optional media independent communication interface <b>335</b>. When the optional media independent communication interface is connected to a media independent communication link the network node <b>300</b> will be a media independent network node (MINN) <b>300</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>n</i>. All wirelessly transmitted messages from MINN <b>300</b> will appear on the media independent communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, there is seen a block diagram of an exemplary access point <b>350</b> according to the present invention. Access point <b>350</b> includes a microprocessor <b>355</b>, a transceiver <b>360</b> communicatively coupled to the microprocessor <b>355</b>, a primary media independent communications interface-1 (for access points and/or local server) <b>365</b> and a secondary media independent communications interface-2 (for the MINN's) <b>336</b>, communicatively coupled to the microprocessor <b>355</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The access point <b>350</b> operates as a communication interface to the radio transceiver <b>360</b>, the local server (with database) <b>130</b> and to other access points (not shown), using independent communication processes. For this purpose, the access point <b>350</b> may be provided, for example, with a communication buffer (not shown). It is believed to be advantageous to provide large area installations with a plurality of distributed access points, each of which is communicatively coupled to the same communication line or network. In this manner, each of the access points operates independently, i.e., with no master-slave relationships.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In operation, each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>is operable to wirelessly communicate its respective node information to the access point <b>120</b> via its respective transceiver <b>315</b>. In this manner, each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>operates as a source of information to be transmitted. A source network node transmits its respective node information only during its assigned time slot <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n</i>, or during one of the random access time slots <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>220</b><i>n </i>if the none of the time slots <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n </i>are assigned to the source network node.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Additionally, each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>is operable to repackage and retransmit node information transmitted by at least one neighboring network node <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>. This &#x201c;retransmission&#x201d; may be required, for example, if a neighboring network node <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>is prevented from directly transmitting its node information to the access point <b>120</b>, for example, due to obstacles, interference, noise, jamming, power limitations, propagation losses, etc. In this case, a &#x201c;transmission chain&#x201d; is utilized, in which a &#x201c;chain&#x201d; of network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>serially retransmits the node information originally transmitted by a source network node (i.e., the network nodes that originates the node information). In this manner, the node information has a higher probability of reaching the access point <b>120</b>. A network node retransmitting information during a &#x201c;chain transmission&#x201d; (intervening transmission), does so during the time slot <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>d </i>assigned to the source network node, or during one of the random access time slots <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>220</b><i>n </i>(which is chosen by the source network node itself) if none of the time slots <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n </i>are assigned to the source network node.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>dynamically assigns itself a hierarchal level based on information (e.g., data packets) received from other network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>. The hierarchal level is self-assigned in accordance with the shortest path to the access point <b>120</b>. That is, the hierarchal level depends on the number of intervening transmissions to other network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>required to ensure that the original transmission (i.e., node information) reaches the access point <b>120</b>. Thus, if a network node, for example, network node <b>110</b><i>a</i>, is capable of transmitting its node information to the access point directly, without an intervening transmission to another network node, it will self-assign a hierarchal level that is different (e.g., lower) than the hierarchal level of another network node that must initiate at least one intervening transmission to a neighboring network node to ensure that its node information reaches the access point <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one exemplary embodiment according to the present invention, the access point is assigned a hierarchal level of, for example, &#x201c;1&#x201d;, and each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>assigns itself a hierarchal level, for example, equal to the incremented minimum hierarchal level of the neighboring (e.g., intervening) network nodes it is capable of directly communicating with. For this purpose, each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>transmits data packets including that node's hierarchal level, as well as an ID value that uniquely identifies the transmitting network node. These transmitted data packets may be received by neighboring network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, each of which stores the transmitted hierarchal level and the transmitting network node's ID value in a Last In First Out (LIFO) memory buffer, so that the ID and hierarchal level of the neighboring network node with the lowest hierarchal level is kept at the top of the LIFO stack. In this manner, when a particular one of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>transmits node information (e.g., data packets), the node information is addressed and sent to the network node and/or the access point <b>120</b> at the top of the stack (or to the network node addressed by a PARENT_ID, as more fully described below).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is seen an exemplary ad hoc network <b>400</b> according to the present invention, in which network nodes have self-assigned hierarchal levels.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It should also be noted that, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows only four network nodes <b>410</b><i>a</i>, <b>410</b><i>b</i>, <b>410</b><i>c</i>, <b>410</b><i>d </i>and one access point <b>420</b>, the timely organized ad hoc wireless network <b>400</b> may include any number of network nodes and any number of access points, for example, one or many network nodes and one access point, five network nodes and three access points, 7100 network nodes and six access points, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It should also be noted that, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows each of network nodes <b>410</b><i>a</i>, <b>410</b><i>b</i>, <b>410</b><i>c</i>, <b>410</b><i>d </i>self-assigning a hierarchal level that increases with the required number of intervening transmissions, the hierarchal level may be assigned in other ways.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is seen the exemplary ad hoc wireless network <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in which the access point <b>420</b> transmits acknowledgment and/or command information to network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>to acknowledge receipt of node information originally transmitted by source network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>and/or give some command to source network node <b>410</b><i>c</i>. In this exemplary embodiment, network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>is the &#x201c;source&#x201d; of node information transmitted during one of its assigned time slot <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n </i>or random access time slots <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>220</b><i>n</i>. To ensure that the node information transmitted by network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>reaches the access point <b>420</b>, network node <b>420</b><i>b </i>engages in a &#x201c;chain transmission&#x201d; by retransmitting the node information to the access point <b>420</b>. After receiving the node information originated by source network node <b>410</b><i>c</i>, the access point <b>420</b> transmits acknowledgment and/or command information to source network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>via the same transmission path (i.e., the same chain transmission path) used to communicate the node information to the access point <b>420</b>, except in reverse order. Thus, the access point <b>420</b> transmits the acknowledgment and/or command information to network node <b>410</b><i>b</i>, after which network node <b>410</b><i>b </i>retransmits the acknowledgment and/or command information to source network node <b>410</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The communications between the access point <b>120</b> and each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>may be accomplished, for example, using differently formatted data packets, for example, three differently formatted data packets. Below is described an exemplary 3-type data packet communications scheme for communications between the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>and the access point <b>120</b>. Alternatively, other types of data communications schemes may be employed, such as a 2-type data packet scheme, a 5-type data packet scheme, etc, and each of the packets may be transmitted, for example, as a serial stream of smaller packets, if and when the communication channel becomes less reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As stated above, the exemplary timely organized ad hoc wireless network <b>100</b> may utilizes a 3-type data packet communications scheme, which may include, for example, a broadcast data packet (BCDP), a network node data packet (NNDP), and a acknowledge/command data packet (CDP).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The BCDP data packet is a data packet transmitted by the access point <b>120</b> to all of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>during the broadcast interval <b>210</b><i>c </i>of each data collection cycle <b>200</b>. To help ensure that all of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>receive the BCDP data packet, each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, receiving the BCDP subsequently retransmits the BCDP data packet after a randomly calculated delay. In this manner, the BCDP has a higher probability of reaching all the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, <b>110</b><i>n</i>. The BCDP data packet contains information that permits the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>to synchronize to one another. This &#x201c;synchronization&#x201d; may be necessary, for example, in a timely organized time-slotted communication method, since each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>must determine its time to transmit information (TTT) with respect to all other network nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The NNDP data packet is a data packet transmitted by one of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, the NNDP data packet being ultimately destined for the access point <b>120</b>. The NNDP data packet contains node information received from one or more sensors, measuring and/or controlling devices (not shown). The node information may include, for example, the temperature of a room, lighting conditions of a room, energy usage, etc. The NNDP data packet is originally transmitted by a source network node and repackaged and retransmitted by at least one neighboring network node, if a &#x201c;chain transmission&#x201d; is required to ensure that the NNDP data packet reaches the access point <b>120</b>. Both the original transmission of the NNDP data packet and any required retransmissions of the NNDP data packet occur during the same time slot used by the source network node to transmit the NNDP data packet (i.e., one of assignable time slots <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>d </i>or random access time slot <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>220</b><i>n</i>). In a timely organized communication method, for example, each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>may originally transmit at least one NNDP data packet during its assigned time slot. Depending on its self-assigned hierarchical level, the NNDP may be directly transmitted to the access point <b>120</b> or may be transmitted to at least one other network node <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, if a chain transmission is required. The NNDP data packet contains the respective node information, as well as auxiliary information used by other network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>for routing the node information to the access point <b>120</b>, if a chain transmission is required.

The optional command information may include, for example, at least one command to be executed by the source network node. The command may, for example, turn off/on an air conditioner, regulate the opening of the steam valve for heating, set and update certain parameters for a local controller, turn on an alarm, display certain message(s), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The access point <b>120</b> transmits the CDP data packet during the same time slot used by the source network node to transmit the NNDP data packet(s) (i.e., during one of assignable time slots <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>d </i>or random access time slot <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>220</b><i>n</i>) <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In one exemplary embodiment according to the present invention, the access point <b>120</b> transmits the CDP data packet to the source network node using the same path (i.e., the same transmission chain) used by the source network node to transmit its NNDP data packet(s) to the access point <b>120</b>.

In this manner, the access point <b>120</b> may receive the NNDP data packet(s) transmitted during the random access communications interval <b>210</b><i>b</i>, after which it may transmit appropriately addressed CDP data packets.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is seen further detail of an exemplary data packet structure <b>600</b> according to the present invention. Each of the BCDP, NNDP, and CDP data packets may include, for example, 12 bytes (<b>0</b> through <b>11</b>). Bytes <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> are a combination of a Series No <b>610</b> (&#xbd; Byte), indicating the data collection cycle number originated by the access point, and a to_ID <b>615</b> (1&#xbd; Bytes) that uniquely identifies the intended destination of the data packet, such as one of the neighboring network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>or the access point <b>120</b>. For a BCDP data packet, the to_ID <b>615</b> does not address a particular network node, since every network node <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>is an intended destination of the BCDP data packet. Instead, the to_ID may be set to, for example, all binary is (hexadecimal: FFF). The first nibble (i.e., 4 bits) of byte <b>2</b> contains the from_hierarchical_level <b>620</b>, which is either the hierarchal level of the transmitting network node, or the hierarchical level of the transmitting access point <b>120</b> (e.g., &#x201c;1&#x201d;). The second nibble of byte <b>2</b> and byte <b>3</b> contain a from_ID <b>625</b> that uniquely identifies either the transmitting network node, i.e., one of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>or the transmitting access point <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Bytes <b>4</b> <b>9</b> contain the main_information <b>630</b>. The format and content of the main_information <b>630</b> depend on the type of data packet (e.g., BCDP, NNDP, CDP), as described below. Bytes <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> contain checksum_info <b>635</b> used to store a calculated checksum of the transmitted data packet. This may permit, for example, the intended destination of the data packet to detect bit errors in a received data packet and, if necessary, initiate appropriate measures. In lieu of or in addition to checksum_info <b>635</b>, bytes <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> may contain other information suitable to detect and/or correct errors in the received data packet, such as a hash code, error correction codes, etc.</p>

Byte <b>6</b> contains a synchro_delay <b>715</b>, which is used by the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>to synchronize to one another. Synchronization may be necessary, for example, in a timely organized communications scheme, in which each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>is assigned a respective time slot <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n</i>, within which to transmit its information. The synchro_delay <b>715</b> is set in accordance with a subsequent time at which the network node assigned to the first time slot <b>215</b><i>a </i>should begin transmission of a first NNDP data packet. Each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>uses the synchro_delay <b>715</b> to calculate a timeout between the moment of receiving the BCDP data packet and this subsequent time to transmit. Upon retransmitting the BCDP data packet to neighboring network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>, each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>recalculates and changes the synchro_delay <b>715</b> by subtracting a value representing the delay between receiving the BCDP data packet and retransmitting it.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there is seen an exemplary data packet processing sequence <b>1025</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">During the BCDP data packet processing step <b>1120</b>, the network node synchronizes to other network nodes, thereby permitting the network node to determine the start of its respective time slot <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n</i>. For this purpose, it is determined whether the network node's currently assigned time slot, i.e., MY_SLOT, is set to the &#x201c;null&#x201d; time slot. MY_SLOT will be assigned the &#x201c;null&#x201d; time slot, for example, upon powering up the network node or, for example, if the network node loses its assigned time slot (e.g., if the access point <b>120</b> does not receive NNDP data packet(s) originated by the network node or if the network node does not receive a CDP data packet acknowledging the received NNDP data packet(s) originated by the network node).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In this exemplary embodiment according to the present invention, the &#x201c;null&#x201d; time slot is time slot &#x201c;0&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">If the network node's time slot (MY_SLOT) is set to the &#x201c;null&#x201d; time slot, i.e., the 0.sup.th time slot, the network node configures itself to transmit during one of the random access time slots <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>220</b><i>n </i>of the random access communications interval <b>210</b><i>b</i>. To determine which of the random access time slots <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>220</b><i>n </i>to transmit in, the network node uses the information contained in the BCDP data packet, for example, the synchro_delay <b>715</b>, the time slot_length <b>720</b>, and the total_slots <b>725</b>. Using this information, the network node may determine its time to transmit, for example, by the following equation: Time to Transmit (TTT)=synchro_delay <b>715</b>+(total_slots <b>725</b>+random integer)*time_slot_length <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The random access time slotted interval may, for example, have a fixed amount of time slots or, alternatively, a certain percentage of the total number of assigned time slots may be assigned to the random access time slotted interval, for example, 10%.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">After the network node synchronizes, i.e., determines the time to transmit, the synchro_delay <b>715</b> of the BCDP data packet is recalculated, and then the modified BCDP data packet is stored in a transmit buffer for subsequent retransmission during the Broadcast interval <b>210</b><i>c </i>after a random delay. The random delay is necessary to prevent simultaneous retransmission of the BCDP data packet by those network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n </i>receiving the BCDP data packet essentially at the same time. The synchro_delay <b>715</b> is recalculated before each retransmission of the BCDP data packet to ensure, or at least makes more probable, that the synchro_delay <b>715</b> will expire at the same time for each of the network nodes <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>110</b><i>n</i>.

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">If the data packet received is an NNDP data packet transmitted by a neighboring network node, step <b>1125</b> is executed, in which it is determined whether the NNDP data packet is an acknowledgment NNDP data packet. A received NNDP data packet is an acknowledgment NNDP data packet if the NNDP data packet is a retransmission of the network node's NNDP data packet by a neighboring network node. For example, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, after network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>transmits an NNDP data packet to network node <b>410</b><i>b</i>, network node <b>410</b><i>b </i>retransmits the NNDP data packet to the access point <b>420</b>. Network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>also receives this retransmission of the NNDP data packet from network node <b>410</b><i>b </i>to the access point <b>420</b>. By receiving the retransmission of the NNDP data packet, network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>verifies that network node <b>410</b><i>b </i>received the original transmission of the NNDP data packet from network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>to network node <b>410</b><i>b </i>(i.e., network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>verifies the integrity of the transmission chain). That is, with respect to node <b>410</b><i>c </i>the NNDP data packet is an acknowledgment or verification data packet. For this purpose, network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>checks the from_ID <b>625</b> and the main information <b>630</b> (i.e., the parameter_number <b>810</b>, the source_ID <b>815</b>, and the parameter_value <b>820</b>) of the NNDP data packet. If the from_ID <b>625</b> of the NNDP data packet transmitted by network node <b>410</b><i>b </i>is the same as the to_ID <b>615</b> of the NNDP data packet transmitted by network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>to network node <b>410</b><i>b</i>, and the main information <b>630</b> of the NNDP data packet transmitted by network node <b>410</b><i>b </i>is the same as the main information <b>630</b> of the NNDP data packet transmitted by network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>to network node <b>410</b><i>b</i>, the NNDP data packet is considered an acknowledgment NNDP data packet. Thus, if, for example, network node <b>410</b><i>b </i>fails to retransmit the NNDP data packet to the access point <b>420</b>, for example, due to noise or interference blocking the original transmission of the NNDP data packet from network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>to network node <b>410</b><i>b</i>, network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>may retransmit the NNDP data packet to a different neighboring network node. In this manner, network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>may ensure, or at least make it more likely, that its NNDP data packet will eventually reach the access point <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, if the NNDP data packet is an acknowledgment NNDP data packet, step <b>1130</b> is executed, in which the network node stores the from_ID <b>625</b> and the from_hierarchal_level <b>620</b> of the NNDP data packet as the PARENT_ID and a PARENT_H_LVL, respectively. Then, the network node assigns itself a hierarchal level (i.e., MY_H_LVL) equal to the PARENT_H_LVL+1. In this manner, all subsequent data packets will be addressed to the network node identified by the PARENT_ID, until communications fails, i.e., until an acknowledgment NNDP data packet is not received or until a neighboring network node with a lower hierarchal level is detected (see below).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">If it is determined, in step <b>1125</b>, that the received data packet is not an NNDP acknowledgment data packet, this indicates that the received packet is either a non-acknowledgment type NNDP data packet or a CDP data packet addressed to another network node. The network node ignores these types of packets, with the exception of the processing performed by step <b>1135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In step <b>1135</b>, the LIFO stack is updated if the received data packet has a from_hierarchal_level <b>620</b> that is either less than or equal to the hierarchal level of the network node's ID currently stored at the top of the LIFO stack. Effectively, the network node processes data packets not addressed to the network node to ensure that at least one neighboring network node's ID and hierarchal level is stored at the top of the LIFO stack. The LIFO stack, the PARENT_ID, and PARENT_H_LVL comprise the dynamic self-routing protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">If the received data packet is addressed to the network node, step <b>1140</b> is executed, in which packets addressed to the network node are processed. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, there is seen an exemplary sequence <b>1140</b> for processing data packets addressed to the network node. If the received data packet is addressed to MY_ID, i.e., the network node, then the received data packet is either a CDP data packet destined for the network node (i.e., the destination_ID <b>910</b> is equal to MY_ID), a CDP data packet destined for another network node (i.e., the destination_ID <b>910</b> is not equal to MY_ID), or an NNDP data packet transmitted by another network node and destined for the access point <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In step <b>1210</b>, it is determined whether the received data packet is a CDP data packet. If not, step <b>1230</b> is executed, in which the network node processes the NNDP data packet transmitted by another network node. As described above, the network node may be the intended destination of the NNDP data packet, if the source network node (i.e., the source of the NNDP data packet) requires intervening transmission to other network nodes to ensure that its respective node information reaches the access point. For example, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, network node <b>410</b><i>c </i>must transmit its NNDP data packet(s) to <b>410</b><i>b</i>, which then retransmits the NNDP data packet(s) to the access point <b>420</b> (i.e., the final destination of the NNDP data packet(s)). Thus, network node <b>410</b><i>b </i>is the intended destination of the NNDP data packet transmitted by network node <b>410</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the network node copies the from_ID <b>625</b> of the NNDP data packet to the internal memory variable LAST FROM_ID. This step is required because the access point <b>120</b> will subsequently transmit a CDP data packet to the source of the NNDP data packet using the same transmission chain, but in reverse order. Thus, when the current network node subsequently receives a CDP data packet destined to the source of the current NNDP data packet, the network node will retransmit the CDP data packet to the network node identified by the LAST_FROM_ID. The network node also copies the destination_ID <b>910</b> of the CDP data packet to the variable LAST_SOURCE. In this manner, the network node keeps track of the source of the NNDP data packet.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Then, step <b>1235</b> is executed, in which the network node determines which neighboring network node to retransmit the NNDP data packet to by changing the to_ID <b>615</b> of the NNDP data packet to either the PARENT_ID or the ID at the top of the LIFO stack. In this manner, the network node will retransmit the NNDP data packet to the neighboring network node identified by the PARENT_ID, unless an acknowledgment NNDP data packet was not detected from the PARENT_ID or if the network node at the top of the LIFO stack has a hierarchal level less than the PARENT_H_LVL, in which case the network node will retransmit the NNDP data packet to the neighboring network node identified by the ID at the top of the LIFO stack. If the network node retransmits the NNDP data packet to the neighboring network node identified by the ID at the top of the LIFO stack, the ID is then removed from the stack. In this manner, the LIFO stack is constantly updated with current routing information.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Then, step <b>1240</b> is executed, in which the modified NNDP data packet is loaded in the transmit buffer. Before doing so, however, the network node updates the from_hierarchal_level <b>620</b> and the from_ID <b>625</b> of the NNDP data packet to indicate the hierarchal level (i.e., MY_H_LVL) and ID (i.e., MY_ID) of the network node, respectively. In this manner, the NNDP is retransmitted to the next neighboring network node in the transmission chain or, alternatively, is transmitted directly to the access point <b>120</b>. The network node transmits the NNDP directly to the access point <b>120</b> if the network node is the last network node in a transmission chain or if the network node is a source network node neighboring the access point <b>120</b> (i.e., the network node's hierarchal level permits direct transmission to the access point).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">If step <b>1210</b> indicates that the received data packet is a CDP data packet, step <b>1215</b> is executed, in which it is determined whether the CDP data packet is destined for the current network node (i.e., whether the destination_ID <b>910</b> is equal to MY_ID). If so, step <b>1220</b> is executed, in which the information contained in the CDP data packet is used to determine the network node's assigned time slot <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n</i>. Specifically, the network node copies time_slot <b>930</b> of the CDP data packet to the variable MY_SLOT. Then, step <b>1225</b> is executed, in which it is determined whether the access point <b>120</b> requires the network node to execute a command based on the command_type <b>915</b> and the command_parameters <b>925</b> of the CDP data packet. If so, the network node decodes and executes the command.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">If step <b>1215</b> indicates that the CDP data packet is not destined for the current network node (i.e., the destination_ID <b>910</b> of the CDP data packet is not equal to MY_ID), step <b>1245</b> is executed, in which the network node loads the CDP data packet into the transmit buffer for subsequent transmission to the neighboring network node identified by the LAST_FROM_ID. For this purpose, the network node modifies the CDP data packet by changing the to_ID <b>615</b> to LAST_FROM_ID, the from_ID <b>625</b> to MY_ID, and the from_hierarchal_level <b>620</b> to MY_H_LVL.

Then, step <b>1320</b> is executed, in which the network node determines which neighboring network node to transmit the newly packaged NNDP data packet(s) to by setting the to_ID <b>615</b> of the NNDP data packet to either the PARENT_ID or the ID at the top of the LIFO stack. Specifically, the network node will transmit the NNDP data packet(s) to the neighboring network node identified by the PARENT_ID, unless an acknowledgment NNDP data packet is not detected from the network node identified by the PARENT_ID or if the network node at the top of the LIFO stack has a hierarchal level less than the PARENT_H_LVL.

This retransmission of the CDP acknowledgment data packet may be used by neighboring network nodes, for example, to help determine an assigned time slot. The reliability of the CDP acknowledge message may be increased, for example, by allowing the source network node to retransmit the CDP acknowledge data packet with lower power. In this case, the CDP acknowledge data packet would be received only by neighboring network nodes, the communication links of which permit reliable communication with the source network node.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">It should be appreciated that each of the network nodes <b>1410</b><i>a</i>, <b>1410</b><i>b</i>, <b>1410</b><i>c </i>may transmit more than one NNDP data packet within its respective time slot.

However, for exemplary purposes only, network node <b>1410</b><i>c </i>transmits three NNDP data packets within its assigned time slot <b>215</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">To communicate the three data packets during time slot <b>215</b><i>c</i>, network node <b>1410</b><i>c </i>may transmit all three NNDP data packets to network node <b>1410</b><i>b </i>before network node <b>1410</b><i>b </i>retransmits all three NNDP data packets to access point <b>1420</b>. By waiting until all three NNDP data packets are received before retransmission of the NNDP data packets, network node <b>1410</b><i>b </i>avoids collisions which may occur if network node <b>1410</b><i>c </i>transmits a successive NNDP data packet while network node <b>1410</b><i>b </i>is retransmitting a previously received NNDP data packet. However, this method of communicating multiple NNDP data packets may be time-consuming if the number of network nodes involved in the chain communication between network node <b>1410</b><i>c </i>and access point <b>1420</b> is too large, as each network node involved in the chain transmission would require a dedicated block of time to receive all NNDP data packets before retransmission.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">To avoid such excessive delays, in an alternative embodiment, network node <b>1410</b><i>c </i>transmits each NNDP data packet in succession with a time delay between transmission of successive NNDP data packets. This time delay should be made large enough to ensure that a network node receiving the NNDP data packet retransmission (i.e., network node <b>1410</b><i>b </i>in this example) has enough time to retransmit the NNDP data packet to the next device in the chain (i.e., access point <b>1420</b> in this example) and to receive an &#x201c;acknowledgement&#x201d; packet from the next device before network node <b>1410</b><i>c </i>transmits the next NNDP data packet. It should be appreciated that, although network node <b>1410</b><i>b </i>is capable of communicating directly with access point <b>1420</b>, a similar delay between successively transmitted NNDP data packets would be required if network node <b>1420</b><i>b </i>could not communicate directly with access point <b>1420</b>, but rather could only communicate directly with another network node, for example, network node <b>1410</b><i>a</i>. In this case, the &#x201c;acknowledgement&#x201d; packet received by network node <b>1410</b><i>b </i>would be the NNDP data packet retransmitted by network node <b>1410</b><i>a </i>to access point <b>1420</b>. In either case, the time delay between successively transmitted NNDP data packets should be made large enough to ensure that the network node receiving the NNDP data packet in the chain transmission (i.e., network node <b>1410</b><i>b </i>in this example) has enough time to retransmit the NNDP data packet and to receive an NNDP &#x201c;acknowledgement&#x201d; packet before network node <b>1410</b><i>c </i>transmits subsequent NNDP data packets. In doing so, several packets may be transmitted simultaneously and not interfere with each other. Having several non-interfering packets transmitted by different network nodes at the same time shortens the time required for chain transmission of multiple packets in a time slot.</p>

Each respective time-out period may be determined, for example, in accordance with the unique ID (i.e., MY_ID) assigned to each access point <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . <b>1605</b><i>n</i>. If the time-out period of a particular access point <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . <b>1605</b><i>n </i>expires, that access point will wirelessly transmit a BCDP data packet, while simultaneously (or some time thereafter) transmitting a copy of the BCDP data packet to the remaining access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>via link <b>1615</b>. Once a particular access point transmits its BCDP data packet, that particular access point remains dormant until the end of the broadcast interval (i.e., until the synchro_delay expires). The remaining access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n</i>, however, do not remain dormant. Rather, upon receiving the BCDP data packet over link <b>1615</b>, each of the remaining access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>restarts its time-out period, and the BCDP transmit cycle repeats within the broadcast interval <b>210</b><i>c </i>until all remaining access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>transmit a BCDP data packet.

For example, with respect to one exemplary embodiment, each of access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>subtracts an appropriate amount of time (e.g., time units) from the Synchro_Delay number <b>715</b> representing a time delay between receipt of a BCDP data packet over MI link <b>1615</b> and retransmission of the BCDP data packet to network <b>1600</b>.

After ad hoc network <b>1600</b> powers up, all devices connected to MI link <b>1615</b> (e.g., access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>and/or server <b>150</b>) begin a power-on timeout counter to ensure that all access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>have enough time to initialize. After the power-on timeout expires (see step <b>1760</b>), broadcast time interval <b>210</b><i>c </i>begins in step <b>1765</b>. At this stage of the sequence, each device connected to MI link <b>1615</b> (e.g., access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>and/or server <b>150</b>) resets an internal clock to begin countdown of an internal &#x201c;time-out&#x201d; period, which is used to mark a transmit time for a BCDP data packet. Since the time-out periods differ from one another (see above), no two time-out periods will expire at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Once the time-out period of one of the access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>expires (see step <b>1770</b>), that access point, for example, access point <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, wirelessly transmits a BCDP data packet to the network nodes <b>1610</b><i>a</i>, <b>1610</b><i>b</i>, <b>1610</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>1610</b><i>n </i>(see step <b>1775</b>) and then remains dormant for the remainder of the broadcast time interval <b>210</b><i>c </i>(see step <b>1780</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, there is seen a second exemplary data collection cycle <b>1900</b> according to the present invention, data collection cycle <b>1900</b> being indefinitely repetitive. Data collection cycle <b>1900</b> is divided into a main data collection cycle <b>1910</b>, supplementary data collection cycle <b>1920</b> and one or more additional supplementary data collection cycles <b>1930</b>. The main collection cycle <b>1910</b> further divided into a broadcast interval <b>210</b><i>c</i>, an assigned time_slotted communications interval <b>210</b><i>a</i>, and a random access time_slotted communications interval <b>210</b><i>b</i>. The supplementary data collection cycle <b>1920</b> is divided into a supplementary broadcast interval <b>210</b><i>d </i>and a supplementary random access time-slotted communications interval <b>210</b><i>e </i>having supplementary random access time slots <b>1920</b><i>a</i>, <b>1920</b><i>b</i>, <b>1920</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>1920</b><i>n</i>.

During the supplementary broadcast interval <b>210</b><i>d</i>, all access points (e.g., access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) transmit BCDP data packets in much the same way as the transmission of BCDP data packets during the normal broadcast interval <b>210</b><i>c</i>. Any network node that did not receive a BCDP data packet transmitted during the normal broadcast interval <b>210</b><i>c </i>or any network node that did not receive a CDP data packet intended for the network node (e.g., due to a transient obstacle) may retransmit an NNDP data packet during one of the supplementary random access time slots <b>1920</b><i>a</i>, <b>1920</b><i>b</i>, <b>1920</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>1920</b><i>n </i>of the supplementary random access time slotted communications interval <b>210</b><i>e</i>. One of the access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>may then transmit an additional CDP data packet to the network node. In this manner, the transmitting access point may assign one of the assignable time slots <b>215</b><i>a</i>, <b>215</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>215</b><i>n </i>to the network node without having to wait until the end of the next data collection cycle <b>1900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">It should be appreciated that not every data collection cycle <b>200</b>, <b>1900</b> need include the supplementary broadcast interval <b>210</b><i>d </i>and the supplementary random access time slotted communications interval <b>210</b><i>e</i>. These intervals <b>210</b><i>d</i>, <b>210</b><i>e </i>are only helpful if at least one network node <b>1610</b><i>a</i>, <b>1610</b><i>b</i>, <b>1610</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>1610</b><i>n </i>lost synchronization. Access points <b>1605</b><i>a</i>, <b>1605</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>1605</b><i>n </i>can determine this event by simply comparing the number of network nodes transmitting NNDP data packets in the previous data collection cycle <b>200</b>, <b>1900</b> to the number of network nodes transmitting NNDP data packets in the current data collection cycle <b>200</b>, <b>1900</b>.

<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, there is seen multiple exemplary timely organized ad hoc networks including network nodes having soft dependencies. The exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> includes two timely organized ad hoc networks <b>2100</b><i>a</i>, <b>2100</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Network <b>2100</b><i>a </i>is a multiple access point network similar to the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Network <b>2100</b><i>a </i>includes two access points (A &#x26; B) <b>2105</b><i>a</i>, <b>2105</b><i>b </i>and a server <b>2120</b><i>a </i>coupled to one another over media-independent communication link <b>2115</b><i>a </i>(hereinafter &#x201c;MI Link <b>2115</b><i>a</i>&#x201d;). These devices <b>2105</b><i>a</i>, <b>2105</b><i>b</i>, <b>2120</b><i>a </i>communicate with network nodes <b>2110</b><i>a</i>, <b>2110</b><i>b</i>, <b>2110</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>2110</b><i>g</i>. Network <b>2100</b><i>b </i>is a single access point network similar to the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>a </i>through <b>14</b><i>l</i>. Network <b>2100</b><i>b </i>includes one access point <b>2105</b><i>c </i>and a server <b>2120</b><i>b </i>coupled to one another over media-independent communication link <b>2115</b><i>b </i>(hereinafter &#x201c;MI Link <b>2115</b><i>b</i>&#x201d;). These devices <b>2105</b><i>a</i>, <b>2105</b><i>b</i>, <b>2120</b> communicate with network nodes <b>2110</b><i>h</i>, <b>2110</b><i>i</i>, <b>2110</b><i>j</i>, . . . , <b>2110</b><i>l</i>. It should be appreciated, however, that there may exist any number of networks, each of which may include any number of access points, servers, and network nodes. It should also be appreciated that, although networks <b>2100</b><i>a</i>, <b>2100</b><i>b </i>include separate respective servers <b>2120</b><i>a</i>, <b>2120</b><i>b </i>at separate locations, servers <b>2120</b><i>a</i>, <b>2120</b><i>b </i>may be located in the same generally vicinity and/or networks <b>2100</b><i>a</i>, <b>2100</b><i>b </i>may be managed by a single server.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, network node <b>2110</b><i>g </i>is capable of communicating with both networks <b>2100</b><i>a</i>, <b>2100</b><i>b</i>. That is, network node <b>2110</b><i>g </i>is capable of direct communication with access point (B) <b>2105</b><i>b </i>of network <b>2100</b><i>a </i>and with network node <b>2110</b><i>h </i>of network <b>2100</b><i>b</i>. As described more fully above, a network node can determine its hierarchal position within a particular network by processing BCDP or CDP data packets transmitted by an access point and/or by processing NNDP data packets transmitted by neighboring network nodes. If a particular network node is capable of communicating with more than one independent network (e.g., network node <b>2110</b><i>g </i>in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>), that network node can determine its relative hierarchal level within each network, and then dynamically &#x201c;soft-affiliate&#x201d; itself to a particular network based on a predefined set of rules. For example, with respect to the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, network node <b>2110</b><i>g </i>will &#x201c;soft affiliate&#x201d; itself with the network requiring the least number of intermediate transmissions (i.e., hops) during a chain communication (i.e., the network within which network node <b>2110</b><i>g </i>will have the lowest hierarchal level). However, it should be appreciated that network node <b>2110</b><i>g </i>may affiliate itself to a particular network based on other rules, for example, to a particular network requiring the least amount of power to transmit, or to a particular network having at least one desired &#x201c;type&#x201d; of network node. Regarding the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, network node <b>2110</b><i>g </i>is at a hierarchal level of &#x201c;2&#x201d; with respect to access point <b>2105</b><i>b </i>of network <b>2100</b><i>a </i>and at a hierarchal level of &#x201c;4&#x201d; with respect to access point <b>2105</b><i>c </i>of network <b>2100</b><i>b</i>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, network node <b>2110</b><i>g </i>&#x201c;affiliates&#x201d; itself with network <b>2100</b><i>a</i>. Of course, upon power-up, a network node (e.g., network node <b>2110</b><i>g</i>) does not know its relative hierarchal level with respect to either network <b>2100</b><i>a</i>, <b>2100</b><i>b</i>. Thus, upon power-up, network nodes may initially affiliate themselves based on other rules (e.g., a network node can affiliate itself with the network from which it receives the first BCDP data packet).</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Once affiliated to a network, a particular network node (e.g., network node <b>2110</b><i>g </i>in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>), that network node will retransmit BCDP data packets only from the affiliated network. That is, network nodes retransmit only those BCDP data packets transmitted from the affiliated network. With respect to the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, for example, network node <b>2110</b><i>g </i>will retransmit only those BCDP data packets transmitted from affiliated network <b>2100</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, the affiliated network node may monitor data packets from neighboring networks to check if its hierarchal level within a non-affiliated network has changed to a level that is below the hierarchal level in the affiliated network. For example, if a particular network node has a hierarchal level of &#x201c;3&#x201d; in a first network and a hierarchal level of &#x201c;4&#x201d; in a second network, this network node will affiliate itself with the first network. However, if changing environmental conditions (e.g., interference, jamming, multipath, fadings, moving objects, etc.) cause the network node to have a lower hierarchal level within the second network for certain period of time, the network node can change its affiliation and begin communicating within the second network. By monitoring data packets from both the first and second networks, the network node can dynamically change its affiliation to an access point of a network having better characteristics for chain transmission. The ability to change affiliations from one access point of one network to another access point from another network is referred to herein as &#x201c;Soft-Dependencies.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, network nodes are &#x201c;hard affiliated&#x201d; (i.e., hard-dependency) with a particular network. Hard dependencies may be required, for example, if two independent wireless networks are located close together, and &#x201c;cross-communication&#x201d; between the networks is not desired. For example, if two different owners of two different (but adjacent) apartment complexes employ an ad hoc network according to the present invention, it would not be desirable for one of the owners to be capable of receiving data transmitted by the network of the other owner, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">If a particular network node if &#x201c;hard affiliated&#x201d; to a particular network, that network node will communicate only within the affiliated network, regardless of whether the network node can receive data packets from a different network, and regardless of whether the hierarchal level of the network node would be lower in a non-affiliated network. With respect to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, &#x201c;hard-affiliation&#x201d; is effectuated by assigning a network identifier to each network node. The identifier uniquely identifies the network within which it must communicate. The identifier may comprise, for example, information identifying a particular access point or groups of access points within a particular network or &#x201c;authorized&#x201d; group of networks.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">With respect to another exemplary embodiment according to the present invention, extended functionality is achieved by implementing different types of BCDP data packets in addition to the &#x201c;standard&#x201d; BCDP data packet structure discussed above. In this manner, different types of communication modes may be initiated (and identified) by the transmission of the respective types of BCDP data packets. For this purpose, each BCDP data packet may include information (data bits) permitting the network nodes in the network to determine the type of BCDP data packet and, hence, the type of communications mode data initiated by the BCDP data packet. This information may be embedded, for example, into at least a portion of the RESERVED space identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. For example, the first nibble of Byte <b>8</b> (RESERVED) of the BCDP data packet may be used to identify the &#x201c;type&#x201d; of BCDP data packet, with a &#x201c;0000&#x201d; identifying a first type of BCDP data packet, a &#x201c;0001&#x201d; identifying a second type of BCDP data packet, and so on. As can be readily appreciated by those in the art, the bit space of the RESERVED nibble of Byte <b>8</b> (i.e., four bits) will allow up to 16 different types of BCDP data packets. However, it should be appreciated that any amount of bit space may be utilized to accommodate any desired number of BCDP data packet types. For example, the RESERVED nibble of Byte <b>7</b> may be additionally used to expand the number of BCDP data packet types to 256 BCDP data packet types (i.e., 8 bits).</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Regardless of which type of BCDP data packet is transmitted, each BCDP data packet is transmitted by the access point(s) during the broadcast time interval <b>210</b><i>c</i>, and each BCDP data packet (regardless of type) is received and retransmitted by the network nodes in a manner, similar to that described above, to ensure that all network nodes of the network receive and decode the BCDP data packet.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Of course, the first type of BCDP data packet is the &#x201c;standard&#x201d; BCDP data packet described in detail above, and it is this standard BCDP data packet which initiates (and identifies) the beginning of a &#x201c;standard&#x201d; communications mode and begins a &#x201c;standard&#x201d; data collection cycle <b>200</b>, <b>1900</b>. A second &#x201c;type&#x201d; of BCDP data packet (called a Device Oriented BCDP data packet) may be used to initiate a special type of communications mode, within which information from only a single &#x201c;type&#x201d; of network node is required to be received by an access point. For example, if a timely organized ad hoc network according to the present invention is installed in a large apartment building, each of the network nodes may be operable to monitor one or more parameters in its vicinity using one or more sensors and/or measuring devices. The measured parameters may include, for example, the temperature of a room, lighting conditions of a room, energy usage, smoke and CO detector data, elevator(s) conditions, door activation data, HVAC system parameters, pressure data, vibration data, etc. If, at a particular point in time, the access point required information only from those network nodes capable of monitoring temperature (i.e., a type of network-node capable of measuring temperature), it would be wasteful to initiate a standard communications mode containing a standard data collection cycle <b>200</b>, <b>1900</b>, in which all network nodes transmit NNDP data packets to the access point, including those that are not of the type capable of monitoring temperature. Thus, to prevent such wasteful utilization of time and resources, the server or access point(s) may transmit a Device Oriented BCDP data packet to all of the network nodes in the timely-organized ad hoc network, so that only those network nodes of the desired type will respond. This may allow for a shorter data collection cycle if less than the entire number of network nodes in the network are of the type identified by the Device Oriented Node BCDP data packet.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">In certain situations, it may be desirable to understand the efficiency of a particular timely-organized ad hoc network. That is, it may be desirable to understand, for example, how many network nodes are capable of communicating directly with the access point(s) without requiring a chain transmission. For this purpose, another type of BCDP data packet, called a Local BCDP data packet, may be employed. Transmission of the Local BCDP data packet will initiate a special type of communications mode (i.e., a local vicinity mode), in which only those network nodes that are capable of communicating directly with the access point(s) (i.e., network nodes having a hierarchal level of &#x201c;2&#x201d;) transmit NNDP data packets during the assigned or random access time-slotted communications interval <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In certain situations, it may be desirable to send the same command to every network node. For example, at the start of winter, it may be desirable to raise the thermostat setting of every apartment in a large apartment complex. If a timely-organized ad hoc network according to the present invention is employed in the complex, and the network nodes arranged in the respective apartments are capable of controlling the thermostats, it would be desirable to change the thermostat settings of all apartments to the same level.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">If the server and/or access point(s) were to initiate a standard communications mode and standard data collection cycle using a standard BCDP data packet, the thermostat adjustment commands would be communicated to the network nodes using numerous respective CDP data packets, in a manner more fully described above&#x2014;one CDP data packet for each network node in the ad hoc network. However, by transmitting a Global Command BCDP data packet, the server and/or access point(s) may send the same command to all network nodes using a single packet during a Global Command Communication mode. The Global Command BCDP data packet contains embedded information (data bits) instructing all network nodes to perform the same command, for example, to set all the thermostats of all apartments to the same level.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Since the data collection cycle initiated by the Global Command BCDP data packet is intended only to communicate commands to the network nodes, NNDP data packet transmission from network nodes to access point(s) is not required and, as such, may be dispensed with. However, it should be appreciated that a data collection cycle could be initiated by a Global Command BCDP data packet also. In this case the network nodes will transmit NNDP data packets during either or both of the assigned or random access time-slotted communication intervals <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Another type of BCDP data packet is the Direct Command BCDP data packet. This packet initiates a communications mode (i.e., the Direct Command communication mode), in which only a single network node, identified by the BCDP data packet, communicates NNDP data packets during either or both of the assigned or random access time-slotted communication intervals <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>. The remaining network nodes not identified by the Direct Command BCDP data packet will remain dormant until the next BCDP data packet is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">It should be appreciated that each type of BCDP data packet could also be initiated by any device connected to the media-independent communication link, by one of the plurality of network nodes, or by one of the plurality of device radios.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In accordance with another example embodiment of the present invention, it may be desirable for one or more of the network nodes to communicate important and/or time sensitive information in an &#x201c;alarm situation&#x201d;&#x2014;i.e., a situation of particular importance that may require immediate attention. When a network node or a device radio detects an alarm situation, for example, if the network node detects fire or smoke, a special communications mode (i.e., an Alarm Broadcast communication mode) may be initiated by the network node itself by transmitting a Alarm BCDP data packet. The Alarm BCDP data packet is received and retransmitted by all network nodes in much the same manner as with regular BCDP data packets, in a manner more fully described above. It is believed that the Alarm Broadcast communications mode is a fast and reliable way for a network node or device radio to transmit information relating to the alarm conditions to the access point(s) and/or server. In another example embodiment, an alarm condition &#x201c;wakes up&#x201d; the device radio from sleep or idle mode and the device radio generates the Alarm Broadcast BCDP data packet containing the alarm information. The Alarm broadcast could be addressed to certain Access Points from the network if the alarm information is important only for the selected access points only.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">In an alternative preferred embodiment, one or more network nodes can be assigned more than one time slot. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates an operational flow diagram for data communication during an exemplary data collection cycle where one or more nodes can be assigned more than one time slot according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a repeating data cycle. Entering the cycle at step <b>2110</b>, the network waits for the next data collection cycle. In step <b>2120</b>, a new data collection cycle starts and a broadcast interval starts. The access points transmit the broadcast communications data packet data packet during the broadcast interval. The BCDP data packet are then received by network nodes. Each of network nodes processes the BCDP data packet to determine the specific access point that originally sent the packet, since a section of a BCDP identifies a transmitting access point.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Timers are synchronized in step <b>2130</b> so that the server, the access points and the network nodes are aware of the temporal position within the cycle. In step <b>2140</b>, the network nodes rebroadcast. During rebroadcast, the network nodes transmits a copy of the NNDP data packet to the access points. This &#x201c;retransmission&#x201d; is received by network nodes, thereby permitting the network nodes to acknowledge that the NNDP data packet transmitted from network node was actually received by network node. That is, the retransmitted NNDP data packet is also an &#x201c;acknowledgment&#x201d; NNDP data packet.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The time-slotted communications interval begins in step <b>2150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In step <b>2160</b>, if the network node does not have a pending assigned time slot, then the cycle skips to step <b>2190</b>. If there is a pending assigned time slot, the cycle continues to step <b>2165</b>. In step <b>2165</b>, the network nodes wait for the next time slot to begin.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In step <b>2170</b>, the network node checks whether the current time slot belongs to it. Either the current time slot is assigned to the network node, or the node has chosen the time slot during the random access interval, as explained further below. If the time slot does not belong to the network node, the method continues with step <b>2160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In step <b>2175</b>, if the timeslot belongs to the network node, the network node transmits its node information message in one or more data packets during the time slot. In step <b>2180</b>, the node obtains one or more assigned time slots for the next data collection cycle. In step <b>2185</b>, the network node checks that its transmissions were acknowledged and that it obtained assigned time slots for the next data collection cycle. If any transmissions were not acknowledged or time slots in the next cycle were not assigned, processing continues at step <b>2160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Turning to step <b>2190</b>, a network node determines whether it has more information to transmit. If not, processing passes to the next cycle at step <b>2110</b>. If so, in step <b>2195</b> the node chooses a time slot in the random access interval. Then in step <b>2197</b>, the node checks whether the current data collection cycle has expired. If not, control passes to step <b>2165</b> where the node waits in steps <b>2160</b>-<b>2170</b> until the chosen random access time slot occurs so that the node can transmit information in step <b>2175</b>. Additional supplementary data collection cycles can occur after the main data collection cycle has ended. Each supplementary data collection cycle comprises additional random access time slots that the network node can choose from.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Having thus described at least illustrative embodiments of the invention, various modifications and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art and are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description is by way of example only and is not intended as limiting. The invention is limited only as defined in the following claims and the equivalents thereto.</p>
