<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to fuel dispensing systems and, more particularly, to a spill containment apparatus to reduce or eliminate the likelihood of fuel spilling into the environment during a fuel tank fill operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fuel dispensing systems used at retail gas stations typically include an underground storage tank containing gasoline, diesel fuel, or other liquid fuel, an above-ground dispensing unit terminating in a nozzle adapted to supply the fuel to a motor vehicle, and a piping system interconnecting the underground storage tank and dispensing unit. As fuel is dispensed to motor vehicles, it becomes necessary to refill or re-supply the underground storage tank with fuel. To this end, the underground storage tank includes a riser pipe having a distal end in communication with the storage tank and a proximal end adjacent the surface of the ground. The proximal end of the riser pipe includes known structure for coupling with an end of a supply hose coupled to a tanker truck carrying a supply of fuel. Fuel from the tanker truck is then permitted to flow through the supply hose, through the riser pipe, and into the storage tank so as to refill the storage tank with fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During such fill operations, it is not uncommon for fuel to spill from, for example, the supply hose and/or the riser pipe in the area immediately adjacent the proximal end of the riser pipe. To prevent the spilled fuel from leaking into the environment around the fuel dispensing system, a spill container, commonly referred to as a spill bucket, may be disposed about the proximal end of the riser pipe. The spill bucket is adapted to contain any spilled fuel from such a fill operation and direct the fuel to the storage tank.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional spill buckets typically include a containment housing having a distal end coupled to the proximal end riser pipe in a fluid tight manner. A proximal end of the containment housing is adjacent the surface of the ground and includes a removable cover for accessing the proximal end of the riser pipe during a fill operation. The distal end of the containment housing typically includes a drain that provides selective fluid communication between an interior cavity of the containment housing and the storage tank. In this way, fuel that inadvertently spills during a fill operation is collected in the interior cavity of the containment housing and directed to the storage tank by actuation of the drain.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While such spill buckets are generally effective for containing inadvertent fuel spillage during fill operations, manufacturers continually strive to provide improved components of a fuel dispensing system. Thus, manufacturers strive to provide components that are relatively easy to install during, for example, an initial installation, or during a repair or replacement process. By way of example, repair and/or replacement of a conventional spill bucket is typically difficult, time consuming and labor intensive.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, many state and/or federal regulations are requiring redundancy in hazardous material handling systems, including fuel dispensing systems. Many spill bucket designs, however, only provide for a single containment housing. Existing spill bucket designs having a double-walled structure that provide containment redundancy suffer from the same shortcomings as described above, i.e., repair and/or replacement is typically difficult, time consuming, and labor intensive.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a need for a spill containment apparatus that provides for improved installation and/or containment redundancy such that personnel may make timely replacements, repairs, or perform other maintenance in a simplified, cost effective, time-efficient, and labor-efficient manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To address these and other shortcomings in the art, a spill containment apparatus for containing liquid spillage from a fill operation is provided. The spill containment apparatus includes a container adapted to be coupled to an end of a riser pipe of a storage tank having a proximal end and a distal end. A tubular socket is formed in the container adjacent its distal end for receiving the riser pipe therein. The socket includes a securing mechanism, such as, for example, threads, for securing the container to the riser pipe, wherein the securing mechanism is spaced proximally of the distal end of the container to define the socket. The socket is configured to allow the riser pipe to support and balance the container during coupling of the container to the riser pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the containment apparatus includes a primary spill container and a secondary spill container to provide redundancy to liquid spillage containment. The primary container may include a primary body and a primary base. Similarly, the second container may include a secondary body and a secondary base. The secondary base is configured to be coupled to the riser pipe and the primary base is configured to be coupled to the secondary base. The containment apparatus may still further include an outer sump housing adapted to contain at least in part the primary and secondary containers and having a cover for accessing the riser pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, a spill containment apparatus for containing liquid spillage from a fill includes a container adapted to be coupled to an end of a riser pipe of a storage tank and a nipple adapted to carry access structure for accessing the riser pipe with a supply hose. An adaptor is provided and includes a first end configured to be removably coupled to the container, and a second end configured to be coupled to the nipple. The nipple may be assembled to or removed from the container by respectively coupling or removing the adaptor from the container. The adaptor may be coupled to the container using one or more fasteners easily accessed by a tool for manipulation. For example, the fasteners may be threaded bolts having an axis generally parallel to the axis of the container. The access structure may include at least one of an adaptor (e.g., swivel adaptor) and a cap.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this embodiment, the containment apparatus may include a primary spill container and a secondary spill container to provide redundancy to liquid spillage containment. The primary container may include a primary body and a primary base. Similarly, the second container may include a secondary body and a secondary base. The secondary base is configured to be coupled to the riser pipe and the primary base is configured to be coupled to the secondary base. The containment apparatus may still further include an outer sump housing adapted to contain at least in part the primary and secondary containers and have a cover for accessing the riser pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A method of assembling a spill containment apparatus for containing liquid spillage from a fill operation includes coupling a container to an end of a riser pipe of a storage tank, coupling a nipple to a removable adaptor external of the container (i.e., while not being disposed in the container), and then coupling the adaptor to the container. Such a modular design facilitates installation and maintenance. For example, maintenance may be performed by removing the adaptor carrying the nipple from the container, exposing a component of the containment apparatus, and effecting repair and/or replacement of the component. The adaptor (and nipple) may then be re-connected to the container.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In still another embodiment, a spill containment apparatus includes a container adapted to be coupled to an end of a riser pipe of a storage tank. A fill tube is disposed in the riser pipe and has an end that extends beyond or proximally of the end of the riser pipe. The fill tube is supported at least in part by engagement of the fill tube with the container. More particularly, in one embodiment, the fill tube includes a flange and the container includes a seat, wherein the flange is disposed in the seat. The seat may be smooth and devoid of any irregularities so as to facilitate sealing between the fill tube and the container.</p>

Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other arrangements for sealing this coupling. By way of example, the adaptor <b>250</b> may include an extension portion that extends into the passageway <b>176</b> of central tube <b>168</b> and the seal may be formed between the passageway <b>176</b> and the side wall of the extension portion using an O-ring or other known type of seal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In use, when it is desired to add fuel to the storage tank <b>12</b>, an operator will remove the cover plate <b>82</b> to access the primary interior cavity <b>154</b>, which contains the structure, such as the swivel adaptor <b>234</b> and cap <b>236</b>, for accessing the riser pipe <b>22</b> (and fill tube <b>194</b>). The operator will remove the cap <b>236</b> and couple an end of a supply hose to the swivel adaptor <b>234</b>. Fuel will then be permitted to flow from the tanker truck, through the supply hose, and into the fill tube <b>194</b> disposed in riser pipe <b>22</b> via the passageways of the intervening structure (e.g., nipple <b>238</b>, passageway <b>176</b>, etc.). If fuel is inadvertently spilled during the fill operation, such as from the supply hose or from the riser pipe <b>22</b>, the fuel will flow into the primary interior cavity <b>154</b> of the primary spill container <b>34</b> and be contained therein. The spilled fuel in cavity <b>154</b> may be directed to the storage tank <b>12</b> by pulling on the chain <b>222</b>, which opens drain valve <b>216</b> so that the fuel may flow into storage tank <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If for some reason, the primary spill container <b>34</b> would fail, such as by developing a hole, crack, etc., and thereby not be effective to contain spilled fuel, the fuel would flow into the secondary interior cavity <b>104</b> of the secondary spill container <b>36</b> and be contained therein. The fuel that flows into the secondary interior cavity <b>104</b> would be detected by the product float <b>232</b> or other monitoring device and thereby provide the operator with an indication that containment by the primary spill container <b>34</b> has been breached and repair and/or replacement thereof may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The spill bucket <b>30</b> as described herein includes a number of advantageous features that improve the operation and/or functionality of spill bucket <b>30</b> and may further prove advantageous in other spill bucket designs (e.g., single containment designs) as well. For example, one feature that provides increased functionality is the socket <b>128</b> adjacent the distal end of the spill bucket <b>30</b>. Conventional spill buckets are generally difficult for maintenance personnel and installers to couple to the proximal end of the riser pipe <b>22</b>. This may be contributed to the fact that spill buckets are generally heavy (e.g., 150 lbs or more), are installed or replaced in limited working space, and that the threads on conventional spill buckets for coupling to the threads on the riser pipe are typically at the distal most end of the spill bucket. The latter fact results in the relatively heavy spill bucket having to be lifted and balanced just right by maintenance personnel in order to get the threaded connection started. This can be a difficult, frustrating, costly, and time-consuming task.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To address such a shortcoming in conventional spill buckets, spill bucket <b>30</b> described herein includes the socket <b>128</b> having the threaded connection that couples with the threaded riser pipe <b>22</b> proximal of the distal end of the spill bucket <b>30</b>. Such a configuration essentially allows the spill bucket <b>30</b> to be seated on and supported by the riser pipe <b>22</b> as the threaded connection is initiated. The socket <b>128</b> provides for balancing the spill bucket <b>30</b> on the riser pipe <b>22</b> so that only the threads must be engaged to complete the coupling. Such a feature makes installation significantly easier, less costly, and more time and labor efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Although the socket feature is shown and described herein in the context of double-walled spill bucket <b>30</b>, it should be recognized that such a feature is not so limited. In this regard, the socket feature may be beneficial in single containment spill bucket designs, multi-port bucket designs, as well as possibly other fuel dispensing components.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The socket <b>128</b> may provide advantages in addition to those described above. In this regard, many state and federal regulations are requiring double containment devices for fuel handling systems. Thus, as older single containment spill buckets are replaced, it may be required to replace them with a double-walled containment spill bucket. Due to the double containment design, however, such spill buckets are typically longer than their single containment spill bucket counterparts. Accordingly, double-walled spill buckets having conventionally placed threads (i.e., no socket) would, if simply threaded back on the same or existing riser pipe, extend above the ground or drive surface <b>70</b> and present a potential hazard or obstacle on the drive surface <b>70</b>. To accommodate the extra length then, the riser pipe has to be replaced or shortened so that the proximal end of the double-walled spill bucket is substantially flush with the drive surface <b>70</b>. Such replacement or modification of the riser pipe is costly, time-consuming and labor intensive. In contrast to this, however, the socket feature as illustrated in spill bucket <b>30</b> allows the proximal end of the spill bucket to remain flush with the drive surface <b>70</b> while using the existing riser pipe, i.e., without replacement or major modifications thereto. In this regard, the extra length for the double-walled construction is located distally of the proximal end of the riser pipe to effectively create the socket. This configuration then provides for replacement with double-walled bucket designs without the need for extensive replacement or modification to the existing riser pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Another feature that provides improved functionality is the connection between the nipple <b>238</b> and the spill bucket <b>30</b>. In many conventional spill bucket designs, the nipple is coupled to a collar (similar to nipple adaptor <b>250</b>) that is rigidly or permanently affixed to the spill bucket (e.g., to the base of the spill container). Thus for installation, the nipple must be inserted into the interior of the spill bucket and threadably coupled to the fixed collar. Such a configuration provides limited space for which to get tools (e.g., pipe wrench, etc.) around the nipple so as to provide a tight connection with the collar. Similarly, for maintenance reasons, it may be necessary to remove the nipple from the spill bucket. For example, to repair and or replace the fill tube, jack screw, or other components distal of the nipple, the nipple must be removed. To do so again requires an operator to get a tool in a limited work space to unthread the nipple from the collar. To do so typically is difficult, time-consuming, and labor intensive.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To address such a shortcoming in conventional spill buckets, spill bucket <b>30</b> described herein includes a more modular design that replaces the permanently affixed collar with a removable adaptor <b>250</b> that couples with the spill bucket <b>30</b> via threaded fasteners <b>262</b> that are easily accessed and manipulated by a suitable tool. For example, during installation, the nipple <b>238</b> and any structure coupled thereto (e.g., swivel adaptor <b>234</b> and cap <b>236</b>) may be pre-assembled with adaptor <b>250</b>. Such pre-assembly may occur outside of the spill bucket <b>30</b> and provide improved working space as well as tool access. Once assembled, this sub-assembly may be inserted into the spill bucket <b>30</b> and coupled thereto via the threaded fasteners <b>262</b> in a comparatively simplified manner. Furthermore, to provide replacement or repair to components that require removal of the nipple <b>238</b>, the threaded fasteners <b>262</b> may simply be removed so as to remove the sub-assembly and gain access to the desired components. Such a design between the connection of the nipple <b>238</b> and spill bucket <b>30</b> allows installation, replacement, and/or repair to be performed in a more cost effective, time efficient, and labor efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Similar to the socket feature, the improved connection between the nipple <b>238</b> and spill bucket <b>30</b> via the adaptor <b>250</b> should not be limited to the double-walled construction provided herein. Instead, it should be recognized that such an adaptor may be beneficial in single containment spill bucket designs, multi-port bucket designs, as well as other fuel dispensing components.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Still another feature that provides improved functionality is the connection between the fill tube <b>194</b> and the riser pipe <b>22</b>. In many conventional spill bucket designs, the flange <b>202</b> of the fill tube <b>194</b> is adapted to engage the proximal end face of the riser pipe <b>22</b>. The coupling is typically sealed using an O-ring or other known seal between the flange <b>202</b> and the proximal end face of the riser pipe <b>22</b>. In many cases, however, the proximal end face of the riser pipe <b>22</b> does not provide a surface conducive to sealing, but instead is often times rough and uneven. Consequently, the seal between the fill tube <b>194</b> and riser pipe <b>22</b> is unreliable or ineffective. Moreover, the replacement of the seal is difficult, costly, time-consuming and labor intensive.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">To address such a shortcoming in conventional spill buckets, spill bucket <b>30</b> described herein provides for improved sealing between the fill tube <b>194</b> and the riser pipe <b>22</b>. As discussed above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, the flange <b>202</b> of the fill tube <b>194</b> no longer engages the proximal end face of the riser pipe <b>22</b>, but instead, engages seat <b>200</b> in ring <b>188</b> in the primary base <b>152</b>. Relocating fill tube engagement to seat <b>200</b> provides for a prepared surface (e.g., smooth and even) that engages with flange <b>202</b> in an improved manner. In this way, the O-ring <b>204</b> or other seal has a smooth, even surface to engage that creates a more reliable and effective seal. In addition, an improved seal may also be attained between the riser pipe <b>22</b> and the primary base <b>152</b>. In this regard, the secondary base <b>102</b> is threadably coupled to the riser pipe <b>22</b> and the primary base <b>152</b> is coupled to the secondary base <b>102</b>. As previously discussed, secondary base <b>102</b> includes a groove <b>184</b> for receiving O-ring <b>186</b> that creates a seal with passageway <b>176</b> of central tube <b>168</b>. Similar to above, these surfaces may be prepared to enhance the sealing with O-ring <b>186</b>. Such a configuration for forming a seal between fill tube <b>194</b> and riser pipe <b>22</b> eliminates the need to create a seal on a potentially very rough and uneven surface. Accordingly, the sealing is more reliable and effective.</p>
