<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present U.S. patent application claims a priority under the Paris Convention of Japanese patent application No. 2011-029453 filed on Feb. 15, 2011, which shall be a basis of correction of an incorrect translation, and is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a color adjustment method and an image forming system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Heretofore, in the field of the offset printing, a technology has been known, in which solid patches of seven colors RGB and CMYK are printed as control strips on a cut margin, the colors are measured by a densitometer, a colorimeter and the like, and ink amounts of the respective colors are adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, in an image forming apparatus that performs image formation by using an electrophotographic process, in place of operations of outputting solid patches of four colors CMYK, measuring the colors, and adjusting ink amounts thereof, there is generally performed change of process conditions such as a development potential, which includes adjustment of a charge amount for an image carrier, and adjustment of an amount of light emitting energy to the image carrier. In such a way, adjustment at highest densities is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, when the change of the process conditions is performed as mentioned above, gradation characteristics at half tones are also changed. Accordingly, after the process conditions are changed, gray-scale images of the respective colors CMYK are outputted and are measured, whereby &#x3b3; correction is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the color adjustment in the image forming apparatus according to the conventional electrophotographic process mode, only primary colors composed of single colors among CMYK are taken as correction targets, and indirect correction is merely performed for secondary or more colors composed of two or more colors among CMYK. In actual, owing to a state change in an imaging process such as transfer and fixing onto a sheet, ideal states are not always achieved in the secondary colors even if the primary colors are adjusted to ideal states. Accordingly, in the color adjustment as described above, stabilization of an image cannot be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, a chart in which patch images of a thousand or several thousand colors are formed is outputted, the respective patches are individually measured by an external instrument such as the colorimeter, and a color profile is created based on results of the measurement, whereby the color adjustment of the primary color and the secondary or more colors is possible. However, a time and a work load for such color adjustment work are required for a user to an extremely large extent.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While such a technology as described above has been known, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. H05-153383 discloses a color correction apparatus, which separates density signals of CMY into black components, secondary color components and primary color components, and multiplies each of these separated components by a fixed ratio, thereby performs correction thereof independently, and thereafter, adds and outputs these.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Incidentally, for example, in the field of the light printing, and the like, large-volume printing is performed by using a plurality of image forming apparatuses. Hence, it is necessary that the color adjustment be performed for each of the image forming apparatuses for use so that similar output results can be obtained in all the image forming apparatuses. Then, in the plurality of image forming apparatuses as described above, even if a type thereof is the same, a machine difference is inherent in characteristics of the imaging process, such as transfer properties to a sheet. Accordingly, even if similar color adjustment is performed among the plurality of image forming apparatuses, the same output result is not always obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in the technology described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. H05-153383, the color adjustment is implemented only for the target apparatus concerned, and how to perform the adjustment among the apparatuses is not taken into consideration at all. Accordingly, it is necessary to perform the color adjustment individually for each of the plurality of image forming apparatuses while comparing the results of the color adjustment among the apparatuses with one another, and this is extremely cumbersome.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Here, a description is made of the image formation in the image forming unit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The photosensitive drum <b>41</b>Y rotates, a surface thereof is charged by the charger <b>403</b>Y, and by exposure of the LD <b>404</b>Ya, a latent image of an image with Y data is formed on such a charged portion. Then, a yellow toner image is formed on a portion of the latent image by the developing unit <b>41</b>Ya. The toner image concerned is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>43</b> by pressure contact of the primary transfer roller <b>42</b>Y. The toner image becomes a yellow image corresponding to image data of an output target. Toner that is not subjected to such transfer is removed by a cleaner (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Magenta, cyan and black toner images are also formed and transferred individually in a similar way.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The intermediate transfer belt <b>43</b> rotates by rotation of the rollers <b>44</b> and the primary transfer rollers <b>42</b>Y, <b>42</b>M, <b>42</b>C and <b>42</b>K, and the YMCK toner images are sequentially superimposed and transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>43</b>.

The sheets supplied from the respective sheet feed trays of the sheet feed unit <b>48</b> are conveyed to the secondary transfer roller <b>46</b> by rotation of the resist rollers <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Following the rotation of the resist rollers <b>45</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>46</b>, each of the sheets passes through a press contact portion, whereby the YMCK toner images on the intermediate transfer belt <b>43</b> are transferred to the sheet. The sheet to which the YMCK toner images are transferred passes through the fixing unit <b>47</b>. By pressurization and heating of the fixing unit <b>47</b>, the YMCK toner images are fixed onto the sheet, and a color image is formed. The sheet on which the image is formed is delivered to the relay unit <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Moreover, in the case of performing double-sided printing, the sheet, on one surface of which the image is formed, is inverted, and is then conveyed to the secondary transfer roller <b>46</b> by the resist rollers <b>45</b> so that another image can be formed on a surface of the sheet, on which the image formation is not performed.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The relay unit <b>50</b> has a function to receive the sheet delivered from the image forming unit <b>40</b>, and to send out the sheet for subsequent processing.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The light L inputted to the CCD <b>62</b> is subjected to the photoelectric conversion, and based on this, the density detection unit <b>60</b> specifies a reflectivity as a ratio of a light receiving quantity with respect to a light quantity outputted by the light source <b>61</b>. Then, the density detection unit <b>60</b> outputs a voltage value, which corresponds to this reflectivity, as an image density signal (reflectivity information) to the control unit <b>10</b>. This image density signal is a signal capable of specifying the gradation of each of the colors RGB. Note that the image density signal may be created from the light receiving quantity obtained by the photoelectric conversion. Moreover, in the density detection unit <b>60</b>, information indicating the light receiving quantity obtained by the photoelectric conversion may be outputted to the control unit <b>10</b>, and the reflectivity may be obtained in the control unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As will be described later, as a result that the scanning for the corrected image for the imaging process adjustment and the gradation pattern image is performed, the control unit <b>10</b> performs the adjustment of the imaging process and creation of a relative gamma curve based on the image density signal outputted from the density detection unit <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Note that, in this embodiment, in place of the CCD <b>62</b>, other light receiving elements may be used, which can receive the light reflected by the corrected image for the imaging process adjustment and the gradation pattern image and can perform the photoelectric conversion for the received light.

Moreover, in this embodiment, the scanning is performed by the CCD <b>62</b> at a position spaced apart from the sheet; however, for example, a capture device of a close contact optical system, such as a contact image sensor (CIS), may be applied.</p>

Note that a time of obtaining the various pieces of information can be arbitrarily set.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">First, in each of the plural image forming apparatuses <b>100</b>, imaging process information, in which characteristics of an imaging process are indicated, is obtained (Step S<b>10</b>). Specifically, each of the control units <b>10</b> of the plural image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> obtains the characteristics of the imaging process, and the control unit <b>10</b> of the number (<b>1</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> that is the target machine serving as the reference exports the obtained imaging process information, which indicates the characteristics of the imaging process, to the number (<b>2</b>) to (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> which are the sample machines. Each of the sample machines stores and holds the exported imaging process information of the target machine. Here, while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a description is made of a procedure for obtaining the imaging process information.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">First, in each of the number (<b>1</b>) to (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b>, the corrected image for the imaging process adjustment is formed (Step S<b>101</b>). More specifically, in the image forming unit <b>40</b>, each of the control units <b>10</b> of the number (<b>1</b>) to number (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> forms, on the sheet, the maximum gradation patches having the maximum gradations (<b>255</b>) of the respective colors Y, M, C and K. The maximum gradation patches are solid images with a predetermined size.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Next, each of the control units <b>10</b> of the number (<b>1</b>) to number (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> captures, by the density detection unit <b>60</b>, the densities of the maximum gradation patches of the respective colors, which are formed on the sheet. As a result, for example, measurement results as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are obtained as characteristics of the imaging process in each of the image forming apparatuses <b>100</b>. Note that the measurement results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> show densities in the color K, and similar measurement results are also obtained for the other colors.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Note that the densities of the maximum gradation patches formed on the sheet may be obtained visually or a scanner, a colorimeter and the like, and results thus obtained may be inputted to each of the image forming apparatuses <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Next, the control unit <b>10</b> of the number (<b>1</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> as the target machine exports density information, which indicates the density measurement values of the respective colors, as the imaging process information from the target machine to the number (<b>2</b>) to number (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> (Step S<b>103</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Then, each of the control units <b>10</b> of the number (<b>2</b>) to number (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> as the sample machines stores the exported density information of the target machine in the storage unit <b>70</b> (Step S<b>104</b>). Moreover, in a similar way, each of the control units <b>10</b> of the sample machines also stores and holds the density information of the machine itself, which is obtained as mentioned above, in the storage unit <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Note that, in this embodiment, the characteristics of the imaging process of the number (<b>1</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> as the target machine are taken as a reference; however, the characteristics of the imaging process of any of the image forming apparatuses other than the target machine, that is, of the (<b>2</b>) to number (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> may be taken as a reference, and the characteristics may be imported and held in other image forming apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the imaging process information is obtained in such a manner as described above, then as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the screen gamma curve is obtained in each of the plural image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> (Step S<b>20</b>). That is to say, the control unit <b>10</b> of the number (<b>1</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> forms a plurality of screen images, which are different in gradation from one another, in the image forming unit <b>40</b>, and measures densities of the screen images individually for each color. From measurement results of the above, the control unit <b>10</b> of the target machine creates the screen gamma curve for performing the correction so that the density of the image can linearly change in response to the change of the gradation. The control unit <b>10</b> of the target machine exports the created screen gamma curve to each of the number (<b>2</b>) to number (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> as the sample machines. Each of the image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> stores and holds the screen gamma curve corresponding to the number (<b>1</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. Here, while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a description is made in detail of a procedure for obtaining the screen gamma curve.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">First, in the number (<b>1</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> as the target machine, an image for obtaining screen gamma characteristics is formed (Step S<b>201</b>). Specifically, for each of the colors Y, M, C and K, the image forming unit <b>40</b> of the number (<b>1</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> creates such a screen gamma characteristic obtaining image as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and forms the created screen gamma characteristic obtaining image on the intermediate transfer belt <b>43</b>. The screen gamma characteristic obtaining image is a step wedge image composed of a plurality of gradations, that is, patch-like density steps in which the density changes step by step.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Next, the control unit <b>10</b> of the target machine captures, in the IDC sensor <b>90</b>, the screen gamma characteristic obtaining image formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>43</b>, and measures the density of each screen image (Step S<b>202</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Next, a measurement result of the density of each screen image, which is measured as mentioned above, is created for each color (Step S<b>203</b>). Specifically, the control unit <b>10</b> of the target machine receives an output value outputted from the IDC sensor <b>90</b>, performs logarithmic transformation for this output value, and obtains a density value. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the control unit <b>10</b> plots thus outputted density values with respect to the inputted gradations of the screen gamma characteristic obtaining image. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, plotted points are indicated by circle marks. Then, the control unit <b>10</b> calculates a measurement curve ME based on the plotted points.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Next, based on the measurement curve ME obtained as mentioned above, the screen gamma curve for correcting the output density value is created (Step S<b>204</b>). Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the control unit <b>10</b> of the target machine creates a gamma correction curve CO, which has inverse characteristics of the measurement curve ME with respect to a straight line indicating a target gradation TA predetermined so that the density value can change linearly in response to the change of the gradation. Based on this gamma correction curve CO, the control unit <b>10</b> replaces the output density value by a gradation value, and creates, for each color of Y, M, C and K, the screen gamma curve for obtaining an output gradation with respect to an input gradation. This screen gamma curve is composed, for example, of a one-dimensional LUT.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The control unit <b>10</b> of the target machine stores the screen gamma curve of each color, which is created as mentioned above, in the screen gamma curve storage unit <b>73</b> of the storage unit <b>70</b> (Step S<b>205</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Meanwhile, the control unit <b>10</b> of the target machine exports the same screen gamma curve as those stored in the screen gamma curve storage unit <b>73</b> individually to the number (<b>2</b>) to number (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> (Step S<b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Then, the control unit <b>10</b> of each sample machine stores the screen gamma curve, which is exported from the target machine, in the screen gamma curve storage unit <b>73</b> of the storage unit <b>70</b> (Step S<b>207</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In such a manner as described above, in each of the plural image forming apparatuses <b>100</b>, the common screen gamma curve is held. In this embodiment, it is assumed that the image forming system uses the n pieces of image forming apparatuses of the same type, and it is considered that a difference in screen gamma characteristics among the apparatuses is small. Therefore, such screen gamma curves are not created in the respective machines, but the screen gamma curve is created in one image forming apparatus, and this is shared among the respective image forming apparatuses, whereby processing for creating the screen gamma curve is simplified. Moreover, since a correction amount is common, compression of a correction amount in relative gamma correction to be described later can be achieved, and it becomes possible to implement effective relative gamma correction more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Note that plural types of the screen gamma curves may be created in response to types of such screens for use.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">When the screen gamma curve is obtained in each of the machines in such a manner as mentioned above, then as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, gradation characteristic information indicating the gradation characteristics in each of the plural image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> is created in each machine (Step S<b>30</b>). That is to say, the control unit <b>10</b> of each of the plural image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> forms, on the sheet, plural pattern images different in gradation for each of eight colors Y, M, C, K, R, G, B and Pb in the image forming unit <b>40</b>. The control unit <b>10</b> of each of the image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> captures, in the density detection unit <b>60</b>, each of the pattern images formed on the sheet, and creates the gradation characteristic information based on this. Meanwhile, the control unit <b>10</b> of the number (<b>1</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> as the target machine exports the gradation characteristic information, which is obtained in the machine itself, to the number (<b>2</b>) to number (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b> as the sample machines. The control unit <b>10</b> of each of the sample machines stores and holds the gradation characteristic information exported from the target machine. Here, while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a description is made in detail of a procedure for creating the gradation characteristic information.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">First, in each of the number (<b>2</b>) to number (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b>, adjustment of the imaging process is performed (Step S<b>301</b>). Specifically, the control unit <b>10</b> of each of the sample machines reads out, from the storage unit <b>70</b>, density information as the imaging process information exported from the number (<b>1</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> as the target machine in such a manner as mentioned above, and density information as the imaging process information of the machine itself. Then, the control unit <b>10</b> of each of the sample machines calculates differences in density from the density information of the target machine and the density information of the machine itself. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, with regard to the density measurement values of the color K at the maximum gradation, the density measurement value at the number (<b>2</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is 1.70, and the density measurement value at the target machine is 1.67. Accordingly, a difference in density between the target machine and the number (<b>2</b>) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> becomes 0.03. Moreover, in the number (n) imaging forming apparatus <b>100</b>, since the density measurement value thereof is 1.64, a difference in density from the target machine becomes &#x2212;0.03.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">When the differences in density are calculated in such a manner as described above, the control unit <b>10</b> of each sample machine changes a bias voltage of the charging grid high-voltage power supply <b>403</b>Ka in the image forming unit <b>40</b>K of the color K, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and performs control to adjust a charging voltage in the photosensitive drum <b>41</b>K through the charger <b>403</b>K. For example, the control unit <b>10</b> of each of the sample machines raises the bias voltage of the charging grid high-voltage power supply <b>403</b>Ka, and raises the charging voltage of the photosensitive drum <b>41</b>K, and can thereby increase the density. An example of this is mentioned. In order to raise the density measurement value &#x201c;1.64&#x201d; of the number (n) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> to &#x201c;1.67&#x201d; as the density measurement value of the target machine, the control unit <b>10</b> of the machine itself as the number (n) image forming apparatus <b>100</b> controls the image forming unit <b>40</b> to raise the bias voltage of the charging grid high-voltage power supply <b>403</b>Ka by 30V. Note that decrease of the density can be realized by lowering the bias voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Moreover, another adjustment method of the imaging process can be realized in such a manner that the control unit <b>10</b> of the sample machine adjusts exposure energy of the LD <b>404</b>Ka by the power controller <b>404</b>Kb shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As an adjustment method of the exposure energy, change of an output pulse width, change of an output voltage, and the like can be applied. For example, the exposure energy of the LD <b>404</b>Ka is enhanced, whereby a charging voltage of an exposed portion of the photosensitive drum <b>41</b>K can be further lowered. As a result, the density can be increased. Note that the decrease of the density can be realized by lowering the exposure energy of the LD <b>404</b>Ka.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Also for the color Y, the color M and the color C, the adjustment of the imaging process can be implemented in a similar way.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Next, in each of the number (<b>1</b>) to number (n) image forming apparatuses <b>100</b>, gradation pattern image data stored in the gradation pattern image storage unit <b>71</b> of the storage unit <b>70</b> is read out (Step S<b>302</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Here, a description is made of examples of the gradation pattern image while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">For each color of Y, M, C, K, R, G, B and Pb, the gradation pattern image formed on the sheet P includes patches of plural densities in a range from the lowest density (gradation value: 31) to the highest density (gradation value: 255). For example, gradation values of the patches of each color, which re included in the gradation pattern image, are individually 31, 53, 95, 127, 159, 191, 223 and 255. Note that the respective gradation pattern images shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> are merely for the purpose of illustration, and arrangement positions of the respective colors and arrays of the patches are not limited to those shown. Moreover, with regard to the gradation pattern images, it is sufficient if any one of the patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> can be outputted; however, plural types thereof may be outputted and used in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In an example of the gradation pattern image, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in an upper portion thereof, patches of K, Y, M, C, B, G, R and Pb are formed in order from a left side, and in a lower portion thereof, a mirror image pattern in which the patches formed in the upper portion are inverted with respect to a vertical direction taken as an axis is formed. That is to say, in the lower portion, patches are formed in order of Pb, R, G, B, C, M, Y and K from the left side. Such a gradation pattern image as described above is formed, whereby the gamma curve can be created by averaging the detected densities of the patches for each gradation, and an influence by in-plane unevenness can be reduced. Note that the gradation pattern image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is arranged in an inside of cutting register marks arranged individually on four corners of the sheet P. These cutting register marks T are identification information indicating cutting positions of the sheet in the event of book binding and the like. The gradation pattern image is formed in the inside of the cutting register marks, whereby the sheet P becomes spoiled. However, since the patches can be formed in a wide range, the number of sheets necessary to form the gradation pattern image can be reduced. Moreover, in this embodiment, the patches are formed in order from a larger density in order to facilitate detection of a starting position of the gradation pattern image.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In an example of the gradation pattern image, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the gradation pattern image is formed on left and right end portions of the sheet P, which are also on the outside of the cutting register marks T.

In this example, when the sheet P is cut by taking the cutting register marks T as guides, the gradation pattern image is also separated at the same time, and accordingly, the sheet P is not spoiled, and cost reduction can be achieved. Moreover, also in this example, the patches are formed in order from a larger density in order to facilitate the detection of the starting position of the gradation pattern image.</p>
