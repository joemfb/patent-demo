<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any one of the patent document or patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has become relatively common for individuals to possess a number of different devices through which they communicate. For example, a person may have a home telephone, a wireless telephone, a pager, a personal digital assistant (PDA), and an office telephone to name a few. As the population becomes increasingly mobile, making contact with a person through one of these communication devices has become more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Call forwarding is one method of addressing this problem. Certain telephone systems allow users to enter another number to which a call is forwarded if not answered by a specified number of rings. This should allow an individual with multiple telephone devices to forward the call to such devices until the telephone at which the individual is located finally rings. However, if several telephones are involved, this approach becomes complicated. Moreover, it requires the calling party to remain on the line for a significant period of time if the call is to be forwarded multiple times. Furthermore, it is necessary that call forwarding capabilities exist on each of the individual's telephones. In addition, this approach requires that all telephones involved be reprogrammed each time an individual desires to initiate call forwarding.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A significant drawback to this forwarding strategy is that, in each leg of the forwarded call, the calling party is terminated on the last device or network in the chain. It follows that the final number in the forwarding scheme is responsible for all available enhanced services or voicemail available to the caller. Accordingly, although a call may have been initially placed to an office telephone equipped with voicemail and/or operator assist, all such enhanced services of the corporate network are lost once the call is forwarded off the corporate PBX (e.g., to the user's wireless telephone).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Travel can also exacerbate the difficulty of establishing communication with an individual having access to multiple telephone devices. Upon checking into a hotel, the telephone in a traveler's hotel room becomes available as yet another potential means of contact. Unfortunately, this forces a calling party to decide whether to attempt to contact the traveler through his or her room telephone or other telephone device (e.g., wireless telephone or pager). If the traveler does not answer the called telephone, the calling party then must decide whether to leave a message (unaware of when, or if, the message will be retrieved) or instead attempt to reach the traveler via his or her other telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Likewise, if the traveler is expecting an important call but is unsure whether it will be placed to his room telephone or wireless telephone, the traveler may feel compelled to remain within his room until the call has been received. In addition, if the traveler's wireless telephone does not support certain types of long distance calls (e.g., to various foreign countries), the traveler may be able to place certain types of calls only from his or her hotel room. The same problems arise when the traveler visits another office or enterprise having their own enterprise telecommunications network.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The office telephone is the primary point of contact of most business people. Typically, corporations invest significantly in their office telephone infrastructure, which often includes voicemail, paging and unified messaging systems. In addition, most corporations have negotiated contracts with their telephone carriers (e.g., local and long distance carriers) to ensure that they obtain the lowest possible rates for calls placed via their corporate network. However, because the corporate workforce is becoming increasingly mobile, more business people are using wireless telephones or devices to conduct their business when they are out of the office. This has resulted in corporations spending a larger portion of their telecommunications budget on wireless communications, with far less favorable negotiated rates than the rates of their corporate network. In addition, wireless communication systems often lack the enhanced conveniences (e.g., interoffice voicemail, direct extension dialing, etc.) that corporate users have come to expect in the office environment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Often times, one must communicate with a particular individual and cannot wait until the individual completes the current call. This is sometimes referred to as Multi-level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP), but is referred to herein as &#x201c;priority preemption.&#x201d; Priority preemption, however, is limited to the telephones connected to the enterprise network, which limits the ability of the higher ranking official to contact the appropriate individual (who may also be a high ranking officer or government official) when the need arises. It is desirable to extend the priority preemption capability to wireless and remote devices so that priority users are able to preempt existing communications and communicate with certain individuals even though that individual is using a wireless telephone or other remote device.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Example embodiments and applications will now be described. It should be appreciated that other embodiments may be realized and structural or logical changes may be made. Although the embodiments disclosed herein have been particularly described as applied to a business or office environment, it should be readily apparent that the embodiments may be embodied for any use or application having the same or similar problems.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments disclosed herein relate to a telecommunication system that can selectively establish communications with one of a plurality of telephony devices associated with a particular telephone number or other addressing method such as SIP URI or private numbering plan (PNP) (e.g., extension dialing). Moreover, the system allows remote devices to perform as a functional standard office telephone for both inbound and outbound communications. The system also has a processor configured to send a data signal via e.g., electronic mail (email), text messaging, or other forms of data communications to one or more remote devices without any user interaction. The data signal causes a processor and a remote device to execute a series of steps designed to route incoming and outgoing calls based on user preferences and perform PBX functions from the remote device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, a method of routing an outbound communication initiated by a wireless device through an enterprise communication network is provided. The method comprises the steps of receiving a first data signal from the wireless device, the first data signal inquiring whether the wireless device has permission to make the outbound communication through the enterprise communication network; retrieving access rights associated with the wireless device based on the first data signal; determining from the retrieved access rights whether the wireless device has permission to make the outbound communication using the services of the enterprise communication network; transmitting a second data signal to the wireless device, the second data signal indicating whether permission has been granted or not; and if it is determined that the wireless device has permission to make the outbound communication, establishing a first communication path to an intended recipient of the outbound communication, establishing a second communication path to the wireless device and connecting the first and second communication paths to route the outbound communication from the wireless device to the recipient. According to the embodiment, the first and second communication paths are not established until it is determined that the wireless device has permission to make the outbound communication.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, a server for routing an outbound communication is provided. The server being is configured to receive a first data signal from a first device, the first data signal inquiring whether the first device has permission to make the outbound communication through the server; retrieve access rights associated with the first device based on the first data signal; determine from the retrieved access rights whether the first device has permission to make the outbound communication through the server; transmit a second data signal to the first device, the second data signal indicating whether permission has been granted or not; and if it is determined that the first device has permission to make the outbound communication through the server, establish a first voice communication path to the first device, establish a second voice communication path to a second device, and connect the first and second communication paths to route the outbound communication between the first and second devices and through the server. In this example embodiment, the voice communication paths are not established until it is determined that the first device has permission to make the outbound communication.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Another embodiment provides a handheld communication device comprising a display region; an input device; and a processor. The processor is for displaying and controlling a graphical user interface on the display region, said graphical user interface providing an interface for inputting information from the input device to said processor and for displaying information on the display region in response to signals from the processor. In the embodiment, the processor and graphical user interface are adapted to route an outbound communication from the handheld communication device through an enterprise communication network by outputting a first screen for logging into the enterprise communication network from the handheld communication device; inputting login information from the input device; outputting a first data signal comprising the input login information to a server computer associated with the enterprise communication network; receiving a second data signal indicating that the handheld device is logged into the enterprise communication network; displaying call options; inputting selected call options from the input device; and placing a call through the enterprise communication network based on the inputted selected call options.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In yet another embodiment, a method of routing a communication is provided. The method comprises receiving over a first communication path an incoming call to a primary device number; retrieving a first connection number for a remote device associated with said primary device number; transmitting a first data signal to the remote device, the data signal inquiring whether the incoming call is to be accepted at the remote device; receiving a second data signal from the remote device; determining whether the incoming call is accepted based on the second data signal; and if the incoming call is accepted, establishing a second communication path to the remote device and connecting the first and second paths such that the incoming call is routed to the remote device. In this embodiment, the second communication path is not established if the incoming call is not accepted.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment, an apparatus for connecting a first call placed to a first device to a second device is provided. The first device is associated with an enterprise network and a first device number. The apparatus comprises a computer readable storage medium, said computer readable storage medium storing a second device number associated with the first device number and corresponding to the second device; and a processor coupled to said computer readable storage medium, said processor adapted to retrieve the second device number from the computer readable storage medium upon detecting the first call over a first communication path, said processor being further adapted to transmit a first data signal to the second device, and if the processor receives a second data signal indicating that the first call is accepted, the processor is adapted to establish a second communication path to the second device and connect the first and second paths such that the first call is routed to the second device instead of the first device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In still a further embodiment, another telecommunications server is provided. The server is configured to receive over a first communication path an incoming call to a primary device number; retrieve a first connection number for a remote device associated with said primary device number; transmit a first data signal to the remote device, the data signal inquiring whether the incoming call is to be accepted at the remote device; receive a second data signal from the remote device; determine whether the incoming call is accepted based on the second data signal; and if the incoming call is accepted, establish a second communication path to the remote device and connect the first and second paths such that the incoming call is routed to the remote device instead of an enterprise telephone associated with the primary device number.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A first example embodiment is discussed and illustrated with reference to its implementation within an office building, multiple office buildings or other enterprise establishment. In an office building, for example, personnel are assigned to offices (or cubicles) with each office having an associated telephone. The office telephones are typically connected to a PBX, exchange, or other call processing infrastructure one example being but not limited to a virtual PBX (also known as Hosted Enterprise Services (HES): a next generation network (NGN) application whereby the NGN hosts all originating and/or terminating business communication capabilities for enterprise users that are directly attached to NGN and have an IMS service subscription for this application in the NGN) hosted on a 3GPP IMS system or TISPAN NGN (e.g., specifications ECMA TR/91 and TR/92), etc. PBXs allow each office telephone to have one or more telephone extensions and a direct inward dial (DID) telephone number. As known in the art, a telephone extension is typically a three, four or five digit telephone number (i.e., a Private Numbering Plan (PNP)) where station-to-station (i.e., office-to-office) calls can be placed by dialing the three, four or five digit extension. This is commonly referred to as direct extension dialing. As also known in the art, a DID telephone number allows external calls (i.e., calls initiated outside of the office PBX) to be placed directly to the office telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The embodiments disclosed herein are not to be limited to any particular environment. The embodiments may be implemented, for example, in a hotel, boarding house, dormitory, apartment, or other commercial or residential establishment, where individuals are assigned to a unique extension or DID telephone number. The term &#x201c;office&#x201d; as used herein encompasses a singular room or space within a business, other enterprise, hotel room or similar facility. The term &#x201c;user&#x201d; as used herein encompasses office personnel, hotel guests or other individuals associated with a telephone extension and DID telephone number.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a telecommunication system <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with an embodiment. As will be discussed below, the system <b>10</b> provides for a full integration of remote telephony devices, such as a remote device <b>70</b> (shown in this example as a personal digital assistant (PDA) with wireless voice and data communications (also referred to herein as a mobile device)), into an office, enterprise or hotel PBX or other communications network. The remote device <b>70</b> may be any suitable wirelessly enabled handheld remote device. The remote device <b>70</b> may operate over multiple types of radio communications technology such as GSM, UMTS, CDMA, WiFi, and/or WIMAX and support multiple protocol suites for data and voice communications associated with the various radio technology. The remote device may support (implement) more than one radio technology and offer both data and voice communication capabilities, simultaneously using two radio services (i.e., WiFi, GSM, etc.) and/or types (e.g., circuit or packet switched transmissions), for example a Blackberry supporting GSM/GPRS and WiFi. The device <b>800</b> described in further detail below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an example of a remote device. Such devices include Blackberry&#x2122; devices by Research In Motion Limited of Ontario, Canada, or Palm&#xae; Treo&#x2122; devices by Palm, Inc. of California, U.S.A. to name a few. In addition, the remote device <b>70</b> may be a cellular telephone, or data only handheld which only supports VoIP.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The system <b>10</b> can selectively establish communications with one of a plurality of devices, including one or more remote devices <b>70</b>, associated with a particular telephone extension or DID telephone number. Moreover, the system <b>10</b> will allow remote devices <b>70</b> such as a mobile device (described below in more detail) to perform functions of a standard office telephone <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>for both inbound and outbound communications. That is, a remote device <b>70</b> will be able to use features of the office network (e.g., direct extension dialing, corporate dialing plan, enterprise voicemail etc.) even though the device is not within the confines of the office or not directly connected to the office PBX. The system <b>10</b> also allows the remote device <b>70</b> to operate as an independent PDA, wireless telephone, etc. if so desired. That is, the remote device <b>70</b> may receive calls placed to its (non-office) DID telephone number even though the system <b>10</b> also routes PBX calls to the device <b>70</b>. In addition, the system <b>10</b> essentially implements all or part of call management or other signaling protocol functions typically available on a device that is part of an office, enterprise or hotel PBX/IP-PBX or other communications network. Some of these features are discussed in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The system <b>10</b> as particularly illustrated herein includes a conventional office PBX network <b>11</b>. The PBX network <b>11</b> may include a plurality of standard telephones <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>respectively connected to a conventional PBX/IP-PBX <b>14</b> via communication lines <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b</i>. Although PBX network <b>11</b> may use a PBX or IP-PBX <b>14</b>, the following disclosure will simply refer to PBX <b>14</b> for convenience purposes. The PBX <b>14</b> is connected to a calling network such as a public switched telephone network (PSTN) <b>16</b> by a primary rate interface (PRI) connection <b>20</b> or other suitable communication line or medium. The standard telephones <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>can be any digital or analog telephone or other communication device known in the art. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first telephone <b>12</b><i>a </i>is a digital telephone while the second telephone <b>12</b><i>b </i>is an analog telephone. For clarity purposes only, two telephones <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but it should be appreciated that any number or combination of telephones or other communication devices can be supported by the system <b>10</b>. Moreover, although it is desirable to use digital telephones, the embodiments described herein are not to be limited to the particular type of telephone used in the system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The PBX <b>14</b> is coupled to a server <b>30</b> constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the invention (discussed in more detail below). The server <b>30</b> is connected to the PBX <b>14</b> in this embodiment by a PRI connection <b>22</b>, VoIP connection <b>24</b> (e.g., SIP and other proprietary protocols) (if PBX <b>14</b> is an IP-PBX), or other suitable communication medium (e.g., WiFi connection). The server <b>30</b> is also connected to a PSTN <b>54</b> by a PRI connection or other suitable digital communication medium. The illustrated PRI connection between the server <b>30</b> and the PSTN <b>54</b> includes a first PRI connection <b>32</b>, a channel service unit (CSU) <b>34</b>, and a second PRI connection <b>36</b>. As known in the art, a CSU is a mechanism for connecting a computer (or other device) to a digital medium that allows a customer to utilize their own equipment to retime and regenerate incoming signals. It should be appreciated that the illustrated connection between the server <b>30</b> and the PSTN <b>54</b> is one of many suitable connections. Accordingly, embodiments described herein should not be limited to the illustrated connection. The server <b>30</b> is one of the mechanisms that allows the integration of remote devices (e.g., mobile device <b>70</b>) into the PBX network <b>11</b> and its operation will be described below in more detail. Moreover, as will become apparent from the various call flow processes described in detail below, the server <b>30</b> maintains control over inbound, outgoing and in-progress calls and communications.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The server <b>30</b> is preferably connected to a local area network (LAN) <b>40</b> by an appropriate communication medium <b>38</b>. Although a LAN <b>40</b> is illustrated, it should be appreciated that any other network, be it wired or wireless or a combination thereof, could be used. A plurality of computers (e.g., <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>) may be respectively connected to the LAN <b>40</b> by any appropriate communication lines <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>. The computers <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>can be used by network administrators or others to maintain server <b>30</b> and other portions of the system <b>10</b>. The LAN <b>40</b> may also be connected to the Internet <b>50</b> by a suitable communication medium <b>48</b>. A firewall <b>46</b> may be used for security purposes. In accordance with an embodiment, Internet <b>50</b> can be used to allow a remote administration device <b>52</b> (e.g., a personal computer) to perform remote administration of server <b>30</b> by office personnel or other authorized users of the system <b>10</b>. Remote administration will allow office personnel to set user preferences for particular telephone extensions. Thus, each office telephone extension and associated remote device is individually configurable.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">PSTN <b>54</b> is connected in this embodiment to a commercial wireless carrier (or other carrier not co-located with the system <b>10</b>) by a wireless switch <b>58</b> or other wireless carrier equipment by an appropriate communication medium <b>56</b>. The wireless switch <b>58</b> is connected to at least one antenna <b>60</b> (by an appropriate communication medium <b>62</b>) for transmitting signals <b>64</b> to a wireless remote device <b>70</b>. The wireless remote device could also be a wireless telephone, cellular telephone, or other wireless communication device. It may be desirable for the remote device <b>70</b> to be capable of handling both (or either) digital and analog communication signals. It should be noted that any type of wireless communication protocol (or a combination of different protocols), such as TDMA, CDMA, GSM, AMPS, MSR, iDEN, WAP, WiFi, etc., could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should be appreciated that the server <b>30</b> is connected to a wireless carrier through a PSTN <b>54</b> and/or data network (e.g., WLAN) and not by unique hardware or an in-office cellular network. As a result, server <b>30</b> only has to interface with conventional components, such as the PBX <b>14</b> and PSTN <b>54</b>. Thus, the system <b>10</b> is substantially technology independent. Moreover, special wireless devices are not required, which allows the remote device to function in its conventional manner (e.g., as a separate mobile device) and as part of the PBX network <b>11</b> (if so desired). The PSTN <b>54</b> e.g., will send calls placed to the DID phone numbers associated with the PBX extensions to the server <b>30</b> where the server <b>30</b> resolves the called number and performs the call processing described below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The server <b>30</b> and the PBX <b>14</b> may also be connected to an accounting/billing system <b>80</b>. The billing system <b>80</b> may also be connected to the LAN <b>40</b> so that system administrators may access the contents of the billing system <b>80</b>. By incorporating a billing system <b>80</b> into the system <b>10</b>, it is possible to obtain immediate billing information for calls placed to/from the remote device <b>70</b> or other remote device. This immediate billing feature is not present in other PBX or enterprise networks and is particularly useful for corporate environments such as law firms and government agencies, and hotel environments, where up to date billing information is essential.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As noted above, the server <b>30</b> allows for the full integration of remote devices into the PBX network <b>11</b>. In accordance with an embodiment, server <b>30</b> is a processor-based stand-alone unit capable of handling communications directed to the PBX network <b>11</b>. In a first embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, server <b>30</b> comprises a plurality of receiving and transmitting modules <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, first and second buses <b>275</b>, <b>285</b>, at least one processor module (Obj) <b>250</b>, a network interface card <b>240</b> and a memory module operable to comprise a database <b>270</b> such as for example, a relational database management system (RDBMS). Further, server <b>30</b> can include a web-based user interface (UI) processor module <b>265</b>, a SIP proxy server module <b>280</b> and a plurality of flop files <b>290</b><i>a</i>, <b>290</b><i>b</i>, <b>290</b><i>c</i>. The processor, UI and SIP proxy server modules <b>250</b>, <b>265</b>, <b>280</b> can be implemented, separately or together, as one or more processor cards (example hardware components of these cards are described below in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) containing source code, object modules, scripts, or other programming to perform the following functions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The SIP proxy server module <b>280</b> receives session initiation protocol (SIP) messages from user agents and acts on their behalf in forwarding or responding to those messages. In essence, the SIP proxy server module <b>280</b> is a gateway for IP-based interfaces to the server <b>30</b>. The SIP proxy server module <b>280</b> also adds services, features and scalability to SIP networks. The SIP proxy server module <b>280</b> typically includes a registration service and a SIP location database, in addition to the SIP proxy function.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Server <b>30</b> can receive an incoming call <b>210</b> and/or place an outgoing call <b>215</b> (described below in more detail). The processor module <b>250</b>, among other things, directs and instructs the call processing of the server <b>30</b>. The memory module comprising database <b>270</b> is used for storing user preferences and other pertinent information and may be a separate card or included within one of the other modules. The memory module may also be located external to the server <b>30</b>, if desired, and connected to the server <b>30</b> by any wired or wireless communication medium.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example processor card <b>400</b>, which may be used for the processor, UI and SIP proxy server modules <b>250</b>, <b>265</b>, <b>280</b>. The card <b>400</b> includes a processor <b>460</b> for executing the processes of processor module <b>250</b> (or the other modules) that communicates with various other devices of the card over a bus <b>450</b>. These devices may include random access memory (RAM) <b>420</b>, read-only memory (ROM) <b>430</b> and non-volatile memory <b>440</b>. An input/output device (I/O) <b>410</b> provides communication into and out of the card <b>400</b>. While one input/output device <b>410</b> is shown, there may be multiple I/O devices included on the card as desired. Source code, or other programming, comprising applications required by or performed by the disclosed embodiments may be stored on one of the computer readable storage media on the card <b>400</b> (e.g., ROM <b>430</b>, non-volatile memory <b>440</b>) and executed by the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the processor module <b>250</b> executes one or more computer programs or applications (Obj) stored in one or more memory units within (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or coupled to the processor module <b>250</b>. Processor module <b>250</b> can include one or more processes such as a modified VxML <b>260</b> call flow process, business logic process <b>255</b>, call service function (CSF) process <b>245</b>, and a global application processing interface (API) process <b>235</b>. It should be appreciated that processor module <b>250</b> can include one, all, or any combination of the processes described. The processor module <b>250</b> may also contain one or more additional databases and/or other processing memory used during the overall operation of system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the business logic process <b>255</b> can be used for determining whether or not a calling party (incoming or outgoing) is a participant of the server <b>30</b> network and allows the server <b>30</b> to be flexibly configured by providing routing plans and route translations, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) prompting and announcements, data manipulation, management and control. In another embodiment, the business logic <b>255</b> provides an intelligent call routing function (described below in more detail). The UI module <b>265</b> includes processes that provide an easy, but powerful, user interface to administer, configure and manage applications including the management of system, user, conference, notification, IVR and voicemail applications, to name a few.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The plurality of receiving and transmitting modules <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c </i>communicate with and handle incoming and outgoing telephone calls and are connected along bus <b>285</b>. In one embodiment, bus <b>285</b> is an H100 or similar bus. The receiving and transmitting modules <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c </i>may be telephonic cards such as e.g., Intel Dialogic cards, that communicate with processor module <b>250</b>, database <b>270</b> and other components via bus <b>275</b> (for example, a PCI bus), which is bridged to bus <b>285</b> (bridge not shown), and are employed to receive and transmit information to the PBX <b>14</b> and PSTN <b>54</b> during call processing. The modules <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c </i>also receive and transmit other information such as administrative information. In another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the receiving and transmitting modules <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c </i>can also be implemented as a processor module <b>320</b> such as e.g., a Host Media Processing (HMP) processor having a memory <b>330</b> comprising a program that, when executed, causes the processor <b>320</b> to perform the desired telephony functions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, the workload performed by the receiving and transmitting modules <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, as well as some of the processing functions of processor module <b>250</b>, are implemented using one or more conventional processor-based programmable telephony interface circuit cards (e.g., Intel Dialogic cards) used to interface server <b>30</b> with PBX <b>14</b> and the PSTN. The cards are programmed to perform the conventional telephony services required to place and receive calls, as well as being programmed to perform the unique call processing functions described below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The server <b>30</b> preferably contains a database of office extension numbers (also referred to herein as PBX extensions) and DID telephone numbers associated with each existing PBX extension, the DID numbers being associated with one or more devices including one or more remote devices <b>70</b>. The database will be stored on a computer readable storage medium, which may be part of (e.g., database <b>270</b>) or connected to the server <b>30</b>. The database may also contain a server-to-PBX extension (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;SERVER-PBX extension&#x201d;) and one or more remote device telephone numbers associated with each PBX extension. In the illustrated embodiment, software running on the telephony modules <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c </i>interfaces with the database to perform the various call processing functions discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the PBX <b>14</b> contains a coordinated dialing plan (CDP) steering table. The CDP steering table will be stored and retrieved from a computer readable storage medium, which may be part of or connected to the PBX <b>14</b>. The CDP steering table directs the routing of some or all PBX extensions to the server <b>30</b> over the PRI <b>22</b> and VoIP <b>24</b> connections between the server <b>30</b> and the PBX <b>14</b>. In addition, the CDP steering table of the PBX <b>14</b> directs the routing of all SERVER-PBX extensions received from the server <b>30</b> to the appropriate office telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates another example of a telecommunication system <b>10</b><i>a </i>constructed in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. System <b>10</b><i>a </i>comprises PBX <b>14</b>, which is connected to server <b>30</b>, including processor module <b>250</b> and database <b>270</b>, via a PRI connection <b>230</b>. As stated above, PBX <b>14</b> could also be an IP-PBX and thus, there can also be a VoIP connection between the server <b>30</b> and PBX <b>14</b>. There can also be a wireless connection (e.g., WiFi) if desired. That is, the illustrated embodiment can use wireless cellular connections (i.e., circuit switched) and data connections (i.e., packet switched) in addition to the connections illustrated and discussed above. Server <b>30</b> also includes components from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <b>3</b> as desired, but the components are not illustrated for convenience purposes. Server <b>30</b> is connected to remote device <b>70</b> via host system <b>480</b>, network <b>1024</b> and wireless network (WDN) <b>850</b> (all of which are described in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>). It should be appreciated that the communications between the server <b>30</b>, host system <b>480</b> and remote device <b>70</b> may be encrypted to render the information in the communications (i.e., telephone numbers, user login identifications, system information and settings, etc.) indecipherable to the public. Although the use of encryption is desirable, the decision of whether encryption is to be used may be left up to the end user or system administrator of the remote device <b>70</b>, host system <b>480</b> and/or server <b>30</b>. Host system <b>480</b> can include a web services connection (i.e., for the Internet) to provide an interface between server <b>30</b> and remote device <b>70</b>. The host system <b>480</b> can also include a mobile data server (e.g., server <b>1174</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) for facilitating data communications between server <b>30</b> and remote device <b>70</b>. A PSTN <b>54</b> is also in communication with server <b>30</b> and remote device <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Processor module <b>250</b> of server <b>30</b> executes one or more programs stored in its associated memory to process calls received through PBX <b>14</b> or PSTN <b>54</b>. Remote device <b>70</b> and host system <b>480</b> will also contain a &#x201c;client&#x201d; application designed to communicate with the server <b>30</b> and perform the following processing in accordance with embodiments described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a sample architecture for remote device <b>70</b>. The illustrated embodiment includes a generic presentation layer <b>541</b>, device specific presentation layer <b>542</b>, application logic <b>543</b>, generic device control <b>544</b> and device specific device control <b>545</b>. In general, the generic presentation layer <b>541</b> controls keypad and display functions. The device specific presentation layer <b>542</b> controls features specific to the device <b>70</b>. For example, depending on the remote device <b>70</b>, the features could include interfacing with a track wheel, track ball, or touch screen to name a few.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the illustrated embodiment, the device <b>70</b> typically includes the following. The device <b>70</b> will have a screen with reasonable resolution and basic graphical capabilities. The device <b>70</b> will also have a basic user input system such as e.g., function keys, reduced or full-size keyboard, and/or a graphical input capability (e.g., touch screen). The device <b>70</b> will further include a data communications interface for one or more of GPRS/EGPRS, 1XRTT/EVDO, 802.11A/B/G/N, WiMAX, LTE, UTRAN, and Satellite to name a few. The application running on the device <b>70</b> is designed as a generic application that has the capability to utilize the inherent interfaces of the device <b>70</b> (e.g., screen, input system and data communications).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The client application utilizes standard API's and built-in capabilities of the e.g., Java ME (J2ME) environment for the management of data presentation (layer <b>541</b>) and device control (control <b>544</b>). These standard capabilities allow for a level of generic data presentation, data input control and data messaging such as e.g., TCP/IP, UDP/IP, SMS, USSD, and circuit switched (CS) data to name a few. Data messaging with the above protocols would be supported by the server <b>30</b> as well. In addition, each device manufacturer can also provide device specific API's, controls and/or capabilities that allow for greater integration to the device (i.e., device specific presentation layer <b>542</b>, device specific device control <b>545</b>). These are typically included as libraries that can be built, linked or packaged with the client application. These device specific controls include, but are not limited to, such features as e.g., thumbwheel control, track ball control, phone book access and controls, security controls and extensions and proprietary or device specific message controls.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The application logic <b>543</b> manages the inputs and outputs to and from the device <b>70</b> and processes this information in a ubiquitous way to provide the generic device client capabilities such as e.g., administration, inbound call management, outbound call management and mid-call (or call in progress) management. The application logic <b>543</b> is written in a way to abstract this logic from the device specific interfaces so all the functionality will work across all the devices supported. As new/future devices become supported, the differences between the client applications is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Similar to system <b>10</b>, system <b>10</b><i>a </i>essentially implements all or part of call management functions typically available on office, enterprise or hotel PBX or other communications network desktop telephone. Some of these features are discussed in detail below. Moreover, as will become apparent from the various call flow processes described in detail below, the server <b>30</b> maintains control over inbound, outgoing and in-progress calls and communications. In accordance with example embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6H</figref> illustrate the basic call processing flows that the server <b>30</b> (via processor module <b>250</b>), host system <b>480</b> and remote device <b>70</b> may be programmed to handle and execute.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, as shown in scenarios <b>100</b> and <b>102</b>, initially a remote device <b>70</b> attempts to log into server <b>30</b> by sending a session request login data signal to the server <b>30</b> (flow lines <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>a</i>). As is described in more detail below, the message from the remote device <b>70</b> is sent through system <b>480</b> by any of the various supported methods (e.g., web services). In response, the server <b>30</b> will either send a data signal to accept the login request (flow line <b>100</b><i>b</i>) (i.e., sends a session response accept data signal) or reject the login request (flow line <b>102</b><i>b</i>) (i.e., sends a session response reject data signal). If the device <b>70</b> is accepted by the server <b>30</b>, the user has access to server <b>30</b> and the ability to process calls in any of the methods described below. It should be appreciated that the login request may be performed automatically (e.g., every time the device <b>70</b> is powered-up, or periodically), it may happen manually when the user selects a predetermined device application, or it may happen automatically or manually in response to a request from the server <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows an example of a user interface on the remote device <b>70</b> allowing the user to perform the login process. As illustrated, the user may be prompted for a user identification (Userid) <b>546</b>, which could be, but is not limited to IMS Public user ID, NAI per RFC 4282, MSISDN, selection of alphanumeric characters, etc. and then a password or personal identification number (PIN) <b>547</b> associated with the Userid. The keypad or track wheel may be used to enter the required information. It should be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> is just one example of how the user may interface with the remote device to initiate the login process.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At the end of a session or after a predetermined time period, as shown in scenario <b>103</b>, the server <b>30</b> sends a session request logout data signal to the remote device <b>70</b> (flow line <b>103</b><i>a</i>). The remote device <b>70</b> responds with a session response accept data signal accepting the logout request from the server <b>30</b> (flow line <b>103</b><i>b</i>). It should be noted that the server <b>30</b> is initially programmed to require the remote device <b>70</b> to login about every 24 hours. The user (via device <b>70</b> and as shown below) or a server administrator (via server <b>30</b>) can change this timing, as well as other system features and settings. The additional logins serve as an easy means for re-authenticating the user and the user's device, and may be optional. This timer value may be sent back in the session response accept data signal. On expiry of the timer, if no update is received from the remote device <b>70</b> the registration shall be deleted. The remote device shall store the timer in memory.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Other information may also be sent back in the session response accept data signal such as the need to perform a heart beat signal, the periodicity of said signal, and other configuration information. Such information is stored in the remote device <b>70</b>. In another implementation a URL could be sent back indicating the location of where configuration data is stored and where the remote device can retrieve said information from.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Remote device <b>70</b> and server <b>30</b> can periodically or continuously request information from each other using data signals as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. In scenario <b>105</b>, remote device <b>70</b> provides a session request heartbeat data signal to server <b>30</b> (flow line <b>105</b><i>a</i>) periodically or continuously (as set by default, user setting or system setting), which is acknowledged by server <b>30</b> in a session response acknowledge data signal (flow line <b>105</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In scenario <b>107</b>, the server <b>30</b> sends an informational update request data signal to remote device <b>70</b> (flow line <b>107</b><i>a</i>), which is acknowledged by the device <b>70</b> in an update response acknowledge data signal (flow line <b>107</b><i>b</i>). Update signals from server <b>30</b> can include e.g., profile information, system settings, messages, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In scenario <b>109</b>, the remote device <b>70</b> sends an informational update request data signal to server <b>30</b> (flow line <b>109</b><i>a</i>) that is acknowledged by the server <b>30</b> in an update response acknowledge data signal (flow line <b>109</b><i>b</i>). Update signals from the remote device <b>70</b> can include profile information, Do Not Disturb information (DND), user preferences, device configuration settings, call forwarding information such as SIP/TEL URI, E.164 number, extension, requests for translating a PNP address to another address or coded as an E.164 address (said E.164 address or PNP address may be an address with the property that when used in a communication, the communication costs incurred by the user are less than when the not transformed number was used). It should be appreciated that this application also covers the use of E.212 numbers (IMSI), but for convenience purposes only refers to E.164. A remote may decide to request translation because of the availability of the PNP, presence of a public network, or based on location indicators, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In scenario <b>104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, a user can accept an incoming call placed to a PBX extension or DID telephone number by a caller (e.g., called). The user's PBX extension or DID telephone number may be considered a primary telephone number. The user's primary telephone number could also be a primary wireless telephone number if the user desired. In the illustrated embodiment, the user's PBX extension or the DID telephone number may be the primary telephone number. Server <b>30</b> receives an incoming voice call from the calling party (flow line <b>104</b><i>a</i>). Server <b>30</b> sends a call setup request data signal to the remote device <b>70</b> (flow line <b>104</b><i>b</i>) inquiring whether or not the user would like to accept the call. The call setup request data signal will cause an audible, visual and/or vibrational indication to occur on the remote device <b>70</b> (as set by a user or system preference). System preferences could be provisioned by said techniques above or by OMA Device Management using an available data path (service) such as GPRS or via the circuit switched services SMS or USSD. Such preferences are stored in memory in the remote device, said memory could be internal or could be a removal memory media such as but not limited to Compact Flash, MicroSD, Memory Stick etc. For example, the call setup request data signal may cause the remote device <b>70</b> to play a ring, ring tone or other suitable audible indication. The call setup request data signal may cause the device <b>70</b> to display a textual or graphical message, pop-up or other visual notification (e.g., blinking LED on the device <b>70</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> illustrates a textual message &#x201c;Incoming Call from Jane Doe 123-456-7890&#x201d; to alert the user of the caller. User responses may include, e.g., &#x201c;answer&#x201d; or &#x201c;deflect&#x201d;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> illustrates options <b>555</b>, which the user may select at this point. In scenario <b>104</b>, the user chooses to answer the call by having the device <b>70</b> send a call setup response answer data signal to the server <b>30</b> (flow line <b>104</b><i>c</i>). This may be performed by selecting &#x201c;accept&#x201d; from the options <b>555</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. In response, the server <b>30</b> will setup a voice call to the remote device (voice signal flow line <b>104</b><i>d</i>) and substantially seamlessly connect the held calling party's incoming call to the remote device <b>70</b> via PSTN connection <b>54</b> (shown as voice signal flow line <b>104</b><i>e</i>). The user's acceptance or denial can be a manual input operation or automatic operation based on programmed user interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In scenario <b>106</b>, the user of the remote device <b>70</b> wishes to deflect the inbound call to voicemail (voicemail address translation may have to occur as described above). In this scenario, server <b>30</b> receives an incoming voice call from the calling party (flow line <b>106</b><i>a</i>). Server <b>30</b> sends a call setup request data signal to the remote device <b>70</b> (flow line <b>106</b><i>b</i>) inquiring whether or not the user would like to accept the call. One or more of the above mentioned visual, audible and/or vibrational indications will be present at the remote device <b>70</b>. The user chooses to deflect the call by having the device <b>70</b> send a call setup response deflect data signal to the server <b>30</b> (flow line <b>106</b><i>c</i>). This may be performed by selecting &#x201c;send to voicemail&#x201d; from the options <b>555</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. In response, the server <b>30</b> will setup a voice call to e.g., the voicemail box associated with the user's PBX extension or other voicemail box setup by the user (voice signal flow line <b>106</b><i>d</i>). The server <b>30</b> connects the held calling party's incoming call to the voicemail box via PSTN connection <b>54</b> (shown as voice signal flow lines <b>106</b><i>e </i>and <b>106</b><i>f</i>). The calling party communicates via PSTN connection <b>54</b> with the user's voicemail via a connection path between the calling party and server <b>30</b> (flow line <b>106</b><i>e</i>), and another connection path between server <b>30</b> and the voicemail (flow line <b>106</b><i>f</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, scenarios <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> illustrate outgoing (from the remote device <b>70</b> through the server <b>30</b> and thus, the PBX) call scenarios. If a user wants to place a call to party <b>1</b>, the user has the remote device <b>70</b> send an out dial request data signal (flow lines <b>108</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>a</i>) to server <b>30</b> requesting to place an outbound call through the server <b>30</b> (party <b>1</b>'s address may have to be translated as described above). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> illustrates several user interfaces for the remote device <b>70</b> to accomplish this. For example, there may be options <b>551</b> for selecting the outbound number from an address book or entering the number manually. Menu option <b>553</b> illustrates a listing of call placement options as well. Option <b>552</b> shows a field for manual entry of the number to be dialed. Option <b>554</b> illustrates another menu or pop-up that contains selections for the user to initiate the outbound call. It should be noted that any input mechanism (e.g., keyboard, track wheel, stylus, touch, voice recognition, etc.) may be used to select the desired option.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Server <b>30</b> determines from the request whether the user and/or remote device <b>70</b> has sufficient rights to place the outbound call. Server <b>30</b> will respond by sending an out dial response accept data signal accepting the user's request (flow line <b>108</b><i>b</i>), or by sending an out dial response reject data signal (flow line <b>110</b><i>b</i>) rejecting the outbound call to remote device <b>70</b> depending on the user's rights. If the server <b>30</b> rejects the request (scenario <b>110</b>), the out dial response reject data signal (flow line <b>110</b><i>b</i>) may include the reason for the rejection.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If server <b>30</b> accepts the outbound call request (scenario <b>108</b>), the server <b>30</b> will place an outbound voice call (flow line <b>108</b><i>c</i>) to the remote device <b>70</b> and another voice call (flow line <b>108</b><i>d</i>) to the called party (e.g., party <b>1</b>). The server <b>30</b> then essentially seamlessly connects the two calls allowing voice communications (two-way voice communication signal flow line <b>108</b><i>e</i>) between the called party and user of the remote device <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As can be seen, both inbound and outbound call processing do not utilize voice communications between the remote device <b>70</b> and server <b>30</b> until it is determined that the user of the device <b>70</b> wishes to receive the call (inbound) or has access rights to place the call (outbound). This saves costs by not using the PSTN connections until absolutely necessary. Moreover, the use of data signals provides the remote device <b>70</b> with additional information and control over the call, which is not done in today's devices.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Scenarios <b>112</b>-<b>130</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6E-6H</figref>, relate to call processing while a call/connection is already in progress. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, in scenario <b>112</b>, during a voice communication between remote device <b>70</b> and party <b>1</b> through server <b>30</b> (communication flow line <b>112</b><i>a</i>), server <b>30</b> receives a second voice call communication (flow line <b>112</b><i>b</i>) from party <b>2</b> destined for the user of remote device <b>70</b>. Server <b>30</b> sends a call setup request data signal (flow line <b>112</b><i>c</i>) to the remote device <b>70</b> alerting the device <b>70</b> to the new call. This may be in an in band message such as tones or an out of band message over another data channel such as but not limited to IP, SMS, USSD, etc. The call setup request data signal will cause an audible, visual and/or vibrational indication to occur on the remote device <b>70</b> (as set by a user or system preference and as described above in more detail). In scenario <b>112</b>, the remote device <b>70</b> user has chosen to deflect the second call by sending, to server <b>30</b>, a call setup response data signal (flow line <b>112</b><i>d</i>) deflecting the call to a destination contained in the data signal. This may be performed by selecting e.g., &#x201c;send to voicemail&#x201d; from the options <b>555</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. The established voice communications between the remote device <b>70</b> and party <b>1</b> remain (communication flow line <b>112</b><i>e</i>), but the server deflects the second call to the identified destination (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> as e.g., a IVR, voicemail, extension or other number) via another voice communication (flow line <b>112</b><i>f</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In scenario <b>114</b>, during a voice communication between remote device <b>70</b> and party <b>1</b> through server <b>30</b> (communication flow line <b>114</b><i>a</i>), server <b>30</b> receives a second voice call communication (flow line <b>114</b><i>b</i>) from party <b>2</b> destined for the user of remote device <b>70</b>. Server <b>30</b> sends a call setup request data signal (flow line <b>114</b><i>c</i>) to the remote device <b>70</b> alerting the device <b>70</b> to the new call. One or more of the above mentioned visual, audible and/or vibrational indications will be present at the remote device <b>70</b>. In this scenario, the user has chosen to accept the second call by sending a call setup response accept and hold data signal (flow line <b>114</b><i>d</i>) to the server <b>30</b>. This may be performed by selecting &#x201c;accept&#x201d; from the options <b>555</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. The server <b>30</b> will place the first voice call on hold (flow line <b>114</b><i>e</i>) and/or deflect the first call to the user's voicemail or destination (flow line <b>114</b><i>f</i>). Server <b>30</b> will establish and connect a voice communication (flow line <b>114</b><i>g</i>) with the remote device <b>70</b> and a voice communication (flow line <b>114</b><i>h</i>) with party <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In scenario <b>116</b>, communication flow lines <b>116</b><i>a</i>-<b>116</b><i>c </i>are similar to communication flow lines <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>114</b><i>c </i>described above. In scenario <b>116</b>, however, the user has decided to accept and conference in the second call by sending a call setup response accept and conference data signal (flow line <b>116</b><i>d</i>) to the server <b>30</b>. This may be performed by selecting an option presented on the device <b>70</b> or by pressing a key or combination of keys on the device <b>70</b>. The server <b>30</b> maintains the voice communication (flow line <b>116</b><i>e</i>) of the in progress call and connects it to a voice communication (flow line <b>116</b><i>f</i>) between the second calling party (party <b>2</b>) and server <b>30</b>, which connects party <b>1</b>, party <b>2</b> and the user of the remote device <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to other embodiments disclosed herein, during other &#x201c;call in progress&#x201d; scenarios, a user of the remote device <b>70</b> can place outbound calls as shown in scenarios <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>). In both scenarios, party <b>1</b> and a user of remote device <b>70</b> have a voice call in progress (flow lines <b>118</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>a</i>) via server <b>30</b>. In scenario <b>118</b>, the user of remote device <b>70</b> begins to place a second call by sending an out dial request hold data signal (flow line <b>118</b><i>b</i>) to server <b>30</b>. This may be performed by selecting an option presented on the device <b>70</b> or by pressing a key or combination of keys on the device <b>70</b>. Server <b>30</b> will respond using an out dial response accept data signal (flow line <b>118</b><i>c</i>). The server <b>30</b> places the first call on hold (voice communication flow line <b>118</b><i>d</i>) and/or deflects the first call to the user's voicemail or other destination (voice communication flow line <b>118</b><i>e</i>). Server <b>30</b> will then place a second voice call/communication (flow line <b>118</b><i>f</i>) to party <b>2</b> and a third voice call/communication (flow line <b>118</b><i>g</i>) to remote device <b>70</b>. Server <b>30</b> then seamlessly connects remote device <b>70</b> to the second called party (communication flow lines <b>118</b><i>h </i>and <b>118</b><i>i</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In scenario <b>120</b>, the user of remote device <b>70</b> desires to place a second call and conference in party <b>2</b>. To do so, the user of remote device <b>70</b> sends an out dial request conference data signal (flow line <b>120</b><i>b</i>) to server <b>30</b>. This may be performed by selecting an option presented on the device <b>70</b> or by pressing a key or combination of keys on the device <b>70</b>. Server <b>30</b> responds using an out dial response request data signal (flow line <b>120</b><i>c</i>). Server <b>30</b> then places a second voice call/communication (flow line <b>120</b><i>e</i>) to party <b>2</b>, while maintaining the initial voice call connection (flow line <b>120</b><i>d</i>). Server <b>30</b> will seamlessly connect the initial voice communication to the second voice communication (see communications flow lines <b>120</b><i>f </i>and <b>120</b><i>g</i>). It should be appreciated that scenarios <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> are preferably implemented using dual-mode remote devices <b>70</b> or a dual-mode interface in order to properly handle voice and data communications during the same scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Additionally, as shown in scenario <b>121</b>, during a voice communication <b>121</b><i>a </i>already in progress, remote device <b>70</b> can send a disconnect request and follow on call (FOC) data signal (flow line <b>121</b><i>b</i>) to server <b>30</b> requesting to disconnect the current voice communication and place a follow on call. This may be performed by selecting an option presented on the device <b>70</b> or by pressing a key or combination of keys on the device <b>70</b>. The server <b>30</b> acknowledges this request with a disconnect response data signal (flow line <b>121</b><i>c</i>). Server <b>30</b> will disconnect party <b>1</b>, maintain a voice communication (flow line <b>121</b><i>d</i>) with the remote device <b>70</b>, and place an outgoing voice communication call (flow line <b>121</b><i>e</i>) to party <b>2</b>. Server <b>30</b> then will connect the two voice communications to form voice conversation between the remote device <b>70</b> and party <b>2</b> (via communication flow lines <b>121</b><i>f </i>and <b>121</b><i>g</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">During similar call-in progress scenarios, a user can receive inbound calls and place outbound calls using DTMF coding via the PSTN connection as shown in scenarios <b>122</b>-<b>130</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6G and 6H</figref>. Each scenario respectively begins with a voice communication flow <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>a </i>(via server <b>30</b>) between party <b>1</b> and a user of remote device <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6G</figref>, in scenario <b>122</b>, a second voice communication (flow line <b>122</b><i>b</i>) is received by server <b>30</b>. Server <b>30</b> sends a barge-in tone signal (flow line <b>122</b><i>c</i>) via DTMF coding to remote device <b>70</b> while the original voice conversation (flow line <b>122</b><i>d</i>) continues. In a desired embodiment, the server <b>30</b> filters the signal in a manner such that only the recipient of the remote device <b>70</b> hears the tone. This way, party <b>1</b> (or party <b>2</b>) does not hear the tone. The user of the remote device <b>70</b> responds using an accept DTMF tone signal (flow line <b>122</b><i>e</i>). This may be performed by selecting an option presented on the device <b>70</b> or by pressing a key or combination of keys on the device <b>70</b>. Again, in a desired embodiment, this signal is also filtered by the server <b>30</b> to ensure that party <b>1</b> (or party <b>2</b>) does not hear the tone. The original conversation is placed on hold (communication flow line <b>122</b><i>f</i>) and/or deflected to e.g., voicemail (communication flow line <b>122</b><i>g</i>). Server <b>30</b> will seamlessly connect remote device <b>70</b> to party <b>2</b> (voice communication flow lines <b>122</b><i>h </i>and <b>122</b><i>i</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The user of the remote device <b>70</b> can, alternatively, deflect the second call to his/her voicemail or another number associated to the user's extension, as shown in scenario <b>124</b>. Communication flow lines <b>124</b><i>a</i>-<b>124</b><i>d </i>are similar to communication flow lines <b>122</b><i>a</i>-<b>122</b><i>d </i>described above. In this scenario, the user of the remote device <b>70</b> responds using a deflect DTMF tone signal (flow line <b>124</b><i>e</i>) (e.g., by selecting an option on the device <b>70</b>, or by pressing a predefined key or key combination) to deflect the second call to his/her voicemail, etc. (voice communication flow line <b>124</b><i>g</i>) while the original conversation (communication flow line <b>124</b><i>f</i>) continues.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In scenario <b>126</b>, the remote device <b>70</b> user decides to conference-in party <b>2</b>. Communication flow lines <b>126</b><i>a</i>-<b>126</b><i>d </i>are similar to communication flow lines <b>122</b><i>a</i>-<b>122</b><i>d </i>described above. In this scenario, however, the user of the remote device <b>70</b> responds using a conference DTMF tone signal (flow line <b>126</b><i>e</i>) (e.g., by selecting an option on the device <b>70</b>, or by pressing a predefined key or key combination) to alert the server that party <b>2</b> should be conferenced-in. Server <b>30</b> will then seamlessly connect the initial conversation (voice communication flow line <b>126</b><i>f</i>) and party <b>2</b> (voice communication flow line <b>126</b><i>g</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref>, in scenario <b>128</b>, during an ongoing voice communication (flow line <b>128</b><i>a</i>), the user of the remote device <b>70</b> decides to send a hold DTMF tone signal (flow line <b>128</b><i>b</i>) to server <b>30</b> requesting the server <b>30</b> to place the current call on hold and to place an outbound call. This may be performed by any of the mechanisms described above. In response, server <b>30</b> will place the original communication (flow line <b>128</b><i>c</i>) on hold and/or deflect the original call to another number e.g., user's voicemail (communication flow line <b>128</b><i>d</i>), and place an outbound voice communication (flow line <b>128</b><i>e</i>) to party <b>2</b>. Server <b>30</b> also forms a voice connection (flow line <b>128</b><i>f</i>) to the remote device <b>70</b>, and then seamlessly connects party <b>2</b> to the remote device <b>70</b> (communication flow lines <b>128</b><i>g </i>and <b>128</b><i>h</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In scenario <b>130</b>, the user of the remote device <b>70</b> can conference in party <b>2</b> (i.e., add a third party) to an existing voice communication (flow line <b>130</b><i>a</i>). To do so, the user of the remote device <b>70</b> sends a conference DTMF tone signal (flow line <b>130</b><i>b</i>) to server <b>30</b> while the existing communication (flow line <b>130</b><i>c</i>) continues. This may be performed by any of the mechanisms described above. Server <b>30</b> then places a second voice call (flow line <b>130</b><i>d</i>) to party <b>2</b> and seamlessly connects this call to the existing conversation (communication flow lines <b>130</b><i>e </i>and <b>130</b><i>f</i>) creating a conference.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">One more call in progress scenario allows the user to disconnect the current call and place a follow on call as shown in scenario <b>131</b>. That is, with a voice communication in progress (flow line <b>131</b><i>a</i>), the remote device <b>70</b> sends a disconnect, follow on call DTMF tone signal (flow line <b>131</b><i>b</i>) to the server <b>30</b>. This may be performed by any of the mechanisms described above. Server <b>30</b> allows remote device <b>70</b> to maintain a voice communication connection (flow line <b>131</b><i>c</i>) with the server <b>30</b> and then places an outgoing voice communication (flow line <b>131</b><i>d</i>) to party <b>2</b>. Server <b>30</b> will then connect remote device <b>70</b> to party <b>2</b> (communication flow lines <b>131</b><i>e </i>and <b>131</b><i>f</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It should be appreciated that the interaction between remote device <b>70</b> and server <b>30</b> can include any call processing telephony functions such as simultaneous ring across multiple devices, single voicemail box, universal voice mail notification, answer acknowledgement, making and receiving a call, abbreviating extension dialing, call hold and retrieval, multiple call appearance, direct inward/outward dialing, post digit dialing, flexible dialing plans/international dialing, caller ID (name, number), voicemail notification, auto reconnect, callback, call forwarding, call transfer, call hold, call waiting, call mute, call blocking, call redial, call parking, speed dial, operator assisted dialing, Do Not Disturb (DND), DND Bypass List (i.e., a list of names/numbers allowed to bypass the do not disturb feature), and DND Ignore List (i.e., a list of names/numbers to always divert to voicemail).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In accordance with another embodiment, system <b>10</b><i>a </i>can be implemented using other call processing formats. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when an incoming station-to-station call (i.e., a direct extension call from one internal telephone device to another internal device) is received by the PBX <b>14</b> for an existing PBX extension (step <b>510</b>), the PBX <b>14</b> looks up the PBX extension in the CDP steering table (step <b>520</b>) to determine where the call should be routed. Based on information in the CDP steering table, the call to the PBX extension is routed to the server <b>30</b> instead of being directly routed to an office telephone <b>12</b><i>a </i>(step <b>530</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As is known in the art, the incoming call will have automatic number identification (ANI) and dialed number identification service (DNIS) information. The ANI identifies the telephone number of the calling party and is traditionally used for &#x201c;caller ID.&#x201d; DNIS identifies the telephone number of the called party. The server <b>30</b> reads the ANI/DNIS information from the incoming call to obtain the DNIS information (step <b>540</b>). As noted above, the server <b>30</b> has assigned a new SERVER-PBX extension to each existing PBX extension. The SERVER-PBX extension and user preferences are obtained from database <b>270</b> through processor <b>250</b> by using the DNIS information as an index into the server <b>30</b> database <b>270</b> (step <b>550</b>). Routing information will include caller information, any additional remote telephone numbers or voicemail box numbers, or other identification numbers of communication devices associated with the PBX extension. Examples of user preferences are given below.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">At step <b>560</b>, the server <b>30</b> holds the incoming communication and pulses the PBX <b>14</b> through the PRI connection <b>22</b> between the server <b>30</b> and PBX <b>14</b> with the SERVER-PBX extension obtained in step <b>550</b>. This causes the PBX <b>14</b> to ring the associated office telephone (e.g., telephone <b>12</b><i>a</i>). At the same time (if the user preferences indicate the desire), the server <b>30</b> attempts to contact one or more alternative remote communication devices (e.g., by initially sending a data signal to the remote device <b>70</b>). In such an embodiment, the station-to-station call is thus routed to both the office telephone and also to at least one remote device <b>70</b> simultaneously or substantially simultaneously (or as determined by the user preferences).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, step <b>560</b> comprises multiple steps. When server <b>30</b> attempts to contact remote device <b>70</b> via system <b>480</b>, the server <b>30</b> will forward a data signal (e.g., a call setup request) through system <b>480</b> to the remote device <b>70</b> (step <b>560</b><i>a</i>). The data signal carries the DNIS information to the remote device <b>70</b> to alert the receiving party that an incoming enterprise call is present and to provide its associated ANI/DNIS information. At step <b>560</b><i>b</i>, remote device <b>70</b> generates identification information to display to a user. The user can then input a selection (step <b>560</b><i>c</i>) to choose to accept the call (step <b>560</b><i>d</i>), divert the call to voicemail (step <b>560</b><i>e</i>) or deny the call (step <b>560</b><i>f</i>). This choice is sent to the server via a data signal (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>). If the call is accepted, the server <b>30</b> connects the call to the user via the PSTN connection (step <b>599</b>). If the call is diverted to voicemail, the server <b>30</b> forwards the call to the voicemail box associated with the called extension (step <b>598</b>). If the call is denied by the user, the server drops the call path to the PSTN (via a user setting option on the device <b>70</b>) (step <b>597</b>). It should be appreciated that the remote device <b>70</b> can be programmed to automatically accept the call, divert the call to voicemail or deny the call based on the received ANI/DNIS information.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It should be noted that the illustrated processing <b>500</b> is one example of how an incoming station-to-station call may be handled. Individual user preferences may alter the way the call is processed. It should be noted that in a preferred embodiment, the server <b>30</b> is signaling (and if accepted, calling) the remote device and pulsing the PBX <b>14</b> with the SERVER-PBX extension. This gives the server <b>30</b> control over the connections to the office telephone <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the remote device <b>70</b>. It should also be noted that the server <b>30</b> can out dial (once the data signaling has occurred) several remote numbers, if so desired, and that the embodiments should not be limited to the dialing of one remote number. One user preference, for example, can be to route the calls sequentially (enterprise phone first, then remote device, or vice versa). Another preference may be to always send the calls only to the remote device <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At step <b>570</b>, it is determined if the current ring count (i.e., current number of rings) exceeds the maximum ring count defined by the user. Since the server <b>30</b> is controlling the call at this time it can track the number of rings. This may be done in several ways. For example, the server <b>30</b> may keep track of the number of rings using a timer that corresponds to the typical timing associated with the selected ring count. That is, if the user ring count is two, the server <b>30</b> checks to see if a time equivalent to the time it takes for two rings to occur has elapsed. If this time has elapsed, then the current &#x201c;ring count&#x201d; exceeds the maximum count defined by the user. The server <b>30</b> can instead, count the rings being sent to the extension if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If the ring count exceeds the maximum ring count, then the server <b>30</b> (if desired and determined by a user preference) forwards the call to the enterprise's voicemail (step <b>575</b>). If the ring count does not exceed the maximum ring count, the server <b>30</b> determines if the call is answered at the PBX extension (step <b>580</b>). The PBX <b>14</b> will issue an off-hook message to the server <b>30</b> if the appropriate office telephone is answered. If it is determined that the call is answered at the PBX extension, the server <b>30</b> drops the call's path to the remote device via the system <b>420</b> and maintains the path to the PBX <b>14</b> (step <b>585</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">If at step <b>590</b>, it is determined that the remote device was answered by the user, the server <b>30</b> drops the SERVER-PBX extension path to the PBX (step <b>595</b>) and initiates the connection between the calling party and the remote device (step <b>599</b>) via the PSTN. Server <b>30</b> will substantially seamlessly connect the incoming call to remote device <b>70</b> via the PSTN connection.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In accordance with the embodiments disclosed herein, it may be desired that the call to the remote device is actually answered by the user and not by a service of the wireless carrier. In known systems, wireless carriers often answer a call if there is a bad connection, the wireless channels are overloaded or for other reasons (such as initiating a wireless carrier's answering service). When the wireless carrier answers the call in these situations, the call would appear to server <b>30</b> as an &#x201c;answered call&#x201d; even if the remote user did not answer the call itself.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">One way to distinguish a user answered call from a wireless service answered call is to prompt the user to transmit an acknowledgement signal such as a dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) tone to the server <b>30</b> via the keypad of the remote device. Upon detecting the answered call, server <b>30</b> can send a voice message instructing the user to e.g., &#x201c;press 1 to complete the call or press 2 to send caller to voicemail.&#x201d; If the DTMF tone is not received, then the server <b>30</b> presumes that the call was answered by the wireless carrier, or that the user does not want to answer the call which the server <b>30</b> treats as an unanswered call.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">If the incoming call is deflected to voicemail, server <b>30</b> will connect the incoming call to an on-server or PBX voicemail box associated with the PBX extension. If the incoming call is denied, the call will be disconnected by server <b>30</b>. If the call is not answered at the remote device in step <b>590</b>, the process flow returns to step <b>570</b> to check whether the ring count has exceeded the maximum ring count. It should be noted that, if desired, the server <b>30</b> can play an interactive menu to the calling party, which allows the calling party to page the called party, leave a voicemail message or to transfer to an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In accordance with an embodiment, the database of server <b>30</b> may also contain numerous system-defined user access rights and user modifiable preferences, which can alter the call processing disclosed herein. An office administrator may use the network computers <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>or a remote administration device <b>52</b> to set user access rights and priorities. The user may use the remote administration device <b>52</b> to set numerous user preferences. It is desirable that a Web-based or graphical user interface be used so that the user can easily access and set user preferences. The network computers <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>(or remote device <b>52</b>) may also be used by the user if so desired.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Many enterprises have already provided wireless communications devices to their personnel. These wireless devices already have existing telephone numbers and are external to the enterprise PBX. Since the devices are already in use by personnel and their clients, the enterprise does not want to change their telephone numbers. There is a need to integrate these telephone numbers into the enterprise PBX. One way to integrate these telephone numbers would be to forward their unanswered calls to the voicemail. This can be accomplished whether the wireless telephone number is associated with a PBX extension or not.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">For example, the enterprise can purchase additional DID telephone numbers from the telephone company (if necessary). These additional DID telephone numbers are stored in the database of the server <b>30</b> together with special routing instructions to route all calls directly to a user's voicemail box (or other destination as desired). The user of a wireless telephone can program the wireless telephone to forward unanswered calls to his associated DID telephone number. Alternatively, the user can have the wireless carrier forward unanswered calls to the DID telephone number as well. This way, any unanswered call to the wireless telephone will be forwarded to the server <b>30</b>, which resolves the DID and forwards the call to the appropriate voicemail box. Using this feature, the likelihood is increased that the user will retrieve his messages since he can retrieve all of his messages through the voicemail. This also alleviates the need for the user to have a separate voicemail service from the wireless carrier, which may reduce the cost of the wireless service.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Embodiments described herein can be utilized in any number of different applications. One embodiment, for example, applies to a hotel having a large number of rooms with dedicated phones lines for each room to provide a second or &#x201c;virtual phone line&#x201d; without routing additional telephone lines or other wiring to the room. Each room would have the original hard-wired telephone extension that is connected to the enterprise PBX, as well as a wireless device (e.g., telephone or PDA) associated with the PBX extension (integrated using embodiments of the invention) serving as a second or virtual telephone line. If, for example, a guest of the hotel were using the hard-wired telephone line for his personal computer, he could still make and receive calls through the PBX with the wireless device. Thus, the this embodiment allows an enterprise to double its telephone lines without incurring the expense of additional wiring required to install a second line for the hotel rooms.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">It should be appreciated that the system could utilize &#x201c;voice over IP&#x201d; communications (i.e., voice over a data network) with appropriate remote devices. Many of today's wireless telephones and PDA's have the ability to place and receive cellular and data (voice over IP) telephone calls and to access the Internet or other data network. It should be appreciated that any conventional remote device could be used with this system.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In one embodiment, remote device <b>70</b> can be implemented as mobile device <b>800</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Mobile device <b>800</b> is a two-way communication device with advanced data communication capabilities including the capability to communicate with other mobile devices or computer systems through a network of transceiver stations. The mobile device may also have the capability to allow voice communication. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device, it may he referred to as a data messaging device, a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance, or a data communication device (with or without telephony capabilities). To aid the reader in understanding the structure of the mobile device <b>800</b> and how it communicates with other devices and host systems, reference will now be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, shown therein is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a mobile device <b>800</b>. The mobile device <b>800</b> includes a number of components such as a main processor <b>802</b> that controls the overall operation of the mobile device <b>800</b>. Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through a communication subsystem <b>804</b>. The communication subsystem <b>804</b> receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network <b>850</b>. In this exemplary embodiment of the mobile device <b>800</b>, the communication subsystem <b>804</b> is configured in accordance with the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) standards. The GSM/GPRS wireless network is used worldwide and it is expected that these standards will be superseded eventually by Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). New standards are still being defined, but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behavior described herein, and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein are intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting the communication subsystem <b>804</b> with the wireless network <b>850</b> represents one or more different Radio Frequency (RF) channels, operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM/GPRS communications. With newer network protocols, these channels are capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Although the wireless network <b>850</b> associated with mobile device <b>800</b> is a GSM/GPRS wireless network in one exemplary implementation, other wireless networks may also be associated with the mobile device <b>800</b> in variant implementations. The different types of wireless networks that may be employed include, for example, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual-mode networks include, but are not limited to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or CDMA2000 networks, GSM/GPRS networks (as mentioned above), and future third-generation (3G) networks like EDGE and UMTS. Some other examples of data-centric networks include WiFi 802.11, Mobitex&#x2122; and DataTAC&#x2122; network communication systems. Examples of other voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The main processor <b>802</b> also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory (RAM) <b>806</b>, a flash memory <b>808</b>, a display <b>810</b>, an auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystem <b>812</b>, a data port <b>814</b>, a keyboard <b>816</b>, a speaker <b>818</b>, a microphone <b>820</b>, short-range communications <b>822</b> and other device subsystems <b>824</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Some of the subsystems of the mobile device <b>800</b> perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide &#x201c;resident&#x201d; or on-device functions. By way of example, the display <b>810</b> and the keyboard <b>816</b> may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over the network <b>850</b>, and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The mobile device <b>800</b> can send and receive communication signals over the wireless network <b>850</b> after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device <b>800</b>. To identify a subscriber, the mobile device <b>800</b> requires a SIM/RUIM card <b>826</b> (i.e. Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module) to be inserted into a SIM/RUIM interface <b>828</b> in order to communicate with a network. The SIM card or RUIM <b>826</b> is one type of a conventional &#x201c;smart card&#x201d; that can be used to identify a subscriber of the mobile device <b>800</b> and to personalize the mobile device <b>800</b>, among other things. Without the SIM card <b>826</b>, the mobile device <b>800</b> is not fully operational for communication with the wireless network <b>850</b>. By inserting the SIM card/RUIM <b>826</b> into the SIM/RUIM interface <b>828</b>, a subscriber can access all subscribed services. Services may include: web browsing and messaging such as e-mail, voicemail, Short Message Service (SMS), and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS). More advanced services may include: point of sale, field service and sales force automation. The SIM card/RUIM <b>826</b> includes a processor and memory for storing information. Once the SIM card/RUIM <b>826</b> is inserted into the SIM/RUIM interface <b>828</b>, it is coupled to the main processor <b>802</b>. In order to identify the subscriber, the SIM card/RUIM <b>826</b> can include some user parameters such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) as defined by ITU-T E.212. An advantage of using the SIM card/RUIM <b>826</b> is that a subscriber is not necessarily bound by any single physical mobile device. The SIM card/RUIM <b>826</b> may store additional subscriber information for a mobile device as well, including datebook (or calendar) information and recent call information. Alternatively, user identification information can also be programmed into the flash memory <b>808</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The mobile device <b>800</b> is a battery-powered device and includes a battery interface <b>832</b> for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries <b>830</b>. In at least some embodiments, the battery <b>830</b> can be a smart battery with an embedded microprocessor. The battery interface <b>832</b> is coupled to a regulator (not shown), which assists the battery <b>830</b> in providing power V+ to the mobile device <b>800</b>. Although current technology makes use of a battery, future technologies such as micro fuel cells may provide the power to the mobile device <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The mobile device <b>800</b> also includes an operating system <b>834</b> and software components <b>836</b> to <b>846</b> which are described in more detail below. The operating system <b>834</b> and the software components <b>836</b> to <b>846</b> that are executed by the main processor <b>802</b> are typically stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory <b>808</b>, which may alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that portions of the operating system <b>834</b> and the software components <b>836</b> to <b>846</b>, such as specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM <b>806</b>. Other software components can also be included, as is well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The subset of software applications <b>836</b> that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed on the mobile device <b>800</b> during its manufacture. Other software applications include a message application <b>838</b> that can be any suitable software program that allows a user of the mobile device <b>800</b> to send and receive electronic messages. Various alternatives exist for the message application <b>838</b> as is well known to those skilled in the art. Messages that have been sent or received by the user are typically stored in the flash memory <b>808</b> of the mobile device <b>800</b> or some other suitable storage element in the mobile device <b>800</b>. In at least some embodiments, some of the sent and received messages may be stored remotely from the device <b>800</b> such as in a data store of an associated host system that the mobile device <b>800</b> communicates with.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The software applications can further include a device state module <b>840</b>, a Personal Information Manager (PIM) <b>842</b>, and other suitable modules (not shown). The device state module <b>840</b> provides persistence, i.e. the device state module <b>840</b> ensures that important device data is stored in persistent memory, such as the flash memory <b>808</b>, so that the data is not lost when the mobile device <b>800</b> is turned off or loses power.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The PIM <b>842</b> includes functionality for organizing and managing data items of interest to the user, such as, but not limited to, e-mail, contacts, calendar events, voicemails, appointments, and task items. A PIM application has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network <b>850</b>. PIM data items may be seamlessly integrated, synchronized, and updated via the wireless network <b>850</b> with the mobile device subscriber's corresponding data items stored and/or associated with a host computer system. This functionality creates a mirrored host computer on the mobile device <b>800</b> with respect to such items. This can be particularly advantageous when the host computer system is the mobile device subscriber's office computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The mobile device <b>800</b> also includes a connect module <b>844</b>, and an IT policy module <b>846</b>. The connect module <b>844</b> implements the communication protocols that are required for the mobile device <b>800</b> to communicate with the wireless infrastructure and any host system, such as an enterprise system, that the mobile device <b>800</b> is authorized to interface with. Examples of a wireless infrastructure and an enterprise system are given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, which are described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The connect module <b>844</b> includes a set of APIs that can be integrated with the mobile device <b>800</b> to allow the mobile device <b>800</b> to use any number of services associated with the enterprise system. The connect module <b>844</b> allows the mobile device <b>800</b> to establish an end-to-end secure, authenticated communication pipe with the host system. A subset of applications for which access is provided by the connect module <b>844</b> can be used to pass IT policy commands from the host system to the mobile device <b>800</b>. This can be done in a wireless or wired manner. These instructions can then be passed to the IT policy module <b>846</b> to modify the configuration of the device <b>800</b>. Alternatively, in some cases, the IT policy update can also be done over a wired connection.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The IT policy module <b>846</b> receives IT policy data that encodes the IT policy. The IT policy module <b>846</b> then ensures that the IT policy data is authenticated by the mobile device <b>800</b>. The IT policy data can then be stored in the flash memory <b>806</b> in its native form. After the IT policy data is stored, a global notification can be sent by the IT policy module <b>846</b> to all of the applications residing on the mobile device <b>800</b>. Applications for which the IT policy may be applicable then respond by reading the IT policy data to look for IT policy rules that are applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The IT policy module <b>846</b> can include a parser (not shown), which can be used by the applications to read the IT policy rules. In some cases, another module or application can provide the parser. Grouped IT policy rules, described in more detail below, are retrieved as byte streams, which are then sent (recursively, in a sense) into the parser to determine the values of each IT policy rule defined within the grouped IT policy rule. In at least some embodiments, the IT policy module <b>846</b> can determine which applications are affected by the IT policy data and send a notification to only those applications. In either of these cases, for applications that aren't running at the time of the notification, the applications can call the parser or the IT policy module <b>846</b> when they are executed to determine if there are any relevant IT policy rules in the newly received IT policy data.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">All applications that support rules in the IT Policy are coded to know the type of data to expect. For example, the value that is set for the &#x201c;WEP User Name&#x201d; IT policy rule is known to be a string; therefore the value in the IT policy data that corresponds to this rule is interpreted as a string. As another example, the setting for the &#x201c;Set Maximum Password Attempts&#x201d; IT policy rule is known to be an integer, and therefore the value in the IT policy data that corresponds to this rule is interpreted as such.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">After the IT policy rules have been applied to the applicable applications or configuration files, the IT policy module <b>846</b> sends an acknowledgement back to the host system to indicate that the IT policy data was received and successfully applied.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Other types of software applications can also be installed on the mobile device <b>800</b>. These software applications can be third party applications, which are added after the manufacture of the mobile device <b>800</b>. Examples of third party applications include games, calculators, utilities, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The additional applications can be loaded onto the mobile device <b>800</b> through at least one of the wireless network <b>850</b>, the auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>812</b>, the data port <b>814</b>, the short-range communications subsystem <b>822</b>, or any other suitable device subsystem <b>824</b>. This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device <b>800</b> and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The data port <b>814</b> enables a subscriber to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile device <b>800</b> by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile device <b>800</b> other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile device <b>800</b> through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to provide secure device communication.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The data port <b>814</b> can be any suitable port that enables data communication between the mobile device <b>800</b> and another computing device. The data port <b>814</b> can be a serial or a parallel port. In some instances, the data port <b>814</b> can be a USB port that includes data lines for data transfer and a supply line that can provide a charging current to charge the battery <b>830</b> of the mobile device <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The short-range communications subsystem <b>822</b> provides for communication between the mobile device <b>800</b> and different systems or devices, without the use of the wireless network <b>850</b>. For example, the subsystem <b>822</b> may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short-range communication. Examples of short-range communication standards include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Bluetooth, and the 802.11 family of standards developed by IEEE.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In use, a received signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem <b>804</b> and input to the main processor <b>802</b>. The main processor <b>802</b> will then process the received signal for output to the display <b>810</b> or alternatively to the auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>812</b>. A subscriber may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, using the keyboard <b>816</b> in conjunction with the display <b>810</b> and possibly the auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>812</b>. The auxiliary subsystem <b>812</b> may include devices such as: a touch screen, mouse, track ball, infrared fingerprint detector, or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. The keyboard <b>816</b> is preferably an alphanumeric keyboard and/or telephone-type keypad. However, other types of keyboards may also be used. A composed item may be transmitted over the wireless network <b>850</b> through the communication subsystem <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">For voice communications, the overall operation of the mobile device <b>800</b> is substantially similar, except that the received signals are output to the speaker <b>818</b>, and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone <b>820</b>. Alternative voice or audio I/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, can also be implemented on the mobile device <b>800</b>. Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the speaker <b>818</b>, the display <b>810</b> can also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an exemplary block diagram of the communication subsystem component <b>804</b> is shown. The communication subsystem <b>804</b> includes a receiver <b>950</b>, a transmitter <b>952</b>, as well as associated components such as one or more embedded or internal antenna elements <b>954</b> and <b>956</b>, Local Oscillators (LOs) <b>958</b>, and a processing module such as a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) <b>960</b>. The particular design of the communication subsystem <b>804</b> is dependent upon the communication network <b>850</b> with which the mobile device <b>800</b> is intended to operate. Thus, it should be understood that the design illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> serves only as one example.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Signals received by the antenna <b>954</b> through the wireless network <b>850</b> are input to the receiver <b>950</b>, which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, and analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion. A/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP <b>960</b>. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, by the DSP <b>960</b>. These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter <b>952</b> for digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission over the wireless network <b>850</b> via the antenna <b>956</b>. The DSP <b>960</b> not only processes communication signals, but also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver <b>950</b> and the transmitter <b>952</b> may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP <b>960</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The wireless link between the mobile device <b>800</b> and the wireless network <b>850</b> can contain one or more different channels, typically different RF channels, and associated protocols used between the mobile device <b>800</b> and the wireless network <b>850</b>. An RF channel is a limited resource that must be conserved, typically due to limits in overall bandwidth and limited battery power of the mobile device <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">When the mobile device <b>800</b> is fully operational, the transmitter <b>952</b> is typically keyed or turned on only when it is transmitting to the wireless network <b>850</b> and is otherwise turned off to conserve resources. Similarly, the receiver <b>950</b> is periodically turned off to conserve power until it is needed to receive signals or information (if at all) during designated time periods.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a block diagram of an exemplary implementation of a node <b>1002</b> of the wireless network <b>850</b> is shown. In practice, the wireless network <b>850</b> comprises one or more nodes <b>1002</b>. In conjunction with the connect module <b>844</b>, the mobile device <b>800</b> can communicate with the node <b>1002</b> within the wireless network <b>850</b>. In the exemplary implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the node <b>1002</b> is configured in accordance with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) technologies. The node <b>1002</b> includes a base station controller (BSC) <b>1004</b> with an associated tower station <b>1006</b>, a Packet Control Unit (PCU) <b>1008</b> added for GPRS support in GSM, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) <b>1010</b>, a Home Location Register (HLR) <b>1012</b>, a Visitor Location Registry (VLR) <b>1014</b>, a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) <b>1016</b>, a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) <b>1018</b>, and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) <b>1020</b>. This list of components is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the components of every node <b>1002</b> within a GSM/GPRS network, but rather a list of components that are commonly used in communications through the network <b>850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In a GSM network, the MSC <b>1010</b> is coupled to the BSC <b>1004</b> and to a landline network, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) <b>1022</b> to satisfy circuit switched requirements. The connection through the PCU <b>1008</b>, the SGSN <b>1016</b> and the GGSN <b>1018</b> to a public or private network (Internet) <b>1024</b> (also referred to herein generally as a shared network infrastructure) represents the data path for GPRS capable mobile devices. In a GSM network extended with GPRS capabilities, the BSC <b>1004</b> also contains the Packet Control Unit (PCU) <b>1008</b> that connects to the SGSN <b>1016</b> to control segmentation, radio channel allocation and to satisfy packet switched requirements. To track the location of the mobile device <b>800</b> and availability for both circuit switched and packet switched management, the HLR <b>1012</b> is shared between the MSC <b>1010</b> and the SGSN <b>1016</b>. Access to the VLR <b>1014</b> is controlled by the MSC <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The station <b>1006</b> is a fixed transceiver station and together with the BSC <b>1004</b> form fixed transceiver equipment. The fixed transceiver equipment provides wireless network coverage for a particular coverage area commonly referred to as a &#x201c;cell&#x201d;. The fixed transceiver equipment transmits communication signals to and receives communication signals from mobile devices within its cell via the station <b>1006</b>. The fixed transceiver equipment normally performs such functions as modulation and possibly encoding and/or encryption of signals to be transmitted to the mobile device <b>800</b> in accordance with particular, usually predetermined, communication protocols and parameters, under control of its controller. The fixed transceiver equipment similarly demodulates and possibly decodes and decrypts, if necessary, any communication signals received from the mobile device <b>800</b> within its cell. Communication protocols and parameters may vary between different nodes. For example, one node may employ a different modulation scheme and operate at different frequencies than other nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">For all mobile devices <b>800</b> registered with a specific network, permanent configuration data such as a user profile is stored in the HLR <b>1012</b>. The HLR <b>1012</b> also contains location information for each registered mobile device and can be queried to determine the current location of a mobile device. The MSC <b>1010</b> is responsible for a group of location areas and stores the data of the mobile devices currently in its area of responsibility in the VLR <b>1014</b>. Further, the VLR <b>1014</b> also contains information on mobile devices that are visiting other networks. The information in the VLR <b>1014</b> includes part of the permanent mobile device data transmitted from the HLR <b>1012</b> to the VLR <b>1014</b> for faster access. By moving additional information from a remote HLR <b>1012</b> node to the VLR <b>1014</b>, the amount of traffic between these nodes can be reduced so that voice and data services can be provided with faster response times and at the same time requiring less use of computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The SGSN <b>1016</b> and the GGSN <b>1018</b> are elements added for GPRS support; namely packet switched data support, within GSM. The SGSN <b>1016</b> and the MSC <b>1010</b> have similar responsibilities within the wireless network <b>850</b> by keeping track of the location of each mobile device <b>800</b>. The SGSN <b>1016</b> also performs security functions and access control for data traffic on the wireless network <b>800</b>. The GGSN <b>1018</b> provides internetworking connections with external packet switched networks and connects to one or more SGSN's <b>1016</b> via an Internet Protocol (IP) backbone network operated within the network <b>850</b>. During normal operations, a given mobile device <b>800</b> must perform a &#x201c;GPRS Attach&#x201d; to acquire an IP address and to access data services. This requirement is not present in circuit switched voice channels as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) addresses are used for routing incoming and outgoing calls. Currently, all GPRS capable networks use private, dynamically assigned IP addresses, thus requiring the DHCP server <b>1020</b> connected to the GGSN <b>1018</b>. There are many mechanisms for dynamic IP assignment, including using a combination of a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server and a DHCP server. Once the GPRS Attach is complete, a logical connection is established from a mobile device <b>800</b>, through the PCU <b>1008</b>, and the SGSN <b>1016</b> to an Access Point Node (APN) within the GGSN <b>1018</b>. The APN represents a logical end of an IP tunnel that can either access direct Internet compatible services or private network connections. The APN also represents a security mechanism for the network <b>850</b>, insofar as each mobile device <b>800</b> must be assigned to one or more APNs and mobile devices <b>800</b> cannot exchange data without first performing a GPRS Attach to an APN that it has been authorized to use. The APN may be considered to be similar to an Internet domain name such as &#x201c;myconnection.wireless.com&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Once the GPRS Attach operation is complete, a tunnel is created and all traffic is exchanged within standard IP packets using any protocol that can be supported in IP packets. This includes tunneling methods such as IP over IP as in the case with some IPSecurity (IPsec) connections used with Virtual Private Networks (VPN). These tunnels are also referred to as Packet Data Protocol (PDP) Contexts and there are a limited number of these available in the network <b>850</b>. To maximize use of the PDP Contexts, the network <b>800</b> will run an idle timer for each PDP Context to determine if there is a lack of activity. When a mobile device <b>800</b> is not using its PDP Context, the PDP Context can be de-allocated and the IP address returned to the IP address pool managed by the DHCP server <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, shown therein is a block diagram illustrating components of an exemplary configuration of a host system <b>480</b> that the mobile device <b>800</b> can communicate with in conjunction with the connect module <b>844</b>. The host system <b>480</b> will typically be a corporate enterprise or other local area network (LAN), but may also be a home office computer or some other private system, for example, in variant implementations. In this example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the host system <b>480</b> is depicted as a LAN of an organization to which a user of the mobile device <b>800</b> belongs. Typically, a plurality of mobile devices can communicate wirelessly with the host system <b>480</b> through one or more nodes <b>1002</b> of the wireless network <b>850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The host system <b>480</b> comprises a number of network components connected to each other by a network <b>1160</b>. For instance, a user's desktop computer <b>1162</b><i>a </i>with an accompanying cradle <b>1164</b> for the user's mobile device <b>800</b> is situated on a LAN connection. The cradle <b>1164</b> for the mobile device <b>800</b> can be coupled to the computer <b>1162</b><i>a </i>by a serial or a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, for example. Other user computers <b>1162</b><i>b</i>-<b>1162</b><i>n </i>are also situated on the network <b>1160</b>, and each may or may not be equipped with an accompanying cradle <b>1164</b>. The cradle <b>1164</b> facilitates the loading of information (e.g. PIM data, private symmetric encryption keys to facilitate secure communications) from the user computer <b>1162</b><i>a </i>to the mobile device <b>800</b>, and may be particularly useful for bulk information updates often performed in initializing the mobile device <b>800</b> for use. The information downloaded to the mobile device <b>800</b> may include certificates used in the exchange of messages.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the user computers <b>1162</b><i>a</i>-<b>1162</b><i>n </i>will typically also be connected to other peripheral devices, such as printers, etc. which are not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Furthermore, only a subset of network components of the host system <b>480</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> for ease of exposition, and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the host system <b>480</b> will comprise additional components that are not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> for this exemplary configuration. More generally, the host system <b>480</b> may represent a smaller part of a larger network (not shown) of the organization, and may comprise different components and/or be arranged in different topologies than that shown in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">To facilitate the operation of the mobile device <b>800</b> and the wireless communication of messages and message-related data between the mobile device <b>800</b> and components of the host system <b>480</b>, a number of wireless communication support components <b>1170</b> can be provided. In some implementations, the wireless communication support components <b>1170</b> can include a message management server <b>1172</b>, a mobile data server <b>1174</b>, a contact server <b>1176</b>, and a device manager module <b>1178</b>. The device manager module <b>1178</b> includes an IT Policy editor <b>1180</b> and an IT user property editor <b>1182</b>, as well as other software components for allowing an IT administrator to configure the mobile devices <b>800</b>. In an alternative embodiment, there may be one editor that provides the functionality of both the IT policy editor <b>1180</b> and the IT user property editor <b>1182</b>. The support components <b>1170</b> also include a data store <b>1184</b>, and an IT policy server <b>1186</b>. The IT policy server <b>286</b> includes a processor <b>1188</b>, a network interface <b>1190</b> and a memory unit <b>1192</b>. The processor <b>1188</b> controls the operation of the IT policy server <b>1186</b> and executes functions related to the standardized IT policy as described below.

<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In this exemplary embodiment, the mobile device <b>800</b> communicates with the host system <b>480</b> through node <b>1002</b> of the wireless network <b>850</b> and a shared network infrastructure <b>1124</b> such as a service provider network or the public Internet. Access to the host system <b>480</b> may be provided through one or more routers (not shown), and computing devices of the host system <b>480</b> may operate from behind a firewall or proxy server <b>1166</b>. The proxy server <b>1166</b> provides a secure node and a wireless internet gateway for the host system <b>480</b>. The proxy server <b>1166</b> intelligently routes data to the correct destination server within the host system <b>480</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some implementations, the host system <b>480</b> can include a wireless VPN router (not shown) to facilitate data exchange between the host system <b>480</b> and the mobile device <b>800</b>. The wireless VPN router allows a VPN connection to be established directly through a specific wireless network to the mobile device <b>800</b>. The wireless VPN router can be used with the Internet Protocol (IP) Version 6 (IPV6) and IP-based wireless networks. This protocol can provide enough IP addresses so that each mobile device has a dedicated IP address, making it possible to push information to a mobile device at any time. An advantage of using a wireless VPN router is that it can be an off-the-shelf VPN component, and does not require a separate wireless gateway and separate wireless infrastructure. A VPN connection can preferably be a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP)/IP connection for delivering the messages directly to the mobile device <b>800</b> in this alternative implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Messages intended for a user of the mobile device <b>800</b> are initially received by a message server <b>1168</b> of the host system <b>480</b>. Such messages may originate from any number of sources. For instance, a message may have been sent by a sender from the computer <b>1162</b><i>b </i>within the host system <b>480</b>, from a different mobile device (not shown) connected to the wireless network <b>850</b> or a different wireless network, or from a different computing device, or other device capable of sending messages, via the shared network infrastructure <b>1124</b>, possibly through an application service provider (ASP) or Internet service provider (ISP), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The message server <b>1168</b> typically acts as the primary interface for the exchange of messages, particularly e-mail messages, within the organization and over the shared network infrastructure <b>1124</b>. Each user in the organization that has been set up to send and receive messages is typically associated with a user account managed by the message server <b>1168</b>. Some exemplary implementations of the message server <b>1168</b> include a Microsoft Exchange&#x2122; server, a Lotus Domino&#x2122; server, a Novell Groupwise&#x2122; server, or another suitable mail server installed in a corporate environment. In some implementations, the host system <b>480</b> may comprise multiple message servers <b>1168</b>. The message server <b>1168</b> may also be adapted to provide additional functions beyond message management, including the management of data associated with calendars and task lists, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">When messages are received by the message server <b>1168</b>, they are typically stored in a data store associated with the message server <b>1168</b>. In at least some embodiments, the data store may be a separate hardware unit, such as data store <b>1184</b>, that the message server <b>1168</b> communicates with. Messages can be subsequently retrieved and delivered to users by accessing the message server <b>1168</b>. For instance, an e-mail client application operating on a user's computer <b>1162</b><i>a </i>may request the e-mail messages associated with that user's account stored on the data store associated with the message server <b>1168</b>. These messages are then retrieved from the data store and stored locally on the computer <b>1162</b><i>a</i>. The data store associated with the message server <b>1168</b> can store copies of each message that is locally stored on the mobile device <b>800</b>. Alternatively, the data store associated with the message server <b>1168</b> can store all of the messages for the user of the mobile device <b>800</b> and only a smaller number of messages can be stored on the mobile device <b>800</b> to conserve memory. For instance, the most recent messages (i.e., those received in the past two to three months for example) can be stored on the mobile device <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">When operating the mobile device <b>800</b>, the user may wish to have e-mail messages retrieved for delivery to the mobile device <b>800</b>. The message application <b>838</b> operating on the mobile device <b>800</b> may also request messages associated with the user's account from the message server <b>1168</b>. The message application <b>838</b> may be configured (either by the user or by an administrator, possibly in accordance with an organization's information technology (IT) policy) to make this request at the direction of the user, at some pre-defined time interval, or upon the occurrence of some pre-defined event. In some implementations, the mobile device <b>800</b> is assigned its own e-mail address, and messages addressed specifically to the mobile device <b>800</b> are automatically redirected to the mobile device <b>800</b> as they are received by the message server <b>1168</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The message management server <b>1172</b> can be used to specifically provide support for the management of messages, such as e-mail messages, that are to be handled by mobile devices. Generally, while messages are still stored on the message server <b>1168</b>, the message management server <b>1172</b> can be used to control when, if, and how messages are sent to the mobile device <b>800</b>. The message management server <b>1172</b> also facilitates the handling of messages composed on the mobile device <b>800</b>, which are sent to the message server <b>1168</b> for subsequent delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">For example, the message management server <b>1172</b> may monitor the user's &#x201c;mailbox&#x201d; (e.g. the message store associated with the user's account on the message server <b>1168</b>) for new e-mail messages, and apply user-definable filters to new messages to determine if and how the messages are relayed to the user's mobile device <b>800</b>. The message management server <b>1172</b> may also compress and encrypt new messages (e.g. using an encryption technique such as Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES, or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)) and push them to the mobile device <b>800</b> via the shared network infrastructure <b>1124</b> and the wireless network <b>850</b>. The message management server <b>1172</b> may also receive messages composed on the mobile device <b>800</b> (e.g. encrypted using Triple DES), decrypt and decompress the composed messages, re-format the composed messages if desired so that they will appear to have originated from the user's computer <b>1162</b><i>a</i>, and re-route the composed messages to the message server <b>1168</b> for delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Certain properties or restrictions associated with messages that are to be sent from and/or received by the mobile device <b>800</b> can be defined (e.g. by an administrator in accordance with IT policy) and enforced by the message management server <b>1172</b>. These may include whether the mobile device <b>800</b> may receive encrypted and/or signed messages, minimum encryption key sizes, whether outgoing messages must be encrypted and/or signed, and whether copies of all secure messages sent from the mobile device <b>800</b> are to be sent to a pre-defined copy address, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The message management server <b>1172</b> may also be adapted to provide other control functions, such as only pushing certain message information or pre-defined portions (e.g. &#x201c;blocks&#x201d;) of a message stored on the message server <b>1168</b> to the mobile device <b>800</b>. For example, in some cases, when a message is initially retrieved by the mobile device <b>800</b> from the message server <b>1168</b>, the message management server <b>1172</b> may push only the first part of a message to the mobile device <b>800</b>, with the part being of a pre-defined size (e.g. 2 KB). The user can then request that more of the message be delivered in similar-sized blocks by the message management server <b>1172</b> to the mobile device <b>800</b>, possibly up to a maximum pre-defined message size. Accordingly, the message management server <b>1172</b> facilitates better control over the type of data and the amount of data that is communicated to the mobile device <b>800</b>, and can help to minimize potential waste of bandwidth or other resources.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The mobile data server <b>1174</b> encompasses any other server that stores information that is relevant to the corporation. The mobile data server <b>1174</b> may include, but is not limited to, databases, online data document repositories, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, or enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The contact server <b>1176</b> can provide information for a list of contacts for the user in a similar fashion as the address book on the mobile device <b>800</b>. Accordingly, for a given contact, the contact server <b>1176</b> can include the name, phone number, work address and e-mail address of the contact, among other information. The contact server <b>1176</b> can also provide a global address list that contains the contact information for all of the contacts associated with the host system <b>480</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the message management server <b>1172</b>, the mobile data server <b>1174</b>, the contact server <b>1176</b>, the device manager module <b>1178</b>, the data store <b>1184</b> and the IT policy server <b>1186</b> do not need to be implemented on separate physical servers within the host system <b>480</b>. For example, some or all of the functions associated with the message management server <b>1172</b> may be integrated with the message server <b>1168</b>, or some other server in the host system <b>480</b>. Alternatively, the host system <b>840</b> may comprise multiple message management servers <b>1172</b>, particularly in variant implementations where a large number of mobile devices need to be supported.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Alternatively, in some embodiments, the IT policy server <b>1186</b> can provide the IT policy editor <b>1180</b>, the IT user property editor <b>1182</b> and the data store <b>1184</b>. In some cases, the IT policy server <b>1186</b> can also provide the device manager module <b>1178</b>. The processor <b>1188</b> can execute the editors <b>1180</b> and <b>1182</b>. In some cases, the functionality of the editors <b>1180</b> and <b>1182</b> can be provided by a single editor. In some cases, the memory unit <b>1192</b> can provide the data store <b>1184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The device manager module <b>1178</b> provides an IT administrator with a graphical user interface with which the IT administrator interacts to configure various settings for the mobile devices <b>800</b>. As mentioned, the IT administrator can use IT policy rules to define behaviors of certain applications on the mobile device <b>800</b> that are permitted such as phone, web browser or Instant Messenger use. The IT policy rules can also be used to set specific values for configuration settings that an organization requires on the mobile devices <b>800</b> such as auto signature text, WLAN/VoIP/VPN configuration, security requirements (e.g. encryption algorithms, password rules, etc.), specifying themes or applications that are allowed to run on the mobile device <b>800</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Another embodiment described herein implements priority preemption to any device associated with the server <b>30</b> used in the enterprise network. This includes any voice, data and/or satellite devices associated with a telephone number of the enterprise network. This allows priority users to preempt existing communications and communicate with certain individuals even though that individual is using a wireless telephone or other remote device. To implement this priority preemption feature, the server <b>30</b> should be programmed to recognize a special dialing pattern, data message or other input from one of the many devices that the high priority user may be using. This unique pattern whether it is a dialing pattern, data message or other input is referred to herein as the preemption signal. The priority preemption signal proceeds a telephone number in which the high priority user wishes to call. If the individual associated with the telephone number is already on another call, then the priority preemption may be invoked as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates priority preemption processing <b>1200</b> performed by an embodiment of the invention. The processing <b>1200</b> begins when the server unit detects a preemption signal and a dialed telephone number (step <b>1202</b>). The server unit checks the preemption signal to determine if it is a valid signal (step <b>1204</b>). If valid, the server unit uses the signal to determine the priority of the caller, the individual associated with the dialed telephone number, and if possible, the priority of the individual on the active call (step <b>1206</b>). The server <b>30</b> compares the priorities to determine if the person attempting to preempt the call has the highest priority (step <b>1210</b>) and if so, sends a data signal through system <b>420</b> to the remote device (step <b>1214</b>). If the remote device accepts the preemption, server <b>30</b> will withdraw the connected call from the remote device and connect the new priority call through the PSTN connection. Due to the flexibility of the server unit, priority preemption may be implemented using DTMF, IVR, web based or micro-browser communications.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">If the person attempting to preempt the call does not have the highest priority (step <b>1210</b>) or if the preemption signal is invalid (step <b>1204</b>), then additional call processing may be performed (step <b>1212</b>). This additional processing may be a prompt, voice or text message or other alert to the caller to indicate that the preemption cannot occur at this time. The processing may also include a menu of options in which the caller can choose to leave a message, try again, or merely hang up. It should be appreciated that priority preemption may be implemented in any manner desired by the enterprise and that the embodiment is not limited to the specific steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">While preferred embodiments have been specifically described and illustrated herein, it should be apparent that many modifications to the embodiments and implementations can be made. For example, while the preferred embodiments illustrated herein have been limited to the processing of voice (packet or circuit switched) calls, it should be readily apparent that any form of call (e.g., audio, video, data) may be processed through server <b>30</b> to any communication device (e.g., cellular phone, pager, office/residential landline telephone, computer terminal, personal digital assistant (PDA), RIM device, etc.). The individual method steps of the exemplary operational flows illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-7A</figref> may be interchanged in order, combined, replaced or even added. Any number of different operations not illustrated herein may be performed during the processing. Moreover, the method steps may be performed by hardware, software, firmware or any combinations of hardware, software, firmware or logic elements.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In addition, while the illustrated embodiments have demonstrated implementations using PBX-based communication systems, it should be readily apparent that the server module may be connected (directly, indirectly, co-located, or remotely) with any other network switching device or communication system used to process calls such as a central switching office, centrex system, or Internet server for telephone calls made over the public switched telephone network, private telephone networks, or even Internet Protocol (IP) telephony networks made over the Internet. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the embodiments do not need a PBX to operate or to perform any of the processing illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-7A</figref>. All that is required is a properly programmed server <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">It should be apparent that, while only PRI lines (e.g., between PBX <b>14</b> and server <b>30</b>, between PBX <b>14</b> and PSTN <b>16</b>) have been illustrated in discussing preferred embodiments, these communication lines (as well as any other communication lines or media discussed herein) may be of any form, format, or medium (e.g., PRI, T1, OC3, electrical, optical, wired, wireless, digital, analog, etc.). Moreover, although PSTN <b>16</b>, <b>54</b> are depicted as separate networks for illustration purposes, it should be readily apparent that a single PSTN network alone may be used. It should be noted that the server <b>30</b> could trunk back to the PBX <b>14</b> instead of being directly connected to the PSTN <b>54</b>. The use of a commercial wireless carrier network (represented by wireless switch <b>58</b> and antenna <b>60</b>) as described herein may be implemented using one or more commercial carriers using the same or different signaling protocols (e.g., Sprint/Nextel, etc.) depending on the communication devices registered with the system.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The modules described herein such as the modules making up server <b>30</b>, as well as server <b>30</b> and PBX <b>14</b> themselves, may be one or more hardware, software, or hybrid components residing in (or distributed among) one or more local or remote systems. It should be readily apparent that the modules may be combined (e.g., server <b>30</b> and PBX <b>14</b>) or further separated into a variety of different components, sharing different resources (including processing units, memory, clock devices, software routines, etc.) as required for the particular implementation of the embodiments disclosed herein. Indeed, even a single general purpose computer executing a computer program stored on a recording medium to produce the functionality and any other memory devices referred to herein may be utilized to implement the illustrated embodiments. User interface devices utilized by in or in conjunction with server <b>30</b> may be any device used to input and/or output information. The interface devices may be implemented as a graphical user interface (GUI) containing a display or the like, or may be a link to other user input/output devices known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Furthermore, memory units employed by the system may be any one or more of the known storage devices (e.g., Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), hard disk drive (HDD), floppy drive, zip drive, compact disk-ROM, DVD, bubble memory, etc.), and may also be one or more memory devices embedded within a CPU, or shared with one or more of the other components. Accordingly, the claimed invention is not to be seen as limited by the foregoing description, but is only limited by the scope of the appended claims.</p>
