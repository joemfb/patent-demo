<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a vertical roller mill employed in, for example, a pulverized-coal-fired boiler or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a coal-fired boiler in the related art, for example, raw-material coal is input to a coal pulverizer, such as a vertical roller mill <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, from a coal feeding pipe <b>14</b>, and ground pulverized coal is used as fuel. Inside the vertical roller mill <b>10</b>, a grinding roller <b>13</b>, while rotating, revolves on a grinding table <b>12</b> installed in a casing <b>11</b> at a lower portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The raw-material coal input to the vertical roller mill <b>10</b> is ground into pulverized coal by being crunched between the grinding table <b>12</b> and the grinding roller <b>13</b>. Hot air jetted from a throat <b>15</b> disposed in the periphery of the grinding table <b>12</b> transports the pulverized coal by means of an airflow, while drying it, to a fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> disposed thereabove in the casing <b>11</b>. Because gravitational sorting is performed at this time, in which large coarse particles having large particle sizes drop due to gravity and are returned onto the grinding table <b>12</b>, the pulverized coal is repeatedly ground until a desired particle size is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">After the primary sorting by means of the gravitational sorting, product pulverized-coal particles containing coarse particles are further sorted by the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> disposed at the top of the grinding table <b>12</b>. This type of sorter includes a rotating type and a type in which a fixed type and a rotating type are combined, in addition to the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>. Note that a rotating-type sorter performs sorting by means of collision with rotating blades and an inertial force, and it is known to have high sorting capability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The pulverized coal transported by means of the airflow is dried by the hot air, and, in addition, it is sorted by passing through the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>. The sorted pulverized coal passes through a pulverized-coal exit <b>16</b> which communicates with the exterior above the casing <b>11</b> from the interior of the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> and is transported to a boiler (not shown) by means of the airflow of transporting primary air.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> is provided, at the top end of a cone <b>21</b>, with numerous fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b> serving as openings at equal intervals in the circumferential direction. The fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b> are opening portions provided so as to penetrate through a wall surface that forms the cone <b>21</b> and serve as entrances and flow paths where the flow of the pulverized coal transported by the airflow (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;solid-gas two-phase flow&#x201d;) passes through to flow into the interior of the cone <b>21</b>. Fixed blades <b>23</b> corresponding to the individual fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b> are attached to the inner wall of the cone <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An inner cylinder <b>24</b> that forms a wall surface facing the fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b> and the fixed blades <b>23</b> is provided on the inner side of the cone <b>21</b>. In order to cause the solid-gas two-phase flow to spiral, all fixed blades <b>23</b> are attached with an inclination in the same direction, that is, having an inclined angle with respect to a line extending in the radial direction toward the axial center of the cone <b>21</b>. Therefore, by increasing or decreasing the inclination angle of the fixed blades <b>23</b>, the intensity of the spiral flow can also be changed in accordance with the degree of opening (angle) of the fixed blades <b>23</b>, which makes it to possible to adjust the powder fineness for sorting.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Note that the bottom end of the cone <b>21</b> serves as a cone exit <b>25</b> from which the coarse particles sorted by the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> are supplied onto the grinding table <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Because the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> is inferior in terms of sorting precision in a coarse particle region, and an increased amount of coarse particles (coarse particles whose approximate sizes exceed 100 mesh, which adversely affect combustibility) is contained in the pulverized coal, this causes uncombusted components contained in combustion exhaust gas expelled from the boiler to increase.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>, the solid-gas two-phase flow that passes through between adjacent fixed blades <b>23</b> from the fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b> centrifugally sorts pulverized coal particles into coarse particles and fine powder by means of a spiral flow. Subsequently, the fine powder that has a small particle size and low weight is swirled up by being carried by a reverse upward flow from below the cone <b>21</b>, enters the inner side of the inner cylinder <b>24</b> from below the inner cylinder <b>24</b>, and flows out to the exterior of the vertical roller mill <b>10</b> from the pulverized-coal exit <b>16</b>. On the other hand, because the coarse particles having large particle sizes that have been centrifugally separated are heavy and cannot be carried by the flow entering the inner side of the inner cylinder <b>24</b> from below the inner cylinder <b>24</b>, they reach the inner wall of the cone <b>21</b> and fall downward along the inner-wall surface of the cone <b>21</b> due to gravity. The coarse particles eventually fall onto the grinding table <b>12</b>, to be ground again, from the cone exit <b>25</b> provided as an opening at the center of the lower portion of the cone <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the related art with regard to vertical roller mills provided with a fixed-type sorter, in order to enhance the sorting capability for ground pulverized coal, it has been proposed to modify flat-plate fixed blades into wave-shaped vanes. With the wave-shaped vanes, even if coarse coal particles flow in from all entry angles when a mixed airflow spiraling upward together with primary air is taken into the spaces between the waved-shaped vanes of a fixed-type sorter, because collisions occur at airflow colliding portions of the wave-shaped vanes and sorting is performed, the sorting capability of the fixed-type sorter is enhanced (for example, Patent Literature 1).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, with rotating-type sorters that have a high sorting capability, in order to further enhance the sorting capability thereof, two stages of rotating blades are disposed in the direction of the rotation axis, and lower-stage blades are inclined with respect to an outer circumferential wall of a rotor, or pivoting portions that can freely pivot are provided at tip portions of the rotating blades (for example, Patent Literature 2).</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">As described above, with the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> of the vertical roller mill <b>10</b>, ground pulverized coal is sorted into coarse particles and fine powder by means of centrifugal force; however, because the centrifugal effect on coarse powder close to the product particle size (particle size between coarse particles and fine particles, that is, particle size of about 150 &#x3bc;m, which is the source of uncombusted components) is weak, a portion thereof flows toward the center close to the inner cylinder <b>24</b> due to fluctuations in the solid-gas two-phase flow and so forth, which results in a tendency to spiral and fall near the inner cylinder <b>24</b>. Because of this, the probability of the coarse powder being mixed into the reverse upward flow of fine powder increases, and there is a problem in that the sorting efficiency deteriorates due to an increased amount of coarse powder that gets mixed into the product pulverized coal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">On the other hand, with the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>, the powder fineness is adjusted and set by adjusting the degree of opening of the fixed blades <b>23</b>. In other words, the mill is operated such that the powder fineness is increased by increasing the centrifugal force by reducing the degree of opening (increasing the inclination angle) of the fixed blades <b>23</b>, and, in contrast, the powder fineness is decreased by reducing the centrifugal force by increasing the degree of opening (reducing the inclination angle) of the fixed blades <b>23</b>. When the powder fineness is decreased by increasing the degree of opening of the fixed blades <b>23</b>, centrifugal sorting is not sufficient for coarse powder passing over the fixed blades <b>23</b>, and therefore, because the coarse powder is more likely to flow toward the center together with the fine powder to be swirled up by the reverse upward flow, the deterioration of the sorting precision increases.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">Depending on the degree of opening of the fixed blades <b>23</b>, a portion of the coarse particles that have flowed toward the center collides with the inner cylinder <b>24</b> and floats between the fixed blades <b>23</b> and the inner cylinder <b>24</b> by being rebounded therefrom or falls down along a side surface of the inner cylinder <b>24</b>, and therefore, this causes the sorting precision to deteriorate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">In addition, when the degree of opening of the fixed blades <b>23</b> is reduced, a portion of the coarse particles exits from the flow, collides with the fixed blades <b>23</b>, and rebounds therefrom, thus following an irregular track. Such a behavior of the coarse particles is undesirable because the proportion of the coarse particles mixed into the product pulverized coal increases, which results in a further deterioration of the sorting precision.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">In addition, when the coarse particles rise from the lower portion of the vertical roller mill <b>10</b> and enter the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>, the coarse particles flow toward the fixed blades <b>23</b> by drifting to the upper portion of the vertical roller mill <b>10</b> due to an inertial force. In other words, because the coarse particles tend to drift to the top side of the fixed blades <b>23</b> when flowing thereto, a region with a high particle concentration (density) is formed in the upper portion of the vertical roller mill <b>10</b> (at the upper portions of the fixed blades <b>23</b>), and there is a problem in that the deterioration of the sorting efficiency described above is further worsened due to collision, interference, and aggregation of the particles in this region.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">The present invention has been conceived in light of the circumstances described above, and an object thereof is to provide a vertical roller mill provided with a fixed-type sorter that is capable of reducing a coarse-particle proportion (proportion of coarse particles whose approximate sizes exceed 100 mesh, which adversely affect combustibility) in product pulverized coal.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">In order to solve the problems described above, a vertical roller mill of the present invention employs the following solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">Specifically, a vertical roller mill according to the present invention is a vertical roller mill provided in a casing, including a fixed-type cyclone sorter that causes fine powder having a small particle size contained in a solid-gas two-phase flow, in which powder produced by grinding a solid is transported by means of an airflow, to externally flow out by applying sorting based on a centrifugal force, wherein the fixed-type sorter includes a conical member in which a narrow tip portion is positioned at the bottom; a fixed-blade entrance window provided in the conical member as an opening through which the solid-gas two-phase flow is introduced into the interior of the conical member; a flat plate-like fixed blade that is attached on the inner side of the conical member near the fixed-blade entrance window and that causes the solid-gas two-phase flow to spiral; an inner cylinder that is provided at an axial center of the conical member and into which the fine powder is guided from the bottom end thereof toward the top end thereof by means of spiraling of the solid-gas two-phase flow; and a fine-powder exit through which the fine powder guided to the top end of the inner cylinder is guided outside the conical member, wherein the fixed blade is bent at a tip portion of the fixed blade so as to increase a downward flow of the solid-gas two-phase flow guided into the interior of the conical member from the fixed-blade entrance window.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">In the fixed blade, the tip portion thereof is bent so as to increase the downward flow of the solid-gas two-phase flow guided into the interior of the conical member. By doing so, the downward velocity component is increased for the solid-gas two-phase flow guided into the interior of the conical member, and, the greater the particle size and the greater the weight thereof, the more the coarse powder contained in the fine powder in the solid-gas two-phase flow flows downward. Accordingly, of the coarse powder that has flowed into the inner side of the conical member from the fixed-blade entrance window, the amount of coarse powder that is swirled up by a reverse upward flow is reduced. Therefore, the sorting precision of the vertical roller mill can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">Furthermore, the fixed blades may be bent along a bending line that connects a top-edge bend starting point at the top edge thereof having a flat plate-like form and a bottom-edge bend starting point at the bottom edge thereof having the flat plate-like form; and the bottom-end bend starting point may be positioned closer to the axial center of the conical member than the top-edge bend starting point is.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">The fixed blade that is bent along the bending line, which connects the top-edge bend starting point having the flat plate-like form and the bottom-edge bend starting point positioned closer to the axial center of the conical member than the top-edge bend starting point is, is employed. By doing so, the velocity component can be increased downward for the flow of the solid-gas two-phase flow guided into the interior of the conical member from the fixed-blade entrance window. Accordingly, the greater the particle size and the greater the weight thereof, the more the coarse powder contained in the fine powder in the solid-gas two-phase flow flows downward, and, of the coarse powder that has flowed toward the axial center of the conical member from the fixed-blade entrance window, the amount thereof that is swirled up by the reverse upward flow is reduced. Therefore, the sorting precision of the vertical roller mill can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">Furthermore, the top-edge bend starting point may be at a position of 0.2 or greater but 0.3 or less from the fixed-blade entrance window relative to the total length of the top edge having the flat plate-like form, and the bottom-edge bend starting point may be at a position of 0.4 or greater but 0.6 or less from the fixed-blade entrance window relative to the total length of the bottom edge having the flat plate-like form.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">Bending is performed by providing the top-edge bend starting point at a position of 0.2 or greater but 0.3 or less from the fixed-blade entrance window relative to the total length of the top edge having the flat plate-like form and by providing the bottom-edge bend starting point at a position of 0.4 or greater but 0.6 or less from the fixed-blade entrance window relative to the total length of the bottom edge having the flat plate-like form. Accordingly, the velocity component can be further increased in the downward direction for the flow of the solid-gas two-phase flow. Therefore, the sorting precision of the vertical roller mill can be further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">Note that it is preferable that the top-edge bend starting point be at a position of 0.24 from the fixed-blade entrance window relative to the total length of the top edge having the flat plate-like form and the bottom-edge bend starting point be at a position of 0.50 from the fixed-blade entrance window relative to the total length of the bottom edge having the flat plate-like form.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">In addition, a line that connects a bottom-edge tip portion of the fixed blade and the bottom-edge bend starting point may form an angle of 10&#xb0; or greater but 30&#xb0; or less with respect to a line that extends in a radial direction from the fixed-blade entrance window toward the axial center of the conical member; and a line that connects a top-edge tip portion of the fixed blade and the top-edge bend starting point may form an angle of 5&#xb0; or greater but 25&#xb0; or less with respect to a line that connects the bottom-edge tip portion of the fixed blade and the bottom-edge bend starting point.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">Bending is performed so that an angle between the line connecting the top-edge bend starting point and the top-edge tip portion and the line connecting the bottom-edge bend starting point and the bottom-edge tip portion is 5&#xb0; or greater but 25&#xb0; or less, and an angle between the line connecting the bottom-edge bend starting point and the bottom-edge tip portion and the line extending from the fixed-blade entrance window in the radial direction toward the axial center of the conical member is 10&#xb0; or greater but 30&#xb0; or less. Accordingly, the velocity component can be increased in the downward direction for the flow of the solid-gas two-phase flow. Therefore, the sorting precision of the vertical roller mill can be further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">Note that it is more preferable that the angle between the line connecting the top-edge bend starting point and the top-edge tip portion and the line connecting the bottom-edge bend starting point and the bottom-edge tip portion be 10&#xb0; or greater but 20&#xb0; or less, and it is more further preferable that the angle between the line connecting the bottom-edge bend starting point and the bottom-edge tip portion and the line extending from the fixed-blade entrance window in the radial direction toward the axial center of the conical member be 15&#xb0; or greater but 25&#xb0; or less.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">In addition, the fixed blade may be bent from the fixed-blade entrance window toward the axial center of the conical member by being divided into multiple stages.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">The fixed blade that is bent from the fixed-blade entrance window toward the axial center of the conical member by being divided into multiple stages is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">Accordingly, as compared with a case in which the fixed blade is bent in one stage, the velocity component can be increased in the downward direction for the flow of the solid-gas two-phase flow. Therefore, the sorting precision of the vertical roller mill can be further enhanced.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">With the present invention, a tip portion of a fixed blade is bent so as to increase a downward flow of a solid-gas two-phase flow guided into the interior of a conical member. By doing so, the downward velocity component is increased for the solid-gas two-phase flow guided into the interior of the conical member, and, the greater the particle size and the greater the weight thereof, the more the coarse powder contained in powder in the solid-gas two-phase flow flows downward. Accordingly, of the coarse powder that has flowed into the inner side of the conical member from a fixed-blade entrance window, the amount of the coarse powder that is swirled up in a reverse upward flow is reduced. Therefore, the sorting precision of a vertical roller mill can be enhanced.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">An embodiment of a vertical roller mill according to the present invention will be described below based on the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">A vertical roller mill <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> produces pulverized coal that is used as, for example, fuel for a pulverized-coal-fired boiler (not shown). The vertical roller mill <b>10</b> grinds raw-material coal into pulverized coal and sorts the gravitationally-sorted pulverized coal by means of a fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>. By doing so, product pulverized coal that has been sorted by passing through the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> is transported, by means of an airflow of primary air, to the pulverized-coal-fired boiler from a pulverized-coal exit (fine-powder exit) <b>16</b>, which is provided at the upper portion of the vertical roller mill <b>10</b>, in the form of pulverized-coal fuel having a desired powder fineness.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">Note that the configuration of the vertical roller mill <b>10</b> according to this embodiment is the same as that of the one in the related art described above, except for the configuration of the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> described later, and therefore, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">The vertical roller mill <b>10</b> according to the present invention is provided with, at the upper portion of a casing <b>11</b>, a fixed-type cyclone sorter <b>20</b> that sorts pulverized coal having small particle sizes by means of a centrifugal force and makes it flow out to the pulverized-coal-fired boiler (exterior) by causing a solid-gas two-phase flow (pulverized coal and primary air) that transports, by means of an airflow, the pulverized coal (powder), which is ground raw-material coal (solid), to pass therethrough. The fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> is configured to introduce the solid-gas two-phase flow into the interior of the cone <b>21</b> from fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b> provided as openings in the cone (conical member) <b>21</b>, to cause the solid-gas two-phase flow to spiral by means of fixed blades <b>23</b> attached to the inner side of the fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b>, and to make low-weight pulverized coal having small particle sizes pass through the interior of the inner cylinder <b>24</b> from the bottom end of the inner cylinder <b>24</b> provided on the inner side of the cone <b>21</b> so that it flows out to the exterior of the cone <b>21</b> from a pulverized-coal exit <b>16</b> provided at the top end of the inner cylinder <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">In other words, pulverized coal smaller than a desired particle size is carried and sorted by a reverse upward flow that rises through the bottom end of the inner cylinder <b>24</b> installed in the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> and flows out by passing through the pulverized-coal exit <b>16</b> provided as an opening at the upper portion thereof. This pulverized coal is supplied to the pulverized-coal-fired boiler (not shown) as product pulverized coal (fuel pulverized coal) from the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b> and the vertical roller mill <b>10</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">In this embodiment, a fixed blade <b>23</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is employed instead of the fixed blade <b>23</b> described above. The fixed blade <b>23</b>A is provided with a fixed-blade base portion <b>23</b><i>a</i>, which turns the solid-gas two-phase flow that flows into the interior of the cone <b>21</b> from the fixed-blade entrance window <b>22</b> into a spiral flow, and a fixed-blade tip portion <b>23</b><i>b</i>, which increases the downward velocity component of the spiral flow.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">A fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>A is provided with the cone <b>21</b> and the concentric inner cylinder <b>24</b> disposed inside the cone <b>21</b> at a predetermined distance therefrom, thus forming a double cylinder configuration. At the inner side (axial center side) of the inner cylinder <b>24</b>, the pulverized-coal exit <b>16</b> from which sorted product pulverized coal flows out is provided as an opening at the upper portion of the cone <b>21</b>. The cone <b>21</b> is a conical member whose narrow tip portion is positioned at the bottom in the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>A. A cone exit <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) from which recovered coarse particles drop onto the grinding table <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is provided as an opening at the lower portion of the cone <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">At the upper portion of the cone <b>21</b>, numerous fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b> are provided as openings at equal intervals in the circumferential direction. The fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b> are opening portions provided so as to penetrate through the wall surface that forms the cone <b>21</b> and serve as entrances and flow paths where the solid-gas two-phase flow, which transports the pulverized coal by means of an airflow of primary air, passes through to flow into the interior of the cone <b>21</b>. The direction of the solid-gas two-phase flow that flows in from the fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b> is changed by substantially 90&#xb0; from an upward flow that transports, by means of an airflow, the pulverized coal ground on the grinding table <b>12</b> disposed at the lower portion of the casing <b>11</b>. In addition, the fixed blades <b>23</b>A are attached to the inner wall of the cone <b>21</b> at positions corresponding to the individual fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> show an enlarged view of the fixed blade <b>23</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a front view of the fixed blade, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a left side view of the fixed blade, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows a top view of the fixed blade.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">The fixed blade <b>23</b>A is provided on the inner side of the cone <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) near the fixed-blade entrance window <b>22</b>. The fixed blade <b>23</b>A has a shape in which a portion of a flat plate-like form is bent. The fixed blade <b>23</b>A is bent in one stage in the radial direction from the fixed-blade entrance window <b>22</b> toward the axial center of the cone <b>21</b>. The fixed blade <b>23</b>A that is divided in two by being bent is formed of the fixed-blade base portion <b>23</b><i>a</i>, which is closer to the fixed-blade entrance window <b>22</b>, and the fixed-blade tip portion (tip portion) <b>23</b><i>b</i>, which is closer to the axial center of the cone <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">The fixed blade <b>23</b>A is bent at a bending line <b>23</b><i>e </i>that connects a top-edge bending starting point (top-edge bend starting point) <b>23</b><i>c </i>provided at the top edge (upper side of the cone <b>21</b>) of the flat plate-like form before bending and a bottom-edge bending starting point (bottom-edge bend starting point) <b>23</b><i>d </i>provided at the bottom edge (lower side of the cone <b>21</b>) thereof. The bottom-edge bending starting point <b>23</b><i>d </i>is provided so as to be positioned closer to the axial center of the cone <b>21</b> than the top-edge bending starting point <b>23</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">Because the bottom-edge bending starting point <b>23</b><i>d </i>is provided so as to be positioned closer to the axial center of the cone <b>21</b> than the top-edge bending starting point <b>23</b><i>c</i>, the fixed-blade tip portion <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the fixed blade <b>23</b>A is bent so as to form a trapezoidal form when viewed from the left side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. By doing so, the downward flow of the solid-gas two-phase flow that has been caused to spiral by the fixed-blade base portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>is increased by the fixed-blade tip portion <b>23</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">In order to cause the solid-gas two-phase flow to spiral, the individual fixed-blade base portions <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the fixed-blades <b>23</b>A are provided at the inner wall of the cone <b>21</b> so as to have the same inclination angle in the same direction. By providing the fixed-blade base portions <b>23</b><i>a </i>having the inclination angle, the solid-gas two-phase flow that flows in from the fixed-blade entrance windows <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is prevented from becoming a flow toward the axial center, which is substantially perpendicular to the outer wall of the inner cylinder <b>24</b>. Specifically, by changing the direction of the velocity component of the flow of the solid-gas two-phase flow in the horizontal direction in accordance with the inclination angle, a flow is formed that spirals in the circumferential direction in a space formed between the inner wall of the cone <b>21</b> and the outer wall of the inner cylinder <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">Furthermore, because the fixed-blade tip portion <b>23</b><i>b </i>that increases the downward flow of the solid-gas two-phase flow, which flows into the interior of the cone <b>21</b>, is provided at the tip of the fixed blade <b>23</b>A, the direction of the rising flow is changed so as to be more in the downward direction than in the substantially horizontal direction. Specifically, because the fixed-blade tip portion <b>23</b><i>b </i>guides the solid-gas two-phase flow that has passed over the fixed-blade base portion <b>23</b><i>b </i>so that the direction thereof is forced to change downward, as shown by an arrow F in the figure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the downward velocity component is increased for the solid-gas two-phase flow that has been guided by the fixed-blade tip portion <b>23</b><i>b </i>to flow into the interior of the cone <b>21</b>. Therefore, the velocity component that causes the solid-gas two-phase flow that has flowed into the interior of the cone <b>21</b> to move toward the axial center of the inner cylinder <b>24</b> so as to be substantially perpendicular to the outer wall thereof is weakened, and is decreased also in the vertical direction due to the fixed-blade tip portion <b>23</b><i>b </i>in addition to the horizontal direction due to the fixed-blade base portion <b>23</b><i>a</i>. Note that, in the illustrated configuration example, the solid-gas two-phase flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> forms a clockwise spiral flow. In other words, the fixed-blade tip portion <b>23</b><i>b </i>is bent in the flow direction of the clockwise spiral flow.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">By increasing the downward flow of the solid-gas two-phase flow that passes over the fixed blades <b>23</b>A, the probability of coarse powder having a particularly large weight to directly flowing downward increases, which decreases the amount of coarse powder that flows toward the axial center of the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>A where the inner cylinder <b>24</b> and the pulverized-coal exit <b>16</b> exist. As a result, because the amount of coarse powder contained in the solid-gas two-phase flow that is swirled up together with product pulverized coal by the reverse upward flow, which flows out from the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>A, is reduced, the sorting precision of the fixed-type sorter <b>20</b>A is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">Here, the positions of the top-edge bending starting point <b>23</b><i>c </i>and the bottom-edge bending starting point <b>23</b><i>d </i>will be described by using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 7</figref>.</p>
