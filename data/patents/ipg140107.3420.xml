<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a fixture and socket assembly, and particularly to a socket assembly configured to receive a replaceable and flexible panel lighting device such as an organic light emitting diode (OLED) panel, as well as an associated system for attaching an array of flexible lighting devices or panels.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">OLED devices are generally known in the art. An OLED device typically includes one or more organic light emitting layer(s) disposed between electrodes. For example, a cathode, organic layer, and a light-transmissive anode formed on a substrate emit light when current is applied across the cathode and anode. As a result of the electric current, electrons are injected into the organic layer from the cathode and holes may be injected into the organic layer from the anode. The electrons and holes generally travel through the organic layer until they recombine at a luminescent center, typically an organic molecule or polymer. The recombination process results in the emission of a light photon, usually in the ultraviolet or visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The layers of an OLED are typically arranged so that the organic layers are disposed between the cathode and anode layers. As photons of light are generated and emitted, the photons move through the organic layer. Those that move toward the cathode, which generally comprises a metal, may be reflected back into the organic layer. Those photons that move through the organic layer to the light-transmissive anode, and finally to the substrate, however, may be emitted from the OLED in the form of light energy. Some cathode materials may be light transmissive, and in some embodiments light may be emitted from the cathode layer, and therefore from the OLED device in a multi-directional manner. Thus, the OLED device has at least cathode, organic, and anode layers. Of course, additional, optional layers may or may not be included in the light source structure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cathodes generally comprise a material having a low work function such that a relatively small voltage causes the emission of electrons. Commonly used materials include metals such as gold, gallium, indium, manganese, calcium, tin, lead, aluminum, silver, magnesium, lithium, strontium, barium, zinc, zirconium, samarium, europium, and mixtures or alloys of any two of more thereof. On the other hand, the anode layer is generally comprised of a material having a high work function value, and these materials are known for use in the anode layer because they are generally light-transmissive. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, transparent conductive oxides such as indium tin oxide (ITO), aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO), fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), indium doped zinc oxide, magnesium indium oxide, and nickel tungsten oxide; metals such as gold, aluminum, and nickel; conductive polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS); and mixtures and combinations or alloys of any two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Preferably, these light emitting or OLED devices are generally flexible, i.e., are capable of being bent into a shape having a radius of curvature of less than about 10 centimeters. These light emitting devices are also preferably large-area which means they have a dimension of an area greater than or equal to about 10 centimeters squared, and in some instances are coupled together to form a generally flexible, generally planar OLED panel comprised of one or more OLED devices, which has a large surface area of light emission.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Preferably, the panel is hermetically sealed since moisture and oxygen have an adverse impact on the OLED device or panel. It is desired that an electrical pathway be established with the light emitting panel, and also that the electrical pathway maintain flexibility, be easily and accurately positioned, establish good electrical continuity, and maintain a thin profile. Commonly owned U.S. application Ser. No. 12/644,520 describes a light panel in which at least one electrical feed-through region is provided in the backsheet located inwardly from a periphery of the light source. A connector cable is positioned over the backsheet and has a portion of the connector cable extending outwardly of the light source periphery for connection with associated drive circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A need exists for a reliable fixture and socket system configured to receive one or more flexible OLED devices, panel, or array of panels, and a reliable manner of attaching the devices, panel, or panels to the fixture. Moreover, a need exists for a reliable fixture and socket system that allows for a wide array of sizes and shapes while still providing for reliable electrical contact, effective mechanical support, and the ability to avoid potential shorting with electrical connections.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A fixture and socket assembly receives a flexible lighting device having a light emitting first surface and an opposed, rear surface. The assembly includes a rigid first surface configured to support at least a portion of the rear surface of the flexible lighting device. A rigid, second surface is spaced from the first surface by a dimension slightly greater than the thickness of the flexible lighting device and configured to receive the flexible lighting device between the first and second surfaces. At least one socket contact is provided adjacent a first edge of the first and second surfaces and dimensioned for electrical coupling with a conductive first portion of the flexible lighting device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first surface of the assembly is configured to support the rear surface of the flexible lighting device such that the lighting device substantially adopts the contour of the first surface therealong.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The assembly preferably includes multiple socket contacts located at spaced locations along a first edge of the first and second surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one arrangement, multiple socket contacts are provided on opposite edges of the flexible lighting device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The socket contact is configured to exert a biasing force on a conductive portion of the flexible lighting device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first surface of the assembly is substantially continuous in order to support substantially an entirety of the rear surface of the flexible lighting device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one arrangement, the second surface of the assembly forms a generally annular frame-like perimeter about the light emitting surface and the first and second surfaces are interconnected by a sidewall.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The sidewall preferably extends about three sides of the fixture and socket assembly, while a fourth side of the assembly includes an opening having a dimension slightly greater than a thickness of the flexible light panel.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one arrangement, the first and second edges of the second surface are substantially coplanar, while in another embodiment, the first and second edges are not coplanar.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment, the first surface is curved and adopts a portion of a substantially cylindrical conformation, and in a further embodiment the first and second surfaces are substantially co-cylindrical.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet another version, the first surface forms a substantially cylindrical shape, and the second surface forms a segment of a substantially cylindrical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A primary advantage of the present disclosure is the ability to provide a press-fit electrical connection with the socket contact rather than directly welding to the contact surface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another advantage of the disclosure relates to the easy replacement of an OLED device or panel.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Still another advantage is the ability to accommodate a wide variety of conformations of the light source and fixture.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flexible light source assembly <b>100</b> that includes a light source <b>102</b> formed at least in part by a generally planar, light emitting surface <b>104</b> which may be comprised of one or more flexible light sources or OLED devices <b>106</b> to form a matrix or panel <b>108</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, four individual flexible light source devices <b>106</b> are joined together to form a two-by-two (2&#xd7;2) matrix or panel <b>108</b>. Perimeter edges <b>110</b> of each light source device are either mechanically abutted against an adjacent flexible light source device perimeter edge, or received in a fixture <b>120</b> that receives the combined light sources or panel therein and supports the perimeter edges of contiguous light source devices that comprise the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">More particularly, the fixture <b>120</b> is additionally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> with the light source components removed for ease of illustration. The fixture <b>120</b> includes a generally rigid, first surface <b>122</b> that is separated from a generally rigid, second surface <b>124</b> by a joining wall or sidewall <b>126</b>. More particularly in the preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the first surface <b>122</b> has a solid, generally rectangular conformation that supports at least a portion of a rear surface of the light emitting devices or light panel, and preferably in this embodiment supports the entirety of the rear surface. The second surface <b>124</b>, on the other hand, forms an open framework or generally annular structure having a central opening <b>128</b> that is dimensioned so that the light emitting surface <b>104</b> of the light panel assembly is situated relative to the central opening to direct light outwardly through the opening <b>128</b> and outer, perimeter edges of the light panel assembly are sandwiched between the first and second surfaces <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. The spacing between the first and second surfaces <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> is defined by the height dimension of the sidewall <b>126</b> and is slightly greater than a thickness of the individual light source devices or light panel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>). Moreover, the sidewall <b>126</b> preferably extends around three contiguous edges of the fixture but is not provided on at least a portion of one edge to provide an access opening <b>130</b> that receives the light source devices or panel. Thus, the perimeter edges of the light panel are supported by the first and second surfaces <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the fixture and contained in place by the sidewall <b>126</b> along three sides. Moreover, a closure member (to be described further below) is subsequently received over the access opening once the panel is mounted in the fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, and additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, a series of electrical contacts or sockets (or socket contacts) <b>140</b> are provided in the fixture and preferably mounted to the first surface <b>122</b> of the panel at preselected locations that align with conductive portions or surface contacts <b>142</b> provided on the rear surface of the panel <b>108</b>. More particularly, the surface contacts of the light emitting devices, light panel, or light source are located at predetermined locations and accessible from the rear surface of the lighting panel. The socket contacts <b>140</b> have a central bowed region <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) that provides some mechanical flexibility and the bowed region <b>144</b> acts like a spring that is urged into biasing mechanical engagement with the surface contact <b>142</b> and also establishes desired electrical contact between an individual surface contact <b>142</b> and an associated socket contact <b>140</b>. For example, the 2&#xd7;2 matrix shown in the exemplary embodiment has four socket contacts preferably located at perimeter locations of the panel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) that pinch against the rear edge seal of the panel, establish electrical connection with surface contacts <b>142</b>, and hold the light panel against the frame to provide a secure retaining function that also provides an effective electrical connection. Socket contact size and shape can be modified to accommodate larger light panel matrices or may be located at other locations if desired. It will also be appreciated that further connections or contacts <b>146</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) are provided between adjacent individual flexible light source devices <b>106</b> to electrically connect one light source device with another so that power provided from the periphery of the panel is provided to the entire panel and to each of the individual light source devices.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As noted previously, each of the light source devices is flexible, i.e., relatively thin, and able to be bent into a shape having a radius of curvature of less than about 10 centimeters (10 cm). These flexible light emitting devices are also preferably large area which means these flexible light emitting devices have a dimension of an area greater than or about 10 centimeters squared (10 cm<sup>2</sup>) and can be effectively coupled together to form the generally flexible, generally planar OLED panel <b>108</b> comprised of one or more individual devices <b>106</b> where the light source or panel has a large surface area <b>104</b> of light emission. Due to the flexible nature of the individual lighting devices and the panel, various fixture conformations can be formed to provide the desired mechanical support and the necessary electrical connection. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-18</figref> show one preferred embodiment that illustrates the flexible nature and types of conformations that are possible. An individual flexible light source device <b>206</b> is joined with similar flexible light source devices to provide a generally curvilinear, partially cylindrical light emitting surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, or may be comprised of alternating forward and rearward directed arcuate light surfaces as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. The fixture <b>220</b> has an inner, generally rigid, generally cylindrical first surface <b>222</b> that is coaxially received within an outer, generally rigid, generally cylindrical second surface <b>224</b>. The generally cylindrical fixture surfaces <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> are maintained in radially spaced, coaxial relation having an annular space therebetween. The fixture surfaces form an annular access opening <b>230</b> at one end of the fixture and are received in a support base <b>232</b> at the other end which closes the opening between the cylindrical first and second surfaces <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> and maintains them in their upright, spaced conformation. In a similar manner, socket contacts <b>240</b> are provided along select regions of the first surface <b>222</b> and adapted for mechanical and electrical engagement with surface contacts <b>242</b> provided on the rear surface of the light source or individual flexible light source devices <b>206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>). As evident in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, it will be appreciated that multiple individual light source devices <b>206</b> can be received in the fixture <b>220</b>. Although four light devices are illustrated, the present disclosure should not be limited to this number, one skilled in the art understanding that a greater or lesser number of light source devices can be used as desired and without departing from the scope and intent of the present disclosure. Moreover, in this arrangement, the second surface <b>224</b> is preferably made of a light transmissive material since at least a portion of the second surface covers the light emitting surface <b>204</b> of the individual light source devices or panel.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The adaptability, conformability, and flexibility of the light source devices allow the light source devices to alternate in their directional output from the fixture as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. Here, every other flexible light source device faces in a different or an opposite direction from the next adjacent flexible light source device, although this arrangement may also be altered if so desired. By way of example only, the directional output may not need to be 180 degrees opposite, or every other lighting device need not be differently oriented relative to an adjacent lighting device, or the color of different lighting devices may be selectively altered.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> shows that a greater percentage of the surface <b>304</b> of each flexible light source device <b>306</b> emits light and therefore the total light output from the panel <b>308</b> received in the generally cylindrical fixture <b>320</b> is enhanced or increased. In substantially all other aspects like reference numerals in the 300 series refer to like components from the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-18</figref> so that assembly, and mechanical and electrical engagement provided on the socket contacts on the generally cylindrical first surface <b>322</b> can make mechanical and electrical engagement with surface contacts <b>342</b> provided on the rear surfaces of the individual flexible light source devices <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Likewise, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates another embodiment that shares many similarities with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-18</figref> so that reference numerals in the 400 series will refer to like components. The light emitting surfaces <b>404</b> of individual light source devices <b>406</b> having an increased light emitting surface area are faced in alternating or varied fashion within the generally cylindrical fixture <b>420</b>. Again, in substantially all other respects including the use of socket contacts <b>440</b> provided on the first cylindrical surface <b>422</b> and the surface contacts <b>442</b> provided on rear surfaces of the individual light source devices <b>406</b> allows for ease of mechanical and electrical connection.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, an electronics supply circuitry may be included in box <b>150</b> that closes off the access opening <b>130</b> of the fixture. The box <b>150</b> provides a hard stop for the light emitting devices to slide into, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the box also provides a suitable port <b>152</b> that provides for electrical connection with a suitable connector (not shown) to provide power to the circuit and light source. Additionally, a central bar <b>154</b> may be provided along a central perimeter abutment region between adjacent flexible light sources in the 2&#xd7;2 matrix. The central support bar <b>154</b> may also be masked to incorporate an internal bus structure of the light emitting device and provide for added structural integrity to the fixture and socket assembly. In addition, an end cap <b>156</b> may be provided at an end of the fixture and socket assembly if sidewall <b>126</b> extends only along opposite sides of the fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Additionally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-28</figref> are a schematic circuit and various layers of the fixture and socket assembly <b>100</b>. For example, the assembly is shown with a transparent body for ease of illustration where eight (8) contacts <b>160</b> and associated surface contacts <b>162</b> are wired as represented by reference numeral <b>164</b> into a desired electrical configuration and associated leads <b>166</b> on the light emitting devices interface with the socket contacts <b>160</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the socket wiring has been removed, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> the socket contacts are removed for ease of illustration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> further shows the light emitting device bottom side with leads <b>162</b> so that two contacts of a socket are wired to interface with two leads on the light emitting device. The light emitting device comes pre-wired for the desired electrical configuration. Although these illustrations show a two-by-two (2&#xd7;2) matrix in a socket with parallel contacts, the disclosure could be for any size OLED or other flexible light emitting device in series, parallel, or series-parallel configuration. Further enlarged views of the socket contacts <b>160</b>, surface contacts <b>162</b>, wiring <b>164</b> and leads <b>166</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref> are enlarged views that illustrate the inclusion of a biasing member or spring <b>270</b> that extends inwardly from the generally cylindrical, second surface <b>224</b> to provide desired pressure on the flexible light emitting device <b>206</b> so that the surface contacts <b>242</b> on the rear surface of the individual OLED devices make the desired mechanical and electrical connection with the associated socket contacts <b>240</b> provided on the generally cylindrical, first surface <b>222</b>. In this arrangement, the biasing members <b>270</b> have a generally arcuate cross-section, and have sufficient resiliency to provide a spring-like function, although other conformations of the biasing members can be used without departing from the scope and intent of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33-35</figref> illustrate that the first and second surfaces <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> that support the flexible light source devices <b>506</b> may be formed as spaced posts that receive opposite edges of individual flexible light source devices. Again, the light source devices can all be arranged to face in the same direction or may be disposed in different directions such as alternating forward and rearward directions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-35</figref>. The orientation of the support posts can be vertical, horizontal, spiral, arched, bent, and still other orientations since the light emitting device is flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref> illustrate that the socket contacts <b>640</b> provided on the posts could be split into individual electrical surfaces <b>644</b> so that individual control settings on a select pair of contacts, governed by the electronics hidden in the base, would provide greater design flexibility. Selected other contacts or sockets could be locally masked or the light emitting device lead could be masked to prevent shorting across the multiple contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The fixture can be formed from a metal, polymer, or other suitable generally rigid material. If formed from metal, a preferred metal is aluminum, or an aluminum/tin alloy. If the metal is used for the fixture, the surface is preferably coated with oxidized material or coated with a polymer to avoid shorting of the interconnects. Likewise, it is understood that composite materials could be used or a polymer/metal combined mixed material could be used. For example, the melting point less than 300&#xb0; C. is used in one polymer that is an ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene copolymer. A silicon-coated woven glass fiber scrim and a polyvinyl fluoride could be used, or a polyethyleneteraphthalal and ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer. Alternatively, a polyethylene or medium density polyethylene, or a high density polyethylene may be used. Preferably, the fixture is adapted to withstand electrical loading between 0 and 50 watts, and the color parameters may range from 3000K to 6500K.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The disclosure has been described with respect to preferred embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations may be contemplated by one skilled in the art, and the subject disclosure should not be limited to the particular examples described above but instead through the following claims.</p>
