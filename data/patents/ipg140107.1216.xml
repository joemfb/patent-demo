<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. National Stage Application of International Application No. PCT/JP2011/056333 filed on Mar. 17, 2011, and published in Japanese as WO 2012/049867 A1 on Apr. 19, 2012. This application claims priority to Japanese Application No. 2010-229482 filed on Oct. 12, 2010. The disclosures of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an oil seal which is one kind of a sealing device. The oil seal according to the present invention is used, for example, as a shaft seal in a power steering section of a vehicle such as a motor vehicle or the like, or is employed in the other general industrial machines and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Conventional Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Historically, as an oil seal which has been used as the shaft seal in the power steering section of the vehicle such as the motor vehicle, an oil seal <b>51</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has been known, and the oil seal <b>51</b> has a main lip <b>52</b> which is arranged toward an inner side A of the machine in an installed state and seals a sealed fluid such as an oil or the like, and a dust lip <b>53</b> which is arranged toward an outer side B of the machine and seals a foreign material such as a muddy water or the like (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-22028).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, since a shaft is a vertical shaft in the case that the oil seal <b>51</b> is installed to an actual machine, the dust lip <b>53</b> is arranged in such a manner that a leading end of the lip is directed upward.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, in a region in which a road improvement is not sufficient, for example, regions in foreign countries, a dust environment is severe and there is a case that the vehicle travels in a state in which the power steering section is temporarily submerged. In the case mentioned above, the muddy water is piled up in an upper part of the dust lip <b>53</b>, in the oil seal <b>51</b>. Accordingly, there is a problem that the muddy water entering from the dust lip <b>53</b> bites into the main lip <b>52</b> so as to cause an oil leakage.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is made by taking the points mentioned above into consideration, and an object of the present invention is to provide an oil seal which can inhibit a muddy water from being piled up in an upper part of a dust lip which is arranged in an outer side of the machine, whereby it is possible to enhance a sealing performance, particularly a muddy water resistance.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a first seal member which is installed to an inner periphery of a shaft hole in a housing inserting a shaft thereto; and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a second seal member which is installed to an end surface section of the housing in an opening peripheral edge section of the shaft hole,</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">wherein the first seal member integrally has an affixation section which is fitted to an inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole in the housing, a main lip which slidably comes into close contact with a peripheral surface of the shaft so as to seal a sealed fluid in an inner side of the machine, and a first dust lip which slidably comes into close contact with the peripheral surface of the shaft so as to seal a foreign material such as a muddy water in the outer side of the machine, and</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">wherein the second seal member integrally has an end surface covering section which covers the end surface section of the housing, an outer peripheral insertion section which is inserted from one side in an axial direction to an outer peripheral surface of the housing and is engaged with a stepped engagement section provided in the outer peripheral surface of the housing so as to prevent the second seal member from coming off from the housing, an inner peripheral insertion section which is inserted to the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole in the housing from one side in the axial direction, and a second dust lip which slidably comes into close contact with a peripheral surface of the shaft in the outer side of the machine in the first dust lip so as to seal the foreign material such as the muddy water in the outer side of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, an oil seal according to a second aspect of the present invention is the oil seal described in the first aspect mentioned above, wherein an outer peripheral surface of the outer peripheral insertion section in the second seal member is integrally provided with a third dust lip which slidably comes into close contact with an inner peripheral surface of a dust cover affixed to the shaft so as to seal the foreign material such as the muddy water in the outer side of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, an oil seal according to a third aspect of the present invention is the oil seal described in the first aspect or the second aspect mentioned above, wherein the second seal member is constructed by an integrally formed product of a rubber-like elastic body and is structured such that a metal ring is embedded in the inner peripheral insertion section.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, an oil seal according to a fourth aspect of the present invention is the oil seal described in the first aspect or the second aspect mentioned above, wherein the second seal member is constructed only by in integrally formed product of a rubber-like elastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, an oil seal according to a fifth aspect of the present invention is the oil seal described in any one of the first to fourth aspects mentioned above, wherein the shaft is constructed by a steering shaft, and the oil seal is used as an oil seal for a steering wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the oil seal according to the present invention having the structure mentioned above, the second seal member is provided in the outer side of machine in the first seal member having the affixation section, the main lip, and the first dust lip, and the second seal member is structured such as to integrally have the end surface covering section which covers the end surface section of the housing, the outer peripheral insertion section which is inserted from the one side in the axial direction to the outer peripheral surface of the housing and is engaged with the stepped engagement section provided in the outer peripheral surface of the housing so as to prevent the second seal member from coming off from the housing, the inner peripheral insertion section which is inserted to the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole in the housing from the one side in the axial direction, and the second dust lip which slidably comes into close contact with the peripheral surface of the shaft in the outer side of the machine in the first dust lip so as to seal the foreign material such as the muddy water in the outer side of the machine. Therefore, since the second seal member having the structure mentioned above is installed so as to cover the end surface section of the housing and the opening section of the shaft hole in the outer side of the machine in the first seal member, it is possible to seal the foreign material such as the muddy water by the second seal member, and it is possible to inhibit the foreign material such as the muddy water from being piled up on the first dust lip.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, since the outer peripheral surface of the outer peripheral insertion section in the second seal member is integrally provided with the third dust lip which slidably comes into close contact with the inner peripheral surface of the dust cover affixed to the shaft so as to seal the foreign material such as the muddy water in the outer side of the machine, the foreign material such as the muddy water reaching the second dust lip is reduced, and a sealing performance is further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is preferable that the second seal member is constructed by the integrally formed product of the rubber-like elastic body and is structured such that the metal ring for fitting to the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole in the housing is embedded in the inner peripheral insertion section. Accordingly, the second seal member is firmly affixed to the housing and is hard to be detached from the housing. However, the metal ring may be omitted, and in this case, it is possible to achieve a reduction of a manufacturing cost and an easiness of an installing work.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the present invention, the shaft is constructed, for example, by the steering shaft, and in this case, the oil seal is used as the oil seal for the steering wheel. Therefore, in the technical field relevant to the shaft seal of the steering section, the effects of the present invention can be achieved.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention achieves the following effects.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other words, in the present invention, as mentioned above, since the second seal member integrally having the end surface covering section, the outer peripheral insertion section, the inner peripheral insertion section and the second dust lip is installed to the outer side of the machine in the first seal member having the affixation section, the main lip and the first dust lip, it is possible to seal the foreign material such as the muddy water by the second seal member, and it is possible to inhibit the foreign material such as the muddy water from being piled up on the first dust lip. Therefore, it is possible to inhibit the muddy water from being piled up on the first dust lip, inhibit the muddy water entering from the first dust lip from biting into the main lip and inhibit the oil leakage from being generated.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, in the case that the third dust lip coming into close contact with the dust cover is integrally provided in the outer peripheral surface of the outer peripheral insertion section in the second seal member, the foreign material such as the muddy water reaching the second dust lip is reduced, and it is possible to further improve the sealing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the case that the second seal member is constructed by the integrally formed product of the rubber-like elastic body and is structured such that the metal ring is embedded in the inner peripheral insertion section, it is possible to stabilize an affixing performance in relation to the housing, and in the case that the second seal member is constructed only by the integrally formed product of the rubber-like elastic body while omitting the metal ring, it is possible to achieve a cost reduction and an easiness of an installing work with regard to the second seal member.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, in the case that the oil seal is used as the oil seal for the steering wheel, the effects of the present invention can be achieved in the technical field relevant to the shaft seal of the steering section.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The following embodiments are included in the present invention</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">(1)</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention relates to an oil seal for a power steering wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">(2)</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">(2-1) In the prior art, the oil seal is fitted to the housing, and plays a role in sealing the internal oil and preventing the external dust from entering. The shaft oscillates together with a motion of the steering wheel, and the dust cover is affixed to the shaft in the atmospheric side of the oil seal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">(2-2) The oil seal is constructed by the metal ring, the rubber and the spring, and is constructed by the main lip sealing the oil, the dust lip preventing the external dust from entering, and the fitting section affixing the oil seal to the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">(2-3) In the region in which the road improvement is not sufficient, for example, the regions in foreign countries, the dust environment is severe and there is a case that the vehicle travels in a state in which the power steering section is temporarily submerged. In the prior art, there is the problem that the muddy water entering from the gap between the dust cover and the housing bites into the main lip section so as to cause the oil leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">(3)</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">(3-1) Accordingly, the present invention is structured as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">(3-2) In other words, in the prior art, in the case that the muddy water environment is severe, the muddy water flows into the oil seal section from the gap between the dust cover and the housing, and the muddy water is piled up in the housing recess section in the atmospheric side of the dust lip. Therefore, the muddy water enters into the main lip section due to lack of the muddy water resistance in the dust lip, and the main lip bites the dust, whereby the oil leakage is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(3-3) On the contrary, the present invention is structured such that the atmospheric side surface of the housing is covered with the dust seal so as to prevent the muddy water from being piled on the housing recess section in the atmospheric side of the oil seal. Further, in order to further improve the muddy water resistance, the outer peripheral lip having a fastening margin in relation to the dust cover is provided in the outer peripheral side of the dust seal, for inhibiting the muddy water from entering from the section between the dust cover and the housing.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, a description will be given of embodiments according to the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross section of a substantial part of an oil seal <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The oil seal <b>1</b> according to the embodiment is constructed by a combination of a first seal member (which may be also called as an oil seal main body) <b>11</b> which is installed to an inner periphery of a shaft hole <b>32</b> of a housing <b>31</b>, and a second seal member (which may be also called as a dust seal) <b>21</b> which is installed to an end surface section of the housing <b>31</b> in an opening peripheral edge section of the shaft hole <b>32</b>, and is structured as follows. In this case, a shaft <b>33</b> inserted to the shaft hole <b>32</b> is a vertical shaft, and is specifically a steering shaft in a power steering section of a vehicle such as a motor vehicle. A lower side of the drawing is a machine inner side A and an upper side is a machine outer side B. An inward (a diametrically inward) flange section <b>34</b> is integrally provided in an opening peripheral edge section of the shaft hole in an end section of the machine outer side of the housing <b>31</b>, and the first seal member <b>11</b> is installed to the flange section <b>34</b> in a state in which the first seal member is struck its end surface against the flange section from the machine inner side A. On the other hand, the second seal member <b>21</b> is installed like a cap from the machine outer side B in such a manner as to cover an end surface section (an upper surface section) of the flange section <b>34</b>, that is, an end surface section (an upper surface section) of the housing <b>31</b>. A dust cover <b>35</b> is attached to an outer peripheral surface of the shaft <b>33</b> so as to be positioned further in the machine outer side B of the flange section <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first seal member <b>11</b> has a tubular affixation section <b>12</b> which is affixed (fitted) to an inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole <b>32</b> of the housing <b>31</b> in the machine inner side A of the flange section <b>34</b>, a flange-shaped lip retaining section <b>13</b> is integrally provided from an end section in the machine outer side of the affixation section <b>12</b> toward an inner side in a diametrical direction, a plurality of seal lips <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> are integrally provided in an inner peripheral end section of the lip retaining section <b>13</b>, and a main lip <b>14</b> and a first dust lip <b>15</b> are integrally provided as the seal lip, the main lip <b>14</b> sealing an oil in the machine inner side A, and the first dust lip <b>15</b> sealing an external dust such as a muddy water or the like in the machine outer side B. Both of the seal lips <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> seal the oil or the dust by slidably coming into close contact with a peripheral surface of the shaft <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the first seal member <b>11</b> is structured in its part construction such that a rubber-like elastic body <b>17</b> is attached (vulcanization bonded) to a metal ring <b>16</b> in which an inward flange section <b>16</b><i>b </i>is integrally formed in an end section in the machine outer side of a tubular section <b>16</b><i>a</i>, and a plurality of seal lips <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> are integrally formed by the rubber-like elastic body <b>17</b> together with an outer peripheral seal section <b>18</b> which seals between the metal ring <b>16</b> and the housing <b>31</b>. A garter spring <b>19</b> for regulating a fastening margin is fitted as a third part to the main lip <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">On the other hand, the second seal member <b>21</b> has a tabular and annular end surface covering section <b>22</b> which covers the end surface section (the upper surface section) <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>31</b> from the above (the machine outer side B), and an annular outer peripheral insertion section <b>23</b> inserted to an outer peripheral surface <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>31</b> from the above is integrally provided in an outer peripheral edge section of the end surface covering section <b>22</b>. A stepped engagement section <b>36</b> is provided as a part of an annular groove <b>37</b> in the outer peripheral surface <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>31</b>. An inner peripheral surface of the outer peripheral insertion section <b>23</b> is integrally provided with a projection section <b>24</b> for preventing the second seal member <b>21</b> from coming off from the housing <b>31</b> by engaging with the stepped engagement section <b>36</b>. Further, an inner peripheral edge section of the end surface covering section <b>22</b> is integrally provided with an annular inner peripheral insertion section <b>25</b> which is inserted to an inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole <b>32</b> in the housing <b>31</b> from the above. Further, in the same manner, a second dust lip <b>26</b> is integrally provided in the machine outer side B of the inner peripheral insertion section <b>25</b> in an inner peripheral edge section of the end surface covering section <b>22</b>, the second dust lip <b>26</b> being positioned in the machine outer side B of the first dust lip <b>15</b>, slidably coming into close contact with a peripheral surface of the shaft <b>33</b> and sealing the foreign material such as the muddy water in the machine outer side B.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An outer peripheral surface of the outer peripheral insertion section <b>23</b> is integrally provided with a third dust lip <b>27</b> which slidably comes into close contact with an inner peripheral surface of a skirt section in the dust cover <b>35</b> so as to seal the foreign material such as the muddy water in the machine outer side B. The third dust lip <b>27</b> is formed such that a lip leading end is directed downward on the contrary to the first and second dust lips <b>16</b> and <b>26</b>, since a gap <b>38</b> between the dust cover <b>35</b> and the housing <b>31</b> is set below the third dust lip <b>27</b> and the muddy water or the like enters from the gap <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second seal member <b>21</b> is constructed by an integrally formed product of the rubber-like elastic body <b>28</b>, however, a metal ring <b>29</b> is embedded at a position from the end surface covering section <b>22</b> toward the inner peripheral insertion section <b>25</b> so as to enhance a strength of the second seal member. The metal ring <b>29</b> is structured such that an outward flange section <b>29</b><i>b </i>is integrally formed in a machine outer side end section of a tubular section <b>29</b><i>a</i>, and the tubular section <b>29</b><i>a </i>positioned in an outer peripheral surface of the inner peripheral insertion section <b>25</b> is fitted to an inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole <b>32</b> with a predetermined fastening margin.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the oil seal <b>1</b> having the structure mentioned above, since the dust cover <b>35</b> is installed to the above of the housing <b>31</b>, the external dust such as the muddy water existing in the machine outer side B is first of all made hard to enter into the machine inner side A. The muddy water entering from the gap <b>38</b> between the dust cover <b>35</b> and the housing <b>31</b> is sealed by the third dust lip <b>27</b>, is further sealed by the second dust lip <b>26</b>, and does not reach the first dust lip <b>15</b> until passing through both the dust lips <b>27</b> and <b>26</b>. The muddy water or the like blocked by the second dust lip <b>26</b> flows down along the outer peripheral surface of the outer peripheral insertion section <b>23</b> without being piled up on the second seal member <b>21</b>, and may flow out of the gap <b>38</b> to the external section via the third dust lip <b>27</b>. Therefore, the muddy water or the like is hard to reach the first dust lip <b>15</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to inhibit the muddy water or the like from being piled up on the first dust lip <b>15</b>, inhibit the muddy water entering from the first dust lip <b>15</b> from biting into the main lip <b>14</b> and inhibit the oil leakage from being generated.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, since the second seal member <b>21</b> is constructed by the integrally formed product of the rubber-like elastic body <b>28</b>, and is structured such that the metal ring <b>29</b> is embedded into the inner peripheral insertion section <b>25</b> and the metal ring <b>29</b> is fitted to the inner peripheral surface of the shaft hole <b>32</b>, it is possible to stabilize an affixing property of the second seal member <b>21</b> in relation to the housing <b>31</b>. In other words, it is possible to strongly and firmly fix the second seal member <b>21</b> to the housing <b>31</b>. Further, since the projection section <b>24</b> provided in the inner peripheral surface of the outer peripheral insertion section <b>23</b> engages with the stepped engagement section <b>36</b> provided in the outer peripheral surface of the housing <b>31</b>, the second seal member <b>21</b> is hard to fall away from the housing <b>31</b>. In this case, in an illustrated installed state, the inner peripheral insertion section <b>25</b> may be structured such that a lower end section thereof is extended downward so as to be brought into close contact with the first seal member <b>11</b>, thereby securing a sealing performance of the section. Further, the end surface covering section <b>22</b> may be structured such that an upper surface thereof is formed as a taper shape and the muddy water tends to flow to the outer peripheral side.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Second Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the first embodiment mentioned above, the second seal member <b>21</b> is constructed by the integrally formed product of the rubber-like elastic body <b>28</b> and is structured such that the metal ring <b>29</b> is embedded at the position from the end surface covering section <b>22</b> toward the inner peripheral insertion section <b>25</b> so as to enhance the strength thereof, however, in a second embodiment, the metal ring <b>29</b> may be omitted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this case, the second seal member <b>21</b> is formed only by an integrally formed product of the rubber-like elastic body <b>28</b>. In this case, it is possible to reduce a manufacturing cost in the second seal member <b>21</b> although a strength thereof is slightly reduced. Further, since a flexibility of the parts is enhanced, it is possible to easily carry out an installing work. The other structures and operational effects of the second embodiment are the same as those of the first embodiment. Further, the parts sealing performance may be secured by bringing the lower end section of the inner peripheral insertion section <b>25</b> into close contact with the first seal member <b>11</b>, and the upper surface of the end surface covering section <b>22</b> may be formed as the taper shape so as to make the muddy water easily flow to the outer peripheral side, in the same manner as the first embodiment.</p>
