<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter disclosed herein generally relates to phase identification and in particular to phase identification at distribution transformers.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electric power distribution networks are used by electric utility companies to deliver electricity from generating stations to customers. The distribution voltages vary across utility companies within a country. In a typical power distribution network, three-phase power at a high voltage is delivered to multiple transmission substations. At these transmission substations, high-voltage power is stepped down to an intermediate three-phase voltage. The intermediate-voltage three-phase power from each substation is then delivered to multiple distribution substations. At the distribution substations, the intermediate-voltage is stepped down to a lower distribution voltage and separated into three single-phase feeder lines. Each of these feeder lines branches into multiple circuits to power multiple distribution transformers that step the voltage down to a final single-phase voltage for delivery to the commercial and residential customers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is desirable to have the feeder circuits with balanced loads such that the current loads on each single-phase output of a three-phase transformer are equal. However, over time, as customers are added and removed, the loads on each single-phase output may change and become unbalanced. To re-balance the loads, some of the branch circuits are typically moved from a more heavily loaded phase to a more lightly loaded phase. If the phase of each line in the feeder circuit is not accurately known, a line may be erroneously removed from a more lightly loaded phase and placed on a more heavily loaded phase. Such errors result in the procedure having to be repeated, which causes a second disruption in service to all customers on the branch being re-phased. Adding a greater load to the more heavily loaded phase may cause imbalance loading on substation that may result in a power outage for all customers on the overloaded phase.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To identify the phase of a particular feeder branch using conventional manual techniques, utility company personnel must physically trace a line run back through various distribution cabinets until the line reaches a point in the distribution network at which the phase is definitely known. This can be a time consuming, labor-intensive process.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various devices and methods have been implemented to attempt to identify phase, such as by use of modems and telephone lines to establish a communication link. A signal associated with the phase at a point in the network where the phase of the line is known (the reference line) is transmitted over the communication link to a point in the network where the phase of the line is not known (the line under test). Difficulties arise when delays in the communication link affect the accuracy of the phase measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One method to reduce communication delays implements a communication link via radio transmissions. Another method is to compare phases between electric power system substations in real time via time base synchronization through Global Positioning System (GPS) data from both the reference line and the line under test to eliminate delay and synchronization problems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In these approaches, a pre-established real-time communication link is required. That is, a communication link needs be established and active at the time the phase of the line under test is measured. This renders these approaches unusable wherever and whenever the communication link cannot be established. Also, because the phase of the line under test is determined for each measurement, the measuring apparatus must be retrieved after each test. This precludes the ability to make several different tests before accessing the apparatus, e.g., measuring the phases of several different overhead lines in a substation before lowering the &#x201c;hot stick&#x201d; to which the apparatus is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a need to provide an improved apparatus and method for the identification of line phase of a power line in a three-phase power distribution network.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Briefly, a phase identification system is proposed. The system includes a sensor coupled to a terminal of a distribution transformer. A processor is coupled to the sensor for processing phase information of the terminal, wherein the sensor and the processor are embedded within a bushing unit on the distribution transformer. The processor is further configured to identify and display phase information at the distribution transformer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment a method to identify phase information at a distribution transformer terminal is presented. The method includes sensing an electrical distribution parameter from a sensor coupled to a terminal of a distribution transformer, obtaining an electrical substation parameter from a substation, and comparing the distribution parameter with the substation parameter. The method further includes identifying phase information of the terminal and displaying the phase information of the terminal at the distribution transformer terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, a system includes a distribution network with a substation coupled to a plurality of distribution transformers. The system further includes a plurality of sensors coupled to terminals of the distribution transformers and the substation, each sensor configured to detect at least one electrical parameter. The system includes a data center for processing and comparing the electrical parameters and a phase identification unit coupled to the data center and embedded within terminals of the distribution transformer. The phase identification unit is configured to identify a phase information at the terminals of the distribution transformers.</p>

The sensor <b>44</b> may include, for example, a current transformer to detect at least one of a noise pattern, a geometric harmonic modulated signal, or an amplitude of current/voltage harmonics. A processor <b>50</b> is coupled to the sensor <b>44</b> for computing phase information of the terminal <b>46</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;processor&#x201d; may include any digital/analog circuit or integrated circuit configured to perform data acquisition, computing, comparing, or analyzing system data such as electrical parameters for information storage or for determining command signals for control actions. The sensor <b>44</b> and the processor <b>50</b> are embedded within a bushing unit <b>52</b> of the distribution transformer <b>48</b>. A display <b>54</b> coupled to the processor <b>50</b> and disposed outside the bushing unit <b>52</b> is configured for displaying the phase information. The display may include an annunciation system such as a LED display or color-coded lights indicating the phase information. In one embodiment, the phase identification unit <b>42</b> alternatively or additionally includes an antenna <b>56</b> coupled to the processor for wireless transmission of electrical parameters to a data center. Power to operate the sensor <b>44</b> and the processor <b>50</b> and other components may be harvested from the voltage present in the transformer. Optionally, system <b>42</b> may include a power harvester comprising an inductive pick up coil <b>60</b> magnetically coupled to the terminal <b>46</b> for supplying power to the sensor <b>44</b>, the processor <b>50</b>, and the optional display <b>54</b>. Alternatively, power harvester may include a capacitive coupling or a step-down transformer (not shown) that is appropriately connected with the terminal <b>46</b> and a ground. In operation, the phase identification unit <b>42</b> may implement at least one of the three techniques discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. It may be noted that the phase identification unit having the sensor, the processor, and the display may be configured to retrofit into a bushing unit of a presently operational distribution transformer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a phase identification system implementing noise correlation according to an embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the sensor <b>44</b> is configured to sense an electrical parameter comprising a noise pattern at a utility node <b>66</b> (where the phase information has to be determined) and is compared with a noise pattern at a substation <b>68</b>, or any other location where the phase is known. In one embodiment, utility node <b>66</b> may comprise a terminal <b>46</b> of a distribution transformer <b>48</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example. The correlation technique relies upon finding the maximum cross-correlation of noise samples taken at one site (for example at utility node <b>66</b>) on one phase with noise samples taken upstream (such as at substation <b>68</b>) on three phases <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. As cross-correlation is most effective if the sampling occurs at the same time at both sites (<b>66</b>,<b>68</b>), it is useful to have communications and sampling protocol that ensures synchronization. In one embodiment, to obtain synchronized samples, electrical parameters at the substation are continuously sampled and stored (in the data center) with time stamps and samples from the distribution transformer are also stored with time stamps.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an exemplary method, to compute phase information at utility node <b>66</b> of the phase of the voltage on power line <b>80</b>, noise samples are simultaneously gathered, for example via sensor <b>44</b> coupled to power line <b>80</b> and sensor <b>45</b> coupled to power line <b>74</b>. In one embodiment, for example, sensors <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> comprise induction couplers. A bandpass filter <b>82</b> having a central frequency between two sequential harmonics, such as 120 Hz and 180 Hz, for example, may be configured to filter the noise between the two sequential harmonics. The filtered noise is then sampled and, an analog-to-digital converter <b>86</b> is used to produce digital packets <b>90</b> representative of the noise voltage at the sample time. These packets are communicated to data center <b>38</b> where a cross-correlation is performed between the noise samples from substation <b>68</b> and the noise samples at the utility node <b>66</b>. In one embodiment, the process of gathering samples from the substation is executed on all three phases of the substation (lines <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>) and on all three lines at the utility node, and the closest correlation is used to determine the phase of the voltage on power line <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the phase identification unit <b>42</b> may include the filter <b>82</b> and the analog-to-digital converter <b>86</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) within the processor <b>50</b>. Further, correlated phase information from the data center <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may be communicated back to the processor <b>50</b> for displaying the phase information on the display <b>54</b>. Communication between the processor <b>50</b> and the data center <b>38</b> may include wired transmission or wireless transmission via antenna <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a phase identification system implementing a geometric harmonic modulation signal according to an embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, one or more GHM signals are injected at one or more points in the distribution network where the phase is known and demodulated where the phase information has to be determined. In one example a signal is injected at substation <b>68</b> and demodulated at utility node <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">GHM signals are generated by GHM signal generators <b>94</b>, only one of which is shown for purposes of example, and added to the distribution network, by inductive coupling via a couplers <b>92</b>, for example, to the three phase lines <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> at the substation <b>68</b>. The components of the GHM signals are configured to have frequencies that are as low as possible in order to traverse capacitor banks and other low pass filters that are found in distribution networks. In one example, these frequencies are in the range of a few hundreds of Hz. At the measurement site such as utility node <b>66</b>, the three GHM signals are extracted, via inductive coupling, for example, using sensors <b>44</b>. Filters <b>82</b>, only one of which is shown for purposes of example, having narrow bandpass segments about the tones of the candidate GHM signals are configured to filter the GHM signals. In one example, the filters may include active filters and perform analog subtraction. The filtered GHM signals are cross-correlated in the data center <b>38</b> against the three possible transmitted signals, and the largest cross-correlation peak is used to identify which of the three candidate GHM signals is on the phase of the voltage on power line <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another exemplary embodiment, the phase identification unit <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> implements a method to correlate the electrical parameters, wherein the electrical parameters comprise at least one of a voltage waveform, a current waveform, a noise pattern, and a harmonic amplitude. Characteristics of voltage or current waveforms include, for example, peak amplitude, phase difference, and frequency domain attributes such as harmonic peak amplitude. In one embodiment, an alternative to performing a correlation of the entire voltage or current waveform is to use a narrower frequency band of noise between the harmonic frequency content for correlation. There may exist pronounced frequency dependence of the harmonics or the background noise visible in the spectral regions between the harmonics. Similar electrical noise characteristics that exist at lower frequencies may travel to the individual distribution transformers connected to the respective phase. The faithfulness with which the noise on one phase at the substation will be present at the distribution transformer will be dependent on the noise or interfering signals on the power line and also on the attenuation suffered in traversing the portion of the distribution network.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary method for phase identification according to an embodiment of the invention. The method <b>100</b> includes determining the electrical parameters at a substation, or any other location where the phase is known at step <b>102</b>. The method also includes determining the electrical parameters at a utility node in step <b>104</b>, where the phase information has to be determined The subsequent steps include converting the electrical parameters from analog to digital signals at <b>106</b>. The electrical parameters may include but not limited to voltage/current harmonics or noise pattern. The digital signals from step <b>106</b> are converted to frequency domain via fast Fourier transform (FFT) in step <b>108</b>. Power at fundamental frequency and at multiple harmonics, for example, third, fifth, and seventh is extracted (in step <b>110</b>) from the frequency spectrum obtained from the FFT. Various ratios such as ratio of the amplitude of power between first and third, or third and fifth, or combinations thereof are computed at step <b>114</b>. A time stamp is applied on the computed ratios in step <b>116</b>. In step <b>118</b>, the ratios from the substation are compared with the ratios from utility node. When a strong correlation is found between the substation ratios and the utility ratios, the phase at the utility node is determined in step <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, such online monitoring of phase information at distribution transformers provides valuable information that is critical for network operations. Phase identification helps distribute load across the grid to improve stability. Further, identifying correct phase of the loads and that of the distribution transformer enables differentiation between single phase and three phase faults and in turn enable outage management systems that rely on the phase information. Added benefits include the ability to accurately model the system and predict the loads on the feeder to ensure that reliable network models are available for analysis. The phase identification system as disclosed herein includes local annunciation that would indicate the phase to which the distribution transformer is connected. Such online systems would eliminate the laborious process of tracking the phase manually from the distribution transformers to the substation. Furthermore, such systems do not suffer from communication delay and synchronization difficulties, and do not require calibration procedures.</p>
