<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of oil collection by the use of a funnel and a drain hose with the drain hose being mounted along a peripheral edge of the funnel when the funnel is hung on a wall.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many different mechanisms are known for catching oil drained from an oil pan of an automobile. Typically, a funnel having a large opening significantly greater than the size of the oil pan drain opening is positioned below the oil pan. When the oil drain plug is removed, oil is allowed to flow into the funnel. Positioned below the funnel is usually a storage container for capturing the used automobile oil.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This process is repeated until a significant quantity of used oil is captured, typically in a 55-gallon storage drum. The drum is then sealed and transported for recycling or alternative use of the captured oil. This process may be undertaken by an individual homeowner or a small auto repair shop.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to the lack of frequency of use when performed by a homeowner, the component parts for capturing used oil must be stored in the homeowner's garage or shop. It is desirous that the assembly for capturing used oil occupy a minimum amount of space and fully capture the oil, so as not to produce a spill.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This object is accomplished by the present invention. The present invention includes the assembly of a funnel and a drain hose for oil collection. The funnel and drain hose are interengaged in a specific orientation. The drain hose is positioned on the funnel with the opposed ends of the drain hose vertically positioned when the funnel is properly hung on a wall. The opposed ends of the drain hose face upwardly so that any residual oil trapped in the drain hose collects at the bottom of a U-shaped portion of the drain hose positioned on the funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">By hanging the funnel assembly on a wall, gravity is used to always maintain residual oil within the drain hose. Residual amounts of oil are thereby collected to avoid the spilling of any oil residue.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This object is accomplished by including a wall mount opening at one end of the funnel. At the opposite end of the funnel and along the sides of the funnel are positioned a series of retention brackets or clips into which the drain hose is engaged. The bracket or clips maintain the drain hose in a specific orientation, so as to collect residual amounts of oil contained in the drain hose. When the funnel is hung vertically on a wall, the drain hose is positioned with its opposite open ends extending vertically upwardly with its opposed openings elevated above the drain hose, so as to transition any residual or excess oil in the drain hose into a thus formed U-shaped portion of the drain hose. The excess oil has no place to escape to and is thereby contained within the drain hose.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, it is another object of the present invention to interengage a drain hose and a funnel for collection of used automobile oil.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another object of the present invention to interengage a drain hose and a funnel for collection of used automobile oil with the funnel including an opening for mounting of the funnel on the wall in a specific orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is still yet another object of the present invention to interengage a drain hose and a funnel for collection of used automobile oil with the funnel including an opening for mounting of the funnel on the wall in a specific orientation and with the drain hose interengaged around a peripheral edge of the funnel so that opposite ends of the drain hose are oriented vertically and residual oil is collected in a U-shaped portion of the drain hose when the funnel is mounted vertically on a wall.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other objects of the invention, as well as many of the intended advantages thereof, will become more readily apparent when reference is made to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In describing a preferred embodiment of the invention illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology will be resorted to for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terms so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific term includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to the drawings, in general, and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in particular, an oil drain collection assembly embodying the teachings of the subject invention is generally designated as <b>10</b>. With reference to its orientation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the oil drain collection assembly includes a funnel <b>12</b> and a drain hose <b>14</b>. The funnel <b>12</b> includes an opening <b>16</b> mounted at an upper end <b>18</b> for mounting the funnel on a wall by passage of a peg <b>20</b> or other projection extending through the opening <b>16</b>. The funnel thereby lies flat against the wall <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The funnel <b>12</b> includes a drain spout <b>24</b> having an externally threaded outlet <b>26</b>. The threaded outlet <b>26</b> is adapted to engage with an internally threaded end <b>28</b> of the drain hose <b>14</b>. The opposite end <b>31</b> of the drain hose includes a spout for directing passage therethrough of oil from the funnel <b>12</b> to the spout <b>31</b> when the end <b>28</b> is connected to the threaded outlet <b>26</b> of the funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the funnel <b>12</b> includes two curved retention clips <b>30</b> along side wall <b>32</b>. Similarly, two curved retention clips <b>30</b> extend from opposite side wall <b>34</b>. At the bottom <b>36</b> of the funnel is a single centrally located clip <b>30</b>. The clips <b>30</b> are generally of a peripheral curvature similar to a curvature of the drain hose <b>14</b>. The clips are used to engage and retain the drain hose along the peripheral sides <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and bottom <b>36</b> of the funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the internally threaded end <b>28</b> of the drain hose is removed from the threaded outlet <b>26</b> of the funnel, residual amounts of fluid or oil are retained within the drain hose. Over time, with the ends <b>28</b>, <b>31</b> of the drain hose positioned in a substantially vertical orientation by the mounting of the drain hose on the funnel and hanging of the funnel <b>12</b> on a wall <b>22</b>, residual oil <b>40</b> is allowed to collect in a U-shaped mid portion of the flexible drain hose <b>14</b>. This oil is retained in position until the drain hose is removed from the funnel and the internally threaded end <b>28</b> is connected to the externally threaded outlet <b>26</b> of the funnel. The collected oil <b>40</b> is thereby directed by end <b>31</b> into a recycling or other container.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in the sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the funnel <b>12</b> includes a converging side wall <b>42</b> tapering down to an intermediate section <b>44</b> until reaching externally threaded outlet <b>26</b>. The sectional view of the drain hose <b>14</b> includes the collected residual oil <b>40</b> located adjacent to the clip <b>30</b> at the bottom end <b>36</b> of the funnel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">By the corrugations in the drain hose <b>14</b>, the drain hose is flexible so as to be bendable into a predetermined configuration. Oil collected in the funnel <b>12</b> is directed to outlet <b>26</b>, so as to pass into the threaded opening <b>28</b> of the drain hose. The outlet end <b>30</b> of the drain hose is directed to a container for collection of oil.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The flexibility of the drain hose allows capture of portions of the drain hose under the clips <b>30</b> spaced about the periphery of three sides of the funnel <b>12</b>. By hanging the funnel in a specific orientation with respect to the retention clips <b>30</b> and the positioning of the flexible hose engaged with the clips <b>30</b>, gravity acts upon any residual oil retained within the drain hose to transition the residual oil to a lowermost connecting portion of the two legs of the U-shaped drain hose. Residual oil is thereby trapped so as to avoid leaking of the oil from the stored drain hose. The residual oil remains in place until the funnel and drain hose are interconnected again and the residual oil is directed from end <b>30</b> of the drain hose.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The foregoing description should be considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and, accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</p>
