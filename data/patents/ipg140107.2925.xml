<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This invention describes a method of conjugating a cell binding agent such as an antibody with an effector group (e.g., a cytotoxic agent) or a reporter group (e.g., a radionuclide), whereby the reporter or effector group is first reacted with a bifunctional linker and the mixture is then used without purification for the conjugation reaction with the cell binding agent. The method described in this invention is advantageous for preparation of stably-linked conjugates of cell binding agents, such as antibodies with effector or reporter groups. This conjugation method provides in high yields conjugates of high purity and homogeneity that are without inter-chain cross-linking and inactivated linker residues.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a novel method of conjugating an effector group (e.g., a cytotoxic agent) or a reporter group (e.g., a radiolabel) to a cell binding agent, such as an antibody or a fragment thereof, via a bifunctional linker. More specifically, this invention relates to a novel method of conjugating an effector group (e.g., maytansinoids) or a reporter group (e.g., a radiolabel) to a cell binding agent (e.g., an antibody or a fragment thereof) via a bifunctional linker such that the process eliminates the steps that result in formation of undesired hydrolyzed species or undesired cross-linked species formed due to intra-molecular or inter-molecular reactions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conjugates of cell binding agents, such as antibodies, with effector groups, such as small cytotoxic agents or cytotoxic proteins, are of immense interest for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics (Richart, A. D., and Tolcher, A. W., 2007, Nature Clinical Practice, 4, 245-25). These conjugates are tumor-specific due to the high specificity of the selected antibodies toward antigens expressed on the cell surface of tumor cells. Upon specific binding to the tumor cell, the antibody-cytotoxic agent conjugate is internalized and degraded inside the target cancer cell thereby releasing the active cytotoxic agent that inhibits essential cellular functions such as microtubule dynamics or DNA replication resulting in the killing of the cancer cell. Various linkers have been employed to link the antibodies with cytotoxic agents with the goal of enhancing the delivery of the agent inside the cell upon internalization and processing of the conjugate, while maintaining the desired stability of the conjugate in plasma. These linkers include disulfide linkers designed with different degrees of steric hindrance to influence their reduction kinetics with intracellular thiol, cleavable peptide linkers such as valine-citrulline linkage, and non-cleavable linkers such as thioether linkage (Widdison, W., et al., J. Med. Chem., 2006, 49, 4392-4408; Erickson, H., et al., Cancer Res., 2006, 66, 4426-4433).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conjugates of cell binding agents such as antibodies with labels or reporter groups are useful for tumor-imaging applications in cancer patients, immunoassay applications for diagnosis of various diseases, cancer therapy using radioactive nuclide-ligand conjugates, and affinity chromatography applications for purification of bioactive agents such as proteins, peptides, and oligonucleotides. The labels or reporter groups that are conjugated with cell-binding agents include fluorophores, and affinity labels such as biotin.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The conventional method of conjugation of the cell-binding agent such as an antibody (Ab) with an effector group (e.g., a cytotoxic agent) or a reporter group (e.g., a radiolabel) linked via a non-reducible linkage (such as thioether linkage) employs two distinct reaction steps with the antibody and necessitates the use of purification steps. In the first reaction step, the antibody is reacted with a heterobifunctional linker bearing two different reactive groups (e.g., X and Y). For example, in one approach, the reaction of an antibody's reactive residues (such as lysine amino residues) with the X reactive group (such as N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) of the heterobifunctional reagent results in the incorporation of the linker with Y reactive group at one or more reactive residues in the antibody (such as lysine amino residues). The initially modified antibody product must be purified from the excess linker or hydrolyzed linker reagent before the next step can occur. In the second reaction step, the linker-modified antibody containing the Y reactive group (such as maleimide or haloacetamide) is reacted with the effector such as an effector group (C) (e.g., a cytotoxic agent) containing a reactive group such as thiol to generate the antibody-effector conjugate, which is again purified in an additional purification step (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020, 5,416,064, or 5,024,834). Thus, in the above process, at least two purification steps are needed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another approach that involves two reaction and purification steps to conjugate antibody with an effector or reporter group uses the reaction of thiol residues in antibody (generated via modification of antibody with thiol-generating reagents such as 2-iminothiolane, or via mutagenesis to incorporate non-native cysteine residues, or via reduction of native disulfide bonds) with a homobifunctional linker Y-L-Y containing Y reactive groups (such as maleimide or haloacetamide).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Major drawbacks of incorporating a reactive group Y such as maleimide (or haloacetamide) in an antibody or peptide are the propensity of the reactive maleimide (or haloacetamide) groups to undergo intra- or inter-molecular reaction with the native histidine, lysine, tyrosine, or cysteine residues in antibody or peptide (Papini, A. et al., Int. J. Pept. Protein Res., 1992, 39, 348-355; Ueda, T. et al., Biochemistry, 1985, 24, 6316-6322), and aqueous inactivation of the Y maleimide group. The undesired intra-molecular or inter-molecular reaction of maleimide (or haloacetamide) groups Y incorporated in antibody with the native histidine, lysine, or cysteine residues in antibody, and aqueous inactivation of the Y maleimide group before the second reaction with the effector or reporter group C give rise to cross-linked proteins or heterogeneous conjugates and lower the efficiency of the second reaction with the effector or reporter group C. The heterogeneous conjugate product&#x2014;cross-linked protein or peptide generated from the undesired reaction of the initially incorporated group Y (such as maleimide group) with native groups in the antibody or peptides (such as histidine, lysine, tyrosine, or cysteine), or with inactive maleimide residues generated by aqueous inactivation&#x2014;may have inferior activity and stability than the desired homogeneous conjugate product.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Processes for conjugating antibodies to thiol-containing cytotoxic agents via disulfide linkages have been described previously (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020, 5,416,064, 6,441,163, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0048314 A1). These processes involve the initial reaction of antibody with a heterobifunctional reagent, followed by a second reaction with a thiol-containing cytotoxic agent. An alternative process has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,441,163 B1 in which the disulfide-linked reactive ester of the cytotoxic agent is first purified and then reacted with the antibody, but which involves an additional reaction and purification step starting from the thiol group-containing cytotoxic agent before the reaction step with the antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further drawback of the current process to make conjugates of cell binding agents is the need for two purification steps, which lowers the overall yield and also makes the process cumbersome and uneconomical for scale-up.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the foregoing, there is a need in the art to develop improved methods of preparing cell-binding agent-drug conjugate compositions that are of substantially high purity and can be prepared avoiding cumbersome steps and by reducing time and cost to the user. The invention provides such a method. These and other advantages of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention describes a conjugation method for preparing non-reducible, thioether-linked conjugates of the formula C-L-CBA, wherein C represents an effector or reporter molecule (e.g., a cytotoxic agent or a radiolabel), L is a linker and CBA is a cell binding agent (e.g., an antibody or a fragment thereof), by utilizing a direct reaction of the thiol-containing cytotoxic agent (e.g., maytansinoids) with a hetero- or a homo-bifunctional reagent, (e.g., cleavable or a non-cleavable linker) followed by mixing of the unpurified reaction mixture with a cell binding agent (e.g., an antibody or a fragment thereof), thereby generating the non-reducible, thioether-linked conjugate by a process that is more efficient, has a high yield, and is amenable for scale up. Another important advantage is that such conjugation method yields thioether-linked non-reducible conjugates with no inter-chain protein cross-linking or inactivated residues (e.g., maleimide or haloacetamide residues). The novel methods disclosed in this application can be applied to the preparation of any conjugate represented by the above formula.</p>

does not involve any purification of the intermediate product X-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C, and therefore provides the advantage of directly mixing it with the antibody (the unpurified intermediate product is added to the antibody or, the antibody is added to the unpurified intermediate product) thereby making the method advantageous for conjugation because it eliminates the need of a cumbersome purification step. Importantly, this method yields homogeneous conjugate with no inter-chain protein cross-linking or inactivated maleimide residues, in contrast to the inter-chain protein cross-linking and inactivated maleimide residues observed in conjugates prepared by the traditional two step reaction and purification sequence.
</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The reaction 1 can be carried out at high concentrations of the heterobifunctional linker, X-L-Y, and the effector or reporter group C in aqueous solvent, organic solvent, or organic/aqueous reaction mixtures, resulting in faster reaction rates than at lower concentrations in aqueous solutions for conjugates prepared by the traditional two step reaction and purification sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The intermediate product X-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C generated in reaction 1 can be stored unpurified in a frozen state, at low temperatures in aqueous solvent at appropriate low pH (e.g., pH &#x2dc;4-6), in organic solvents, or in mixed organic/aqueous mixtures, or in lyophilized state, for prolonged periods and can be mixed later with the antibody solution for the final conjugation reaction at a higher pH value of about 4-9, therefore adding to the convenience of this reaction sequence. The intermediate product can be diluted as required with organic solvent or with aqueous buffer, or a mixture of organic solvent and aqueous buffer prior to mixing with the cell binding agent. The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; as used herein in connection with a numerical should be understood to refer to all such numbers, including all numbers and small variations therefrom. The reaction of the intermediate product X-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C with antibody can be carried out at pH values of about 4 to about pH 9, preferably in the pH range of about 5 to 8.7, more preferably, in the pH range of about 6.5 to about 8.5, such as, pH 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5, a pH range therein or small variations therefrom. The buffers used for the reaction of the antibody with the intermediate product X-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C in the preferential pH range of about 6.5 to 8.5 are buffers with pK<sub>a </sub>values around this pH range, such as phosphate and HEPES buffer. These preferred buffers should not have primary or secondary amino groups, or other reactive groups, that can react with linker X (such as N-hydroxysuccinimide ester).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A stoichiometric or a slight excess of C over the heterobifunctional linker X-L-Y is used in the first reaction to ensure that all Y group (such as maleimide) is reacted before the unpurified mixture is added to the antibody. An optional additional treatment with a quenching reagent (such as 4-maleimidobutyric acid, 3-maleimidopropionic acid, or N-ethylmaleimide, or iodoacetamide, or iodoacetamidopropionic acid) can be done to ensure that any unreacted C is quenched before mixing with the antibody to minimize any unwanted thiol-disulfide interchange reaction with the native antibody disulfide groups. Upon quenching with polar, charged thiol-quenching reagents (such as 4-maleimidobutyric acid or 3-maleimidopropionic acid), the excess, unreacted C is converted into a polar, charged adduct that can be easily separated from the covalently-linked conjugate. Optionally, the final reaction mixture 2, before purification, is treated with nucleophiles, such as amino group containing nucleophiles (e.g., lysine, taurine, hydroxylamine) to quench any unreacted linker (X-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An alternative method for the reaction of antibody with the unpurified initial reaction mixture of maytansinoids (DMx) and heterobifunctional linker involves mixing the initial reaction mixture of DMx and heterobifunctional linker (upon completion of the DMx-linker reaction) with antibody at low pH (pH &#x2dc;5) followed by addition of buffer or base to increase the pH to about 6.5-8.5 for the conjugation reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">This new method is applied to the preparation of an antibody conjugate with the cytotoxic maytansinoid drug. The antibody-maytansinoid conjugates prepared using this method outlined in the reaction sequence 1-2 unexpectedly were much superior in homogeneity compared to the conjugates prepared by the traditional two step reaction and purification sequence, based on characterization of the conjugates by reducing SDS-PAGE, protein LabChip electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. The conjugation method described in this invention that involves the reaction sequence 1-2 also does not require any intermediate purification step and is therefore significantly more convenient than the traditional two-step method.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a second embodiment of the invention, a process for the preparation of a thioether-linked conjugate of a cell-binding agent with an effector or reporter molecule is described comprising the following steps: a) contacting a homobifunctional linker of formula Y-L-Y with a thiol- or amine-containing effector or reporter group C (such as a cytotoxic agent) in aqueous solvent, organic solvent, or mixed aqueous/organic reaction mixtures to yield Y-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C, b) mixing of the reaction mixture without purification with an antibody in aqueous solution or aqueous/organic mixture to produce a conjugate of formula Ab-(Y&#x2032;-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C)<sub>m</sub>, wherein, L is as defined above; Y is a thiol- or amine-reactive group such as a maleimide or haloacetamide, or N-hydroxysuccinimide or sulfo N-hydroxysuccinimide; Ab is an antibody; m is an integer from 1 to 20; Y&#x2032; is the modified Y site (such as a thioether or amide linkage) upon reaction with antibody or a modified Y site (such as a thioether or amide linkage) upon reaction with the cytotoxic agent or effector or reporter group, and c) purification of the conjugate by tangential flow filtration, dialysis, or chromatography (gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography) or a combination thereof.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The reactions 1, 3, 5, and 7-8, can be carried out at high concentrations of the bifunctional linker (X-L-Y, X-L-Y<sub>b</sub>, or Y-L-Y) and the effector or reporter group C in aqueous solvent, organic solvent, or organic/aqueous reaction mixtures, resulting in faster reaction rates than at lower concentrations in aqueous solutions for conjugates prepared by the traditional two step reaction and purification sequence where the solubility of reagents is limiting.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A stoichiometric or a slight excess of C over the heterobifunctional linker X-L-Y, or Y-L-Y, or X-L-Y<sub>b </sub>is used in the first reaction to ensure that all Y group (such as maleimide) is reacted before the unpurified mixture is added to the antibody. An optional additional treatment with a quenching reagent (such as 4-maleimidobutyric acid, or 3-maleimidopropionic acid, or N-ethylmaleimide, or iodoacetamide, or iodoacetic acid) can be done to ensure that any unreacted group (such as thiol) in C is quenched before the addition to the antibody to minimize any unwanted thiol-disulfide interchange reaction with the native antibody disulfide groups. The quenching of the excess C using a charged, polar thiol-quenching reagent, after the initial reaction of C with the bifunctional linker, converts excess C into a highly polar, water-soluble adduct that is easily separated from the covalently-linked conjugate by gel filtration, dialysis, or TFF. The final conjugate product does not contain any non-covalently associated C. Optionally, the final reaction mixtures 2, 4, 6, and 9, before purification, are treated with nucleophiles, such as, amino group containing nucleophiles (e.g., lysine, taurine, hydroxylamine) to quench any unreacted linkers (X-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C, Y-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C, or X-L-Y<sub>b</sub>&#x2032;&#x2014;C).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">An alternate method of the reaction of antibody with the unpurified initial reaction mixture of DMx and bifunctional linker involves mixing the initial reaction mixture of DMx and bifunctional linker (upon completion of the DMx-linker reaction) with antibody at low pH (pH &#x2dc;5) followed by addition of buffer or base to increase the pH to about 6.5-8.5 for the conjugation reaction.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a preferred embodiment, chemotherapeutic cytotoxic agents are essentially small molecule cytotoxic agents. A &#x201c;small molecule drug&#x201d; is broadly used herein to refer to an organic, inorganic, or organometallic compound that may have a molecular weight of for example 100 to 1500, more suitably from 120 to 1200, favorably from 200 to 1000, and typically having a molecular weight of less than about 1000. Small molecule cytotoxic agents of the invention encompass oligopeptides and other biomolecules having a molecular weight of less than about 1000. Small molecule cytotoxic agents are well characterized in the art, such as in WO05058367A2, European Patent Application Nos. 85901495 and 8590319, and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,303, among others and are incorporated in their entirety by reference.</p>

Thus the siRNA in its 3&#x2032; or 5&#x2032;-phosphoroamidite form is reacted with one end of the crosslinker bearing a hydroxyl functionality to give an ester bond between the siRNA and the crosslinker. Similarly reaction of the siRNA phosphoramidite with a crosslinker bearing a terminal amino group results in linkage of the crosslinker to the siRNA through an amine. siRNA are described in detail in U.S. Patent Publication Numbers: 20070275465, 20070213292, 20070185050, 20070161595, 20070054279, 20060287260, 20060035254, 20060008822, 20050288244, 20050176667, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.</p>

Various labels or reporter groups are useful for tumor-imaging applications in cancer patients, immunoassay applications for diagnosis of various diseases, cancer therapy using radioactive nuclide-ligand conjugates, and affinity chromatography applications for purification of bioactive agents such as proteins, peptides, and oligonucleotides. The labels or reporter groups that are conjugated with cell-binding agents include fluorophores, and affinity labels such as biotin. Such reporter group references can be found in US publication number 2007/0092940. Reporter groups including, for example, biotin or fluorescein can also be attached to a PEG conjugate moiety. A number of suitable reporter groups are known in the art, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,152,411 and Hirschfeld U.S. Pat. No. 4,166,105, U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,242, U.S. Pat.

<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Linkers</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The conjugates may be prepared by in vitro methods. In order to link a drug to the cell-binding agent, a linking group is used. Suitable linking groups are well known in the art and include non-cleavable or cleavable linkers. A non-cleavable linker is any chemical moiety that is capable of linking a cytotoxic agent to a cell-binding agent in a stable, covalent manner. Non-cleavable linkers are substantially resistant to acid-induced cleavage, light-induced cleavage, peptidase-induced cleavage, esterase-induced cleavage, and disulfide bond cleavage. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include linkers having an N-succinimidyl ester, N-sulfosuccinimidyl ester moiety, maleimido- or haloacetyl-based moiety for reaction with the drug, the reporter group or the cell binding agent. Crosslinking reagents comprising a maleimido-based moiety include N-succinimidyl 4-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylate (SMCC), N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxy-(6-amidocaproate), which is a &#x201c;long chain&#x201d; analog of SMCC (LC-SMCC), &#x3ba;-maleimidoundecanoic acid N-succinimidyl ester (KMUA), &#x3b3;-maleimidobutyric acid N-succinimidyl ester (GMBS), &#x3b5;-maleimidocaproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (EMCS), m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), N-(&#x3b1;-maleimidoacetoxy)-succinimide ester (AMAS), succinimidyl-6-(&#x3b2;-maleimidopropionamido)hexanoate (SMPH), N-succinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl)-butyrate (SMPB), and N-(p-maleimidophenyl)isocyanate (PMPI). Cross-linking reagents comprising a haloacetyl-based moiety include N-succinimidyl-4-(iodoacetyl)-aminobenzoate (SIAB), N-succinimidyl iodoacetate (SIA), N-succinimidyl bromoacetate (SBA), and N-succinimidyl 3-(bromoacetamido)propionate (SBAP).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Other crosslinking reagents lacking a sulfur atom that form non-cleavable linkers can also be used in the inventive method. Such linkers can be derived from dicarboxylic acid based moieties. Suitable dicarboxylic acid based moieties include, but are not limited to, &#x3b1;,&#x3c9;-dicarboxylic acids of the general formula shown below:

</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">wherein X is a linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, Y is a cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group bearing 3 to 10 carbon atoms, Z is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group bearing 6 to 10 carbon atoms, or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group wherein the hetero atom is selected from N, O or S, and wherein l, m, and n are each 0 or 1, provided that l, m, and n are all not zero at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Many of the non-cleavable linkers disclosed herein are described in detail in U.S. Patent publication number 20050169933.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Cleavable linkers are linkers that can be cleaved under mild conditions, i.e. conditions under which the activity of the cytotoxic agent is not affected. Many known linkers fall in this category and are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Acid-labile linkers are linkers cleavable at acid pH. For example, certain intracellular compartments, such as endosomes and lysosomes, have an acidic pH (pH 4-5), and provide conditions suitable to cleave acid-labile linkers.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Linkers that are photo-labile are useful at the body surface and in many body cavities that are accessible to light. Furthermore, infrared light can penetrate tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Some linkers can be cleaved by peptidases. Only certain peptides are readily cleaved inside or outside cells, see e.g. Trouet et al., 79 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 626-629 (1982), Umemoto et al. 43 Int. J. Cancer, 677-684 (1989), and lysosomal-hydrolase cleavable valine-citrulline linkage (U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345 B1). Furthermore, peptides are composed of .alpha.-amino acids and peptidic bonds, which chemically are amide bonds between the carboxylate of one amino acid and the .alpha.-amino group of a second amino acid. Other amide bonds, such as the bond between a carboxylate and the .epsilon.-amino group of lysine, are understood not to be peptidic bonds and are considered non-cleavable.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Some linkers can be cleaved by esterases. Again only certain esters can be cleaved by esterases present inside or outside cells. Esters are formed by the condensation of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Simple esters are esters produced with simple alcohols, such as aliphatic alcohols, and small cyclic and small aromatic alcohols. For example, the present inventors found no esterase that cleaved the ester at C-3 of maytansine, since the alcohol component of the ester, maytansinol, is very large and complex.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Preferred cleavable linker molecules include, for example, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) (see, e.g., Carlsson et al., <i>Biochem. J., </i>173: 723-737 (1978)), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoate (SPDB) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,563,304), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP) (see, e.g., CAS Registry number 341498-08-6), and other reactive cross-linkers, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,913,748, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0133">Monoclonal antibody techniques allow for the production of specific cell-binding agents in the form of monoclonal antibodies. Particularly well known in the art are techniques for creating monoclonal antibodies produced by immunizing mice, rats, hamsters or any other mammal with the antigen of interest such as the intact target cell, antigens isolated from the target cell, whole virus, attenuated whole virus, and viral proteins such as viral coat proteins. Sensitized human cells can also be used. Another method of creating monoclonal antibodies is the use of phage libraries of sFv (single chain variable region), specifically human sFv (see, e.g., Griffiths et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,793; McCafferty et al, WO 92/01047; Liming et al, WO 99/06587.)</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0134">Selection of the appropriate cell-binding agent is a matter of choice that depends upon the particular cell population that is to be targeted, but in general monoclonal antibodies and fragments thereof that preferentially bind to a target cell are preferred, if an appropriate one is available.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0135">For example, the monoclonal antibody My9 is a murine IgG<sub>2a </sub>antibody that is specific for the CD33 antigen found on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cells (Roy et al. <i>Blood </i>77:2404-2412 (1991)) and can be used to treat AML patients. Similarly, the monoclonal antibody anti-B4 is a murine IgG<sub>1</sub>, that binds to the CD19 antigen on B cells (Nadler et al, <i>J. Immunol. </i>131:244-250 (1983)) and can be used if the target cells are B cells or diseased cells that express this antigen such as in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphoblastic leukemia. Similarly, the antibody N901 is a murine monoclonal IgG<sub>1 </sub>antibody that binds to CD56 found on small cell lung carcinoma cells and on cells of other tumors of neuroendocrine origin (Roy et al. <i>J. Nat. Cancer Inst. </i>88:1136-1145 (1996)), huC242 antibody that binds to the CanAg antigen, Trastuzumab that binds to HER2/neu, and anti-EGF receptor antibody that binds to EGF receptor.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Purification Methods</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0136">The conjugate, i.e., the finalized product, of the present invention is purified to remove any unreacted or unconjugated effector or reporter molecule, or unreacted linker or unconjugated, hydrolyzed linker. The purification method can be a tangential flow filtration (TFF, also known as cross flow filtration, ultrafiltration, or diafiltration), gel filtration, adsorptive chromatography, selective precipitation, or combinations thereof. The adsorptive chromatography methods include ion-exchange chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), hydrophobic charge induction chromatography (HCIC), mixed mode ion exchange chromatography, immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), dye ligand chromatography, affinity chromatography, and reversed phase chromatography. For example, the conjugate Ab-(X&#x2032;-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C)<sub>m </sub>described in formula 2 is purified from unreacted C or unreacted/hydrolyzed linker X-L-Y or X-L-Y&#x2032;&#x2014;C. Similarly, the conjugates described in formulae 4, 6, and 9 are purified. Such methods of purification are known to one of skill in the art and can be found, for example, in US Publication No. 2007/0048314.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Undesired Hydrolyzed Linker or Protein Cross-Linking in Conjugates</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0137">Traditional conjugation methods employing the initial reaction of a protein with a heterobifunctional linker with reactive maleimide or haloacetamide residue suffer from two major drawbacks: (i) the conjugate product may consist of hydrolyzed linker, due to aqueous inactivation of the incorporated linker in the antibody before reaction with the effector or reporter molecule; and (ii) inter- or intrachain cross-linking of conjugate, due to reaction of maleimide (or haloacetamide) group with the native histidine, lysine, tyrosine, or cysteine residues in protein or peptide (A. Papini et al., Int. J. Pept. Protein Res., 1992, 39, 348-355; T. Ueda et al., Biochemistry, 1985, 24, 6316-6322). Such interchain cross-linking in antibody would result in various non-reducible covalent linkages between the heavy and light chains, or between two heavy chains, which would be apparent in reducing SDS-PAGE analysis as bands of higher molecular weights than the expected heavy and light chain bands. Such interchain or intrachain cross-linking in antibody would also be apparent by MS as peaks of aberrant masses different than the expected masses of antibody plus linked reporter or effector groups. Unlike traditional conjugation methods, the method described in this application results in conjugates with high homogeneity with no substantial interchain cross-linking or hydrolyzed linker.</p>

After mixing, the reaction mixture was left for 1-4 h and then an aliquot of the reaction mixture was diluted 10 fold and its absorbance measured at 302-320 nm to determine the presence of any remaining unreacted maleimide using the extinction coefficient (&#x3b5;) of maleimide at 302 nm=620 M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and &#x3b5;320 nm&#x2dc;450 M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.

The conjugation reaction was allowed to proceed at ambient temperature for 2 h. Ab-DMx conjugate was purified from the excess small-molecule DMx and linker reactants using a G25 gel filtration column equilibrated in pH 7.5 phosphate buffer, or using tangential flow filtration (TFF). The conjugation mixture was further kept at 4&#xb0; C. for 2 days in pH 7.5 buffer to allow the dissociation of any DMx species attached to antibody non-covalently or via labile linkage. The conjugate was then dialyzed overnight into pH 5.5 histidine/glycine buffer and then filtered through a 0.22 &#x3bc;m filter for final storage.

The number of DMx/Ab measured on purified conjugates were measured as a function of added equivalents of DMx per linker. Conditions of 1.2-2.0 equivalents of DM1/Linker gave conjugates with similar DMx/Ab loads, indicating that the undesired reaction of the DMx thiol at the NHS ester side of the linker is not a significant problem. The amount of cross-linking present in the final conjugates was also analyzed by reducing SDS PAGE showing that the presence of cross-linked contaminants decreases significantly with increasing DM1/linker ratio.</p>

<p id="p-0136" num="0144">An alternate method of the reaction of antibody with the unpurified initial reaction mixture of DMx and heterobifunctional linker involved mixing the initial reaction mixture of DMx and heterobifunctional linker (upon completion of the DMx-linker reaction) with antibody at low pH (pH &#x2dc;5) followed by the addition of buffer or base to increase the pH to 6.5-8.5 for the conjugation reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0145">An antibody-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Mal-DM1 or DM4 conjugate was made by the traditional two step conjugation method for comparison with the conjugation method described in this invention. The humanized antibody at a concentration of 8 mg/ml in pH 7.5 phosphate buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) and 5% DMA was modified with excess heterobifunctional maleimide-PEG<sub>4</sub>-NHS linker reagent (purchased from Pierce Endogen). After 2 h at 25&#xb0; C., the modified antibody was gel purified by G25 chromatography to remove excess unreacted, unincorporated linker. The recovery of purified Ab was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The number of linked maleimide groups in the modified Ab was determined using a small aliquot of modified antibody by addition of a known amount of thiol (such as 2-mercaptoethanol), added in excess over the maleimide, to react with the maleimide residues in the modified antibody and then assaying the remaining thiol by Ellman's assay using DTNB reagent (extinction coefficient of TNB thiolate at 412 nm=14150 M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>; Riddles, P.

The conjugation of modified Ab with DM1 or DM4 thiol was carried out at an Ab concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in a reaction mixture consisting of 95% phosphate buffer pH 7.5 (50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) and 5% DMA. An excess of 1.7 molar equivalents of DM1 or DM4 thiol was added per mol of linked maleimide on the Ab. After reacting overnight at 25&#xb0; C., the conjugate was sterile filtered using a 0.22 &#x3bc;m filter and gel purified from excess unreacted DM1 or DM4 by a G25 column equilibrated in phosphate buffer pH 7.5 (50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). The purified conjugate was held at 4&#xb0; C. for 2 days in phosphate buffer pH 7.5 (50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) to allow for the dissociation of any DM1 or DM4 species attached to antibody non-covalently or via a labile linkage. The conjugate was subsequently dialyzed for 2 days in histidine/glycine buffer pH 5.5 (130 mM glycine/10 mM histidine, pH 5.5) and sterile filtered using a 0.22 &#x3bc;m filter. The number of DM1 or DM4 molecules per Ab molecule in the final conjugate was measured by determining absorbance of the conjugate at 252 and 280 nm using known extinction coefficients for DM1/DM4 and Ab at these two wavelengths.</p>

In contrast, the conjugate prepared using the traditional two-step conjugation method showed heavy and light bands of only 16 and 8% respectively, and major bands of higher molecular weights ranging from 94-169 kDa presumably due to inter-chain cross-linking.

In the case of conjugates made using the traditional two-step method, the major peaks in the spectra all contain one or more hydrolyzed or cross-linked linker fragments in addition to the desired Ab-(linker-DMx)<sub>n </sub>moieties. The putative mechanism of the inter-chain cross-linking or aqueous inactivation of maleimide in the traditional 2-step reaction sequence is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, whereby the incorporated maleimide (or haloacetamide) residue from the initial reaction of antibody with the heterobifunctional linker can react with intramolecular (or intermolecular) histidine, lysine, tyrosine, or cysteine residues resulting in inter-chain cross-linking, or the initially incorporated maleimide (or haloacetamide) residue can get inactivated (such as by hydrolytic maleimide ring cleavage or by aqueous addition to maleimide) and therefore become unavailable for the rapid reaction with thiol-bearing effector or reporter group.

<p id="p-0148" num="0156">An alternative method of conjugation using the method described in this invention involved a quenching step using maleimide or haloacetamide reagents (such as 4-maleimidobutyric acid, or 3-maleimidopropionic acid, or N-ethylmaleimide, or iodoacetamide, or iodoacetic acid) after the completion of the initial DMx and heterobifunctional linker reaction (before the addition of the reaction mixture to the antibody) to quench the excess DMx thiol group in order to prevent any unwanted reaction of DMx thiol with the antibody. In a specific example, following completion of the initial DMx and heterobifunctional linker reaction (before the addition of the reaction mixture to the antibody), 4-maleimidobutyric acid was added to quench the excess DMx thiol group in order to prevent any unwanted reaction of DMx thiol with the antibody during the conjugation reaction. To a reaction mixture of DM4 and Sulfo-Mal-NHS heterobifunctional reagent that contained an excess of DM4 (3 mM), upon completion of the desired DM4 thiol coupling to the maleimide group of the heterobifunctional reagent, a two-fold molar excess of 4-maleimidobutyric acid (6 mM) was added to the reaction mixture at ambient temperature for 20 minutes to quench the remaining DM4 from the initial coupling reaction. Without purification of the reaction mixture, an aliquot was mixed with a solution of antibody in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) under final conjugation conditions of 4 mg/ml Ab, 90% aqueous phosphate buffer/10% DMA, pH 7.5. The conjugation reaction was allowed to proceed at ambient temperature for 2 h.

The conjugation mixture was further kept at 4&#xb0; C. for 2 days in pH 7.5 buffer to allow the dissociation of any DMx species attached to antibody non-covalently or via labile linkage. The conjugate was then dialyzed overnight into pH 5.5 histidine/glycine buffer and filtered through a 0.22 &#x3bc;m filter for final storage. The average number of DM4 molecules per Ab molecule in the final conjugate was measured by determining absorbance of the conjugate at 252 and 280 nm and using known extinction coefficients for DM4 and antibody at these two wavelengths. The conjugate samples were analyzed by non-reducing SDS PAGE using the NuPage electrophoresis system with a 4-12% Bis Tris Gel (Invitrogen). The heat-denatured samples were loaded at 10 &#x3bc;g/lane. The non-reducing SDS-PAGE of the conjugate prepared using the method described in this invention (without quenching) showed evidence of a light chain band (&#x2dc;25 kDa) and half-antibody band (heavy-light chain; &#x2dc;75 kDa) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). On the other hand, the conjugate prepared using the method described in this invention which was treated with 4-maleimidobutyric acid (to cap excess DMx thiol) had significantly lower amounts of these undesirable bands (at levels comparable to unmodified antibody sample). Another advantage of the quenching of the initial DMx and heterobifunctional reaction mixture (before conjugation with the antibody) by thiol-quenching reagents such as 4-maleimidobutyric acid is that during the antibody conjugation reaction there is no &#x201c;free&#x201d; DMx (DM1 or DM4) species and therefore the final conjugate after purification does not contain &#x201c;free&#x201d; or unconjugated DMx species. The DMx-adduct with 4-maleimidobutyric acid (or other polar thiol-quenching reagents) is more water soluble than DMx and therefore can be more easily separated from the covalently linked antibody-DMx conjugate.</p>

In contrast, the conjugate prepared using the traditional two-step method showed heavy and light bands of only 54 and 24% respectively, and major bands of higher molecular weights ranging from 96-148 kDa presumably due to inter-chain cross-linking. Based on the quantitative Protein LabChip analysis, the conjugate prepared by the method described in this application is much superior in terms of lack of inter-chain cross-linking compared to that prepared using the conventional two-step process (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0161">The Ab-SMCC-DM1 conjugates with similar drug loads made via the method described in this invention and by the traditional two step method were compared by size exclusion LC/MS analysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). The conjugate made via the method described in this invention shows the desired MS spectrum containing only the expected distribution of peaks with mass equal to Ab-(linker-DMx)<sub>n</sub>. In the case of conjugate made using the traditional two-step method the spectrum shows a heterogeneous mixture of species which includes the desired Ab-(linker-DMx)<sub>n </sub>species plus additional species containing inactivated maleimide and cross-linked linker fragments. The putative mechanisms of the inter-chain cross-linking and maleimide inactivation in the traditional 2-step reaction sequence are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> whereby the incorporated maleimide (or haloacetamide residue) from the initial reaction of antibody with the heterobifunctional linker can react with intramolecular (or intermolecular) histidine, lysine, tyrosine, or cysteine residues resulting in inter-chain cross-linking, or the initially incorporated maleimide (or haloacetamide) residue can get inactivated by hydrolysis or hydration of the maleimide residue before the reaction step with the thiol-bearing DM1 or DM4 (DMx) agent. Thus the LC-MS analysis clearly shows that the method described in this invention has the advantage of producing homogeneous conjugate with little or no inactivated maleimide or cross-linked linker fragments attached to antibody.</p>

<p id="p-0154" num="0162">Stock solutions containing DM1 or DM4 thiol (DMx) and heterobifunctional linker 4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SPDB) were prepared in DMA at concentrations of 30-60 mM. Linker and DMx thiol were mixed together in DMA containing up to 40% v/v of aqueous 200 mM succinate buffer, 2 mM EDTA, pH 5.0 to give a ratio of DM1 or DM4 (DMx) to linker of 1.6:1 and a final concentration of DMx of 8 mM. After mixing, the reaction was left for 1 h at ambient temperature and then an aliquot of the reaction was added to an aqueous solution of antibody in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) under final conjugation conditions of 4 mg/ml Ab, 90% phosphate buffer (aqueous)/10% DMA (v/v), pH 7.5. The conjugation reaction was allowed to proceed at ambient temperature for 2 h. The Ab-DMx conjugate was purified from excess unreacted reagent and excess DMx using a G25 gel filtration column equilibrated in pH 7.5 phosphate buffer (aqueous). Conjugate was kept at 4&#xb0; C. for 2 days in pH 7.5 buffer to allow for the dissociation of any DMx species attached to Ab non-covalently or via labile linkage. The conjugate was then dialyzed overnight into pH 5.5 histidine/glycine buffer and then filtered through a 0.22 &#x3bc;m filter for final storage. The number of DMx molecules per Ab molecule on the final conjugate was measured by determining absorbance of the conjugate at 252 and 280 nm using known extinction coefficients for DMx and antibody at these two wavelengths.</p>

The reaction mixture was left to react for 2 h at ambient temperature. In a separate parallel reaction, SPDB linker and DMx thiol were mixed together and reacted in a similar fashion to the conditions used for NHS-PEG<sub>4</sub>-maleimide reaction except for a reaction time of 1 h. After the completion of both reactions and without purification, equal volumes of PEG<sub>4</sub>-Mal-DM4 mixture and SPDB-DM4 mixture were combined. An aliquot of the combined reaction mixtures was added without purification to a solution of antibody in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) under final conjugation conditions of 4 mg/ml Ab, 90% phosphate buffer (aqueous)/10% DMA (v/v), pH 7.5. The conjugation reaction was allowed to proceed at ambient temperature for 2 h.

<p id="p-0156" num="0164">The Ab-(mixed SPDB and PEG<sub>4</sub>-Mal linker)-DMx conjugate made via the method described in this invention was tested to determine the percent of incorporation of cleavable versus non-cleavable linker on the Ab by comparing DMx per antibody (D/A) ratio before and after DTT (dithiothreitol) treatment of the conjugate to reduce the disulfide linkage. In order to maintain reaction pH at 7.5 during DTT reduction, the conjugate was first dialyzed into 250 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5. The conjugate was then reduced by reacting with 25 mM DTT for 20 min at 37&#xb0; C. After the DTT reaction, the released DMx and DTT were separated from the reaction mixture using a G25 gel filtration column equilibrated in 250 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5. The average number of DMx molecules per Ab molecule in the purified product was measured by determining the absorbance of the conjugate at 252 and 280 nm and using known extinction coefficients for DMx and antibody at these two wavelengths. The ratio between D/A of DTT-treated conjugate and D/A of non-DTT treated conjugate was used to calculate the percent of DMx attached to Ab via non-cleavable linkage. Two additional samples, Ab-SPDB-DM4 and Ab-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Mal-DM4 conjugates, were treated with DTT as positive and negative controls, respectively. By comparing D/A ratio before and after DTT treatment, the control non-cleavable Ab-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Mal-DM4 conjugate showed that approximately all linkers bound were found to be non-cleavable (93%) as expected. The Ab-(mixed SPDB and PEG<sub>4</sub>Mal linker)-DMx conjugate containing both non-cleavable and disulfide linkers made via the method described in this invention had 41% less DMx cleaved by DTT treatment relative to the amount of DMx loss from the Ab-SPDB-DMx conjugate that consists entirely of cleavable linker. This demonstrated that the Ab-(mixed SPDB and PEG<sub>4</sub>-Mal)-DMx conjugate made via the method described in this invention was composed of approximately 40% non-cleavable and 60% cleavable linkers. By changing the initial ratio of the non-cleavable and cleavable linker reagents, conjugates of antibody with maytansinoid or other effector can be prepared with different ratio of non-cleavable and cleavable linkers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows the mass spectrum of deglycosylated conjugate described above, which comprises of antibody with an average of 3.5 maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule linked via both disulfide linkers (SPDB) and non-cleavable linkers (PEG). The MS shows discrete conjugate species bearing both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). For example, the conjugate peak designated D2-PEG-SPDB bears one disulfide-linked and one non-cleavable thioether-linked maytansinoid molecule; the conjugate peak designated D3-PEG-2SPDB bears two disulfide-linked and one non-cleavable thioether-linked maytansinoid molecules; and the conjugate peak designated D3-2PEG-SPDB bears one disulfide-linked and two non-cleavable thioether-linked maytansinoid molecules.</p>

After mixing, the reaction was left for up to 4 h at ambient temperature and then an aliquot of the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold to measure absorbance at 302-320 nm to assess whether all of the maleimide had reacted with thiol. When no further maleimide was present by UV, an aliquot of the reaction was added to an aqueous solution of an antibody in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5-8.5) under final conjugation conditions of 2.5 mg/ml Ab, 70-80% phosphate buffer (aqueous)/30-20% DMA (v/v). The conjugation reaction was allowed to proceed at ambient temperature for 3 h.

For example, conjugates of a humanized antibody with DM1 were prepared using BMPS (N-[&#x3b2;-maleimidopropyloxy]succinimide ester) or GMBS ((N-[&#x3b3;-maleimidobutyryloxy]succinimide ester) linker as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.
