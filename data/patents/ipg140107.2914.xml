<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is directed to compositions of matter useful for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors in mammals and to methods of using those compositions of matter for the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The highly conserved homologs of the secreted morphogen Hedgehog (Hh) are responsible for proper cellular differentiation during embryogenesis of both invertebrates and vertebrates (reviewed in Ingham and McMahon (2001) <i>Genes Dev. </i>15:3059-3087). In mammals, three Hedgehog genes have been identified encoding Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) proteins. Their roles range from left-right asymmetry, neural tube patterning, limb patterning and branching morphogenesis to bone formation and spermatogenesis. Mutations of pathway components can lead to dramatic developmental disorders. While Hh signaling is mostly quiescent in adults, it has been implicated in many cancers, suggesting that inhibition of this pathway may have therapeutic benefit (reviewed in Beachy, P. A. et al. (2004) <i>Nature </i>432:324-331; Pasca di Magliano and Hebrok (2003) <i>Nat. Rev. Cancer </i>3:903-911; Rubin and de Sauvage (2006) <i>Nat Rev Drug Discov. </i>5(12):1026-33).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Activation of the Hedgehog pathway through overexpression of Hedgehog is a hallmark of many cancers. The literature shows that overexpression of Hedgehog has been detected in many human tumor biopsies and cell lines of different types, including, for example, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), gastric and upper gastrointestinal tract cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The mature Hh amino terminal domain, responsible for proper short- and long-range signaling of Shh (sometimes referred to as Shh-N), is produced by autoproteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal intein-like domain (Lee, J. J. et al. (1994) <i>Science </i>266:1528-1537; Porter, J. A. et al. (1995) <i>Nature </i>374:363-366; Porter, J. A. et al. (1996) <i>Cell </i>86:21-34) followed by addition of cholesterol at the C-terminus and palmitoylation at the N-terminus (Pepinsky et al. (1998) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>273:14037-14045; Porter, J. A. et al. (1996) <i>Science </i>274:255-259). The crystal structure of murine Shh revealed a tetrahedrally coordinated Zn<sup>2+</sup> cation (Hall, T. M. et al. (1995) <i>Nature </i>378:212-216) with an overall topology similar to those of the MD clan of metalloproteases (Rawlings, N. D. et al. (2008) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>36:D320-325), which include bacterial lysostahins (Bochtler, M. et al. (2004) <i>Protein Sci. </i>13:854-861), and the VanX dipeptidase (Bussiere, D. E. et al. (1998) <i>Mol. Cell. </i>2:75-84). Although Shh contains a metalloprotease pseudo-active site, mutations in the active site do not adversely affect biological assays signaling activity, suggesting that Shh acts as binding partner for membrane-bound receptors rather than as an enzymatically active protease (Fuse, N. et al. (1999) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>96:10992-10999).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">At the cell surface, the Hh signal is relayed by two multi-transmembrane prteins. The 12-pass transmembrane protein Patched (Ptch) is a negative regulator of the pathway, which in the absence of ligand prevents signaling by repressing the 7-passtranmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) (Chen and Struhl (1996) <i>Cell </i>87:553-563; Marigo, V. et al. (1996) <i>Nature </i>384:176-179; Stone, D. M. et al. (1996) <i>Nature </i>384:129-134). Binding of Shh to Ptch relieves the inhibition of Smo, allowing it to translocate to the primary cilium (Rohatgi and Scott (2007) <i>Nat. Cell Biol. </i>9:1005-1009), where still poorly understood downstream signaling events ultimately lead to the activation of a family of Zn-finger transcription factors called Gli (Ingham and McMahon (2001) <i>Genes Devel. </i>15: 3059-3087).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Regulation of the Hh signal at the cell surface by Ptch is finely tuned by a number of additional cell surface molecules such as the invertebrate proteins Ihog (interference Hedgehog) (Lum, L. et al. (2003) <i>Science </i>299:2039-2045; Yao, S. et al. (2006) <i>Cell </i>125:343-357) and Boi (brother of Ihog) (Yao, S. et al. (2006) <i>Cell </i>125:343-357) and their corresponding vertebrate homologs Cdon (Kang, J. S. et al. (1997) <i>J. Cell. Biol. </i>138:203-213; Zhang, W. et al. (2006) Dev. Cell 10: 657-65) and Boc (bioregional Cdon-binding protein) (Kang, J. S. et al. (2002) <i>EMBO J. </i>21:114-124; Tenzen, T. et al. (2006) <i>Dev. Cell </i>10:647-656). The co-receptors Ihog/Boi Cdon/Boc, and Gas1 (Growth arrest-specific-1 protein), which lacks a known homolog in <i>Drosophila</i>, are pathway agonists that enhance signal reception (Allen Allen, B. L. et al. (2007) <i>Genes Dev. </i>21:1244-1257).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Like Ptch, Hedgehog-interacting protein (Hhip1, also known as Hip) is a negative regulator of the pathway and its transcription is upregulated in response to Hh signaling (Chuang, P. T. et al. (2003) <i>Genes Dev. </i>17:342-347; Chuang, P. T. et al. (1999) <i>Nature </i>397:617-621). Binding affinities for Shh to Hhip1 and Ptch on cells are similar, with K<sub>D </sub>values of 5 nM for Hhip1 and 4 nM for Ptch (Chuang and McMahon (1999) <i>Nature </i>397:617-621). Decreased expression levels of Hhip1 have been noted in several human tumor tissue types, suggesting an important role for Hhip1 in suppressing tumor development (Olsen, C. L. et al. (2004) <i>BMC Cancer </i>4:43).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Hhip1 is a 700 residue protein with an N-terminal signal peptide and a large extracellular region that ends with a hydrophobic C-terminal stretch (Chuang and McMahon (1999) <i>Nature </i>397:617-621). In addition to the predominantly membrane-associated form, a soluble form of Hhip1 has also been detected in mature brains of adult rodents (Coulombe, J. et al. (2004) <i>Mol. Cell. Neurosci. </i>25:323-333). Other than the likely presence of two epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains and four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Chuang and McMahon (1999) <i>Nature </i>397:617-621), nothing is known about the structural arrangement of the Hhip1 extracellular domain (ECD).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Although the structure of Shh has been known for some time, a precise understanding of the molecular interactions with its membrane-associated receptors has remained elusive. Recently, a comparison of structures of fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain 1 of Ihog and FNIII domain 3 of Cdon in complex with <i>Drosphila </i>Hh and vertebrate Shh, respectively, have revealed completely different binding modes (McLellan, J. S. et al. (2006) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>103:17208-17213).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Until now, the crystal structure of Hhip1 has remained unsolved and it was not known how Hhip1 interacted with Hh to exert its effect. Likewise, Ptch has not been crystallized, so it was also unknown how Ptch interacted with Hh.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, in order to effectively combat Hedgehog pathway-associated tumors, there is an urgent need in the art to better understand the precise interaction of Hh with Hh-controlling molecules such as Hhip1 and Ptch. A more complete understanding of the structural/functional relationship of the members of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, and more specifically, a better understanding of the molecular interaction between Ptch and Hhip1 with Hh would provide the necessary information for the rational design of small molecule and large molecule inhibitors of Hh and therapies for Hh-related cancers and conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to better understand the regulation of Shh by Hhip1, we determined crystal structures of a truncated form of the Hhip1 ectodomain both alone and in complex with Shh. The complex structure revelas a critical interaction between a loop in the Hhip1 &#x3b2;-propeller and the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-containing groove of the Shh pseudo-active site. Remarkably, a similar motif is found in Ptch, suggesting that Ptch and Hhip1 compete for binding to the Shh pseudo-active site. This would explain the negative regulation by Hhip1 as a structural decoy for Shh, preventing Ptch binding and pathway activation. The data also lend insight into the effect of mutations in and around the pseudo-active site in Hh proteins that are linked to human disease (Dubourg et al. (2004); Gao and He (2004)). Taken together, the data allow us to propose a model for regulation of Hh activity via receptor interactions and suggest novel approaches for developing antagonists of Hh signaling.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, this specification describes a Hedgehog interacting protein (Hhip1) variant, lacking a putative frizzled domain, herein referred to as &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>&#x201d; and the crystal structure of the same. It has been surprisingly discovered that the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>protein provides the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>protein with increased stability while completely maintaining Hh-inhibitory activity. Thus, the crystal structure of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>has been solved and the interaction with Hh and other proteins, such at Ptch, has been analyzed. Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>contains critical amino acids that interact with Hh and Ptch allowing for the design of interacting molecules such as, for example, polypeptide agonists and antagonists, immunoadhesins, antibodies, and small molecule inhibitors and agonists.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present invention, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence that encodes a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide or biologically active fragment thereof (collectively &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides&#x201d;).</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another aspect of the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a Hhip1 polypeptide which has either the putative GPI signal sequence deleted or inactivated, or is complementary to such encoding nucleotide sequence, wherein the putative GPI signal sequence of such polypeptide(s) are disclosed herein.

<p id="p-0181" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the model of Shh-receptor complexes that lead to pathway regulation. When the Hh pathway is active, membrane-bound Shh forms a multimeric complex with Cdon and Ptch that relieves inhibition of Smo. This leads to translocation of the active form of Gli to the nucleus initiating transcription of Hh target genes. Ptch binding to Shh will likely involves interaction between the Ptch L2-equivalent loop and the Shh Zn<sup>2+</sup>-containing groove.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0190"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the same pathway as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> except when Hh signaling is inhibited by Hhip1, which acts as a structural decoy receptor for Ptch by occupying the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-containing groove on Shh. Hhip1, Cdon and Shh form a stable ternary complex leaving Ptch to repress Smo and inhibit signaling. Consequently, Gli is processed into a transcriptional repressor by the proteasome, resulting in inhibition of Hh target gene transcription. FN and Ig stand for the fibronectin type-III (FNIII) and Ig-like domains of Cdon, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0192" num="0200">The terms &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides&#x201d; and &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>derivatives&#x201d; or Hip<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>refer to various polypeptides, derived from full-length Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:83) that is lacking the putative Frizzled domain of Hhip1. The term encompasses specifically identified fragments defined herein by SEQ ID NOs. and by designations such as Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12ECD </sub>(SEQ ID NO:12), Hip<sub>&#x3b2;1 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:13) and Hip<sub>&#x3b2;</sub> (SEQ ID NO:14), for example. Further, where the term appears with specified amino acids (e.g., Hhip1 14-67) this refers to the amino acids specifically designated with reference to the full-length Hhip1 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:2). The Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides described herein may be isolated from a variety of sources, such as from human tissue types or from another source, or prepared by recombinant or synthetic methods. The term &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide&#x201d; refers to each individual Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>/number polypeptide disclosed herein. All disclosures in this specification which refer to the &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide derivatives&#x201d; refer to each of the polypeptides individually as well as jointly. For example, descriptions of the preparation of, purification of, derivation of, formation of antibodies to or against, formation of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>binding oligopeptides to or against, formation of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>binding organic molecules to or against, administration of, compositions containing, treatment of a disease with, etc., pertain to each polypeptide of the invention individually. The term &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide variants&#x201d; refers to variants of the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide and derivatives disclosed herein including. The sequence of full-length Hhip1 polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:2. The sequence of full-length Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide is provided as SEQ ID NO:83.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0201">A &#x201c;native sequence Hhip1 polypeptide&#x201d; comprises a polypeptide having the same amino acid sequence as the corresponding Hhip1 polypeptide derived from nature. Such native sequence Hhip1 polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. The term &#x201c;native sequence Hhip1 polypeptide&#x201d; specifically encompasses naturally-occurring truncated or secreted forms of the specific Hhip1 polypeptide (e.g., an extracellular domain sequence), naturally-occurring variant forms (e.g., alternatively spliced forms) and naturally-occurring allelic variants of the polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0202">The Hhip1 polypeptide &#x201c;extracellular domain&#x201d; or &#x201c;ECD&#x201d; refers to a form of the Hhip1 polypeptide which is essentially free of the putative GPI signal sequence which is removed when the polypeptide is anchored via a GPI-linkage (abbreviated herein as &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>ECD</sub>&#x201d;). It will be understood that any putative GPI signal sequence identified for the Hhip1 polypeptides of the present invention are identified pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of domain. The exact boundaries of a GPI signal sequence may vary but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids at either end of the domain as initially identified herein. In a specific example, Hhip1<sub>ECD </sub>has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:11. Optionally, therefore, an extracellular domain of a Hhip1 polypeptide may contain from about 5 or fewer amino acids on either side of the putative GPI signal sequence domain/extracellular domain boundary as identified in the Examples or specification and such polypeptides, with or without the associated signal peptide, and nucleic acid encoding them, are contemplated by the present invention. Similarly, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12ECD </sub>refers to the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide essentially free of the putative GPI signal sequence (abbreviated herein as &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12ECD</sub>&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0203">The approximate location of the &#x201c;signal peptides,&#x201d; &#x201c;signal sequence,&#x201d; or &#x201c;leader sequence,&#x201d; used synonymously herein, of the various Hhip1 polypeptides disclosed herein may be shown in the present specification and/or the accompanying figures. It is noted, however, that the C-terminal boundary of a signal peptide may vary, but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids on either side of the signal peptide C-terminal boundary as initially identified herein, wherein the C-terminal boundary of the signal peptide may be identified pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of amino acid sequence element (e.g., Nielsen et al., <i>Prot. Eng. </i>10:1-6 (1997) and von Heinje et al., <i>Nucl. Acids. Res. </i>14:4683-4690 (1986)). Moreover, it is also recognized that, in some cases, cleavage of a signal sequence from a secreted polypeptide is not entirely uniform, resulting in more than one secreted species. These mature polypeptides, where the signal peptide is cleaved within no more than about 5 amino acids on either side of the C-terminal boundary of the signal peptide as identified herein, and the polynucleotides encoding them, are contemplated by the present invention.</p>

Such Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide variants include, for instance, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides wherein one or more amino acid residues are added, or deleted, at the N- or C-terminus of the full-length native amino acid sequence.

Optionally, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>variant polypeptides will have no more than one conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the native Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide sequence, alternatively no more than 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the native Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0205">&#x201c;Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity&#x201d; with respect to the Hhip1 polypeptide sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific Hhip1 polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc. and the source code shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,361,732, and has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The source code is incorporated herein by reference. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif. or may be compiled from the source code provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7,361,732. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0206">In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>100 times the fraction X/Y<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. As examples of % amino acid sequence identity calculations using this method, Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate how to calculate the % amino acid sequence identity of the amino acid sequence designated &#x201c;Comparison Protein&#x201d; to the amino acid sequence designated &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>&#x201d;, wherein &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>&#x201d; represents the amino acid sequence of a hypothetical Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide of interest, &#x201c;Comparison Protein&#x201d; represents the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide against which the &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>&#x201d; polypeptide of interest is being compared, and &#x201c;X, &#x201c;Y&#x201d; and &#x201c;Z&#x201d; each represent different hypothetical amino acid residues.

<p id="p-0201" num="0209">&#x201c;Percent (%) nucleic acid sequence identity&#x201d; with respect to Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>-encoding nucleic acid sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of nucleotides in a candidate sequence that are identical with the nucleotides in the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>nucleic acid sequence of interest, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent nucleic acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. For purposes herein, however, % nucleic acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2, wherein the complete source code for the ALIGN-2 program as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0210">In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for nucleic acid sequence comparisons, the % nucleic acid sequence identity of a given nucleic acid sequence C to, with, or against a given nucleic acid sequence D (which can alternatively be phrased as a given nucleic acid sequence C that has or comprises a certain % nucleic acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given nucleic acid sequence D) is calculated as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>100 times the fraction W/Z<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where W is the number of nucleotides scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of C and D, and where Z is the total number of nucleotides in D. It will be appreciated that where the length of nucleic acid sequence C is not equal to the length of nucleic acid sequence D, the % nucleic acid sequence identity of C to D will not equal the % nucleic acid sequence identity of D to C. As examples of % nucleic acid sequence identity calculations, Tables 3 and 4, demonstrate how to calculate the % nucleic acid sequence identity of the nucleic acid sequence designated &#x201c;Comparison DNA&#x201d; to the nucleic acid sequence designated &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>-DNA&#x201d;, wherein &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>-DNA&#x201d; represents a hypothetical Hip-encoding nucleic acid sequence of interest, &#x201c;Comparison DNA&#x201d; represents the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid molecule against which the &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>-DNA&#x201d; nucleic acid molecule of interest is being compared, and &#x201c;N&#x201d;, &#x201c;L&#x201d; and &#x201c;V&#x201d; each represent different hypothetical nucleotides. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % nucleic acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program.

<p id="p-0203" num="0211">In other embodiments, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>variant polynucleotides are nucleic acid molecules that encode a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide and which are capable of hybridizing, preferably under stringent hybridization and wash conditions, to nucleotide sequences encoding a full-length Hhip1 polypeptide as disclosed herein. Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>variant polypeptides may be those that are encoded by a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>variant polynucleotide</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0212">The term &#x201c;full-length coding region&#x201d; when used in reference to a nucleic acid encoding a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide refers to the sequence of nucleotides which encode the full-length Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide of the invention (which is often shown between start and stop codons, inclusive thereof, in the accompanying figures).</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0213">&#x201c;Isolated,&#x201d; when used to describe the various polypeptides disclosed herein, means polypeptide that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified (1) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (2) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells, since at least one component of the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0214">An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid or other polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid. An isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the specific polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule includes polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules contained in cells that ordinarily express the polypeptide where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0215">The term &#x201c;control sequences&#x201d; refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0216">Nucleic acid is &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0217">&#x201c;Stringency&#x201d; of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art, and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general, longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence, the higher the relative temperature that can be used. As a result, it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent, while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions, see Ausubel et al., C<smallcaps>URRENT </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>ROTOCOLS IN </smallcaps>M<smallcaps>OLECULAR </smallcaps>B<smallcaps>IOLOGY</smallcaps>, Wiley Interscience Publishers, (1995).</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0218">&#x201c;Stringent conditions&#x201d; or &#x201c;high stringency conditions&#x201d;, as defined herein, may be identified by those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50&#xb0; C.; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42&#xb0; C.; or (3) overnight hybridization in a solution that employs 50% formamide, 5&#xd7;SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5&#xd7;Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 &#x3bc;g/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42&#xb0; C., with a 10 minute wash at 42&#xb0; C. in 0.2&#xd7;SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) followed by a 10 minute high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1&#xd7;SSC containing EDTA at 55&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0219">&#x201c;Moderately stringent conditions&#x201d; may be identified as described by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1989, and include the use of washing solution and hybridization conditions (e.g., temperature, ionic strength and % SDS) less stringent that those described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 37&#xb0; C. in a solution comprising: 20% formamide, 5&#xd7;SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5&#xd7;Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 mg/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 1&#xd7;SSC at about 37-50&#xb0; C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0220">The term &#x201c;epitope tagged&#x201d; when used herein refers to a chimeric polypeptide comprising a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide or anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody fused to a &#x201c;tag polypeptide.&#x201d; The tag polypeptide has enough residues to provide an epitope against which an antibody can be made, yet is short enough such that it does not interfere with activity of the polypeptide to which it is fused. The tag polypeptide preferably also is fairly unique so that the antibody does not substantially cross-react with other epitopes. Suitable tag polypeptides generally have at least six amino acid residues and usually between about 8 and 50 amino acid residues (preferably, between about 10 and 20 amino acid residues).</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0221">&#x201c;Active&#x201d; or &#x201c;activity&#x201d; for the purposes herein refers to form(s) of a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide which retain a biological and/or an immunological activity of native or naturally-occurring Hhip1, wherein &#x201c;biological&#x201d; activity refers to a biological function of a native or naturally-occurring Hhip1 other than the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally-occurring Hhip1 and an &#x201c;immunological&#x201d; activity refers to the ability to induce the production of an antibody against an antigenic epitope possessed by a native or naturally-occurring Hip.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0222">The term &#x201c;antagonist&#x201d; is used in the broadest sense, and includes any molecule that partially or fully blocks, inhibits, or neutralizes a biological activity of a native Hhip1 polypeptide disclosed herein. In a similar manner, the term &#x201c;agonist&#x201d; is used in the broadest sense and includes any molecule that mimics a biological activity of a native Hhip1 polypeptide disclosed herein. Suitable agonist or antagonist molecules specifically include agonist or antagonist antibodies or antibody fragments, fragments or amino acid sequence variants of native Hhip1 polypeptides, peptides, antisense oligonucleotides, small organic molecules, etc. Methods for identifying agonists or antagonists of a Hhip1 polypeptide may comprise contacting a Hhip1 polypeptide with a candidate agonist or antagonist molecule and measuring a detectable change in one or more biological activities normally associated with the Hhip1 polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0223">&#x201c;Treating&#x201d; or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; or &#x201c;alleviation&#x201d; refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) the targeted pathologic condition or disorder. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in whom the disorder is to be prevented. A subject or mammal is successfully &#x201c;treated&#x201d; for a cancer, for example, if, after receiving a therapeutic amount of a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oligopeptide, or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>immunoadhesin, the patient shows observable and/or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more of the following: reduction in the number of cancer cells or absence of the cancer cells; reduction in the tumor size; inhibition (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) of cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs including the spread of cancer into soft tissue and bone; inhibition (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) of tumor metastasis; inhibition, to some extent, of tumor growth; inhibition of Hedgehog signaling and/or relief to some extent, one or more of the symptoms associated with the specific cancer; reduced morbidity and mortality, and improvement in quality of life issues. To the extent the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oligopeptide may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. Reduction of these signs or symptoms may also be felt by the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0224">The above parameters for assessing successful treatment and improvement in the disease are readily measurable by routine procedures familiar to a physician. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR). Metastasis can be determined by staging tests and by bone scan and tests for calcium level and other enzymes to determine spread to the bone. CT scans can also be done to look for spread to the pelvis and lymph nodes in the area. Chest X-rays and measurement of liver enzyme levels by known methods are used to look for metastasis to the lungs and liver, respectively. Other routine methods for monitoring the disease include transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and transrectal needle biopsy (TRNB).</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0225">For bladder cancer, which is a more localized cancer, methods to determine progress of disease include urinary cytologic evaluation by cystoscopy, monitoring for presence of blood in the urine, visualization of the urothelial tract by sonography or an intravenous pyelogram, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The presence of distant metastases can be assessed by CT of the abdomen, chest x-rays, or radionuclide imaging of the skeleton.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0226">&#x201c;Chronic&#x201d; administration refers to administration of the agent(s) in a continuous mode as opposed to an acute mode, so as to maintain the initial therapeutic effect (activity) for an extended period of time. &#x201c;Intermittent&#x201d; administration is treatment that is not consecutively done without interruption, but rather is cyclic in nature.</p>

<p id="p-0231" num="0239">The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains (an IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer unit along with an additional polypeptide called J chain, and therefore contain 10 antigen binding sites, while secreted IgA antibodies can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages comprising 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units along with J chain). In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (VH) followed by three constant domains (CH) for each of the &#x3b1; and &#x3b3; chains and four CH domains for &#x3bc; and &#x3b5; isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (VL) followed by a constant domain (CL) at its other end. The VL is aligned with the VH and the CL is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (CH1). Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a VH and VL together forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see, e.g., B<smallcaps>ASIC AND </smallcaps>C<smallcaps>LINICAL </smallcaps>I<smallcaps>MMUNOLOGY, </smallcaps>8th edition, Daniel P.

<p id="p-0232" num="0240">The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, having heavy chains designated &#x3b1;, &#x3b4;, &#x3b5;, &#x3b3;, and &#x3bc;, respectively. The &#x3b3; and &#x3b1; classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0241">The term &#x201c;variable&#x201d; refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and define specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the 110-amino acid span of the variable domains. Instead, the V regions consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions (FRs) of 15-30 amino acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called &#x201c;hypervariable regions&#x201d; that are each 9-12 amino acids long. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a &#x3b2;-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the &#x3b2;-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., S<smallcaps>EQUENCES OF </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>ROTEINS OF </smallcaps>I<smallcaps>MMUNOLOGICAL </smallcaps>I<smallcaps>NTEREST, </smallcaps>5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0242">The term &#x201c;hypervariable region&#x201d; when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a &#x201c;complementarity determining region&#x201d; or &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; (e.g. around about residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the VL, and around about 1-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the VH; Kabat et al., S<smallcaps>EQUENCES OF </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>ROTEINS OF </smallcaps>I<smallcaps>MMUNOLOGICAL </smallcaps>I<smallcaps>NTEREST, </smallcaps>5th Ed.

<p id="p-0235" num="0243">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies useful in the present invention may be prepared by the hybridoma methodology first described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) <i>Nature </i>256:495, or may be made using recombinant DNA methods in bacterial, eukaryotic animal or plant cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The &#x201c;monoclonal antibodies&#x201d; may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., (1991) <i>Nature </i>352:624-628 and Marks et al., (1991) <i>J.

No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., (1984) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include &#x201c;primatized&#x201d; antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g., Old World Monkey, Ape etc.), and human constant region sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0245">An &#x201c;intact&#x201d; antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding site as well as a CL and at least heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. Preferably, the intact antibody has one or more effector functions.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0246">&#x201c;Antibody fragments&#x201d; comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al., (1995) <i>Protein Eng. </i>8(10): 1057-1062); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0247">Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called &#x201c;Fab&#x201d; fragments, and a residual &#x201c;Fc&#x201d; fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (VH), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (CH1). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having divalent antigen-binding activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab&#x2032; fragments differ from Fab fragments by having additional few residues at the carboxy terminus of the CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab&#x2032;-SH is the designation herein for Fab&#x2032; in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab&#x2032;)2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab&#x2032; fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0248">The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, which region is also the part recognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain types of cells.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0249">&#x201c;Fv&#x201d; is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0250">&#x201c;Single-chain Fv&#x201d; also abbreviated as &#x201c;sFv&#x201d; or &#x201c;scFv&#x201d; are antibody fragments that comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun in T<smallcaps>HE </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>HARMACOLOGY OF </smallcaps>M<smallcaps>ONOCLONAL </smallcaps>A<smallcaps>NTIBODIES</smallcaps>, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994); Borrebaeck 1995, infra.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0251">The term &#x201c;diabodies&#x201d; refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10 residues) between the VH and VL domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the V domains is achieved, resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., fragment having two antigen-binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two &#x201c;crossover&#x201d; sFv fragments in which the VH and VL domains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>90:6444-6448 (1993).</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0252">Anti-idiotypic antibodies are antibodies that bind to the antigen binding region of a subject antibody. Such anti-idiotypic antibodies may mimic the epitope that is bound by the subject antibody. For example, a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody that specifically binds the L2 loop of Hhip1, may mimic the portion of Hedgehog that binds to L2. Thus, an anti-idiotypic antibody raised against this subject antibody (and specifically against the antigen binding portion, may therefore recognize and specifically bind Hedgehog in the manner that the L2 portion of Hhip1 binds Hedgehog.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0253">&#x201c;Humanized&#x201d; forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from the non-human antibody. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired antibody specificity, affinity, and capability. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al.

In such embodiments, the extent of binding of the antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule to a &#x201c;non-target&#x201d; protein will be less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule to its particular target protein as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA).

<p id="p-0257" num="0265">Antibody &#x201c;effector functions&#x201d; refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: Clq binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor); and B cell activation.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0266">&#x201c;Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity&#x201d; or &#x201c;ADCC&#x201d; refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g., Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies &#x201c;arm&#x201d; the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc&#x3b3;RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII and Fc&#x3b3;RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet (1991) <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol. </i>9:457-492. An in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337, may be performed to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. (1998) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>95(2):652-656.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0267">&#x201c;Fc receptor&#x201d; or &#x201c;FcR&#x201d; describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc&#x3b3;RI, Fc&#x3b3;RII and Fc&#x3b3;RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc&#x3b3;RII receptors include Fc&#x3b3;RIIA (an &#x201c;activating receptor&#x201d;) and Fc&#x3b3;RIIB (an &#x201c;inhibiting receptor&#x201d;), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc&#x3b3;RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc&#x3b3;RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see review M. in Da&#xeb;ron, (1997) <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol. </i>15:203-234). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet (1991) <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol. </i>9:457-492; Capel et al. (1994) <i>Immunomethods </i>4:25-34; and de Haas et al. (1995) <i>J. Lab. Clin. Med. </i>126:330-341. Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term &#x201c;FcR&#x201d; herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al. (1976) <i>J. Immunol. </i>117:587 and Kim et al. (1994) <i>J. Immunol. </i>24:249).</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0268">&#x201c;Human effector cells&#x201d; are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably, the cells express at least Fc&#x3b3;RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source, e.g., from blood.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0269">&#x201c;Complement dependent cytotoxicity&#x201d; or &#x201c;CDC&#x201d; refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (Clq) to antibodies (of the appropriate subclass) which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g., as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., (1996) <i>J. Immunol. Methods </i>202:163, may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0270">The terms &#x201c;cancer&#x201d; and &#x201c;cancerous&#x201d; refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g., epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, cancer of the urinary tract, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, melanoma, multiple myeloma and B-cell lymphoma, brain, as well as head and neck cancer, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) and associated metastases.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0271">The terms &#x201c;cell proliferative disorder&#x201d; and &#x201c;proliferative disorder&#x201d; refer to disorders that are associated with some degree of abnormal cell proliferation. In one embodiment, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0272">&#x201c;Tumor,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0273">An antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule which &#x201c;induces cell death&#x201d; is one which causes a viable cell to become nonviable. The cell is one which is responsive to Hedgehog signaling, such as one that expresses Hhip1 and/or Ptch, preferably a cell that overexpresses Ptch polypeptide as compared to a normal cell of the same tissue type. Preferably, the cell is a cancer cell, e.g., a basal cell, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, stomach, endometrial, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, thyroid, or bladder cell. Cell death in vitro may be determined in the absence of complement and immune effector cells to distinguish cell death induced by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Thus, the assay for cell death may be performed using heat inactivated serum (i.e., in the absence of complement) and in the absence of immune effector cells. To determine whether the antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule is able to induce cell death, loss of membrane integrity as evaluated by uptake of propidium iodide (PI), trypan blue (see Moore et al. (1995) <i>Cytotechnology </i>17:1-11) or 7AAD can be assessed relative to untreated cells. Preferred cell death-inducing antibodies, oligopeptides or other organic molecules are those which induce PI uptake in the PI uptake assay in BT474 cells.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0274">A &#x201c;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>-expressing cell&#x201d; is a cell which expresses an endogenous or transfected Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide either on the cell surface or in a secreted form. A &#x201c;Hedgehog-responsive cancer&#x201d; is a cancer comprising cells that have a Hhip1 polypeptide and/or Ptch polypeptide present on the cell surface. A &#x201c;Hedgehog-responsive cancer&#x201d; produces sufficient levels Hh receptor polypeptides on the surface of cells thereof, such that an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody (e.g., an antibody that binds to an L2 loop of Hhip1 and Ptch and inhibit Hh binding), an oligopeptide or other organic molecule can bind thereto and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0275">As used herein, the term &#x201c;immunoadhesin&#x201d; designates antibody-like molecules which combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein (an &#x201c;adhesin&#x201d;) with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d;), and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the immunoadhesin may be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-1 and IgA-2), IgE, IgD or IgM.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0276">The word &#x201c;label&#x201d; when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition which is conjugated directly or indirectly to the antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule so as to generate a &#x201c;labeled&#x201d; antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule. The label may be detectable by itself (e.g. radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0277">The term &#x201c;cytotoxic agent&#x201d; as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells.

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">II. Compositions and Methods of the Invention</heading>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">A. Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>Polypeptides</heading>
<p id="p-0280" num="0288">In some embodiments of the invention, the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides are isolated polypeptides having an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NO:83, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:13, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15, and SEQ ID NO:16. In other embodiments, the invention provides Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>-derived polypeptides, such as the individual domains having the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:9 and SEQ ID NO:10.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0289">Nucleic acid sequences encoding these polypeptides may be cloned into appropriate expression vectors and transfected into appropriate host cells. Expressed polypeptides may be isolated using a variety of methods known in that art and described herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">B. Anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>Antibodies</heading>
<p id="p-0282" num="0290">In one embodiment, the present invention provides anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies which may find use herein as therapeutic and/or diagnostic agents. In some embodiments, the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies are produced by immunizing animals with Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides and such antibodies specifically bind to epitopes on native Hhip1 that could not be elicited through immunization with native Hhip1 protein (containing the putative Frizzled domain). In a specific example, the antibodies include antibodies against the L2 Loop of Hhip1 and anti-idiotypic antibodies thereof. Exemplary antibodies include polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, bispecific, anti-idiotypic and heteroconjugate antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0291">1. Polyclonal Antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0292">Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen (especially when synthetic peptides are used) to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized. For example, the antigen can be conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor, using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, e.g., maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl<sub>2</sub>, or R<sup>1</sup>N&#x2550;C&#x2550;NR, where R and R<sup>1 </sup>are different alkyl groups.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0293">Animals are immunized against the antigen, immunogenic conjugates, or derivatives by combining, e.g., 100 &#x3bc;g or 5 &#x3bc;g of the protein or conjugate (for rabbits or mice, respectively) with 3 volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later, the animals are boosted with &#x2155; to 1/10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later, the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0294">2. Monoclonal Antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0295">Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) <i>Nature, </i>256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0296">In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized as described above to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization, lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, M<smallcaps>ONOCLONAL </smallcaps>A<smallcaps>NTIBODIES</smallcaps>: P<smallcaps>RINCIPLES AND </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>RACTICE</smallcaps>, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)).</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0297">The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium which medium preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells (also referred to as fusion partner). For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0298">Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 and derivatives e.g., X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, Va., USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor (1984) <i>J. Immunol. </i>133:3001); and Brodeur et al., M<smallcaps>ONOCLONAL </smallcaps>A<smallcaps>NTIBODY </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>RODUCTION </smallcaps>T<smallcaps>ECHNIQUES AND </smallcaps>A<smallcaps>PPLICATIONS</smallcaps>, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0299">Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0300">The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al., (1980) <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>107:220.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0301">Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: P<smallcaps>RINCIPLES AND </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>RACTICE</smallcaps>, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g., by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0302">The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A or protein G Sepharose&#xae;) or ion-exchange chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0303">DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as <i>E. coli </i>cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., (1993) <i>Curr. Opinion in Immunol. </i>5:256-262 (1993) and Pl&#xfc;ckthun (1992) <i>Immunol. Revs. </i>130:151-188.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0304">In a further embodiment, monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. (1990) <i>Nature </i>348:552-554. Clackson et al. (1991) <i>Nature </i>352:624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>222:581-597 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al. (1992) <i>Bio/Technology </i>10:779-783), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al. (1993) <i>Nuc. Acids. Res. </i>21:2265-2266). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0305">The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or fusion antibody polypeptides, for example, by substituting human heavy chain and light chain constant domain (CH and CL) sequences for the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison, et al. (1984) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>81:6851), or by fusing the immunoglobulin coding sequence with all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide (heterologous polypeptide). The non-immunoglobulin polypeptide sequences can substitute for the constant domains of an antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0306">3. Human and Humanized Antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0307">The anti-Hhip1 antibodies of the invention may further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin (Jones et al. (1986) <i>Nature </i>321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) <i>Nature </i>332:323-329; and Presta (1992) <i>Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. </i>2:593-596).</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0308">Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as &#x201c;import&#x201d; residues, which are typically taken from an &#x201c;import&#x201d; variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al. (1986) <i>Nature </i>321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) <i>Nature </i>332:323-329; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) <i>Science </i>239:1534-1536), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0309">The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity and HAMA response (human anti-mouse antibody) when the antibody is intended for human therapeutic use. According to the so-called &#x201c;best-fit&#x201d; method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human V domain sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is identified and the human framework region (FR) within it accepted for the humanized antibody (Sims et al. (1993) <i>J. Immunol. </i>151:2296; Chothia et al. (1987) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>196:901). Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., (1992) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>89:4285; Presta et al. (1993) <i>J. Immunol. </i>151:2623).</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0310">It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high binding affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0311">Various forms of a humanized antibodies are contemplated. For example, the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as a Fab, which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent(s) in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively, the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody, such as an intact IgG1 antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0312">As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:2551; Jakobovits et al. (1993) <i>Nature </i>362:255-258; Bruggemann et al. (1993) <i>Year in Immuno. </i>7:33; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,806, 5,569,825, 5,591,669 (all of GenPharm); 5,545,807; and WO 97/17852.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0313">Alternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty et al. (1990) <i>Nature </i>348:552-553) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats, reviewed in, e.g., Johnson, K. S., et al. (1993) <i>Current Opinion in Structural Biology </i>3:564-571. Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. (1991) <i>Nature </i>352:624-628 isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. (1991) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>222:581-597, or Griffith et al. (1993) <i>EMBO J. </i>12:725-734. See, also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0314">As discussed above, human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275).</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0315">4. Antibody Fragments</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0316">In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0317">Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al. (1992) <i>J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods </i>24:107-117; and Brennan et al. (1985) <i>Science </i>229:81). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from <i>E. coli</i>, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab&#x2032;-SH fragments can be directly recovered from <i>E. coli </i>and chemically coupled to form F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments (Carter et al., (1992) <i>Bio/Technology </i>10:163-167). According to another approach, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment with increased in vivo half-life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,894; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv (See A<smallcaps>NTIBODY </smallcaps>E<smallcaps>NGINEERING</smallcaps>, ed. Borrebaeck, supra). The antibody fragment may also be a &#x201c;linear antibody&#x201d;, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0318">5. Bispecific Antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0319">Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide as described herein. Other such antibodies may combine a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>binding site with a binding site for another protein. Alternatively, a target-specific arm (e.g., an L2-specific arm) may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g., CD3), or Fc receptors for IgG (Fc&#x3b3;R), such as Fc&#x3b3;RI (CD64), Fc&#x3b3;RII (CD32) and Fc&#x3b3;RIII (CD16), so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the Hip- or Ptch-expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express Hhip1 and/or Ptch. These antibodies possess a Hip- or Ptch-binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent (e.g., saporin, anti-interferon-&#x3b1;, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten). Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>bispecific antibodies).</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0320">WO 96/16673 describes a bispecific anti-ErbB2/anti-Fc&#x3b3;RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,234 discloses a bispecific anti-ErbB2/anti-Fc&#x3b3;RI antibody. A bispecific anti-ErbB2/Fc&#x3b1; antibody is shown in WO98/02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 teaches a bispecific anti-ErbB2/anti-CD3 antibody. Thus, methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et al. (1983) <i>Nature </i>305:537-539). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, and in Traunecker et al. (1991) <i>EMBO J. </i>10:3655-3659.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0321">According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably, the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light chain bonding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant affect on the yield of the desired chain combination.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0322">In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al. (1986) <i>Meth. Enzymol. </i>121:210.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0323">According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g., tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory &#x201c;cavities&#x201d; of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g., alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0324">Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or &#x201c;heteroconjugate&#x201d; antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360, WO 92/200373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0325">Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. (1985) <i>Science </i>229:81 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent, sodium arsenite, to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab&#x2032; fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab&#x2032;-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab&#x2032;-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab&#x2032;-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0326">Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab&#x2032;-SH fragments from <i>E. coli</i>, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. (1992) <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>175: 217-225 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>molecule. Each Fab&#x2032; fragment was separately secreted from <i>E. coli </i>and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0327">Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers (Kostelny et al. (1992) <i>J. Immunol. </i>148(5):1547-1553). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab&#x2032; portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The &#x201c;diabody&#x201d; technology described by Hollinger et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:6444-6448 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a VH connected to a VL by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. (1994) <i>J. Immunol. </i>152:5368.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0328">Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. (1991) <i>J. Immunol. </i>147:60.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0329">6. Heteroconjugate Antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0330">Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360; WO 92/200373; EP 03089). It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0331">7. Multivalent Antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0332">A multivalent antibody may be internalized (and/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more antigen binding sites (e.g., tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises (or consists of) an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises (or consists of) three to about eight, but preferably four, antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain (and preferably two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or more variable domains. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X1)n-VD2-(X2)n-Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region chain; or VH-CH1-VH-CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two (and preferably four) light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0333">8. Effector Function Engineering</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0334">It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, e.g., so as to enhance antigen-dependent cell-mediated cyotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See Caron et al. (1992) <i>J. Exp Med. </i>176:1191-1195 and Shopes, B. J. (1992) <i>Immunol. </i>148:2918-2922. Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al. (1993) <i>Cancer Res. </i>53:2560-2565. Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. (1989) <i>Anti</i>-<i>Cancer Drug Design </i>3:219-230.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0335">To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term &#x201c;salvage receptor binding epitope&#x201d; refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0336">9. Immunoconjugates</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0337">The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a growth inhibitory agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate)</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0338">Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, <i>Aleurites fordii </i>proteins, dianthin proteins, <i>Phytolaca americana </i>proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), <i>momordica charantia </i>inhibitor, curcin, crotin, <i>sapaonaria officinalis </i>inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include 212Bi, 131I, 131In, 90Y, and 186Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. (1987) <i>Science </i>238:1098. Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody (See WO 94/11026).</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0339">Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoids, a trichothene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity, are also contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0340">i. Maytansine and Maytansinoids</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0341">In one preferred embodiment, an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody (full length or fragments) of the invention is conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0342">Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub Maytenus serrata (U.S. Pat. No. 3,896,111). Subsequently, it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids, such as maytansinol and C-3 maytansinol esters (U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,042). Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,248,870; 4,256,746; 4,260,608; 4,265,814; 4,294,757; 4,307,016; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,313,946; 4,315,929; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; 4,331,598; 4,361,650; 4,364,866; 4,424,219; 4,450,254; 4,362,663; and 4,371,533, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0343">In an attempt to improve their therapeutic index, maytansine and maytansinoids have been conjugated to antibodies specifically binding to tumor cell antigens. Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids and their therapeutic use are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020, 5,416,064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. (1996) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>93:8618-8623 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells, and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. (1992) <i>Cancer Res. </i>52:127-131 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines, or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER-2/neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1-maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, which expresses 3&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>HER-2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansonid drug, which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7-maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0344">Anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody-maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. An average of 3-4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody, although even one molecule of toxin/antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule, such as various maytansinol esters.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0345">There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, including, for example, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 or EP Patent 0425235B1, Chari et al. (1992) <i>Cancer Res. </i>52:127-131, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/960,602, filed Oct. 8, 2004, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/960,602, filed Oct. 8, 2004. The linking groups include disulfide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase labile groups, as disclosed in the above-identified patents, disulfide and thioether groups being preferred. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0346">Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). Particularly preferred coupling agents include N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) (Carlsson et al. (1978) <i>Biochem. J. </i>173:723-737) and N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridylthio)-pentanoate (SPP) to provide for a disulfide linkage.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0347">The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions, depending on the type of the link. For example, an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hyrdoxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a hydroxyl group, and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment, the linkage is formed at the C-3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0348">ii. Auristatins and Dolostatins</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0349">In some embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to dolastatins or dolostatin peptidic analogs and derivatives, the auristatins (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,635,483; 5,780,588). Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics, GTP hydrolysis, and nuclear and cellular division (Woyke et al (2001) <i>Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. </i>45(12):3580-3584) and have anticancer (U.S. Pat. No. 5,663,149) and antifungal activity (Pettit et al. (1998) <i>Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. </i>42:2961-2965). The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N (amino) terminus or the C (carboxyl) terminus of the peptidic drug moiety (WO 02/088172).</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0350">Exemplary auristatin embodiments include the N-terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF (i.e., MMAE and MMAF), disclosed in &#x201c;Senter et al., <i>Proceedings of the American Association for Cancer Research</i>, Volume 45, Abstract Number 623, presented Mar. 28, 2004, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0351">Typically, peptide-based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and/or peptide fragments.

<p id="p-0344" num="0352">iii. Calicheamicin</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0353">Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,712,374; 5,714,586; 5,739,116; 5,767,285; 5,770,701; 5,770,710; 5,773,001; 5,877,296 (all to American Cyanamid Company). Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, &#x3b3;1I, &#x3b1;2I, &#x3b1;3I, N-acetyl-&#x3b3;1I, PSAG and &#x3b8;I1 (Hinman et al. (1993) <i>Cancer Res. </i>53:3336-3342; Lode et al. (1998) <i>Cancer Res. </i>58:2925-2928 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid). Another anti-tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore, cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.</p>

Nos. 5,053,394; 5,770,710, as well as esperamicins (U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,296).</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0356">Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, <i>Aleurites fordii </i>proteins, dianthin proteins, <i>Phytolaca americana </i>proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), <i>momordica charantia </i>inhibitor, curcin, crotin, <i>sapaonaria officinalis </i>inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecene (See, for example, WO 93/21232 published Oct. 28, 1993).</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0357">The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity (e.g., a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease; DNase).</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0358">For selective destruction of the tumor, the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies. Examples include <sup>211</sup>At, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>90</sup>Y, <sup>186</sup>Re, <sup>188</sup>Re, <sup>153</sup>Sm, <sup>212</sup>Bi, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>212</sup>Pb, and radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for diagnosis, it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies, for example tc99m or <sup>123</sup>I, or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (also known as magnetic resonance imaging, mri), such as iodine-123 again, iodine-131, indium-111, fluorine-19, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, oxygen-17, gadolinium, manganese or iron.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0359">The radio- or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example, the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving, for example, fluorine-19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tc99m or <sup>123</sup>I, <sup>186</sup>Re, <sup>188</sup>Re and <sup>111</sup>In can be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium-90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method (Fraker et al. (1978) <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>80:49-57 can be used to incorporate iodine-123.

<p id="p-0352" num="0360">Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. (1987) <i>Science </i>238:1098. Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026. The linker may be a &#x201c;cleavable linker&#x201d; facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al. (1992) <i>Cancer Res. </i>52:127-131; U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020) may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0361">The compounds of the invention expressly contemplate, but are not limited to, ADC prepared with cross-linker reagents: BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone) benzoate) which are commercially available (e.g., from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill., U.S.A, see pages 467-498 of the 2003-2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog).</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0362">Alternatively, a fusion protein comprising the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0363">In yet another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a &#x201c;receptor&#x201d; (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a &#x201c;ligand&#x201d; (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0364">10. Immunoliposomes</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0365">The anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A &#x201c;liposome&#x201d; is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids and/or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al. (1985) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>82:3688; Hwang et al. (1980) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>77:4030; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and WO 97/38731 published Oct. 23, 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0366">Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab&#x2032; fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. (1982) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>257:286-288 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome (See Gabizon et al. (1989) <i>J. National Cancer Inst. </i>81(19):1484).</p>

<p id="p-0359" num="0367">Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oligopeptides of the present invention are oligopeptides that bind, preferably specifically, to a Hhip1 polypeptide. Hhip1 binding oligopeptides may be chemically synthesized using known oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using recombinant technology. Hhip1 binding oligopeptides are usually at least about 5 amino acids in length, alternatively at least about 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100 amino acids in length or more, wherein such oligopeptides that are capable of binding, preferably specifically, to a Hhip1 polypeptide. Certain Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oliopeptides are described in detail herein. Other Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oligopeptides may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this regard, it is noted that techniques for screening oligopeptide libraries for oligopeptides that are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,556,762; 5,750,373; 4,708,871; 4,833,092; 5,223,409; 5,403,484; 5,571,689; 5,663,143; PCT Publication Nos. WO 84/03506 and WO 84/03564; Geysen et al. (1984) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

<p id="p-0360" num="0368">In this regard, bacteriophage (phage) display is one well known technique which allows one to screen large oligopeptide libraries to identify member(s) of those libraries which are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target. Phage display is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to the coat protein on the surface of bacteriophage particles (Scott, J. K. and Smith, G. P. (1990) <i>Science </i>249:386). The utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of selectively randomized protein variants (or randomly cloned cDNAs) can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Display of peptide (Cwirla, S. E. et al. (1990) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>87:6378) or protein (Lowman, H. B. et al. (1991) <i>Biochemistry </i>30:10832; Clackson, T. et al. (1991) <i>Nature, </i>352:624; Marks, J. D. et al. (1991), <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>222:581; Kang, A. S. et al. (1991) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>88:8363) libraries on phage have been used for screening millions of polypeptides or oligopeptides for ones with specific binding properties (Smith, G. P. (1991) <i>Current Opin. Biotechnol. </i>2:668). Sorting phage libraries of random mutants requires a strategy for constructing and propagating a large number of variants, a procedure for affinity purification using the target receptor, and a means of evaluating the results of binding enrichments. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,223,409; 5,403,484; 5,571,689; and 5,663,143.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0369">Although most phage display methods have used filamentous phage, lambdoid phage display systems (WO 95/34683; U.S. Pat. No. 5,627,024), T4 phage display systems (Ren et al. (1998) <i>Gene </i>215:439; Zhu et al. (1998) <i>Cancer Res. </i>58(15):3209-3214; Jiang et al. (1997) <i>Inf. Immun. </i>65(11):4770-4777; Ren et al. (1997) <i>Gene </i>195(2):303-311; Ren (1996) <i>Protein Sci. </i>5:1833; Efimov et al. (1995) <i>Virus Genes </i>10:173) and T7 phage display systems (Smith and Scott (1993) <i>Meth. Enzymol. </i>217:228-257; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,905) are also known.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0370">Many other improvements and variations of the basic phage display concept have now been developed. These improvements enhance the ability of display systems to screen peptide libraries for binding to selected target molecules and to display functional proteins with the potential of screening these proteins for desired properties. Combinatorial reaction devices for phage display reactions have been developed (WO 98/14277) and phage display libraries have been used to analyze and control bimolecular interactions (WO 98/20169; WO 98/20159) and properties of constrained helical peptides (WO 98/20036). WO 97/35196 describes a method of isolating an affinity ligand in which a phage display library is contacted with one solution in which the ligand will bind to a target molecule and a second solution in which the affinity ligand will not bind to the target molecule, to selectively isolate binding ligands. WO 97/46251 describes a method of biopanning a random phage display library with an affinity purified antibody and then isolating binding phage, followed by a micropanning process using microplate wells to isolate high affinity binding phage. The use of <i>Staphlylococcus aureus </i>protein A as an affinity tag has also been reported (Li et al. (1998) <i>Mol. Biotech. </i>9:187). WO 97/47314 describes the use of substrate subtraction libraries to distinguish enzyme specificities using a combinatorial library which may be a phage display library. A method for selecting enzymes suitable for use in detergents using phage display is described in WO 97/09446. Additional methods of selecting specific binding proteins are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,498,538; 5,432,018; and WO 98/15833.</p>

<p id="p-0364" num="0372">In certain embodiments, the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>binding oligopeptides bind to the L2 Loop of Hhip1 and as such are Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>L2 Loop binding oligopeptides. These peptides bind to the L2 Loop of Hhip1 and/or Ptch due to the conserved nature of the L2 Loop motif of Hhip1. In some embodiments, the oligopeptides interfere with Hh binding to Hhip1 and/or Ptch and prevent Hh signaling. In other embodiments, the oligopeptides themselves may bind to Hhip1 and/or Ptch and thereby drive Hh signaling by mimicking Hh binding to Ptch.</p>

<p id="p-0381" num="0389">While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory of operability, the oligopeptides of the invention are designed to mimic the L2 loop of Hhip1 and/or Ptch, and therefore, interact with Hedgehog. The oligopeptides of the invention are useful for binding to Hedgehog and thereby inhibiting binding of Hedgehog to Ptch and Hhip1 receptors on the surface of cells, such as cancer cells. Thus, inhibiting or halting the growth of Hedgehog-responsive cells (e.g., cancer cells).</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0390">The peptides of the invention are also useful as antigens in the generation of L2 loop-specific antibodies. Such antibodies may bind native Hhip1 and/or Ptch and prevent binding of Hedgehog to these receptors (without stimulating the receptors themselves) and inhibit of halt growth of Hedgehog-responsive cells (e.g., cancer cells). In addition anti-idiotypic antibodies against anti-L2 Loop antibodies may be made which mimic the Hhip1 or Ptch L2 Loop and therefore would bind Hedgehog. Such antibodies are also useful in preventing binding of Hedgehog to Ptch or Hhip1 and inhibit of halt growth of Hedgehog-responsive cells. These antibodies are useful in treating Hedgehog related cancers.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0391">Alternatively, in some embodiments, anti-L2-specific antibodies are useful as agonists of Hedgehog signaling and may be useful as Hedgehog agonists in such applications as, for example, regulation of growth of neural tissues, bone and cartilage formation and repair, regulation of spermatogenesis, regulation of smooth muscle, regulation of lung, liver and other organs arising from the primitive gut, regulation of hematopoietic function, regulation of skin and hair growth.</p>

Hhip1 binding organic molecules are usually less than about 2000 daltons in size, alternatively less than about 1500, 750, 500, 250 or 200 daltons in size, wherein such organic molecules that are capable of binding, preferably specifically, to a Hhip1 polypeptide as described herein may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this regard, it is noted that techniques for screening organic molecule libraries for molecules that are capable of binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art (see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos.

<p id="p-0388" num="0396">Techniques for generating antibodies, oligopeptides and organic molecules that bind to Hhip1 polypeptides have been described above. One may further select antibodies, oligopeptides or other organic molecules with certain biological characteristics, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0397">The growth inhibitory effects of an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule of the invention may be assessed by methods known in the art, e.g., using cells which express a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide either endogenously or following transfection with the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>gene. For example, appropriate tumor cell lines and Hip-transfected cells may treated with an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>monoclonal antibody, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oligopeptide or other Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>organic molecule of the invention at various concentrations for a few days (e.g., 2-7) days and stained with crystal violet or MTT or analyzed by some other colorimetric assay. Another method of measuring proliferation would be by comparing <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine uptake by the cells treated in the presence or absence an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oligopeptide or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>organic molecule of the invention. After treatment, the cells are harvested and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the DNA quantitated in a scintillation counter. Appropriate positive controls include treatment of a selected cell line with a growth inhibitory antibody known to inhibit growth of that cell line. Growth inhibition of tumor cells in vivo can be determined in various ways known in the art. Preferably, the tumor cell is one that overexpresses a Hhip1 polypeptide. Preferably, the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oligopeptide or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>organic molecule will inhibit cell proliferation of a Hip-expressing tumor cell in vitro or in vivo by about 25-100% compared to the untreated tumor cell, more preferably, by about 30-100%, and even more preferably by about 50-100% or 70-100%, in one embodiment, at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 &#x3bc;g/ml. Growth inhibition can be measured at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 &#x3bc;g/ml or about 0.5 nM to 200 nM in cell culture, where the growth inhibition is determined 1-10 days after exposure of the tumor cells to the antibody. The antibody is growth inhibitory in vivo if administration of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody at about 1 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 100 mg/kg body weight results in reduction in tumor size or reduction of tumor cell proliferation within about 5 days to 3 months from the first administration of the antibody, preferably within about 5 to 30 days.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0398">To select for an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oligopeptide or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>organic molecule which induces cell death, loss of membrane integrity as indicated by, e.g., propidium iodide (PI), trypan blue or 7AAD uptake may be assessed relative to control. A PI uptake assay can be performed in the absence of complement and immune effector cells. Hhip1 polypeptide-expressing tumor cells are incubated with medium alone or medium containing the appropriate anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody (e.g, at about 10 &#x3bc;g/ml), Hhip1 binding oligopeptide or Hhip1 binding organic molecule. The cells are incubated for a 3 day time period. Following each treatment, cells are washed and aliquoted into 35 mm strainer-capped 12&#xd7;75 tubes (1 ml per tube, 3 tubes per treatment group) for removal of cell clumps. Tubes then receive PI (10 &#x3bc;g/ml). Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN&#xae; flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT&#xae; CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Those anti-Hhip1 antibodies, Hhip1 binding oligopeptides or Hhip1 binding organic molecules that induce statistically significant levels of cell death as determined by PI uptake may be selected as cell death-inducing anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oligopeptides or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>organic molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0399">To screen for antibodies, oligopeptides or other organic molecules which bind to an epitope on a Hhip1 polypeptide bound by an antibody of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in A<smallcaps>NTIBODIES</smallcaps>, A L<smallcaps>ABORATORY </smallcaps>M<smallcaps>ANUAL</smallcaps>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. This assay can be used to determine if a test antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule binds the same site or epitope as a known anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody. Alternatively, or additionally, epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art. For example, the antibody sequence can be mutagenized such as by alanine scanning, to identify contact residues. The mutant antibody is initially tested for binding with polyclonal antibody to ensure proper folding. In a different method, peptides corresponding to different regions of a Hhip1 polypeptide can be used in competition assays with the test antibodies or with a test antibody and an antibody with a characterized or known epitope.</p>

Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as &#x201c;abzymes&#x201d;, can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs (see, e.g., Massey (1987) <i>Nature </i>328:457-458). Antibody-abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0403">The enzymes of this invention can be covalently bound to the anti-Hhip1 antibodies by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Alternatively, fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art (see, e.g., Neuberger et al.

<p id="p-0396" num="0404">The present invention also provides newly identified and isolated nucleotide sequences encoding polypeptides referred to in the present application as Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides. In particular, cDNAs (partial and full-length) encoding various Hhip1 polypeptides are encompassed by the invention. The nucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptides of the invention may be determined with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which shows an alignment of the nucleic acid sequence encoding Hhip1 and the deduced amino acid sequence. Further, SEQ ID NO:83 shows the amino acid sequence of full-length Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>and SEQ ID NO:52 shows the cDNA sequence of human Hhip1. The smaller fragments of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>may be encoded by any polynucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence, but the specific example of the nucleic acid sequence provides one of skill in the art with at least one reference sequence.</p>

<p id="p-0397" num="0405">In addition to the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies and full-length sequence Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>and other Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides described herein, it is contemplated that anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide variants can be prepared. Anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody and Hhip1 polypeptide variants can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the encoding DNA, and/or by synthesis of the desired antibody or polypeptide. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that amino acid changes may alter post-translational processes of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites or altering the membrane anchoring characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0406">Variations in the anti-Hhip1 antibodies and Hhip1 polypeptides described herein, can be made, for example, using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non-conservative mutations set forth, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,934. Variations may be a substitution, deletion or insertion of one or more codons encoding the antibody or polypeptide that results in a change in the amino acid sequence as compared with the native sequence antibody or polypeptide. Optionally the variation is by substitution of at least one amino acid with any other amino acid in one or more of the domains of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide. Guidance in determining which amino acid residue may be inserted, substituted or deleted without adversely affecting the desired activity may be found by comparing the sequence of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide with that of homologous known protein molecules and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology. Amino acid substitutions can be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties, such as the replacement of a leucine with a serine, i.e., conservative amino acid replacements. Insertions or deletions may optionally be in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids. The variation allowed may be determined by systematically making insertions, deletions or substitutions of amino acids in the sequence and testing the resulting variants for activity exhibited by the full-length or mature native sequence.</p>

Certain fragments lack amino acid residues that are not essential for a desired biological activity of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0408">Anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide fragments may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. Desired peptide fragments may be chemically synthesized. An alternative approach involves generating antibody or polypeptide fragments by enzymatic digestion, e.g., by treating the protein with an enzyme known to cleave proteins at sites defined by particular amino acid residues, or by digesting the DNA with suitable restriction enzymes and isolating the desired fragment. Yet another suitable technique involves isolating and amplifying a DNA fragment encoding a desired antibody or polypeptide fragment, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed at the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; primers in the PCR.

<p id="p-0403" num="0411">Substantial modifications in function or immunological identity of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0412">(1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0413">(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr; Asn; Gln</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0414">(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0415">(4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0416">(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0417">(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0418">Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or, more preferably, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0419">The variations can be made using methods known in the art such as oligonucleotide-mediated (site-directed) mutagenesis, alanine scanning, and PCR mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis (Carter et al., (1986) <i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>13:4331; Zoller et al. (1987) <i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>10:6487), cassette mutagenesis (Wells et al. (1985) <i>Gene </i>34:315), restriction selection mutagenesis (Wells et al. (1986) <i>Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London SerA </i>317:415) or other known techniques can be performed on the cloned DNA to produce the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide variant DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0420">Scanning amino acid analysis can also be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small, neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include alanine, glycine, serine, and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side-chain beyond the beta-carbon and is less likely to alter the main-chain conformation of the variant (Cunningham and Wells (1989) <i>Science </i>244:1081-1085). Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further, it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions (Creighton, T<smallcaps>HE </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>ROTEINS</smallcaps>, W.H. Freeman &#x26; Co., N.Y.); Chothia (1976) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>150:1). If alanine substitution does not yield adequate amounts of variant, an isoteric amino acid can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0421">Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment).</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0422">A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g., a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g., 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g., binding affinity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and human Hhip1 polypeptide. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.</p>

These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody.</p>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">I. Modifications of Anti-Hhip1 Antibodies and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>Polypeptide</heading>
<p id="p-0416" num="0424">Covalent modifications of anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides are included within the scope of this invention. One type of covalent modification includes reacting targeted amino acid residues of an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide. Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful, for instance, for crosslinking anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide to a water-insoluble support matrix or surface for use in the method for purifying anti-Hhip1 antibodies, and vice-versa. Commonly used crosslinking agents include, e.g., 1,1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, for example, esters with 4-azidosalicylic acid, homobifunctional imidoesters, including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3&#x2032;-dithiobis (succinimidylpropionate), bifunctional maleimides such as bis-N-maleimido-1,8-octane and agents such as methyl-3-[(p-azidophenyl)dithio]propioimidate.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0425">Other modifications include deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively, hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the &#x3b1;-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, P<smallcaps>ROTEINS</smallcaps>: S<smallcaps>TRUCTURE AND </smallcaps>M<smallcaps>OLECULAR </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>ROPERTIES</smallcaps>, W.H. Freeman &#x26; Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86, 1983), acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and amidation of any C-terminal carboxyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0426">Another type of covalent modification of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide included within the scope of this invention comprises altering the native glycosylation pattern of the antibody or polypeptide. &#x201c;Altering the native glycosylation pattern&#x201d; is intended for purposes herein to mean deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in native sequence anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide (either by removing the underlying glycosylation site or by deleting the glycosylation by chemical and/or enzymatic means), and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the native sequence anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide. In addition, the phrase includes qualitative changes in the glycosylation of the native proteins, involving a change in the nature and proportions of the various carbohydrate moieties present.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0427">Glycosylation of antibodies and other polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0428">Addition of glycosylation sites to the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide (for O-linked glycosylation sites). The anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide amino acid sequence may optionally be altered through changes at the DNA level, particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide at preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0429">Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the polypeptide. Such methods are described in the art, e.g., in WO 87/05330 published 11 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC C<smallcaps>RIT</smallcaps>. R<smallcaps>EV</smallcaps>. B<smallcaps>IOCHEM</smallcaps>., pp. 259-306, 1981.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0430">Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically or by mutational substitution of codons encoding for amino acid residues that serve as targets for glycosylation. Chemical deglycosylation techniques are known in the art and described, for instance, by Hakimuddin, et al. (1987) <i>Arch. Biochem. Biophys. </i>259:52 and by Edge et al. (1981) <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>118:131. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al. (1987) <i>Meth. Enzymol. </i>138:350.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0431">Another type of covalent modification of anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide comprises linking the antibody or polypeptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192 or 4,179,337. The antibody or polypeptide also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization (for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively), in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in R<smallcaps>EMINGTON'S </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>HARMACEUTICAL </smallcaps>S<smallcaps>CIENCES, </smallcaps>16<smallcaps>TH EDITION</smallcaps>, Oslo, A., Ed., 1980.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0432">The anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide of the present invention may also be modified in a way to form chimeric molecules comprising an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide fused to another, heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0433">In one embodiment, such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide with a tag polypeptide which provides an epitope to which an anti-tag antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino- or carboxyl-terminus of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide. The presence of such epitope-tagged forms of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide can be detected using an antibody against the tag polypeptide. Also, provision of the epitope tag enables the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide to be readily purified by affinity purification using an anti-tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that binds to the epitope tag. Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art. Examples include poly-histidine (poly-his) or poly-histidine-glycine (poly-his-gly) tags; the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 (Field et al. (1988) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>8:2159-2165); the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto (Evan et al., (1985) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>5:3610-3616); and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody (Paborsky et al. (1990) <i>Pro. Engineer. </i>3(6):547-553). Other tag polypeptides include the Flag-peptide (Hopp et al. (1988) <i>BioTechnology </i>6:1204-1210); the KT3 epitope peptide (Martin et al. (1992) <i>Science </i>255:192-194); an &#x3b1;-tubulin epitope peptide (Skinner et al. (1991) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>266:15163-15166); and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag (Lutz-Freyermuth et al. (1990) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>87:6393-6397).</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0434">In an alternative embodiment, the chimeric molecule may comprise a fusion of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin. For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule (also referred to as an &#x201c;immunoadhesin&#x201d;), such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a soluble (transmembrane domain deleted or inactivated) form of an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide in place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge, CH2 and CH3, or the hinge, CH1, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgG1 molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin fusions see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,428,130 issued Jun. 27, 1995.</p>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">J. Preparation of Anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>Antibodies and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>Polypeptides</heading>
<p id="p-0427" num="0435">The description below relates primarily to production of anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies and Hhip1 polypeptides by culturing cells transformed or transfected with a vector containing anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody- and Hhip1 polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid. It is, of course, contemplated that alternative methods, which are well known in the art, may be employed to prepare anti-Hhip1 antibodies and Hhip1 polypeptides. For instance, the appropriate amino acid sequence, or portions thereof, may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques (see, e.g., Stewart et al., S<smallcaps>OLID</smallcaps>-P<smallcaps>HASE </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>EPTIDE </smallcaps>S<smallcaps>YNTHESIS</smallcaps>, W.H. Freeman Co., San Francisco, Calif. (1969); Merrifield, (1963) <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>85:2149-2154). In vitro protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be accomplished, for instance, using an Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer (Foster City, Calif.) using manufacturer's instructions. Various portions of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical or enzymatic methods to produce the desired anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0436">1. Isolation of DNA Encoding Anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>Antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>Polypeptide</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0437">DNA encoding anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue believed to possess the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide mRNA and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly, human anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide DNA can be conveniently obtained from a cDNA library prepared from human tissue. The anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody- or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide-encoding gene may also be obtained from a genomic library or by known synthetic procedures (e.g., automated nucleic acid synthesis).</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0438">Libraries can be screened with probes (such as oligonucleotides of at least about 20-80 bases) designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Screening the cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures, such as described in Sambrook et al., M<smallcaps>OLECULAR </smallcaps>C<smallcaps>LONING</smallcaps>: A L<smallcaps>ABORATORY </smallcaps>M<smallcaps>ANUAL</smallcaps>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY, 1989). An alternative means to isolate the gene encoding anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide is to use PCR methodology (Sambrook et al., supra; Dieffenbach et al., PCR P<smallcaps>RIMER</smallcaps>: A L<smallcaps>ABORATORY </smallcaps>M<smallcaps>ANUAL</smallcaps>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY, 1995).</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0439">Techniques for screening a cDNA library are well known in the art. The oligonucleotide sequences selected as probes should be of sufficient length and sufficiently unambiguous that false positives are minimized. The oligonucleotide is preferably labeled such that it can be detected upon hybridization to DNA in the library being screened. Methods of labeling are well known in the art, and include the use of radiolabels like <sup>32</sup>P-labeled ATP, biotinylation or enzyme labeling. Hybridization conditions, including moderate stringency and high stringency, are provided in Sambrook et al., supra.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0440">Sequences identified in such library screening methods can be compared and aligned to other known sequences deposited and available in public databases such as GenBank or other private sequence databases. Sequence identity (at either the amino acid or nucleotide level) within defined regions of the molecule or across the full-length sequence can be determined using methods known in the art and as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0441">Nucleic acid having protein coding sequence may be obtained by screening selected cDNA or genomic libraries using the deduced amino acid sequence disclosed herein for the first time, and, if necessary, using conventional primer extension procedures as described in Sambrook et al., supra, to detect precursors and processing intermediates of mRNA that may not have been reverse-transcribed into cDNA.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0442">2. Selection and Transformation of Host Cells</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0443">Host cells are transfected or transformed with expression or cloning vectors described herein for anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. The culture conditions, such as media, temperature, pH and the like, can be selected by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. In general, principles, protocols, and practical techniques for maximizing the productivity of cell cultures can be found in M<smallcaps>AMMALIAN </smallcaps>C<smallcaps>ELL </smallcaps>B<smallcaps>IOTECHNOLOGY</smallcaps>: A P<smallcaps>RACTICAL </smallcaps>A<smallcaps>PPROACH</smallcaps>, M. Butler, ed., IRL Press, 1991 and Sambrook et al., supra.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0444">Methods of eukaryotic cell transfection and prokaryotic cell transformation are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, CaPO<sub>4</sub>, liposome-mediated and electroporation. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is performed using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in Sambrook et al., supra, or electroporation is generally used for prokaryotes. Infection with <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </i>is used for transformation of certain plant cells, as described by Shaw et al., (1983) <i>Gene </i>23:315 and WO 89/05859 published Jun. 29, 1989. For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb (1978) <i>Virol. </i>52:456-457 can be employed. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transfections have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,216. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al., (1977) <i>J. Bacteriol. </i>130:946 (1977) and Hsiao et al. (1979) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>76:3829. However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells, such as by nuclear microinjection, electroporation, bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells, or polycations, e.g., polybrene, polyornithine, may also be used. For various techniques for transforming mammalian cells, see Keown et al. (1990) <i>Meth. Enzymol. </i>185:527-537 and Mansour et al. (1988) <i>Nature </i>336:348-352.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0445">Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells. Suitable prokaryotes include but are not limited to eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as <i>E. coli</i>. Various <i>E. coli </i>strains are publicly available, such as <i>E. coli </i>K12 strain MM294 (ATCC 31,446); <i>E. coli </i>X1776 (ATCC 31,537); <i>E. coli </i>strain W3110 (ATCC 27,325) and K5 772 (ATCC 53,635). Other suitable prokaryotic host cells include Enterobacteriaceae such as <i>Escherichia</i>, e.g., <i>E. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella</i>, e.g., <i>Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia</i>, e.g., <i>Serratia marcescans</i>, and <i>Shigella</i>, as well as Bacilli such as <i>B. subtilis </i>and <i>B. licheniformis </i>(e.g., <i>B. licheniformis </i>41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published Apr. 12, 1989), <i>Pseudomonas </i>such as <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Streptomyces</i>. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Strain W3110 is one particularly preferred host or parent host because it is a common host strain for recombinant DNA product fermentations. Preferably, the host cell secretes minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes. For example, strain W3110 may be modified to effect a genetic mutation in the genes encoding proteins endogenous to the host, with examples of such hosts including <i>E. coli </i>W3110 strain 1A2, which has the complete genotype tonA; <i>E. coli </i>W3110 strain 9E4, which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3; <i>E. coli </i>W3110 strain 27C7 (ATCC 55,244), which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 (argF-lac) 169 degP ompT kanr; <i>E. coli </i>W3110 strain 37D6, which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 (argF-lac) 169 degP ompT rbs7 ilvG kanr; <i>E. coli </i>W3110 strain 40B4, which is strain 37D6 with a non-kanamycin resistant degP deletion mutation; and an <i>E. coli </i>strain having mutant periplasmic protease disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,783 issued Aug. 7, 1990. Alternatively, in vitro methods of cloning, e.g., PCR or other nucleic acid polymerase reactions, are suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0446">Full length antibody, antibody fragments, and antibody fusion proteins can be produced in bacteria, in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed, such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a toxin) and the immunoconjugate by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full length antibodies have greater half life in circulation. Production in <i>E. coli </i>is faster and more cost efficient. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,237 (Carter et. al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,199 (Joly et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,523 (Simmons et al.) which describes translation initiation regio (TIR) and signal sequences for optimizing expression and secretion, these patents incorporated herein by reference. After expression, the antibody is isolated from the <i>E. coli </i>cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be purified through, e.g., a protein A or G column depending on the isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody expressed e.g., in CHO cells.</p>

<p id="p-0442" num="0450">Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0451">3. Selection and Use of a Replicable Vector</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0452">The nucleic acid (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) encoding anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide may be inserted into a replicable vector for cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may, for example, be in the form of a plasmid, cosmid, viral particle, or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general, DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site(s) using techniques known in the art. Vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are known to the skilled artisan.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0453">The Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which may be a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody- or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide-encoding DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence may be a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lpp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequence may be, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, alpha factor leader (including <i>Saccharomyces </i>and <i>Kluyveromyces </i>&#x3b1;-factor leaders, the latter described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,182), or acid phosphatase leader, the <i>C. albicans </i>glucoamylase leader (EP 362,179 published Apr. 4, 1990), or the signal described in WO 90/13646 published Nov. 15, 1990. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences may be used to direct secretion of the protein, such as signal sequences from secreted polypeptides of the same or related species, as well as viral secretory leaders.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0454">Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2&#x3bc; plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0455">Expression and cloning vectors will typically contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0456">An example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody- or Hhip1 polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid, such as DHFR or thymidine kinase. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity, prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub et al. (1980) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>77:4216. A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 (Stinchcomb et al. (1979) <i>Nature </i>282:39; Kingsman et al. (1979) <i>Gene </i>7:141; Tschemper et al. (1980) <i>Gene </i>10:157). The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1 (Jones, (1977) <i>Genetics </i>85:12).</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0457">Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter operably linked to the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody- or Hhip1 polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequence to direct mRNA synthesis. Promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the &#x3b2;-lactamase and lactose promoter systems (Chang et al. (1978) <i>Nature </i>275:615); Goeddel et al. (1979) <i>Nature </i>281:544), alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system (Goeddel (1980) <i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>8:4057; EP 36,776), and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter (deBoer et al. (1983) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>80:21-25). Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1 polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0458">Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Hitzeman et al. (1980) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>255:2073) or other glycolytic enzymes (Hess et al. (1968) <i>J. Adv. Enzyme Reg. </i>7:149; Holland, (1978) <i>Biochemistry </i>17:4900) such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0459">Other yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0460">Anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus (UK 2,211,504 published Jul. 5, 1989), adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, and from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0461">Transcription of a DNA encoding the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide by higher eukaryotes may be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA (usually about from 10 to 300 bp) that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, &#x3b1;-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; to the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide coding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5&#x2032; from the promoter.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0462">Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5&#x2032; and, occasionally 3&#x2032;, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0463">Still other methods, vectors, and host cells suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide in recombinant vertebrate cell culture are described in Gething et al. (1981) <i>Nature </i>293:620-625; Mantei et al. (1979) <i>Nature </i>281:40-46; EP 117,060; and EP 117,058.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0464">4. Culturing the Host Cells</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0465">The host cells used to produce the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al. (1979) <i>Meth. Enzymol. </i>58:44, Barnes et al. (1980) <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>102:255, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Pat. Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN&#x2122; drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0466">5. Detecting Gene Amplification/Expression</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0467">Gene amplification and/or expression may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by conventional Southern blotting, Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA (Thomas, (1980) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>77:5201-5205), dot blotting (DNA analysis), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe, based on the sequences provided herein. Alternatively, antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes, including DNA duplexes, RNA duplexes, and DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA-protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn may be labeled and the assay may be carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface, so that upon the formation of duplex on the surface, the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0468">Gene expression, alternatively, may be measured by immunological methods, such as immunohistochemical staining of cells or tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids, to quantitate directly the expression of gene product. Antibodies useful for immunohistochemical staining and/or assay of sample fluids may be either monoclonal or polyclonal, and may be prepared in any mammal Conveniently, the antibodies may be prepared against a sequence Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide or against a synthetic peptide based on the DNA sequences provided herein or against exogenous sequence fused to Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>DNA and encoding a specific antibody epitope.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0469">6. Purification of Anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>Antibody and Hhip1 Polypeptide</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0470">Forms of anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide may be recovered from culture medium or from host cell lysates. If membrane-bound, it can be released from the membrane using a suitable detergent solution (e.g., Triton-X 100) or by enzymatic cleavage. Cells employed in expression of anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide can be disrupted by various physical or chemical means, such as freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or cell lysing agents.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0471">It may be desired to purify anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: by fractionation on an ion-exchange column; ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex&#xae; G-75; protein A Sepharose&#xae; columns to remove contaminants such as IgG; and metal chelating columns to bind epitope-tagged forms of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide. Various methods of protein purification may be employed and such methods are known in the art and described for example in Deutscher (1990) Meth. Enzymol. 182:83-90; Scopes, PROTEIN PURIFICATION: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1982. The purification step(s) selected will depend, for example, on the nature of the production process used and the particular anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide produced.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0472">When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, are removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. (1992) <i>Bio/Technology </i>10:163-167 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of <i>E. coli</i>. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0473">The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human &#x3b3;1, &#x3b3;2 or &#x3b3;4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al. (1983) <i>J. Immunol. Meth. </i>62:1-13). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human &#x3b3;3 (Guss et al. (1986) <i>EMBO J. </i>5:1567-1575). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly (styrenedivinyl) benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX&#x2122; resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE&#x2122; chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0474">Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).</p>

Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as acetate, Tris, phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; tonicifiers such as trehalose and sodium chloride; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; surfactant such as polysorbate; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN&#xae;, PLURONICS&#xae; or polyethylene glycol (PEG).

<p id="p-0469" num="0477">The formulations herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, in addition to an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>oligopeptide, or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>organic molecule, it may be desirable to include in the one formulation, an additional antibody, e.g., a second anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody which binds a different epitope on the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide, or an antibody to some other target such as a growth factor that affects the growth of the particular cancer. Alternatively, or additionally, the composition may further comprise a chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory agent, anti-hormonal agent, and/or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.</p>

<p id="p-0471" num="0479">Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly (vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0476" num="0488">Hhip1 and/or Ptch overexpression or amplification may be evaluated using an in vivo diagnostic assay, e.g., by administering a molecule (such as an antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule) which binds the molecule to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label (e.g., a radioactive isotope or a fluorescent label) and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0489">Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory of operability, it is believed that the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies of the invention that bind the Hhip1 L2 loop may cross-react with the analogous loop of Ptch and therefore detect overexpression of Ptch as well as Hip.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0490">As described above, the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies, oligopeptides and organic molecules of the invention have various non-therapeutic applications. The anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies, oligopeptides and organic molecules of the present invention can be useful for diagnosis and staging of Hip- or Ptch-expressing cancers (e.g., in radioimaging). The antibodies, oligopeptides and organic molecules are also useful for purification or immunoprecipitation of Hhip1 and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide from cells, for detection and quantitation of Hhip1 polypeptide in vitro, e.g., in an ELISA or a Western blot, to kill and eliminate Hip-expressing cells from a population of mixed cells as a step in the purification of other cells.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0491">Currently, depending on the stage of the cancer, cancer treatment involves one or a combination of the following therapies: surgery to remove the cancerous tissue, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule therapy may be especially desirable in elderly patients who do not tolerate the toxicity and side effects of chemotherapy well and in metastatic disease where radiation therapy has limited usefulness. The tumor targeting anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies, oligopeptides and organic molecules of the invention are useful to alleviate Hip-expressing cancers upon initial diagnosis of the disease or during relapse. For therapeutic applications, the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule can be used alone, or in combination therapy with, e.g., hormones, antiangiogens, or radiolabelled compounds, or with surgery, cryotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. Anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule treatment can be administered in conjunction with other forms of conventional therapy, either consecutively with, pre- or post-conventional therapy. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as TAXOTERE&#xae; (docetaxel), TAXOL&#xae; (palictaxel), estramustine and mitoxantrone are used in treating cancer, in particular, in good risk patients.

The dosing regimen and dosages of these aforementioned chemotherapeutic drugs that are therapeutically effective will depend on the particular cancer being treated, the extent of the disease and other factors familiar to the physician of skill in the art and can be determined by the physician.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0492">In one particular embodiment, a conjugate comprising an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule conjugated with a cytotoxic agent is administered to the patient. Preferably, the immunoconjugate bound to the Hhip1 protein is internalized by the cell, resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the cancer cell to which it binds. In a preferred embodiment, the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with the nucleic acid in the cancer cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents are described above and include maytansinoids, calicheamicins, ribonucleases and DNA endonucleases.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0493">The anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies, oligopeptides, organic molecules or toxin conjugates thereof are administered to a human patient, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous administration, e.g., as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes. Intravenous or subcutaneous administration of the antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0494">Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule. The combined administration includes co-administration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. Preferably such combined therapy results in a synergistic therapeutic effect.</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0495">It may also be desirable to combine administration of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody or antibodies, oligopeptides or organic molecules, with administration of an antibody directed against another tumor antigen associated with the particular cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0496">In another embodiment, the therapeutic treatment methods of the present invention involves the combined administration of an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody (or antibodies), oligopeptides or organic molecules and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents, including co-administration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutic agents include estramustine phosphate, prednimustine, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, hydroxyurea and hydroxyureataxanes (such as paclitaxel and doxetaxel) and/or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers' instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in C<smallcaps>HEMOTHERAPY </smallcaps>S<smallcaps>ERVICE </smallcaps>Ed., M. C. Perry, Williams &#x26; Wilkins, Baltimore, Md., 1992.</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0497">The antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule may be combined with an anti-hormonal compound; e.g., an anti-estrogen compound such as tamoxifen; an anti-progesterone such as onapristone (see, EP 616 812); or an anti-androgen such as flutamide, in dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is androgen independent cancer, the patient may previously have been subjected to anti-androgen therapy and, after the cancer becomes androgen independent, the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule (and optionally other agents as described herein) may be administered to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0498">Sometimes, it may be beneficial to also co-administer a cardioprotectant (to prevent or reduce myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy) or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic regimes, the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and/or radiation therapy, before, simultaneously with, or post antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule therapy. Suitable dosages for any of the above co-administered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the agent and anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0499">For the prevention or treatment of disease, the dosage and mode of administration will be chosen by the physician according to known criteria. The appropriate dosage of antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Preferably, the antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule is administered by intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injections. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 50 mg/kg body weight (e.g., about 0.1-15 mg/kg/dose) of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A dosing regimen can comprise administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg/kg of the anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 &#x3bc;g/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. The progress of this therapy can be readily monitored by conventional methods and assays and based on criteria known to the physician or other persons of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0500">Aside from administration of the antibody protein to the patient, the present application contemplates administration of the antibody by gene therapy. Such administration of nucleic acid encoding the antibody is encompassed by the expression &#x201c;administering a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody.&#x201d; See, for example, WO 96/07321 published Mar. 14, 1996 concerning the use of gene therapy to generate intracellular antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0501">There are two major approaches to getting the nucleic acid (optionally contained in a vector) into the patient's cells; in vivo and ex vivo. For in vivo delivery the nucleic acid is injected directly into the patient, usually at the site where the antibody is required. For ex vivo treatment, the patient's cells are removed, the nucleic acid is introduced into these isolated cells and the modified cells are administered to the patient either directly or, for example, encapsulated within porous membranes which are implanted into the patient (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,892,538 and 5,283,187). There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro, or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes, electroporation, microinjection, cell fusion, DEAE-dextran, the calcium phosphate precipitation method, etc. A commonly used vector for ex vivo delivery of the gene is a retroviral vector.</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0502">The currently preferred in vivo nucleic acid transfer techniques include transfection with viral vectors (such as adenovirus, Herpes simplex I virus, or adeno-associated virus) and lipid-based systems (useful lipids for lipid-mediated transfer of the gene are DOTMA, DOPE and DC-Chol, for example). For review of the currently known gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. (1992) <i>Science </i>256:808-813. See also WO 93/25673 and the references cited therein.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0503">The anti-Hhip1 antibodies of the invention can be in the different forms encompassed by the definition of &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; herein. Thus, the antibodies include full length or intact antibody, antibody fragments, native sequence antibody or amino acid variants, humanized, chimeric or fusion antibodies, immunoconjugates, and functional fragments thereof. In fusion antibodies an antibody sequence is fused to a heterologous polypeptide sequence. The antibodies can be modified in the Fc region to provide desired effector functions. As discussed in more detail in the sections herein, with the appropriate Fc regions, the naked antibody bound on the cell surface can induce cytotoxicity, e.g., via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or by recruiting complement in complement dependent cytotoxicity, or some other mechanism. Alternatively, where it is desirable to eliminate or reduce effector function, so as to minimize side effects or therapeutic complications, certain other Fc regions may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0504">In one embodiment, the antibody competes for binding or bind substantially to, the same epitope as the antibodies of the invention. Antibodies having the biological characteristics of the present anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies of the invention are also contemplated, specifically including the in vivo tumor targeting and any cell proliferation inhibition or cytotoxic characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0505">Methods of producing the above antibodies are described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0506">The present anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies, oligopeptides and organic molecules are useful for treating a Hip-expressing cancer or alleviating one or more symptoms of the cancer in a mammal. Such a cancer includes prostate cancer, cancer of the urinary tract, lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer and ovarian cancer, more specifically, prostate adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinomas, colorectal adenocarcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, lung squamous cell carcinomas, and pleural mesothelioma. The cancers encompass metastatic cancers of any of the preceding. The antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule is able to bind to at least a portion of the cancer cells that express Hhip1 polypeptide in the mammal. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule is effective to destroy or kill Hip-expressing tumor cells or inhibit the growth of such tumor cells, in vitro or in vivo, upon binding to Hhip1 polypeptide on the cell. Such an antibody includes a naked anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody (not conjugated to any agent). Naked antibodies that have cytotoxic or cell growth inhibition properties can be further harnessed with a cytotoxic agent to render them even more potent in tumor cell destruction. Cytotoxic properties can be conferred to an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody by, e.g., conjugating the antibody with a cytotoxic agent, to form an immunoconjugate as described herein. The cytotoxic agent or a growth inhibitory agent is preferably a small molecule. Toxins such as calicheamicin or a maytansinoid and analogs or derivatives thereof, are preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0507">The invention provides a composition comprising an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule of the invention, and a carrier. For the purposes of treating cancer, compositions can be administered to the patient in need of such treatment, wherein the composition can comprise one or more anti-Hhip1 antibodies present as an immunoconjugate or as the naked antibody. In a further embodiment, the compositions can comprise these antibodies, oligopeptides or organic molecules in combination with other therapeutic agents such as cytotoxic or growth inhibitory agents, including chemotherapeutic agents. The invention also provides formulations comprising an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule of the invention, and a carrier. In one embodiment, the formulation is a therapeutic formulation comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0508">Another aspect of the invention is isolated nucleic acids encoding the anti-Hhip1 antibodies. Nucleic acids encoding both the H and L chains and especially the hypervariable region residues, chains which encode the native sequence antibody as well as variants, modifications and humanized versions of the antibody, are encompassed.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0509">The invention also provides methods useful for treating a Hhip1 polypeptide-expressing cancer or alleviating one or more symptoms of the cancer in a mammal, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule to the mammal. The antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule therapeutic compositions can be administered short term (acute) or chronic, or intermittent as directed by physician. Also provided are methods of inhibiting the growth of, and killing a Hhip1 polypeptide-expressing cell.</p>
<p id="p-0498" num="0510">The invention also provides kits and articles of manufacture comprising at least one anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule. Kits containing anti-Hhip1 antibodies, oligopeptides or organic molecules find use, e.g., for Hhip1 cell killing assays, for purification or immunoprecipitation of Hhip1 polypeptide from cells. For example, for isolation and purification of Hhip1, the kit can contain an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule coupled to beads (e.g., Sepharose&#xae; beads). Kits can be provided which contain the antibodies, oligopeptides or organic molecules for detection and quantitation of Hhip1 in vitro, e.g., in an ELISA or a Western blot. Such antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule useful for detection may be provided with a label such as a fluorescent or radiolabel.</p>
<heading id="h-0024" level="1">L. Articles of Manufacture and Kits</heading>
<p id="p-0499" num="0511">Another embodiment of the invention is an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of anti-Hhip1 expressing cancer. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is effective for treating the cancer condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule of the invention. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating cancer.

Additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.</p>
<p id="p-0500" num="0512">Kits are also provided that are useful for various purposes, e.g., for Hip-expressing cell killing assays, for purification or immunoprecipitation of Hhip1 polypeptide from cells. For isolation and purification of Hhip1 polypeptide, the kit can contain an anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibody, oligopeptide or organic molecule coupled to beads (e.g., Sepharose&#xae; beads). Kits can be provided which contain the antibodies, oligopeptides or organic molecules for detection and quantitation of Hhip1 polypeptide in vitro, e.g., in an ELISA or a Western blot. As with the article of manufacture, the kit comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container.

The label or package insert may provide a description of the composition as well as instructions for the intended in vitro or diagnostic use.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">M. Uses for Hhip1 polypeptides and Hip-Polypeptide Encoding Nucleic Acids</heading>
<p id="p-0501" num="0513">Nucleotide sequences (or their complement) encoding Hhip1 polypeptides have various applications in the art of molecular biology, including uses as hybridization probes, in chromosome and gene mapping and in the generation of anti-sense RNA and DNA probes. Hip-encoding nucleic acid will also be useful for the preparation of Hhip1 polypeptides by the recombinant techniques described herein, wherein those Hhip1 polypeptides may find use, for example, in the preparation of anti-Hhip1 antibodies as described herein</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0514">The full-length native sequence Hhip1 gene, or portions thereof, may be used as hybridization probes for a cDNA library to isolate the full-length Hhip1 cDNA or to isolate still other cDNAs (for instance, those encoding naturally-occurring variants of Hhip1 or Hhip1 from other species) which have a desired sequence identity to the native Hhip1 sequence disclosed herein. Optionally, the length of the probes will be about 20 to about 50 bases. The hybridization probes may be derived from at least partially novel regions of the full length native nucleotide sequence wherein those regions may be determined without undue experimentation or from genomic sequences including promoters, enhancer elements and introns of native sequence Hhip1. By way of example, a screening method will comprise isolating the coding region of the Hhip1 gene using the known DNA sequence to synthesize a selected probe of about 40 bases. Hybridization probes may be labeled by a variety of labels, including radionucleotides such as <sup>32</sup>P or <sup>35</sup>S, or enzymatic labels such as alkaline phosphatase coupled to the probe via avidin/biotin coupling systems. Labeled probes having a sequence complementary to that of the Hhip1 gene of the present invention can be used to screen libraries of human cDNA, genomic DNA or mRNA to determine which members of such libraries the probe hybridizes to. Hybridization techniques are described in further detail in the Examples below. Any EST sequences disclosed in the present application may similarly be employed as probes, using the methods disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0515">Other useful fragments of the Hip-encoding nucleic acids include antisense or sense oligonucleotides comprising a singe-stranded nucleic acid sequence (either RNA or DNA) capable of binding to target Hhip1 mRNA (sense) or Hhip1 DNA (antisense) sequences. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides, according to the present invention, comprise a fragment of the coding region of Hhip1 DNA. Such a fragment generally comprises at least about 14 nucleotides, preferably from about 14 to 30 nucleotides. The ability to derive an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide, based upon a cDNA sequence encoding a given protein is described in, for example, Stein and Cohen (1988) <i>Cancer Res. </i>48:2659 and van der Krol et al. (1988) <i>BioTechniques </i>6:958.</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0516">Binding of antisense or sense oligonucleotides to target nucleic acid sequences results in the formation of duplexes that block transcription or translation of the target sequence by one of several means, including enhanced degradation of the duplexes, premature termination of transcription or translation, or by other means. Such methods are encompassed by the present invention. The antisense oligonucleotides thus may be used to block expression of Hhip1 proteins, wherein those Hhip1 proteins may play a role in the induction of cancer in mammals. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides further comprise oligonucleotides having modified sugar-phosphodiester backbones (or other sugar linkages, such as those described in WO 91/06629) and wherein such sugar linkages are resistant to endogenous nucleases. Such oligonucleotides with resistant sugar linkages are stable in vivo (i.e., capable of resisting enzymatic degradation) but retain sequence specificity to be able to bind to target nucleotide sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="0517">Preferred intragenic sites for antisense binding include the region incorporating the translation initiation/start codon (5&#x2032;-AUG/5&#x2032;-ATG) or termination/stop codon (5&#x2032;-UAA, 5&#x2032;-UAG and 5-UGA/5&#x2032;-TAA, 5&#x2032;-TAG and 5&#x2032;-TGA) of the open reading frame (ORF) of the gene. These regions refer to a portion of the mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032;) from a translation initiation or termination codon. Other preferred regions for antisense binding include: introns; exons; intron-exon junctions; the open reading frame (ORF) or &#x201c;coding region,&#x201d; which is the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon; the 5&#x2032; cap of an mRNA which comprises an N7-methylated guanosine residue joined to the 5&#x2032;-most residue of the mRNA via a 5&#x2032;-5&#x2032; triphosphate linkage and includes 5&#x2032; cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides adjacent to the cap; the 5&#x2032; untranslated region (5&#x2032;UTR), the portion of an mRNA in the 5&#x2032; direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5&#x2032; cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene; and the 3&#x2032; untranslated region (3&#x2032;UTR), the portion of an mRNA in the 3&#x2032; direction from the translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3&#x2032; end of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene.</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0518">Specific examples of preferred antisense compounds useful for inhibiting expression of Hhip1 proteins include oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non-natural internucleoside linkages. Oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in the art, modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides. Preferred modified oligonucleotide backbones include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotri-esters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3&#x2032;-alkylene phosphonates, 5&#x2032;-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3&#x2032;-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and borano-phosphates having normal 3&#x2032;-5&#x2032; linkages, 2&#x2032;-5&#x2032; linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more internucleotide linkages is a 3&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;, 5&#x2032; to 5&#x2032; or 2&#x2032; to 2&#x2032; linkage. Preferred oligonucleotides having inverted polarity comprise a single 3&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; linkage at the 3&#x2032;-most internucleotide linkage i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleobase is missing or has a hydroxyl group in place thereof). Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.

<p id="p-0508" num="0520">In other preferred antisense oligonucleotides, both the sugar and the internucleoside linkage, i.e., the backbone, of the nucleotide units are replaced with novel groups. The base units are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target compound. One such oligomeric compound, an oligonucleotide mimetic that has been shown to have excellent hybridization properties, is referred to as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In PNA compounds, the sugar-backbone of an oligonucleotide is replaced with an amide containing backbone, in particular an aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are retained and are bound directly or indirectly to aza nitrogen atoms of the amide portion of the backbone.

<p id="p-0515" num="0527">It is not necessary for all positions in a given compound to be uniformly modified, and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single compound or even at a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide. The present invention also includes antisense compounds which are chimeric compounds. &#x201c;Chimeric&#x201d; antisense compounds or &#x201c;chimeras,&#x201d; in the context of this invention, are antisense compounds, particularly oligonucleotides, which contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide in the case of an oligonucleotide compound. These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region wherein the oligonucleotide is modified so as to confer upon the oligonucleotide increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional region of the oligonucleotide may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids. By way of example, RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of oligonucleotide inhibition of gene expression. Consequently, comparable results can often be obtained with shorter oligonucleotides when chimeric oligonucleotides are used, compared to phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides hybridizing to the same target region. Chimeric antisense compounds of the invention may be formed as composite structures of two or more oligonucleotides, modified oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides and/or oligonucleotide mimetics as described above. Preferred chimeric antisense oligonucleotides incorporate at least one 2&#x2032; modified sugar (preferably 2&#x2032;-O&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>) at the 3&#x2032; terminal to confer nuclease resistance and a region with at least 4 contiguous 2&#x2032;-H sugars to confer RNase H activity. Such compounds have also been referred to in the art as hybrids or gapmers. Preferred gapmers have a region of 2&#x2032; modified sugars (preferably 2&#x2032;-O&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>) at the 3&#x2032;-terminal and at the 5&#x2032; terminal separated by at least one region having at least 4 contiguous 2&#x2032;-H sugars and preferably incorporate phosphorothioate backbone linkages.

The nucleotide sequences provided herein may be mapped to a chromosome and specific regions of a chromosome using known techniques, such as in situ hybridization, linkage analysis against known chromosomal markers, and hybridization screening with libraries.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0536">When the coding sequences for Hhip1 encode a protein which binds to another protein (example, where the Hhip1 is a receptor), the Hhip1 can be used in assays to identify the other proteins or molecules involved in the binding interaction. By such methods, inhibitors of the receptor/ligand binding interaction can be identified. Proteins involved in such binding interactions can also be used to screen for peptide or small molecule inhibitors or agonists of the binding interaction. Also, the receptor Hhip1 can be used to isolate correlative ligand(s). Screening assays can be designed to find lead compounds that mimic the biological activity of a native Hhip1 or a receptor for Hhip1. Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high-throughput screening of chemical libraries, making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates. Small molecules contemplated include synthetic organic or inorganic compounds. The assays can be performed in a variety of formats, including protein-protein binding assays, biochemical screening assays, immunoassays and cell based assays, which are well characterized in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0537">Nucleic acids which encode Hhip1 or its modified forms can also be used to generate either transgenic animals or &#x201c;knock out&#x201d; animals which, in turn, are useful in the development and screening of therapeutically useful reagents. A transgenic animal (e.g., a mouse or rat) is an animal having cells that contain a transgene, which transgene was introduced into the animal or an ancestor of the animal at a prenatal, e.g., an embryonic stage. A transgene is a DNA which is integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic animal develops. In one embodiment, cDNA encoding Hhip1 can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding Hhip1 in accordance with established techniques and the genomic sequences used to generate transgenic animals that contain cells which express DNA encoding Hhip1. Methods for generating transgenic animals, particularly animals such as mice or rats, have become conventional in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,736,866 and 4,870,009. Typically, particular cells would be targeted for Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>transgene incorporation with tissue-specific enhancers. Transgenic animals that include a copy of a transgene encoding Hhip1 introduced into the germ line of the animal at an embryonic stage can be used to examine the effect of increased expression of DNA encoding Hhip1. Such animals can be used as tester animals for reagents thought to confer protection from, for example, pathological conditions associated with its overexpression. In accordance with this facet of the invention, an animal is treated with the reagent and a reduced incidence of the pathological condition, compared to untreated animals bearing the transgene, would indicate a potential therapeutic intervention for the pathological condition.</p>
<p id="p-0526" num="0538">Alternatively, non-human homologues of Hhip1 can be used to construct a Hhip1 &#x201c;knock out&#x201d; animal which has a defective or altered gene encoding Hhip1 as a result of homologous recombination between the endogenous gene encoding Hhip1 and altered genomic DNA encoding Hhip1 introduced into an embryonic stem cell of the animal. For example, cDNA encoding Hhip1 can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding Hhip1 in accordance with established techniques. A portion of the genomic DNA encoding Hhip1 can be deleted or replaced with another gene, such as a gene encoding a selectable marker which can be used to monitor integration. Typically, several kilobases of unaltered flanking DNA (both at the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends) are included in the vector (see e.g., Thomas and Capecchi (1987) <i>Cell </i>51:503 for a description of homologous recombination vectors). The vector is introduced into an embryonic stem cell line (e.g., by electroporation) and cells in which the introduced DNA has homologously recombined with the endogenous DNA are selected (see e.g., Li et al. (1992) <i>Cell </i>69:915). The selected cells are then injected into a blastocyst of an animal (e.g., a mouse or rat) to form aggregation chimeras (see e.g., Bradley, in T<smallcaps>ERATOCARCINOMAS AND E</smallcaps><smallcaps>MBRYONIC </smallcaps>S<smallcaps>TEM </smallcaps>C<smallcaps>ELLS</smallcaps>: A P<smallcaps>RACTICAL </smallcaps>A<smallcaps>PPROACH</smallcaps>, E. J. Robertson, ed., IRL, Oxford, 1987, pp. 113-152). A chimeric embryo can then be implanted into a suitable pseudopregnant female foster animal and the embryo brought to term to create a &#x201c;knock out&#x201d; animal. Progeny harboring the homologously recombined DNA in their germ cells can be identified by standard techniques and used to breed animals in which all cells of the animal contain the homologously recombined DNA. Knockout animals can be characterized for instance, for their ability to defend against certain pathological conditions and for their development of pathological conditions due to absence of the Hhip1 polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0527" num="0539">Nucleic acid encoding the Hhip1 polypeptides may also be used in gene therapy. In gene therapy applications, genes are introduced into cells in order to achieve in vivo synthesis of a therapeutically effective genetic product, for example for replacement of a defective gene. &#x201c;Gene therapy&#x201d; includes both conventional gene therapy where a lasting effect is achieved by a single treatment, and the administration of gene therapeutic agents, which involves the one time or repeated administration of a therapeutically effective DNA or mRNA. Antisense RNAs and DNAs can be used as therapeutic agents for blocking the expression of certain genes in vivo. It has already been shown that short antisense oligonucleotides can be imported into cells where they act as inhibitors, despite their low intracellular concentrations caused by their restricted uptake by the cell membrane. (Zamecnik et al., (1986) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>83:4143-4146). The oligonucleotides can be modified to enhance their uptake, e.g. by substituting their negatively charged phosphodiester groups by uncharged groups.</p>
<p id="p-0528" num="0540">There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro, or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes, electroporation, microinjection, cell fusion, DEAE-dextran, the calcium phosphate precipitation method, etc. The currently preferred in vivo gene transfer techniques include transfection with viral (typically retroviral) vectors and viral coat protein-liposome mediated transfection (Dzau et al. (1993) <i>Trends in Biotechnology </i>11:205-210). In some situations it is desirable to provide the nucleic acid source with an agent that targets the target cells, such as an antibody specific for a cell surface membrane protein or the target cell, a ligand for a receptor on the target cell, etc. Where liposomes are employed, proteins which bind to a cell surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis may be used for targeting and/or to facilitate uptake, e.g. capsid proteins or fragments thereof tropic for a particular cell type, antibodies for proteins which undergo internalization in cycling, proteins that target intracellular localization and enhance intracellular half-life. The technique of receptor-mediated endocytosis is described, for example, by Wu et al. (1987) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>262:4429-4432; and Wagner et al. (1990) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>87:3410-3414. For review of gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. (1992) <i>Science </i>256:808-813.</p>
<p id="p-0529" num="0541">The nucleic acid molecules encoding the Hhip1 polypeptides or fragments thereof described herein are useful for chromosome identification. In this regard, there exists an ongoing need to identify new chromosome markers, since relatively few chromosome marking reagents, based upon actual sequence data are presently available. Each Hhip1 nucleic acid molecule of the present invention can be used as a chromosome marker.</p>
<p id="p-0530" num="0542">The Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may also be used diagnostically for tissue typing, wherein Hhip1 polypeptides may be differentially expressed in one tissue as compared to another, preferably in a diseased tissue as compared to a normal tissue of the same tissue type. Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>nucleic acid molecules will find use for generating probes for PCR, Northern analysis, Southern analysis and Western analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0543">This invention encompasses methods of screening compounds to identify those that mimic the Hhip1 polypeptide (Hedgehog antagonists) or prevent the effect of the Hhip1 polypeptide (agonists). Screening assays for antagonist drug candidates are designed to identify compounds that bind or complex with the Hhip1 polypeptides encoded by the genes identified herein, or otherwise interfere with the interaction of the encoded polypeptides with other cellular proteins, including e.g., inhibiting the expression of Hhip1 polypeptide from cells. Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high-throughput screening of chemical libraries, making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates.</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="0544">The assays can be performed in a variety of formats, including protein-protein binding assays, biochemical screening assays, immunoassays, and cell-based assays, which are well characterized in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="0545">All assays for antagonists are common in that they call for contacting the drug candidate with a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid identified herein under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow these two components to interact.</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="0546">In binding assays, the interaction is binding and the complex formed can be isolated or detected in the reaction mixture. In a particular embodiment, the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid identified herein or the drug candidate is immobilized on a solid phase, e.g., on a microtiter plate, by covalent or non-covalent attachments. Non-covalent attachment generally is accomplished by coating the solid surface with a solution of the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide and drying. Alternatively, an immobilized antibody, e.g., a monoclonal antibody, specific for the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide to be immobilized can be used to anchor it to a solid surface. The assay is performed by adding the non-immobilized component, which may be labeled by a detectable label, to the immobilized component, e.g., the coated surface containing the anchored component. When the reaction is complete, the non-reacted components are removed, e.g., by washing, and complexes anchored on the solid surface are detected. When the originally non-immobilized component carries a detectable label, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexing occurred. Where the originally non-immobilized component does not carry a label, complexing can be detected, for example, by using a labeled antibody specifically binding the immobilized complex.</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="0547">If the candidate compound interacts with but does not bind to a particular Hhip1 polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid identified herein, its interaction with that polypeptide can be assayed by methods well known for detecting protein-protein interactions. Such assays include traditional approaches, such as, e.g., cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-purification through gradients or chromatographic columns In addition, protein-protein interactions can be monitored by using a yeast-based genetic system described by Fields and co-workers (Fields and Song, (1989) <i>Nature </i>340:245-246; Chien et al. (1991) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>88:9578-9582) as disclosed by Chevray and Nathans (1991) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>89:5789-5793. Many transcriptional activators, such as yeast GAL4, consist of two physically discrete modular domains, one acting as the DNA-binding domain, the other one functioning as the transcription-activation domain. The yeast expression system described in the foregoing publications (generally referred to as the &#x201c;two-hybrid system&#x201d;) takes advantage of this property, and employs two hybrid proteins, one in which the target protein is fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, and another, in which candidate activating proteins are fused to the activation domain. The expression of a GAL1-lacZ reporter gene under control of a GAL4-activated promoter depends on reconstitution of GAL4 activity via protein-protein interaction. Colonies containing interacting polypeptides are detected with a chromogenic substrate for &#x3b2;-galactosidase. A complete kit (MATCHMAKER&#x2122;) for identifying protein-protein interactions between two specific proteins using the two-hybrid technique is commercially available from Clontech. This system can also be extended to map protein domains involved in specific protein interactions as well as to pinpoint amino acid residues that are crucial for these interactions.</p>
<p id="p-0536" num="0548">Compounds that interfere with the interaction of a gene encoding a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide identified herein and other intra- or extracellular components can be tested as follows: usually a reaction mixture is prepared containing the product of the gene and the intra- or extracellular component under conditions and for a time allowing for the interaction and binding of the two products. To test the ability of a candidate compound to inhibit binding, the reaction is run in the absence and in the presence of the test compound. In addition, a placebo may be added to a third reaction mixture, to serve as positive control. The binding (complex formation) between the test compound and the intra- or extracellular component present in the mixture is monitored as described hereinabove. The formation of a complex in the control reaction(s) but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound indicates that the test compound interferes with the interaction of the test compound and its reaction partner.</p>
<p id="p-0537" num="0549">To assay for antagonists, the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide may be added to a cell along with the compound to be screened for a particular activity and the ability of the compound to inhibit the activity of interest in the presence of the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide indicates that the compound is an antagonist to the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide. Alternatively, antagonists may be detected by combining the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide and a potential antagonist with membrane-bound Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide receptors or recombinant receptors under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. The Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide can be labeled, such as by radioactivity, such that the number of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide molecules bound to the receptor can be used to determine the effectiveness of the potential antagonist. The gene encoding the receptor can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, ligand panning and FACS sorting. Coligan et al., Eds., C<smallcaps>URRENT </smallcaps>P<smallcaps>ROTOCOLS IN </smallcaps>I<smallcaps>MMUNOLOGY</smallcaps>, 1(2): Chapter 5, 1991. Preferably, expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide. Transfected cells that are grown on glass slides are exposed to labeled Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide. The Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion of a recognition site for a site-specific protein kinase. Following fixation and incubation, the slides are subjected to autoradiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub-pools are prepared and re-transfected using an interactive sub-pooling and re-screening process, eventually yielding a single clone that encodes the putative receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0550">More specific examples of potential antagonists include an oligonucleotide that binds to the fusions of immunoglobulin with Hhip1 polypeptide, and, in particular, antibodies including, without limitation, poly- and monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments, single-chain antibodies, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and chimeric or humanized versions of such antibodies or fragments, as well as human antibodies and antibody fragments.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0551">Another potential Hhip1 polypeptide antagonist is an antisense RNA or DNA construct prepared using antisense technology, where, e.g., an antisense RNA or DNA molecule acts to block directly the translation of mRNA by hybridizing to targeted mRNA and preventing protein translation. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through triple-helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA, both of which methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example nucleic acids encoding Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptides herein, are used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription (triple helix&#x2014;see Lee et al. (1979) <i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>6:3073; Cooney et al. (1988) <i>Science </i>241:456; Dervan et al. (1991) <i>Science </i>251:1360), thereby preventing transcription and the production of the Hhip1 polypeptide. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into the Hhip1 polypeptide (Okano (1991) <i>Neurochem. </i>56:560); O<smallcaps>LIGODEOXYNUCLEOTIDES AS </smallcaps>A<smallcaps>NTISENSE </smallcaps>I<smallcaps>NHIBITORS OF </smallcaps>G<smallcaps>ENE </smallcaps>E<smallcaps>XPRESSION</smallcaps>, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1988). The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of the Hhip1 polypeptide. When antisense DNA is used, oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the translation-initiation site, e.g., between about &#x2212;10 and +10 positions of the target gene nucleotide sequence, are preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0540" num="0552">Potential antagonists of Hhip1 include small molecules that bind to the active site, the receptor binding site, or growth factor or other relevant binding site of the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>L2 region, thereby blocking the normal biological activity of the Hhip1 polypeptide. Examples of small molecules include, but are not limited to, small peptides or peptide-like molecules, preferably soluble peptides, and synthetic non-peptidyl organic or inorganic compounds.</p>

<p id="p-0542" num="0554">Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. Ribozymes act by sequence-specific hybridization to the complementary target RNA, followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within a potential RNA target can be identified by known techniques. For further details see, e.g., Rossi (1994) <i>Current Biology, </i>4:469-471, and PCT publication No. WO 97/33551 (published Sep. 18, 1997).</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="0555">Nucleic acid molecules in triple-helix formation used to inhibit transcription should be single-stranded and composed of deoxynucleotides. The base composition of these oligonucleotides is designed such that it promotes triple-helix formation via Hoogsteen base-pairing rules, which generally require sizeable stretches of purines or pyrimidines on one strand of a duplex. For further details see, e.g., PCT publication No. WO 97/33551, supra.</p>

<p id="p-0547" num="0559">If the Hhip1 polypeptide is intracellular and whole antibodies are used as inhibitors, internalizing antibodies are preferred. However, lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody, or an antibody fragment, into cells. Where antibody fragments are used, the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred. For example, based upon the variable-region sequences of an antibody, peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and/or produced by recombinant DNA technology (See, e.g., Marasco et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:7889-7893).</p>

<p id="p-0552" num="0564">To discern the underlying structural patterns that help reveal domain folds and boundaries, an evolutionarily diverse alignment of Hhip1 homologs was constructed by MUSCLE (Edgar, R. C. (2004) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>32:1792-1797) from sequences harvested from Genbank by iterative PSIBLAST runs (Schaffer et al. (2001) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>29:2994-3005. Secondary structure prediction of the aligned sequences was in turn performed by PSIPRED (McGuffin et al. (2000) <i>Bioinformatics </i>16:404-405. Hhip1 sequence profiles and HMMs aimed at both sequence and structure databases were able to discern links between an N-terminal Cys-rich module (rich in predicted &#x3b1;-helices) and putative Frizzled domains, and likewise, between a central &#x3b2;-strand-rich section of Hhip1 and &#x3b2;-propeller domains. These relationships were corroborated by returns from fold recognition programs (dependent on profile-profile matches at both sequence and structural levels) like HHPred (S&#xf6;ding, J. (2005) <i>Bioinformatics </i>21:951-960. Comparative models of the Hhip1 &#x3b2;-propeller domain were built with MODELLER (Sali and Blundell, 1993) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>234:779-815. The presence of a C-terminal GPI-anchor sequence in Hhip1 rather than a transmembrane helix, with the concomitant prediction of the modification site residue, was detected by the big-PI server (mendel.imp.ac.at/gpi/gpi_server) (Eisenhaber et al. (1999) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>292:741-758).</p>
<p id="p-0553" num="0565">Computational analysis of the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12ECD </sub>sequence using sensitive structure prediction and fold recognition tools revealed the presence of four distinct globular domains: a Cysteine-rich N-terminal domain with a putative Frizzled (Fz) fold, a central six-bladed &#x3b2;-propeller and two C-terminal EGF repeats (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Furthermore, in place of the single C-terminal transmembrane helix previously predicted for Hhip1 (Chuang and McMahon, 1999), we find a motif consistent with a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor attachment site (Eisenhaber et al.

Shh constructs were expressed in Rosetta 2 <i>E. coli </i>cells (Novagen) in LB medium for 20 hrs at 25&#xb0; C. after induction with 1 mM IPTG. For expression of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Shh, cells were grown in minimal medium. Harvested cells were lysed and Shh was purified from the cystosolic fraction by Ni-affinity and size exclusion chromatography. For crystallization and NMR studies, Shh was incubated with 10 units of thrombin (Calbiochem) per mg of Shh in PBS overnight at 23&#xb0; C., yielding Shh (residues 29-197) lacking the His<sub>6</sub>-Tag (SEQ ID NO: 87). Finally, Shh was purified using a Mono S 5/5GL column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0-1 M NaCl in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.2. Purification buffers for Shh<sub>N-Cys </sub>contained 5 mM &#x3b2;-mercaptoethanol during Ni-affinity chromatography and 0.5 mM DTT during size exclusion and cation exchange chromatography. Shh<sub>N-Cys </sub>was conjugated with EZ-Link Maleimide PEO<sub>2</sub>-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol to yield biotinylated-Shh<sub>N-Cys</sub>. Shh<sub>C-Cys </sub>was conjugated with DyLight 649 Maleimide (Pierce) to yield fluorescent Shh (Shh<sub>649</sub>) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Expressed proteins were used in experiments described below.</p>

<heading id="h-0035" level="1">A. Gli Luciferase Signaling Co-Culture Assay and Hip-Fc Assay</heading>
<p id="p-0564" num="0576">Due to the lack of both N- and C-terminal lipid modifications of Shh and the absence of other cellular components, the in vitro assays may not fully recapitulate Hip-Shh interactions occurring in a cellular environment. Therefore, a co-culture assay consisting of murine S12 fibroblasts stably transfected with a Gli luciferase reporter gene and (Frank-Kamenetsky et al. (2002) <i>J. Biol. </i>1:10) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT29 cells that secrete fully lipid-modified Shh (Yauch et al. (2008) <i>Nature </i>455:406) was used to determine which extracellular domains of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>mediate inhibition of Shh signaling in mammalian cells.</p>
<p id="p-0565" num="0577">Briefly, S12 cells, which are 10T1/2 fibroblasts stably transfected with 8&#xd7; Gli-binding sites fused to a luciferase reporter (Frank-Kamenetsky et al. (2002) <i>J. Biol. </i>1:10), were plated at 10,000 cells/well of a white-walled clear bottomed 96-well plate (Costar 3610) for 48 hrs in regular growth medium (HG-DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% glutamine). After 24 h, the media was removed and Shh-producing HT29 cells at 20,000 cells/well were plated and the co-culture was grown in regular media. After 24 h, the media was changed to 0.5% serum HG-DMEM&#xb1;Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>fragments and further incubated for 24 hrs to stimulate signaling. Gli-luciferase activity was measured using a HTS-Steady Lite luciferase detection kit (Perkin Elmer); multiple assays were carried out, each in triplicate. Data were fit to a 4-parameter sigmoidal equation, from which the IC<sub>50 </sub>was derived using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0566" num="0578">Hhip1<sub>ECD </sub>and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>were equally potent inhibitors of Hh signaling with IC<sub>50 </sub>values of 5.3 nM and 5.0 nM, respectively, while Hip<sub>&#x3b2;1 </sub>had an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 20.3 nM, only about 4-fold higher than Hhip1<sub>ECD </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0567" num="0579">To confirm that the putative Fz domain (Hhip1<sub>Fz</sub>) is dispensable for inhibition in this assay, we expressed and purified it as an Fc-fusion protein (Hhip1<sub>Fz-Fc</sub>). Briefly, human Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>(20-193) was cloned into expression vector pRK5 (Genentech) with an N-terminal gD-secrection signal (MGGAAARLGAVILFVVIVGLHGVRG) (SEQ ID NO:41) and a C-terminal human Fc-fragment (IgG<sub>1</sub>). The construct was expressed in 293 cells by transient transfection using FuGENE 6 (Roche) and after 5 days of incubation purified using protein A resin (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion chromatography (S-200 column, GE Healthcare). Consistent with the data above, the Fc fusion construct lacked any inhibitory activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). Overall, these data reveal that the minimal region of the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>ECD required for binding all three mammalian Hedgehogs and mediating its full antagonistic effect is contained within the &#x3b2;-propeller and EGF domains, with the EGF2 domain playing only a minor role.</p>
<heading id="h-0036" level="1">B. Peptide Competition ELISA</heading>
<p id="p-0568" num="0580">Binding to all 3 mammalian Hh homologs using competition was also assessed by ELISAs. Briefly, 96-well Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp plates (Nalge Nunc International) were coated with 100 &#x3bc;l of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>at 2 &#x3bc;g/ml in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6 at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. Plates were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with 100 &#x3bc;L blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 15 PPM Proclin) on a plate shaker. The blocking buffer was removed and a serial dilution of either Dhh, Ihh, or Shh (starting at 10 &#x3bc;M, 1:4 dilution) containing 5 nM biotinylated-Shh<sub>N-Cys </sub>in a final volume of 100 &#x3bc;L was added to the wells to compete for binding to immobilized Hhip1. After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature on a plate shaker, the wells were washed with wash buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween) and incubated for 1 hr with Streptavidin-HRP (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol in blocking buffer. After that, the plate was washed again with wash buffer and incubated with 100 &#x3bc;L of BD OptEIA reagent mix (1:1 ratio, BD Bioscience) until the solution turned light blue. The reaction was then quenched by addition of 100 &#x3bc;L acid (1 M H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>) and the optical density at 450 nm (OD<sub>450</sub>) was measured with a SpectraMAX plate reader (Molecular Devices). The OD<sub>450 </sub>was plotted versus the concentration of Ihh, Dhh and Shh and the IC<sub>50 </sub>of the curves were determined in triplicate by a 4-parameter sigmoidal fit to the data using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0570" num="0582">Shh<sub>649</sub>, conjugated to Dylight 649 (Pierce) at its C-terminus (vide supra), was incubated at 0.33 or 1 nM for 1 h on ice with various Hhip or control proteins prior to incubation with HEK-293 cells (293) or 293 cells expressing full length human Patched-1 (Ptch1-293 clone 10) (Carpenter D. et al. (1998) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>95:13630-13634) in FACS buffer (3% FBS in PBS) for 1 h on ice. After washing 3 times in FACS buffer, live cells (sorted by propidium iodide exclusion) were analyzed by flow cytometry in the APC channel using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Control proteins included His6-Shh, His6-Ihh, HGF &#x3b2;-His639, Trastuzumab (Genentech, Inc.) as a human IgG1 isotype control for Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>-Fc, and mIgG1 (Molecular Probes Z25105) as a murine Mab control for anti-Shh 5E1 Mab34. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0038" level="1">D. 5E1 Epitope Mapping</heading>
<p id="p-0571" num="0583">5E1 bound to agarose beads was incubated with Shh, partially digested with trypsin, then undigested peptides were eluted and identified by mass spectrometry as previously described (Kiselyov, A. S. et al. (2007) <i>Expert Opin. Ther. Targets </i>11:1087-1101). This revealed peptide 158-178 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>) in agreement with previous data that encompasses the S177 residue (Fuse N. et al. (1999) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </i>96:10992-10999; Pepinsky, R. B. et al. (2000) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>5:154-156). The epitope likely extends past the tryptic cleavage site at K178 encompassing the residues that differ between Shh/Ihh and Dhh to account for the lower affinity for Dhh (vide infra).</p>
<heading id="h-0039" level="1">E. Binding Affinity of 5E1 to Shh by Surface Plasmon Resonance</heading>
<p id="p-0572" num="0584">Affinity determinations for human Shh (25-197), Dhh, or Ihh binding to 5E1 were performed by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore&#x2122;-2000. IgG (882 to 991 RU) was immobilized in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 on a CM5 sensor chip and serial 3-fold dilutions of the various forms of Shh (0.3-1000 nM) in PBST were injected at a flow rate of 30 &#x3bc;l/min. Each sample was analyzed with 4-minute association time and 10-minute dissociation time. After each injection the chip was regenerated using 10 mM glycine pH 1.7. Binding response was corrected by subtracting the control IgG flow cell 1 from the 5E1 flow cells. A 1:1 Languir model of simultaneous fitting of k<sub>on </sub>and k<sub>off </sub>was used for kinetics analysis. 5E1 bound with similar affinity (&#x2dc;3 nM) to Shh and Ihh, but had significantly lower affinity for Dhh.</p>

<p id="p-0574" num="0586">Crystals of apo Hip<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>were grown by atypical hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 19&#xb0; C. by placing protein samples (0.3-2 &#x3bc;l) over 500 &#x3bc;l of reservoir solution of 20 mM Hepes pH 7.2 and 3 M NaCl. Rectangular crystals appeared within 48 hrs and were grown for one week, with the longest dimension exceeding 0.8 mm. The best diffracting crystals (typically 0.25&#xd7;0.25&#xd7;0.10 mm<sup>3</sup>) were transferred to a 2 &#x3bc;l drop of 20 mM Hepes pH 7.2 and 3 M NaCl and placed over a 500 &#x3bc;l reservoir solution of 20 mM Hepes pH 7.2 and 5 M NaCl. After 16-24 hrs of dehydration, crystals were soaked for 30 sec in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 5M NaCl prior to flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. Three-wavelength Se-Met based MAD was collected at 100 K at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) 9-2 beamline. Crystallography statistics are summarized in Table 7.</p>
<p id="p-0575" num="0587">A different form of apo Hip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>crystal was grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 19&#xb0; C. by combining 1.5 &#x3bc;l of protein solution with 1.5 &#x3bc;l of reservoir solution (0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 22-24% PEG 4000 and 1-2% dioxane). Crystals appeared within a week and grew to full size in 7-14 days. Prior to flash cooling in liquid nitrogen, crystals were cryoprotected in a reservoir solution supplemented with glycerol in a step-wise fashion (v/v glycerol final concentration of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%). Native data were collected at 100 K at Advanced Light Source (ALS) 5.0.2 beamline.</p>
<p id="p-0576" num="0588">Initial crystals of Hip<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>-Shh complex were generated by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 19&#xb0; C. by combining 1 l of protein sample and 1 &#x3bc;l of reservoir solution (0.1 M bis-Tris propane pH 7.0 and 2.8-3.0 M sodium formate). They appeared after 4 days and grew large with the longest dimension exceeding 0.3 mm. These crystals were of very poor quality and a series of microseeding and macroseeding steps were required for crystals suitable for data collection. A succession of streak seeding into a pre-equilibrated (48 h) protein drop improved crystal quality such that macroseeding was feasible. Small crystals with dimensions of about 0.02 mm were washed and transferred into a pre-equilibrated drop with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M bis-Tris propane pH 7.0 and 2.2 M sodium formate. Since slow growth was essential for getting crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction, complex and lengthy multistage procedures were implemented using NeXtal screw-cap 24 well plates. Typically, crystals were incubated over reservoir solution for 4-7 days before being transferred to conditions where the sodium formate concentration was raised by 0.1 M. This process was repeated four times with a final reservoir containing 0.1 M bis-Tris propane pH 7.0 and 2.5 M sodium formate. The best quality crystals measuring 0.09&#xd7;0.09&#xd7;0.05 mm<sup>3 </sup>were produced in a period of 4-6 weeks. Anisotropic native data were collected at SSRL 11-1 beamline.</p>
<p id="p-0577" num="0589">All data sets were processed using HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor (1997) <i>Methods Enzymol. </i>276: 307-325). Nine selenium sites were located and phase refinement for apo Hip<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>crystallized in the P3<sub>1</sub>21 space group was performed with autoSHARP (Bricogne, G. et al. (2003) <i>Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. </i>59: 2023-30). Solvent flattening with 66% solvent content significantly improved experimental map quality. Manual atomic model building into experimental electron density was done in Coot (Emsley and Cowtan (2004) <i>Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. </i>60: 2126-2132). The structures of apo Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>in the C222<sub>1 </sub>space group and the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>-Shh complex were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (McCoy, A. J. et al. (2005) <i>Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. </i>61: 458-464) using the refined coordinates of the P3<sub>1</sub>21 crystal form as a search model for the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>and Shh crystal structure (PDB code 1VHH). Refinement of all structures was done with Refmac (Winn, M. D. et al. (2001) <i>Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. </i>57: 122-133). Crystallography statistics are summarized in Table 7.</p>

<p id="p-0579" num="0591">The high affinity between Hip<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>and Shh allowed isolation of a stable complex with 1:1 stoichiometry was isolated by size exclusion chromatography.

The asymmetric unit contained two Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>molecules in the same orientation as in the apo form, and two Shh molecules, each creating a 1:1 heterodimeric complex. However, the density for one of the Shh molecules was extremely poor due to the lack of stabilizing crystal packing interactions; this copy of Shh was not included in the final model.</p>

<p id="p-0581" num="0593">The Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>fragment present in our crystal structures contains a canonical six-bladed &#x3b2;-propeller domain and two EGF domains, with the overall structure resembling a lollipop (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). The &#x3b2;-propeller domain represents the head (65&#xd7;50&#xd7;50 &#x212b;<sup>3</sup>) of the lollipop and the two EGF domains create the stalk (40&#xd7;15&#xd7;15 &#x212b;<sup>3</sup>). Four intra-domain disulfide bonds are present within the &#x3b2;-propeller and three within each of the EGF domains. The structures of Shh and the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>&#x3b2;-propeller core remain largely unchanged upon complex formation (Shh rmsd=0.38 &#x212b; (residues 40-187); (Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>rmsd=0.39 &#x212b; (residues 215-606), with the exception of peripheral Shh-binding loops in Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>which are generally more well-defined in the complex.</p>
<p id="p-0582" num="0594">A search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the SSM program (Krissinel and Henrick, 2004) revealed that the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>&#x3b2;-propeller domain superimposed best with X-ray structures of soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenases from bacteria and archea (PDB codes 2ISM, 2G8S and 1CRU), with rmsds ranging from 2.2-2.4 &#x212b; over 271-284 aligned C<sub>&#x3b1;</sub> positions with a sequence identity of 23%. These proteins are members of a larger family of bacterial and archael enzymes that notably utilize a highly reactive pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor that binds in the central cavity of their six-bladed &#x3b2;-propeller folds (Oubrie, 2003). Close inspection of the superimposed &#x3b2;-propellers of Hhip1 and these select dehydrogenases reveal that Hhip1 lacks the PQQ-coordinating residues and the corresponding binding pocket is both smaller and more solvent-exposed. The observed structural relationship of Hhip1 with a clan of bacterial PQQ-dependent enzymes raises the interesting question of whether the mammalian Hhip1 family is a very divergent branch that has lost enzyme function but gained a new protein interaction role.</p>

<heading id="h-0043" level="1">B. The EGF1 Domain Intimately Associates with the &#x3b2;-propeller</heading>
<p id="p-0584" num="0596">In the five crystallographically independent structures of Hhip1, three for the apo form and two bound to Shh, the &#x3b2;-propeller and EGF1 domains superimpose well, suggesting that they form a rigid unit (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>). EGF1 is spatially restrained by an intimate interaction with blades 2 and 3 of the &#x3b2;-propeller. The resulting interface between the two domains is hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic in nature, with a disulfide bond formed between C402 in blade 3 of the &#x3b2;-propeller and C624 in EGF1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>). The intimate nature of this interaction explains the instability of the Hip<sub>p </sub>construct lacking the EGF1 domain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The close interaction between the Hhip &#x3b2;-propeller and EGF1 domain resembles the contacts made between the second and third blade of the six-bladed &#x3b2;-propeller domain of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and its C-terminal EGF domain (Jeon et al., 2001). Notably, the interface is considerably larger in the case of LDLR with hydrophobic side chains predominating. Unlike EGF1, the orientation of EGF2 with respect to the &#x3b2;-propeller shows significant variation, probably due to the inherent flexibility of the linker region between the two EGF domains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>). The flexibility here and most likely between EGF2 domain and the membrane implies there is some conformational freedom in the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12ECD </sub>with respect to the plasma membrane.</p>
<heading id="h-0044" level="1">C. Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>Interacts with Shh Via Three Loops</heading>
<p id="p-0585" num="0597">The Shh binding site is localized at the periphery of the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>&#x3b2;-propeller domain, distant from the EGF stalk (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> A and B). Three loops from the second and third blades of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>(L1: 309-314, L2: 376-388 and L3: 417-422) contact a region of Shh centered on the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-containing groove (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> A-C). The L1 and L2 loops show evidence of multiple conformations in the apo Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>structures, indicating that binding Shh restricts their conformation. The interface is large, comprising 23 Hhip1 residues and 29 Shh residues accounting for 870 &#x212b;<sup>2 </sup>and 780 &#x212b;<sup>2 </sup>buried solvent accessible surface area, respectively. The location and the extent of the interaction is consistent with our in vitro binding data, which show that the minimal region for binding resides within the protein fragment encompassing the &#x3b2;-propeller and EGF1 (Table 6). Although the EGF1 domain does not contact Shh, it is nonetheless required since it stabilizes the &#x3b2;-propeller (vide supra). Interestingly, the N- and C-termini of Shh, which are lipid-modified in vivo, as well as the C-terminus of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>are all on the same side of the complex, suggesting that both components could be anchored to the same cell membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0586" num="0598">The Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>L2 loop inserts deeply into the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-containing groove of Shh and constitutes the heart of the interaction. Approximately 500 &#x212b;<sup>2 </sup>of the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>L2 surface is in direct contact with Shh, which accounts for &#x2dc;60% of total Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>surface in contact with Shh. Extensive side chain interactions between Shh and the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>L2 loop are present in addition to some main chain-side chain interactions. Intriguingly, D383 in the L2 loop of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>directly interacts with the Zn<sup>2+</sup> cation in Shh, resulting in tetrahedral coordination (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>). In the high-resolution apo murine Shh structure (Hall, T. M. et al. (1995) <i>Nature </i>378:212-216) a water molecule replaces D383 while the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating residues H141, D148, and H183 in Shh (H140, D147, H182 in human Shh) are identical in the bound and apo structures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 8B</figref>). In contrast to the extensive interactions made by the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>L2 loop, the L1 and L3 loops' contacts appear more superficial and involve significantly smaller surface area on the periphery of the binding site (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>).

<p id="p-0589" num="0601">Consistent with the notion that interaction of Hip<sub>&#x3b2;1 </sub>with Shh is dependent upon Zn<sup>2+</sup>, binding was completely abolished in the presence of EDTA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>). Importantly, loss of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> cation does not have a significant effect on Shh structure or stability, as shown by virtually identical NMR spectra in the absence or presence of EDTA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>). Minor spectral differences are consistent with local changes to the zinc-binding residues upon displacement of Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, the tertiary structure of Shh is nearly identical to that of <i>Drosophila </i>Hh (McLellan, J. S. et al. (2006) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although EDTA can also sequester other divalent cations (see Ca<sup>2+</sup> site below) we believe that Zn<sup>2+</sup> interaction is critical for complex assembly since the Zn<sup>2+</sup> is the only Shh-bound divalent cation that directly interacts with Hhip1.</p>
<heading id="h-0047" level="1">B. Role of L1, L2 and L3 in Hedgehog Binding</heading>
<p id="p-0590" num="0602">In order to assess the contribution of residues in the Hhip1 L1, L2 and L3 loops for binding to Shh, a series of single alanine Hip<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>mutants were made using the QuickChange DNA mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the manufacturer's protocol, and their affinity for Shh was measured by bio-layer interferometry (as described in Example 2B). These mutations included Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>mutants 1312A, E381A, M382A, D383A, D378A, T418A, Q420A, E380A, D387A and &#x394;L2.</p>
<p id="p-0591" num="0603">The results are shown in Table 6 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4E and 4F</figref>. As expected, deletion of the entire L2 loop (Hhip1<sub>&#x394;L2</sub>) abrogated binding to Shh. The importance of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> cation for bridging the interaction between Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>and Shh was also further highlighted by the inability of the D383A L2 and D383R Hhip L2 mutants to bind Shh. Alanine substitutions at L2 residues E380, M382, and D387 also abolished binding to Shh. Residues E380 and D387 have direct interactions with Shh, while M382 does not contact Shh and likely functions by stabilizing the L2 loop in a conformation that is competent for binding. Two other mutations in L2, D378A and E380A, had minor to moderate effects on Shh binding (Table 6, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>). Unlike the changes in the L2 loop, single alanine mutations in the L1 (1312A) or L3 (T418A, Q420A) loops had little effect on Shh, binding with K<sub>D </sub>values comparable to WT Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>(Table 6, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>). The alanine mutant affinity data are consistent with the hypothesis that the L2 loop is the major energetic determinant for Shh binding.</p>
<p id="p-0592" num="0604">Somewhat unexpectedly, the D383A mutant retained activity in the more complex and physiologically relevant Gli-luciferase co-culture assay (See Example 3A for protocol), having an IC<sub>50 </sub>&#x2dc;10 nM, only 2-fold higher than observed for wildtype Hip<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>. However, the inhibition was incomplete (&#x2dc;85%) at saturating conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0593" num="0605">Adverse steric and charge effects at this position (D383R) resulted in a &#x2dc;13-fold reduction in IC<sub>50 </sub>(57 nM) and maximal inhibition of only &#x2dc;50%. As expected, there was no inhibitory activity observed with the Hhip&#x394;L2 mutant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>). Since no additional divalent metal ions were added in the protein binding assays, sub-saturating concentrations could explain differences found in the cell-based assay; further Hhip-Shh binding studies are needed to better define the dependence on divalent metal ions. The complexity of Hhip-Shh interactions in cell-based assays could also arise from interactions absent in binding assays, e.g., lipid modifications on Shh. Moreover, the presence of a highly conserved acidic area on the surface of the Hhip-Shh complex suggests a potential interaction site for additional regulators (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0594" num="0606">Another mutant, I312A, that bound Shh similar to wildtype Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>(Table 6) was essentially identical to wildtype Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>in the cell-based activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>). The complexity of Hip-Shh interaction in cell-based assays may include additional or compensatory interactions absent in the binding assay, which uses unmodified recombinant Shh. The N-terminal palmitoyl and C-terminal cholesterol modifications of Shh present in the cell-based assays likely anchor Shh to the cell membrane, restricting its mobility and priming it for Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>binding. Furthermore, the Hhip1 EGF2 domain may mediate additional interactions as it has a small effect on inhibition in the co-culture assay, even though it does not directly contact Shh in the crystal structure and does not appear to contribute to binding in vitro (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, Table 6).</p>

<heading id="h-0049" level="1">The Complex Suggests a Rationale for Type A1 Brachydactyly Ihh Genetic Mutations</heading>
<p id="p-0595" num="0607">Genetic data on Hh and other Hh family members highlights the importance of the Shh pseudo-active site groove and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site. These mutations can have a profound effect, although it is unclear for most of them whether this is due to impaired interactions with Ptch1 and/or with modulatory receptors. For instance, deletion of E176-K178, which contributes to one wall of the pseudo-active site groove, is associated with microcephaly and a partial corpus collosum. In addition, several Ihh mutations (E95G/K, D100E/N, R128Q, T130N, E131K and T154I corresponding to Shh residues E90, D95, R123, T125, E126 and T149, respectively; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) are associated with brachydactyly type A1, an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder characterized by shortening of the middle phalanges<sup>43,44,45,47,48,49</sup>. These mutations map to two sites in Shh: the pseudo-active site (R123, T125, T149) and the adjacent Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site (E90, D95, E126) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>). In the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding groove T125 and T149 both pack against R123 and contribute to the groove surface. In addition, R123 provides a complementary charge for residue E380 in Hhip (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>). The Ihh mutations T1541, R128Q, T130N are all solvent exposed and are unlikely to alter the Ihh fold although the R128Q mutation may diminish electrostatic interactions with binding partners. The relatively benign nature of these three heterozygous mutations contrasts with the embryonic lethality in mice of the Ihh knockout<sup>50</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0596" num="0608">The other type A1 bradydactyly-associated mutations in Ihh (E95G/K, D100E/N and E131K (Gao B. et al. (2001) <i>Nat. Genet. </i>28:386-388; Kirkpatrick T. J. et al.

Shh side chains E90, D95 and E126, corresponding to the Ihh residues above, and the backbone carbonyl of W128, coordinate a putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> cation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>). Alteration of any of these acidic side chains will likely adversely affect divalent cation binding to Shh or Ihh. The evolutionary association between the cation-coordinating side chains and this inheritable disease suggest that this site is functionally important in Hh signaling.</p>

<heading id="h-0051" level="1">Hip-Shh Interactions Resemble Inhibitor-Metalloprotease Interactions</heading>
<p id="p-0597" num="0609">Although both the geometry of Zn<sup>2+</sup> cation coordination and the overall Shh fold is topologically similar to the MD clan of metalloproteases (Bochtler, M. et al. (2004) <i>Protein Sci. </i>13:854-861; Bussiere, D. E. et al. (1998) <i>Mol. Cell. </i>2:75-84; Hall, T. M. et al. (1995) <i>Nature </i>378:212-216; Rawlings, N. D. et al. (2008) <i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>36:D320-325), no enzymatic activity has been reported for Shh (Fuse, N. et al. (1999) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>96:10992-10999). Mutation of key residues at the pseudo-active site has shown that Shh functions as a ligand for Ptch and not as a protease (Fuse, N. et al. (1999) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>96:10992-10999). Our Hip-Shh complex structure is therefore the first example of Shh utilizing its metalloprotease-like fold to regulate the Hh pathway. The Zn<sup>2+</sup>-containing groove of Shh, which is akin to the protease substrate/inhibitor binding cleft, is occupied by the L2 loop of Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>with D383 coordinating the Zn<sup>2+</sup>. This mode of interaction is analogous to that of the TIMP1-MMP3 complex (Gomis-Ruth, F. X. et al. (1997) <i>Nature </i>389:77-81), where the MMP3 active site groove is occupied by a continuous loop from its inhibitor, TIMP1. In the TIMP-MMP3 structure, as in the Hip-Shh complex, the inhibitor completes the Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordination sphere. The Hip-Shh structure suggests that Shh may have evolved from a catalytically competent ancestor which lost its proteolytic activity while retaining some aspects of the protease-inhibitor binding mode to regulate pathway activity. Involvement of non-catalytic proteases as a binding partner has been observed in other important signaling pathways. For instance, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a plasminogen-like &#x3b1;/&#x3b2;-heterodimeric growth factor and the ligand for Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase (Birchmeier, C. et al. (2003) <i>Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>4:915-925). The HGF &#x3b2;-chain serine protease-like domain interacts with the &#x3b2;-propeller of the Met receptor via its pseudo-active site, yet HGF lacks any catalytic activity (Kirchhofer, D. et al. (2004) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>279:39915-39924; Stamos, J. et al. (2004) <i>EMBO J. </i>23:2325-2335).</p>
<p id="p-0598" num="0610">If Hhip acts as a decoy receptor for Shh, preventing it from binding to Ptch1 and thereby inhibiting signaling, then Hhip1 and Ptch1 should compete for Shh. We therefore examined whether soluble Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>could compete Shh from binding to Ptch1-expressing 293 cells by FACS. Fluorescent Shh<sub>649 </sub>bound specifically to Ptch1-293 cells with an EC50 of &#x2dc;2 nM (data not shown) and could be competed with unlabeled Shh or Ihh in a dose dependent manner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15J</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0599" num="0611">Indeed both Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>-FC inhibit Ptch1-specific Shh cell binding in a dose-dependent manner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15I and 15J</figref>). In contrast, mutants that do not bind to Shh (Table 6), such as Hhip&#x394;L2 or Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>D383R, and His<sub>6</sub>-(SEQ ID NO: 87) or Fc-tagged controls show no inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15J</figref>). The high affinity neutralizing anti-Shh monoclonal antibody 5E134 also competes Shh binding to Ptch1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15I and 15J</figref>) as well as to Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). Moreover, the 5E1 epitope on Shh partially overlaps with the Hhip binding site (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Thus, since the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>, Ptch1 and 5E1 binding sites overlap, this further confirms that Ptch1 and Hhip compete for Shh and indicates that they either share a common binding site or have binding sites in close proximity such that steric hindrance results in competition.</p>

<heading id="h-0053" level="1">Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>Binding to Shh Differs from Ihog Interaction with <i>Drosophila </i>Hh</heading>
<p id="p-0600" num="0612">The interaction observed between Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>and Shh differs from that of <i>Drosophila </i>Hh and Ihog (McLellan, J. S. et al. (2006) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>103:17208-17213), the only other Hh-receptor complex structure available to date. The two complexes differ both in their types and location of intermolecular interactions. The Ihog-Hh complex requires heparin, which not only bridges the two binding partners, but also facilitates Ihog dimerization. In contrast, the Hip-Shh interaction is heparin-independent and the presence of heparin, at least in vitro, does not lead to the formation of higher order Hhip oligomers (data not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0601" num="0613">Despite the structural homology between <i>Drosophila </i>Hh and Shh, Ihog and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>bind to distinct surfaces on these ligands. Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>binds Shh at its pseudo-active site whereas Ihog binds to a surface localized to the side of the molecule around the second helix (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). Moreover, the structural elements of Ihog and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>responsible for ligand binding are fundamentally different. While Ihog uses one of its fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains to bind <i>Drosophila </i>Hh, the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>&#x3b2;-propeller mediates interactions with Shh. The two mammalian homologs of Ihog, Cdon and Boc, have been suggested to bind Shh in an Ihog-like manner (Yao, S. et al. (2006) <i>Cell </i>125:343-357), which does not involve the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-containing groove, thereby leaving this surface available to interact with Hhip1. Although Hhip1 and Ihog have distinct binding sites on Shh and Hh, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>), superposition of the two complexes reveals adverse steric interactions of the FNIII domain with Hhip1 that occur away from the binding site. This suggests that either Hhip1 and Cdon/Boc cannot bind simultaneously to Shh or if they can, that Cdon/Boc do not bind Shh in an Ihog-like manner (vide infra).</p>
<p id="p-0602" num="0614">The crucial role of Hh signaling in development, disease and cancer clearly illustrates the need for tight regulation. A number of plasma membrane-associated receptors are involved in relaying the Hh signal. To better understand the mechanism by which Hhip1 inhibits Shh signaling, we determined the structure of the complex between Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>and Shh, which led to several important and unexpected findings. First, the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-containing groove in the pseudo-active site of Shh does indeed play a critical biochemical and biological role. Hhip1 utilizes this site to regulate the biological activity of Shh. Second, binding of Shh to a Ptch peptide, homologous to the Hhip1 L2 loop, suggests that Hhip1 and Ptch share a common binding mode to Hh homologs and strengthens the notion that Hhip1 acts as a competitive decoy receptor for Ptch. Finally, other Shh receptors such as Cdon/Boc can bind to the Hip-Shh complex, which permits us to begin putting the biological function of these proteins into a structural context. We propose that Cdon/Boc act as co-receptors for Shh, which leads to either signaling or inhibition of the pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0603" num="0615">Here we show that a soluble fragment of Hhip1 (Hip<sub>&#x3b2;12</sub>) that tightly binds Shh is a potent inhibitor of Hh signaling. While most reported Hh signaling inhibitors are small molecules that bind to Smo (Kiselyov et al. (2007) <i>Expert Opin. Ther. Targets </i>11:1087-1101), the monoclonal antibody 5E1 remains the only potent pathway inhibitor that binds Hh ligands (Ericson et al. (1996) <i>Cell </i>87:661-663). The critical interactions of Hhip1 with the Shh pseudo-active site can be captured by a peptide derived from its L2 loop as well as a peptide from Ptch. Thus antibodies, peptides or small molecules that bind with high affinity to the Shh pseudo-active site should all inhibit Hh signaling. Antibodies directed towards the Shh binding site on Ptch may do the same. This opens up several new opportunities to design novel antagonists of Hh signaling for use in cell biology and therapeutic areas.</p>

<p id="p-0604" num="0616">Mapping the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>and Ihog binding sites on Shh and <i>Drosophila </i>Hh shows there are at least two distinct binding sites between surface receptors and Hh homologs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). Ptch interactions with Shh have been defined by affinity and activity of Shh surface mutants (Fuse, N. et al. (1999) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>96: 10992-10999; Pepinsky, R. B. et al. (2000) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>275:10995-11001) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, right panel). Since Cdon/Boc directly binds to Shh and enhances signaling through Ptch (Tenzen, T. et al. (2006) Dev. Cell 10: 647-56; Yao, S. et al. (2006) <i>Cell </i>125:343-357), Shh mutants that abrogate Cdon/Boc binding may have indirect consequences on Ptch interaction with Shh and downstream signaling. In order to determine candidate regions of Ptch that might contact Shh, we looked for sequence similarities between Ptch and Hhip1, as well as between Ptch and Ihog. This analysis identified a stretch of residues in the second ectodomain of Ptch, between transmembrane helices 7 and 8, which had striking sequence similarity with the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>L2 loop, thereby suggesting the presence of a similar loop in Ptch (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Asp or Glu residues occupy position 0, except in <i>C. elegans </i>where Ser is found. In all cases, Gly is found at position 1 and Thr is the predominant residue in the &#x2212;8 position. Moreover, the overwhelming presence of hydrophobic residues at positions &#x2212;7, &#x2212;4, &#x2212;1 and 2 is consistent with a role in stabilizing an L2-like loop. In agreement with our analysis, removal of the entire extracellular domain between transmembrane helices 7 and 8 of Ptch results in a loss of Shh binding, while conserving the ability to repress Smo (Briscoe et al.

A competition binding assay revealed that a fragment of murine Cdon containing its 3 FNIII domains fused to thioredoxin (mCdon<sub>FN1-3</sub>) does not compete with Hhip1 for binding to Shh (data not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0610" num="0622">In order to find a possible binding site for Cdon/Boc (or other interactors in vivo), we mapped the sequence conservation among Shh and Hhip1 orthologs. Sequence analysis revealed a highly-conserved acidic area on the surface of the Shh-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>complex (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>). We propose that this region contains a potential interaction site for additional signaling binding partners such as Cdon/Boc.</p>
<p id="p-0611" num="0623">Based on our structures and binding data discussed above, we propose the following simple model for Hip/Ptch regulation of the Hh pathway (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>). Lipid-modified Shh anchored in the cell membrane first binds to Cdon/Boc. Depending upon the cellular milieu, the Shh-Cdon/Boc complex could then further interact with either Ptch or Hhip1. Complex formation of Shh with Ptch would stimulate Hh signaling (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), while complex formation with Hhip1 would sequester Shh and inhibit the pathway (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). This suggests a primary role for Hhip1 in Hh signaling as an inhibitory structural decoy receptor for Ptch.</p>
<p id="p-0612" num="0624">Genetic data on Hh and other Hh family members highlights the importance of the Shh pseudo-active site groove and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site. These mutations can have a profound effect, although it is unclear for most of them whether this is due to impaired interactions with Ptch1 and/or with modulatory receptors. For instance, deletion of E176-K178, which contributes to one wall of the pseudo-active site groove, is associated with microcephaly and a partial corpus collosum.</p>

<p id="p-0614" num="0626">The DNA sequence encoding Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>is initially amplified using selected PCR primers. The primers should contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the selected expression vector. A variety of expression vectors may be employed. An example of a suitable vector is pBR322 (derived from <i>E. coli</i>; see Bolivar et al., (1977) <i>Gene, </i>2:95) which contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance. The vector is digested with restriction enzyme and dephosphorylated. The PCR amplified sequences are then ligated into the vector. The vector will preferably include sequences which encode for an antibiotic resistance gene, a trp promoter, a polyhis leader (including the first six STII codons, polyhis sequence, and enterokinase cleavage site), the Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>coding region, lambda transcriptional terminator, and an argU gene.</p>
<p id="p-0615" num="0627">The ligation mixture is then used to transform a selected <i>E. coli </i>strain using the methods described in Sambrook et al., supra. Transformants are identified by their ability to grow on LB plates and antibiotic resistant colonies are then selected. Plasmid DNA can be isolated and confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing.</p>
<p id="p-0616" num="0628">Selected clones can be grown overnight in liquid culture medium such as LB broth supplemented with antibiotics. The overnight culture may subsequently be used to inoculate a larger scale culture. The cells are then grown to a desired optical density, during which the expression promoter is turned on</p>
<p id="p-0617" num="0629">After culturing the cells for several more hours, the cells can be harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet obtained by the centrifugation can be solubilized using various agents known in the art, and the solubilized Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>protein can then be purified using a metal chelating column under conditions that allow tight binding of the protein.</p>
<p id="p-0618" num="0630">Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>may be expressed in <i>E. coli </i>in a poly-His tagged form, using the following procedure. The DNA encoding Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>is initially amplified using selected PCR primers. The primers will contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the selected expression vector, and other useful sequences providing for efficient and reliable translation initiation, rapid purification on a metal chelation column, and proteolytic removal with enterokinase. The PCR-amplified, poly-His tagged sequences are then ligated into an expression vector, which is used to transform an <i>E. coli </i>host based on strain 52 (W3110 fuhA(tonA) lon galE rpoHts(htpRts) clpP(lacIq). Transformants are first grown in LB containing 50 mg/ml carbenicillin at 30&#xb0; C. with shaking until an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 3-5 is reached. Cultures are then diluted 50-100 fold into CRAP media (prepared by mixing 3.57 g (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.71 g sodium citrate.2H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.07 g KCl, 5.36 g Difco yeast extract, 5.36 g Sheffield hycase SF in 500 ml water, as well as 110 mM MPOS, pH 7.3, 0.55% (w/v) glucose and 7 mM MgSO4) and grown for approximately 20-30 hours at 30&#xb0; C. with shaking. Samples are removed to verify expression by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the bulk culture is centrifuged to pellet the cells. Cell pellets are frozen until purification and refolding.</p>
<p id="p-0619" num="0631"><i>E. coli </i>paste from 0.5 to 1 L fermentations (6-10 g pellets) is resuspended in 10 volumes (w/v) in 7 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris, pH 8 buffer. Solid sodium sulfite and sodium tetrathionate is added to make final concentrations of 0.1 M and 0.02 M, respectively, and the solution is stirred overnight at 4&#xb0; C. This step results in a denatured protein with all cysteine residues blocked by sulfitolization. The solution is centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ultracentifuge for 30 min. The supernatant is diluted with 3-5 volumes of metal chelate column buffer (6 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) and filtered through 0.22 micron filters to clarify. The clarified extract is loaded onto a 5 ml Qiagen Ni-NTA metal chelate column equilibrated in the metal chelate column buffer. The column is washed with additional buffer containing 50 mM imidazole (Calbiochem, Utrol grade), pH 7.4. The protein is eluted with buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. Fractions containing the desired protein are pooled and stored at 4&#xb0; C. Protein concentration is estimated by its absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficient based on its amino acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0620" num="0632">The proteins are refolded by diluting the sample slowly into freshly prepared refolding buffer consisting of: 20 mM Tris, pH 8.6, 0.3 M NaCl, 2.5 M urea, 5 mM cysteine, 20 mM glycine and 1 mM EDTA. Refolding volumes are chosen so that the final protein concentration is between 50 to 100 micrograms/ml. The refolding solution is stirred gently at 4&#xb0; C. for 12-36 hours. The refolding reaction is quenched by the addition of TFA to a final concentration of 0.4% (pH of approximately 3). Before further purification of the protein, the solution is filtered through a 0.22 micron filter and acetonitrile is added to 2-10% final concentration. The refolded protein is chromatographed on a Poros R1/H reversed phase column using a mobile buffer of 0.1% TFA with elution with a gradient of acetonitrile from 10 to 80%. Aliquots of fractions with A280 absorbance are analyzed on SDS polyacrylamide gels and fractions containing homogeneous refolded protein are pooled. Generally, the properly refolded species of most proteins are eluted at the lowest concentrations of acetonitrile since those species are the most compact with their hydrophobic interiors shielded from interaction with the reversed phase resin. Aggregated species are usually eluted at higher acetonitrile concentrations. In addition to resolving misfolded forms of proteins from the desired form, the reversed phase step also removes endotoxin from the samples.</p>
<p id="p-0621" num="0633">Fractions containing the desired folded Hhip1 polypeptide are pooled and the acetonitrile removed using a gentle stream of nitrogen directed at the solution.

<p id="p-0624" num="0636">In one embodiment, the selected host cells may be 293 cells. Human 293 cells (ATCC CCL 1573) are grown to confluence in tissue culture plates in medium such as DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum and optionally, nutrient components and/or antibiotics. About 10 &#x3bc;g pRK5-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>DNA is mixed with about 1 &#x3bc;g DNA encoding the VA RNA gene (Thimmappaya et al.

The precipitate is suspended and added to the 293 cells and allowed to settle for about four hours at 37&#xb0; C. The culture medium is aspirated off and 2 ml of 20% glycerol in PBS is added for 30 seconds. The 293 cells are then washed with serum free medium, fresh medium is added and the cells are incubated for about 5 days.</p>
<p id="p-0625" num="0637">Approximately 24 hours after the transfections, the culture medium is removed and replaced with culture medium (alone) or culture medium containing 200 &#x3bc;Ci/ml <sup>35</sup>S-cysteine and 200 &#x3bc;Ci/ml <sup>35</sup>S-methionine.

After about four days, the conditioned media is centrifuged and filtered to remove cells and debris.

<p id="p-0627" num="0639">In another embodiment, Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>can be expressed in CHO cells.

As described above, the cell cultures can be incubated, and the medium replaced with culture medium (alone) or medium containing a radiolabel such as <sup>35</sup>S-methionine. After determining the presence of a Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide, the culture medium may be replaced with serum free medium. Preferably, the cultures are incubated for about 6 days, and then the conditioned medium is harvested.

CHO expression vectors are constructed to have compatible restriction sites 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; of the DNA of interest to allow the convenient shuttling of cDNA's. The vector used for expression in CHO cells is as described in Lucas et al. (1996) <i>Nucl.

Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl (&#x201c;MC&#x201d;), maleimidopropanoyl (&#x201c;MP&#x201d;), valine-citrulline (&#x201c;val-cit&#x201d;), alanine-phenylalanine (&#x201c;ala-phe&#x201d;), p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (&#x201c;PAB&#x201d;), N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate (&#x201c;SPP&#x201d;), N-Succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 carboxylate (&#x201c;SMCC&#x2019;), and N-Succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl) aminobenzoate (&#x201c;SIAB&#x201d;). Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0649" num="0661">In some embodiments, the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine-phenylalanine (af or ala-phe). Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine-valine-citrulline (gly-val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (gly-gly-gly). Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.</p>
<p id="p-0650" num="0662">Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues).</p>
<p id="p-0651" num="0663">Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic subsituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan &#x26; Stroh, (1992) <i>Bioconjugate Chem. </i>3:138-146; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.</p>
<p id="p-0652" num="0664">Alternatively, a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.</p>
<p id="p-0653" num="0665">In yet another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a &#x201c;receptor&#x201d; (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a &#x201c;ligand&#x201d; (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).</p>
<p id="p-0654" num="0666">Specific techniques for producing antibody-drug conjugates by linking toxins to purified antibodies are well known and routinely employed in the art. For example, conjugation of a purified monoclonal antibody to the toxin DM1 may be accomplished as follows. Purified antibody is derivatized with N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate to introduce dithiopyridyl groups. Antibody (376.0 mg, 8 mg/ml) in 44.7 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing NaCl (50 mM) and EDTA (1 mM) is treated with SPP (5.3 molar equivalents in 2.3 ml ethanol). After incubation for 90 minutes under argon at ambient temperature, the reaction mixture is gel filtered through a Sephadex&#xae; G25 column equilibrated with 35 mM sodium citrate, 154 mM NaCl and 2 mM EDTA. Antibody containing fractions are then pooled and assayed. Antibody-SPP-Py (337.0 mg with releasable 2-thiopyridine groups) is diluted with the above 35 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.5, to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. DM1 (1.7 equivalents, 16.1 mols) in 3.0 mM dimethylacetamide (DMA, 3% v/v in the final reaction mixture) is then added to the antibody solution. The reaction is allowed to proceed at ambient temperature under argon for 20 hours. The reaction is loaded on a Sephacryl&#xae; S300 gel filtration column (5.0 cm.times.90.0 cm, 1.77 L) equilibrated with 35 mM sodium citrate, 154 mM NaCl, pH 6.5. The flow rate is 5.0 ml/min and 65 fractions (20.0 ml each) are collected. Fractions are pooled and assayed, wherein the number of DM1 drug molecules linked per antibody molecule (p&#x2032;) is determined by measuring the absorbance at 252 nm and 280 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0655" num="0667">For illustrative purposes, conjugation of a purified monoclonal antibody to the toxin DM1 may also be accomplished as follows. Purified antibody is derivatized with (Succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC, Pierce Biotechnology, Inc) to introduce the SMCC linker. The antibody is treated at 20 mg/ml in 50 mM potassium phosphate/50 mM sodium chloride/2 mM EDTA, pH 6.5 with 7.5 molar equivalents of SMCC (20 mM in DMSO, 6.7 mg/ml). After stirring for 2 hours under argon at ambient temperature, the reaction mixture is filtered through a Sephadex&#xae;G25 column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate/50 mM sodium chloride/2 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. Antibody containing fractions are pooled and assayed. Antibody-SMCC is then diluted with 50 mM potassium phosphate/50 mM sodium chloride/2 mM EDTA, pH 6.5, to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, and reacted with a 10 mM solution of DM1 (1.7 equivalents assuming 5 SMCC/antibody, 7.37 mg/ml) in dimethylacetamide. The reaction is stirred at ambient temperature under argon 16.5 hours. The conjugation reaction mixture is then filtered through a Sephadex&#xae; G25 gel filtration column (1.5.times.4.9 cm) with 1.times.PBS at pH 6.5. The DM1/antibody ratio (p) is then measured by the absorbance at 252 nm and at 280 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0656" num="0668">Moreover, a free cysteine on an antibody of choice may be modified by the bis-maleimido reagent BM(PEO)4 (Pierce Chemical), leaving an unreacted maleimido group on the surface of the antibody. This may be accomplished by dissolving BM(PEO)4 in a 50% ethanol/water mixture to a concentration of 10 mM and adding a tenfold molar excess to a solution containing the antibody in phosphate buffered saline at a concentration of approximately 1.6 mg/ml (10 micromolar) and allowing it to react for 1 hour. Excess BM (PEO)4 is removed by gel filtration in 30 mM citrate, pH 6 with 150 mM NaCl buffer. An approximate 10 fold molar excess DM1 is dissolved in dimethyl acetamide (DMA) and added to the antibody-BMPEO intermediate. Dimethyl formamide (DMF) may also be employed to dissolve the drug moiety reagent. The reaction mixture is allowed to react overnight before gel filtration or dialysis into PBS to remove unreacted drug. Gel filtration on S200 columns in PBS is used to remove high molecular weight aggregates and furnish purified antibody-BMPEO-DM1 conjugate.</p>
<p id="p-0657" num="0669">Cytotoxic drugs have typically been conjugated to antibodies through the often numerous lysine residues of the antibody. Conjugation through thiol groups present, or engineered into, the antibody of interest has also been accomplished. For example, cysteine residues have been introduced into proteins by genetic engineering techniques to form covalent attachment sites for ligands (Better et al. (1994) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>13:9644-9650; Bernhard et al. (1994) <i>Bioconjugate Chem. </i>5:126-132; Greenwood et al. (1994) <i>Therapeutic Immunol. </i>1:247-255; Tu et al. (1999) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>96:4862-4867; Kanno et al. (2000) <i>J. Biotechnology, </i>76:207-214; Chmura et al. (2001) <i>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA </i>98(15):8480-8484; U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,564). Once a free cysteine residue exists in the antibody of interest, toxins can be linked to that site. As an example, the drug linker reagents, maleimidocaproyl-monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), i.e. MC-MMAE, maleimidocaproyl-monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), i.e. MC-MMAF, MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE or MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAF, dissolved in DMSO, is diluted in acetonitrile and water at known concentration, and added to chilled cysteine-derivatized antibody in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After about one hour, an excess of maleimide is added to quench the reaction and cap any unreacted antibody thiol groups. The reaction mixture is concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and the toxin conjugated antibody is purified and desalted by elution through G25 resin in PBS, filtered through 0.2 m filters under sterile conditions, and frozen for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0658" num="0670">Additionally, anti-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>antibodies of the present invention may be conjugated to auristatin and dolostatin toxins (such as MMAE and MMAF) using the following technique. Antibody, dissolved in 500 mM sodium borate and 500 mM sodium chloride at pH 8.0 is treated with an excess of 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). After incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for about 30 minutes, the buffer is exchanged by elution over Sephadex&#xae; G25 resin and eluted with PBS with 1 mM DTPA. The thiol/Ab value is checked by determining the reduced antibody concentration from the absorbance at 280 nm of the solution and the thiol concentration by reaction with DTNB (Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis.) and determination of the absorbance at 412 nm. The reduced antibody dissolved in PBS is chilled on ice.</p>
<p id="p-0659" num="0671">The drug linker reagent, (1) maleimidocaproyl-monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), i.e. MC-MMAE, (2) MC-MMAF, (3) MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE, or (4) MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAF dissolved in DMSO, is diluted in acetonitrile and water at known concentration, and added to the chilled reduced antibody in PBS. After about one hour, an excess of maleimide is added to quench the reaction and cap any unreacted antibody thiol groups. The reaction mixture is concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and the conjuagted antibody is purified and desalted by elution through G25 resin in PBS, filtered through 0.2 m filters under sterile conditions, and frozen for storage.</p>

<heading id="h-0070" level="1">Purification of Hhip1 polypeptides Using Specific Antibodies</heading>
<p id="p-0660" num="0672">Native or recombinant Hhip1 polypeptides may be purified by a variety of standard techniques in the art of protein purification. For example, pro-Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide, mature Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide, or pre-Hhip1 polypeptide is purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies specific for the Hhip1 polypeptide of interest. In general, an immunoaffinity column is constructed by covalently coupling the anti-Hhip1 polypeptide antibody to an activated chromatographic resin.</p>
<p id="p-0661" num="0673">Polyclonal immunoglobulins are prepared from immune sera either by precipitation with ammonium sulfate or by purification on immobilized Protein A (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, N.J.). Likewise, monoclonal antibodies are prepared from mouse ascites fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation or chromatography on immobilized Protein A. Partially purified immunoglobulin is covalently attached to a chromatographic resin such as CnBr-activated SEPHAROSE&#x2122; (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology). The antibody is coupled to the resin, the resin is blocked, and the derivative resin is washed according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0662" num="0674">Such an immunoaffinity column is utilized in the purification of Hhip1 polypeptide by preparing a fraction from cells containing Hhip1 polypeptide in a soluble form. This preparation is derived by solubilization of the whole cell or of a subcellular fraction obtained via differential centrifugation by the addition of detergent or by other methods well known in the art. Alternatively, soluble Hhip1 polypeptide containing a signal sequence may be secreted in useful quantity into the medium in which the cells are grown.</p>
<p id="p-0663" num="0675">A soluble Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide-containing preparation is passed over the immunoaffinity column, and the column is washed under conditions that allow the preferential absorbance of Hhip1 polypeptide (e.g., high ionic strength buffers in the presence of detergent). Then, the column is eluted under conditions that disrupt antibody/Hhip1 polypeptide binding (e.g., a low pH buffer such as approximately pH 2-3, or a high concentration of a chaotrope such as urea or thiocyanate ion), and Hhip1<sub>&#x3b2;12 </sub>polypeptide is collected.</p>
<p id="p-0664" num="0676">The foregoing written specification is considered to be sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention. The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific illustrations disclosed herein. Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
