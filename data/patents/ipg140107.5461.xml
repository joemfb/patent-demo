<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The field of the invention relates to online information systems, and more specifically, to online systems having communities of users that share ideas.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The phenomenon of like-minded people going online to share ideas, trade, or compete is well-accepted. In moving from the physical world to the digital one, users create virtual &#x201c;communities&#x201d; where they are bound together by the similarities of their interests or activities, rather than the proximity of their location. These communities can take any number of forms, the most basic being discussion groups, chat rooms, blogs, and forums, which are, in effect, offline communities reincarnated online.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Social network theory (SNT) describes how individuals within a community interact with one another and the community as a whole. Prediction markets (PM) are a newer discipline that have shown that individuals competing with one another for real or hypothetical rewards collectively can make more accurate predictions than organized bodies, who might have access to higher quality information. Additionally, studies have shown that a modest number of users is sufficient to obtain a high degree of accuracy. Various ideas relating to Social Network Theory (SNT) and the Prediction Markets (PM) are disclosed in detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">Social Network Theory (SNT)</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Social network theory illustrates the ability of persons to influence one another. What might appear as random conversations between people in the off-line world, when viewed on-line, can show clear patterns of influence. In practice, people relate to one another in different ways. For example, certain people are more promiscuous in their interactions, speaking with several different people simultaneously, while others interact with fewer users, but perhaps more frequently. One of the reasons SNT is studied is that by understanding the mappings connecting an individual to others, one can evaluate the social and or professional &#x201c;capital&#x201d; of that individual. In practice, this social capital refers to the network position of the person and reflects their ability to draw on the resources available to the members of the network. Human social networks comprise individuals that interact with each other through family, work, recreation, community, social, and other activities. Common to these interactions is the establishment of relationships that rely on patterns of connection and information exchange processes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An effective on-line system mimics these interactions. Individuals are able to re-identify each other in the system, as well as identify all the additional members that the system allows them to come in contact with. Individuals influence each other directly, through, for example, persuasion, orders, providing information and acting as role models, and they adjust or modify their behavior in consequence of their interaction with other individuals, and the environment in which they operate. Communication, and thus social comparison, depends on the individuals. New issues promote discussion and comparison as agreement patterns emerge.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Prediction Markets (PM)</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Markets are considered to be a method of allocating resources among competing uses. Markets can also be used when there is an absence of an arbiter with helpful information. Prices ensure that the different agents competing for access have a common standard for comparison across different choices. The market clearing process ensures that each resource is assigned to its best use. Different market designs satisfy different purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Continuous double auction markets provide goods on demand to buyers who are willing to pay the going rate, while call or options markets improve prices for buyers and sellers when time is not the most crucial factor, allowing for hedging and risk allocation. When a plurality of buyers have needs for different goods, which also are interdependent, combination markets may be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Prediction markets are a form of market in which the goods being traded are securities whose values are determined by the outcomes of future events. The securities are structured so that trading between buyers and sellers causes the price to reflect the probability of the underlying event. When a trader sees a market price (probability) that is less than her expected probability for the event, she will see a profit opportunity in buying more, thus likely driving the price up. The new price reflects a higher probability to others monitoring the market.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Prediction markets have been applied to a variety of problems and questions. Several variations on the basic idea have been described, making it possible to find answers for many different types of questions, or apply the concept in a wider set of circumstances. New variations of the original prediction market concept suggested ways to support conditional bets, which would elicit estimates about the relative chances that alternative approaches would have of achieving certain outcomes. In these variations, pari-mutuel style betting is combined with standard double-auction prediction markets to increase the liquidity of the markets at the cost of having prices that don't directly reflect probabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Several automated market makers have proposed different ways to improve the predictive ability of markets with small numbers of traders (&#x201c;thin markets&#x201d;). In markets for general commodities, similar approaches can make thin markets more liquid and make it easier for traders to find counterparties to trade with. Key, however, is that most markets have been limited to questions of broad interest like national elections and the outcome of professional sporting events. This limitation reflects a short falling of conventional prediction markets, that their predictive capability is a direct function of their liquidity, or ultimately their number of active users.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one aspect of the present invention, a system and method is provided that provides an early indication of consensus of opinion among a number of users regarding an event or observation indicated by a user. Such an opinion may be interesting to a consumer of information, who may be interested in determining the outcome of the consensus relating to the event or observation. Such recognition of early events or observations may be useful in different areas, such as healthcare, finance, etc., where initial observations, if provided early, allow resulting decisions to be made much earlier. The opinion may, for instance, be used as an early indicator of problem with a product, company, new insight on a disease, awareness of a disease outbreak, etc. Such an opinion or observation may permit an investor or other information consumer to take a position or take action at a much earlier point than if s/he relied on traditional sources of information. Thus, such opinion information may be a valuable tool for monitoring events.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Similarly, such a tool may be also valuable for participants in the advancement of ideas, especially those that rely on collaboration between people (e.g., research) and consensus between observers. However, conventional social networking systems or other online communities are insufficient for determining what information is likely to be quality information versus a random or incorrect observation or prediction. That is, it is appreciated that such conventional systems are incapable of distinguishing quality data from noise.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Also, such networks do not provide proper incentive for experts to contribute quality information in particular subject areas that would be interesting to information consumers (e.g., corporations, equity traders, etc.). Further, prediction markets are insufficient for advancing original ideas and observations, as predictive events are defined in such systems by a system operator and users can only vote on the predictive events set forth by the system operator. Thus, such systems may not be used to submit and foster the ideas and observations originated by users.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one aspect of the present invention, a distributed system is provided for determining a consensus of opinion among users. According to one embodiment, the system may be capable of accepting original observations and opinions submitted by users. The system may adjudicate and provide incentives for users to make and vote on observations, opinions and/or predictive events.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Existing predictive markets and social networks are insufficient for such an application, for example, as they do not provide proper incentives for users to submit quality information and/or provide checks and balances to prohibit users from exploiting the system. To this end, a system is provided that provides incentives and disincentives for users to cooperatively contribute observations and opinions to an online system for the purpose of early detection of consensus.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, according to another aspect of the present invention, it is appreciated that existing predictive markets and social networks require a moderator to create issues to be voted on and adjudicate them. However, according to one aspect of the present invention, users are permitted to define the issues being voted on. Because users create the issues, an online system that permits users to define the issues can function as an early warning system, whereby users having an observation can submit the observation to the system. Such users may be in a position to make the observation at an earlier point than traditional methods of monitoring issues (e.g., waiting for a journal article to come out on a particular issue, an FDA action in response to an issue, etc.), and thus the early observation may be useful.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for determining consensus of opinion relating to an observation, opinion, and/or a predictive event, used herein interchangeably as set forth by a user. A user may submit an idea to an online system, and other users may submit their opinion of the observation. In one embodiment, users of the system may be provided incentives to both create their own observations as well as provide their opinions on observations created by other users. These incentives may be in the form of money paid to users for their observations and opinions of observations.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one aspect of the present invention, users submit observations in the form of &#x201c;tickets&#x201d; to an online system, the tickets including information relating to the observation or opinion. These tickets may be, for instance, holders for an observation or opinion in the online system. These tickets may be displayed to other users of the online system, where these other user users may view and cast a &#x201c;vote&#x201d; expressing their opinion on the observation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The system may permit a number of users to vote on the ticket, and, based on the voting performed by users, determine whether there is consensus forming among the users regarding the observation or opinion. In this manner, the ticket and its associated observation or opinion may be submitted for feedback to the online system. There, the observation or opinion may be corroborated, refuted, and/or explained by others.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Other users may, for example, corroborate or otherwise agree with an observation, modify the observation, or disagree with the observation. In one example system, a user may be permitted to &#x201c;agree&#x201d; or &#x201c;disagree&#x201d; with an observation or opinion. That is, the user may be permitted to submit either a positive or negative response.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another example voting model, a user may be permitted to provide another response to the observation or opinion in addition to the binary yes/no, agree/disagree response model. The submitted response may be presented to other users as an option for response (e.g., in the form of a multiple choice selection), where other users can select the submitted response as their vote on the observation or opinion. In this way, users can propose new responses relating to the observation or opinion that can be voted on by other users.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another example, users may be permitted to change their vote after placing their vote. For instance, it may be beneficial for an early voter to change their response upon receiving information that might lead the early voter to change their response. For instance, if the early voter submits a vote that a particular drug prevents cancer, but later views a journal article including a study that shows that the drug does not prevent cancer, then the early voter may be permitted to change their vote in response to the additional information. Further, the early voter may be informed by the system of later responses (e.g., in the form of alternative responses provided by later users), which may cause the user to change their response.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus, according to one embodiment, the system may facilitate monitoring voting by later users, and if their voting or other observations (e.g., in the form of an alternative submitted response) changes the mind of the early voter, that voter may be permitted to change their vote. A change in voting may be permitted during the pendency of a ticket, allowing the consensus result to be a more accurate reflection of the users' opinions, and allows for earlier voters to change their vote in response to later-posted observations. Further, an information consumer may permitted to observe the voting process, and any voting trends that may arise during the pendency of the ticket. The system may also provide the information consumer key information relating to the ticket during the voting process, such as trends, alternative responses, or other information.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to one aspect of the present invention, the tickets and the associated election is created and arbitrated by users rather than a system operator. That is, users (not an operator) create the issues which are decided on by the online user community. In this way, original observations usually made by people that are in the best position to report the observation are submitted to the system. Further, according to one embodiment, the system is configured to rapidly disseminate such observations to other users. Further, according to another embodiment, it is left to the user community to agree, disagree, or offer an alternative response to the observation and otherwise determine collectively among the user community any consensus of the observation. Also, the voting process may be monitored by the system, and length of the voting process may be varied depending on information relating to the opinions entered by users. Thus, in this way, the users both create and vote on the issues in the online system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To foster such participation, various mechanisms may be used by the system to motivate users. For instance, monetary or any other type of value (e.g., points) may be attributed to tickets, which may increase or decrease based on the opinions submitted by users. Thus, if other users agree with an observation, a consensus measurement (referred to herein as a signal strength) of the ticket is increased. Similarly, if users disagree with an observation, the consensus measurement of the ticket is decreased. Whether other users agree or disagree with the observation, a ranking of the user originating the ticket may be affected. Other mechanisms may be used by the system to encourage desired participation (e.g., submitting opinions by particular users in their field of expertise, users encouraged to both create observation and express opinions) and to discourage undesired participation (e.g., gaming of the system, submission of non-unique observations, etc.). Further, the system may encourage users to submit tickets in particular subject areas to foster ideas in those areas (e.g., by valuing tickets and voting more highly in such areas). According to one embodiment, the system may use rules to provide such incentives and disincentives for user behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one aspect of the present invention, an online system may be provided for users to submit observations, insights, and/or questions. Such observations, insights, and/or questions may be submitted in the form of tickets. Information consumers that desire to have exclusive access to voting results of a particular ticket may be permitted to bid on the ticket. Once a particular information consumer has agreed to pay a particular price for the voting results, that ticket is referred to herein as being cultivated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Users may vote on a ticket until some predetermined criteria is reached. In one embodiment, a consensus determination is performed that indicates when the voting process is complete, and the ticket is closed. Consensus may be measured, for instance, using a parameter (referred to herein as signal strength) that determines whether the voting process is complete. Signal strength may be measured, for example, by the number of users responding to a particular ticket, the number of votes cast for a particular answer, or any combination of information associated with the ticket and/or statistic in voting on the ticket. In addition, the information consumer may be permitted to specify parameters that determine when signal strength is reached (e.g., when a particular number of users vote on the ticket, when a particular number of votes are received, when the ticket should close, etc.). The information consumer may be permitted to view voting results in real time, and may be provided exclusive access to the results after ticket closing. In one example, the exclusive access may be granted for a particular period of time, after which the results may be made available to other users of the online system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, according to another aspect, it appreciated that conventional online predictive markets may run afoul of online gambling laws, including the United States. In particular, one of several obstacles faced by prediction markets is that the gambling laws in several jurisdictions are written broadly enough so that they can be construed to prohibit use of these markets with real money. Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, an online information brokering service is provided that permits users to define and place opinions regarding future outcomes, yet not impinge on U.S. gaming laws. In particular, users may be compensated for their opinions regarding predictive events without placing a wager. Rather, they are compensated if their opinion is correct, but not charged if their opinion is incorrect. Other non-monetary mechanisms (e.g., a ranking) may be used to reflect a user's ability to place correct opinions. Further, information consumers that purchase the opinion information (e.g., government officials, investors) are not wagering, because, according to one embodiment, the purchase of opinion information is completed independent of the outcome of the &#x201c;ticket/s.&#x201d; Thus, neither action performed by the user or information consumer is a speculative wager.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a system may be provided that permits users to associate classification information with tickets. For instance, users may be permitted to associate classification information such as &#x201c;tags&#x201d; in order to classify tickets to permit searching by the system, other users, programs, etc. Further, a computer system associated with the system may process tickets to create classifications for a ticket. In one example, the system may process one or more keywords associated with the ticket and classify the ticket using those keywords. Further, the computer system may be adapted to search one or more databases to locate similar keywords with which the ticket may be associated. After such classifications are defined, the ticket may be located using such classification.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to another aspect of the present invention, tickets may be identified in the system and matched to particular users based on their classification information. For instance, a ticket may be classified by a submitting user, along with any classifications assigned by the system, and based on the assigned classifications, the submitting user is displayed tickets already submitted to the system having similar classifications. In this way, the user may more easily locate similar tickets. Tickets may be associated with users in other ways, such as, for example, identifying tickets to users that voted on similar tickets, identifying tickets to users who are identified as experts in a particular area, identifying tickets to particular consumers of ticket information that may have previously bid on such information, among others.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to one aspect of the present invention, it is appreciated that it may be useful to convey information from early observers to information consumers so that decisions can be made at an early stage. One aspect of the present invention relates to an early detection and survey method to track and predict trends in various markets which can be used to monetize the early trends.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is appreciated that it takes time for information to be disseminated from people that have early observations (e.g., a physician that makes a useful observation in the field) to other people and entities that act on such information (e.g., an information consumer such as the FDA). For instance, a period of days, weeks, or even months may elapse before a useful observation becomes public knowledge (e.g., through a newswire service) and becomes public information. There may be additional periods of time that elapse before the observation makes its way to others interested in such information (e.g., to form opinions or to perform an action based on such information). According to one aspect, it is appreciated that an early observation, if corroborated, may be effectively used as information to perform an action. One example includes detection and reporting of adverse effects of drugs. An information consumer such as the FDA, an investor, or other entity may perform an action (e.g., open an inquiry, perform a trade) in response to receiving the adverse information generated by an early observer in the field. If received early, such information may be used to save lives, time, and money.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">To this end, it is appreciated that a system and method for identifying early observations and communicating them amongst interested parties in a more timely manner would be beneficial. In one embodiment, one or more computer systems (e.g., Personal Computers (PCs), Portable Digital Assistants (PDAs), telephones, or other computer system types) using various forms of communication (e.g., Internet, cellular network, etc.) may be used to create an online ecosystem described below used to exchange observation information between information providers and consumers, and to corroborate such observations.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Online Ecosystem</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one embodiment, an online &#x201c;ecosystem&#x201d; is created, the ecosystem including a community of users that together, function to exchange information. Such an ecosystem may be novel in its integration of prediction markets, social networking, decision making, and group consensus. In such an ecosystem, a community is created by one or more rules influencing the behavior of a plurality of users. According to one embodiment, the rules adhere to the basic drives and ambitions of the users and channel the interested users back into the ecosystem community. In particular, rules may be designed that provide incentives (and disincentives) for certain types of behavior. Optimally, the rules encourage users to submit original ideas and encourage others to review these ideas to foster consensus. In one embodiment, the rules function without external (other than users) or moderator intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The overall ecosystem may be driven by several processes. One process permits users to take independent actions, and the user's independent actions affect the ecosystem. Therefore, the ecosystem can be self-perpetuating. Further, the ecosystem can create its own content, as users define and vote on the observations and opinions of others. The ecosystem may be self-regulating, for instance, as users determine the value of the collected observations and opinions. One method of the driving of the ecosystem involves recruiting new users as individuals within the ecosystem pursue their own interests.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The ecosystem can be manipulated to fit the interests of those that run the ecosystem (e.g., a system operator) is by generating valuable data for third parties that consume information generated by the ecosystem. One method for ensuring that valuable data is generated includes creating rules that promote the creation of valuable data, and by integrating adjustable variables into the rules.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Such an ecosystem may be applied to different problems, markets, and subject areas. One such application is healthcare, and the medicine in general. The healthcare industry is a good application of such a system, as there are a number of readily available customers for the information generated by the ecosystem. For instance, there is a need to capture original observations to further the advancement of understanding of medical treatment, drugs, and related research, and to ensure patient safety. Such observations may also be valuable to the financial community when making investment decisions, and thus a system that makes such observations aware to the community would be beneficial. Another application includes the observation of the spread of disease, and monitoring for outbreaks of such diseases. Further, the ecosystem may permit physicians to further the advancement ideas by allowing them to submit observations and to comment on observations of their physician colleagues.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The ecosystem may align the interests of clinicians, industry, and researchers to more effectively capture physician observations and insight, potentially improving surveillance and allowing more rapid insight into physician consensus on a given topic. Organizations that benefit from early insight into healthcare information create a financial incentive used to generate, sustain, and regulate participation in the online community or ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">One version of the ecosystem can leverage a high value of healthcare-related subject-specific information that can be shared among interested users. Further, the ecosystem can successfully exploit multiple behaviors of various users, such as greed, drive for collaboration, and humanitarianism. Because there is a continuous need for information, the information of the ecosystem is self-renewing and replenishes itself continuously. Although healthcare is one application of such an ecosystem, it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to any specific field, and may be applied to other information-sharing situations where collaboration facilitates information that has value.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one example application of such a system, a value of a physician's observation (modeled in the system in the form of a &#x201c;ticket&#x201d;) in the system is determined by how many people agree or disagree with the observation at any given moment. Physicians from diverse backgrounds are incentivized to submit observations and to corroborate or dispute those observations to the system, providing a resultant method by which clinical data may be gathered. Further, a ranking of users may be determined, used to determine a value of observations, and to incentivize desired ticket creation and/or voting behavior.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Example Ecosystem</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one example implementation, a system is provided that permits a user to perform a number of actions relating to observations or opinions submitted by users. In one particular embodiment, the user may submit observations or vote on existing observations. In one example implementation, the observation may be represented in the system in the form of a &#x201c;ticket.&#x201d; In the example, the ticket is a construct that permits an idea to be shared and viewed to by other users as well as allowing the system to track the idea as it progresses through the ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A user may create an observation by creating a ticket that describes the observation. In one example, the ticket includes a number of parameters including a description of the observation as entered by a user (e.g., in the form of text and/or phrases describing the observation). In one example, the length of description of the observation associated with the ticket may be any length (e.g., no minimum or maximum length). In other words, the observation description can be as long as a user wants, or as short as he/she wants.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Also, the user may be permitted to express an opinion on an existing observation by voting on an existing ticket. In another embodiment, the user may be permitted to submit an answer or opinion to the observation. The answer may be in the form of a yes/no response, or the user may be permitted to submit an alternative answer. Here, the user is permitted to provide an additional statement that allows the user to qualify their response.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In another example, the user is permitted to provide an additional statement which allows the user to provide an alternative response that may be viewed and selected by other users. Each of these possible responses may be viewed by other users in the ecosystem (e.g., as a multiple choice selection), from which they may choose to provide (or may not) a different response.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The user may also be &#x201c;charged&#x201d; a currency for voting on a ticket. For instance, the user may be provided a particular number of points or other credit, and decremented each time the user votes on a ticket. The user's credit may be increased in response to a positive behavior exhibited by the user in the ecosystem (e.g., the user creates tickets, provides early votes, becomes an expert in a particular field, etc.). In this manner, the system rewards positive behavior and encourages participation in the ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In one embodiment, when a user writes a ticket, the user classifies the ticket. The classifications may include but are not limited to classifying the ticket as a particular type of observation. There may be more or less classification types, depending on the application, but are generally referred to herein as an observation. The tickets may also be classified by the user and/or system. For instance, tags or other classification information may be associated with a ticket.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to another embodiment, the ticket may also include classification information, either part of or separate from the ticket, the classification information indicating an organization of the ticket such that the ticket may be easily located. In one embodiment, it to is appreciated that metadata in the form of &#x201c;tags&#x201d; or keywords may be associated with information such as tickets, and tags may be used to classify tickets. Because tickets have associated tags, tickets with similar or the same tags may be located more easily by a system or an associated user. Further, action's may be performed in response to tag information, such as alerting a user when a ticket having a particular tag is created, locating similar tickets using tag information, and other actions relating to the organization and control of tickets.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">According to another embodiment, the system may present to the user an interface that provide real-time feedback of classification information as the user enters information associated with the ticket. For instance, a list of related tags may be presented to the user, and while the user enters description information of the ticket, the list of the most relevant tags may be changed in response to the entry of the user. In this way, the feedback permits users to create better tickets (by seeing how the system would classify the ticket) and also permits the user to easily locate similar tickets (e.g., by selecting tag information presented in real-time to the user in the interface).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">According to one embodiment, an observation may be classified as a &#x201c;Case&#x201d; observation. Using such an observation, it may be useful to permit users to submit observations by users in a position to view a particular event or condition. Generally, any user regardless of rank or stature may be suitable for making such an observation.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In another example, an observation may be classified as a &#x201c;Consult&#x201d; observation. In such an observation, it may be useful for a user to submit an observation, upon which other users can provide their opinions or consultation on the observation. Generally, observations made by users having a higher rank, voting history, or other status may be valued by the system more than observations made by lower-ranked users. There may be other observation types and combination types thereof by which a particular observation may be classified.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In one embodiment, the online system may assign each ticket a &#x201c;value.&#x201d; Depending on the subject matter of the observation, the ticket may be assigned an initial value, which may be adjusted depending on the market value of the ticket (e.g., the value of the ticket as determined by a bid process involving interested information consumers) and/or the opinions (e.g., in the form of votes) set forth by other users relating to the ticket.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The values may be assigned in real-time, when the ticket is created, however, the initial value can be revisited with the value on any given ticket increased or decreased as needed to promote the health of the ecosystem. Health of the ecosystem may be monitored, for example, by measuring a number of votes received in a particular area, ticket, or issue. Once submitted, any other users can vote on a ticket or submit an alternative answer with a ticket as well as forward the ticket to any other users inside or outside the ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The ecosystem may have a number of different types of consumers and providers of information. Users that provide observations may or may not be charged a fee for accessing the ecosystem, but in one embodiment of the ecosystem, information consumers are charged for their use and access to the observations and opinions provided by and ability of the system to establish communication between others. In one example system, consumers may be charged a subscription fee to observe overall activity within the ecosystem. Such fees may be used, for example, to maintain the ecosystem. Further, other fees may be charged to consumers for cultivating tickets submitted by others. In such a system, for example, customers may observe a ticket that the consumer wishes to draw attention to, or cultivate. Once the consumer becomes the owner of the ticket (e.g., through a bid process or other process), the results of the ticket may be the exclusive property of that consumer. In another example system, the results may not be shown to the public. In yet another example, the results of the ticket may be the exclusive property of the consumer for a fixed period of time (e.g., 60 days) after which, the results are published to the ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In such an ecosystem, it is appreciated that there may be trade-off between consensus and early warning, but according to one embodiment, such a model according to various embodiments may perform more quickly and accurately than conventional survey models. In one such system, a customer/information consumer may be permitted to set predefined &#x201c;triggers&#x201d; that alert the consumer if/when a user (e.g., a physician) makes an observation of interest. The consumer may then be able to identify to the ecosystem how many users would need to vote on that observation for the observation results to be valuable to them. The system may determine the current voting rates for the desired population of users, the amount of incentives (e.g., money) that needs to be applied, and when the consumer agrees, that consumer may be granted exclusive access to the result information. Optionally, users that vote on the observation may be made available to the consumer for direct contact, permitting the consumer to more quickly and effectively reach a targeted group that has the necessary insight and/or experience in a given area.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Example Process</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart showing an example process <b>200</b> for interacting with an ecosystem according to one embodiment of the present invention. In one example, the ecosystem may include one or more computers and/or communication systems used to communicate information between users. A user may have an initial observation, insight or idea (e.g., at block <b>210</b>). At block <b>220</b>, the user logs onto the system and uses an interface of the system (e.g., a web-based search engine or similar interface) to search and verify whether the observation, insight or idea does not already exist. In one embodiment, the user may be required to join the ecosystem (e.g., have a uniquely-identifiable identity such as a username/password) in order to create tickets and/or vote.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The user may be permitted to create a ticket according to the initial observation, and submit the ticket to the system. The system (and/or the user) may search existing tickets to determine whether there is a ticket on a related subject of the idea, observation or insight at block <b>230</b>. For instance, a keyword and/or tag search may be used to verify if a ticket already exists on the user's insight, observation, question, idea or thought. Such a search may be performed manually by the user, but additional searching may be performed by the ecosystem itself (e.g., by searching tag data stored in association with other tickets previously created in the ecosystem).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">If a similar ticket is found, then the user may be permitted to vote on the existing ticket (e.g., by agreeing or disagreeing) with the existing ticket at block <b>240</b>, or by proposing an alternative response. The user may optionally be permitted to perform other actions with respect to the ticket, such as, for example, commenting on the observation by authoring a statement in a blog, comment area, or other location, sending the ticket to other users, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">If no similar ticket was found and/or identified, then the user may be presented the opportunity to create a new ticket at block <b>250</b>. Thus, if the user and/or system did not identify any similar (or adequate) tickets, they could submit their own. A process of authoring a ticket may involve the user submitting one or more pieces of information, including, but not limited to, a title for the ticket, a description of the observation, and any proposed classification(s) of the ticket (e.g., through the use of tags), embedding images associated with the observation (e.g., medical test results, pictures, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In one embodiment, the ecosystem may provide incentive to the users to make the ticket specific enough so that others with the same observation would identify with it, but not so general that the ticket would generate inconclusive insights. Once submitted, a ticket may be made available for all users to vote on. The ticket author and those users that subsequently vote on the ticket now have a vested interest in promoting that consensus.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Once a ticket is submitted or a vote made, users may be presented real-time feedback regarding the status of the ticket, and any status regarding any payments to be made for submitting and/or voting on tickets. In one implementation, users may be compensated based their ability to predict consensus. In one example, the payout that a user receives may be determined as a function of how many people vote in agreement after them, modified by the weight of the ticket, the user's reputation, and a variable that describes the quality of the consensus.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart showing an example process <b>300</b> for interacting with an ecosystem according to one embodiment of the present invention. Once a ticket has been posted on the online ecosystem, the ticket can be viewed and voted upon by users, can be forwarded by a user to their colleagues, friends, peers, etc. via many sources of communication to encourage them to vote on the posted ticket at block <b>310</b>. For example, tickets may be sent to other users via electronic mail, wireless paging, telephone, or any other method of communication.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As a product of maintaining the ecosystem, meaningful observations are generated, along with financial income for the ecosystem participants. In one embodiment, users are encouraged and rewarded for their votes and original ideas at block <b>320</b>. For instance, the amount that a user may be rewarded may be influenced by the accuracy and speed in which they vote and predict outcomes. In addition, the system has the ability to recognize the trends as opinions and votes are posted by users, and provide such information and trends to information consumers. Similarly, at block <b>330</b>, the system may generate financial income for the participants as providers and consumers in the ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an example use case showing an example process <b>400</b> for conducting an online system according to one embodiment of the present invention. A user (e.g., a physician) makes an initial observation (block <b>401</b>). The user accesses the ecosystem and searches a ticket database (block <b>402</b>) to determine if there is a related ticket (and observation) generated from another user.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">If a ticket already exists, the user may find and vote on an existing ticket (block <b>403</b>). If not, the user is permitted to author a new ticket (block <b>404</b>) and submit the same to the ecosystem. Additionally, the user may encourage others to review and vote on the ticket (block <b>405</b>), especially those users that have previously voted on similar tickets, are experts in a related field, or those identified with ability to accurately predict events.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The ecosystem, after receiving user votes on the created ticket, may generate signals regarding the observation (block <b>406</b>) that indicates the quality of the observation to others (e.g., information consumers). Also as discussed, users creating the ticket may receive financial rewards (e.g., compensation or income) depending on the quality of the observation and need of the observation in the marketplace.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an example use case showing an example process <b>500</b> for conducting an online system according to another embodiment of the present invention. In the example, a client or other information consumer interested in particular observation information may be capable of setting (e.g., within an interface of a computer system) a trigger that, when activated, causes the client to be notified when a ticket having a particular parameter value is submitted (block <b>501</b>). For instance, an equity trader may want to set a monitor for a particular drug name of interest, a particular company name, or other parameter. At block <b>502</b>, a physician or other user has an insight and submits a ticket to the ecosystem. In the example shown, the ticket may include some parameter (e.g., a keyword) that activates the trigger, and the client is notified (e.g., at block <b>503</b>). In one example, keywords of the ticket are used to create tags associated with the ticket, and triggers defined on these tags are activated when a ticket is created or otherwise classified using such tags.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">At block <b>504</b>, the ticket is opened for bidding to one or more information consumers, who will bid to determine exclusive access to the result of the voting process. After a winning bidder is determined, the ticket is submitted to the ecosystem where other users vote on the ticket (block <b>505</b>). In parallel, physicians or other users may be notified that the ticket has been cultivated (block <b>506</b>), where compensation is determined. When the ticket is cultivated and compensation (e.g., a price) is determined for the winner's access to the ticket, access to the result information is provided to the winning bidder (block <b>507</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">After the ticket is cultivated, users may be permitted to vote on the ticket as described above. Also, the client determined to be the winning bidder may be notified of any result or consensus determination associated with the ticket, or any updates that may occur after consensus is reached (block <b>508</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an example use case showing an example process <b>600</b> for conducting an online system according to another embodiment of the present invention. According to one embodiment, an information consumer may be capable of initiating collaboration in an area of interest. For instance, an information consumer (or client) may have a theory or other idea for which they need feedback from the user community or otherwise needs feedback from a population of users. In one embodiment, the information consumer can target a particular user population (e.g., a group of experts in a particular field) in order to receive their feedback on a particular topic. This may be particularly helpful as a tool for a client to reach consensus on an issue in a timely manner from a group of experts or authorities in a particular area.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">To this end, the client submits a ticket to the ecosystem (block <b>601</b>). Because the idea is proposed by the information client, the specific client may propose particular target goals, a timeline for developing consensus on the issue, and may assign a dollar value to the ticket (block <b>602</b>). The ticket is then submitted to the ecosystem (block <b>604</b>) where the ticket can be reviewed and voted on by users. In this way, the client may determine the parameters that define how the information should be delivered, how much the information is worth, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the case of an ecosystem that relates to medical issues, a physician or other type of user permitted to participate in the ecosystem may view and vote on the ticket. In one embodiment, a physician may set a trigger that indicates when particular types of tickets are submitted to the ecosystem. For instance, if a ticket relating to cardiac pacemakers is submitted, a particular physician may be notified by the ecosystem. A user may set a notification, for example, based on any type of information associated with the ticket, including keywords, classification of the ticket (e.g., a tag value), or any other information (block <b>603</b>). Thus, based on a predefined notification, a physician or other user may receive an indication of a ticket being submitted to the ecosystem (block <b>605</b>), increasing the probability that relevant users will vote on the ticket, and therefore, consensus will be reached earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Because the client submitted and financed the ticket, that client may gain exclusive insight into the result of the consensus determination by the ecosystem, and any related opinion data (block <b>606</b>). Also, the client may require further follow-up after consensus is reached, and may have additional options in this regard. For example, for a physician that votes on the ticket, a call may be set up to discuss related issues (block <b>607</b>), continue research on the topic, or perform any other type of effort.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As discussed, the ecosystem may be used to couple any type of information providers and consumers for the purpose of exchanging observations and information. For instance, professionals such as lawyers, consultants, investors, engineers, scientists, etc. may be capable of submitting observations to a group of information consumers. Information consumers may include any entity that is interested in the information, and more importantly, is willing to pay for the information. For instance, information consumers may include companies, firms, government entities, and individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">One embodiment of an ecosystem may be directed to the investment community which can offer significant rewards for information that is relevant to investment. Increasingly, funds trade upon near-instantaneous information about medical products that may affect company stock prices. An ecosystem that connects financial information consumers to physicians and other field observers can provide a mechanism to identify relevant issues long before they are identified and released by traditional thought leaders (e.g., the FDA).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Pharmaceutical and medical device companies may also be important revenue sources. In the medical field, current reporting standards depend upon physician calls to report adverse events, and sometimes, without significant incentive on the part of companies to forward the reports. Companies may use the ecosystem to monitor events associated with their products so that they can gauge the adoption of new devices, detect adverse events, and solicit input from the online community.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Revenue sources can be divided into a plurality of categories, two of which include surveillance and survey. Surveillance watches for trends that appear in new tickets and opinions. Although surveillance is, by definition, passive, the ecosystem can be manipulated by adjusting the ticket value that is assigned to new and existing tickets. For example, the greater commercial value of tickets relating to particular subject matter may be adjusted so that these ticket types are valued over tickets relating to other types of matters. For instance, although it is likely that device and pharmaceutical tickets will likely have greater commercial value, clinical insights with implications for public health can be weighted to attract more opinions. Thus, the behavior of users within the ecosystem may be adjusted using incentives.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Potential surveillance trends that may be monitored may include, for example, the total number of opinions, the rate at which the number of opinions increase, and the ratio of opinions (Yes vs. No, Agree vs. Disagree or some other opinion/observation), the composition of opinion makers (average rank/reputation of user), among others. Surveillance may be based on a subscription model and can be segmented (for sale to different markets) on the basis of a pattern, subject matter (including, for example, keyword search and subject headings), and pattern recognition, tag information, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In one embodiment, a ticket may be created that consults a group of users. In particular, the ticket may be based upon intentionally introducing and/or promoting tickets to targeted groups of users. For instance, a customer who is looking to gather information on any given topic can construct their own ticket (e.g., discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Assigning of ticket value and promotion mechanism to gather this information may be conducted in real-time. Furthermore, the survey can be targeted at specific user types. Responses can be categorized by user profile, and weighted based on past performance.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Further, users may be &#x201c;profiled&#x201d; so that the ecosystem and its users may be distinguished from one another for the purpose of evaluating their opinions. This &#x201c;profiling&#x201d; allows for intermediation by the ecosystem between the users and various clients. In one embodiment, the ecosystem may be adapted to recognize and identify which users are the innovators, the thought leaders, and/or the best predictors generally or in particular areas of expertise. This information is certainly of tremendous value to advertisers, manufacturers, etc., as this identification may be exploited (e.g., by advancing a particular ticket to a subset of users that are the best predictors to reach consensus earlier).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In one embodiment, the system may include the ability to track users and distinguish among users based on their profile information. For instance, users may be distinguished based on their early recognition of trends, ability (or inability) to post accurate predictions, voting accuracy, and/or ability to influence others.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The ecosystem may also be adapted to offer any sort of combination of industry insight. For instance, the ecosystem may be able to target users by specialty, by predictive ability, ability to post accurate predictions, ability to recognize trends early, ability to influence others, determining who the influencers are, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Profiling also allows for the introduction of another variable into determining income, referred to herein as consensus &#x201c;quality.&#x201d; The ecosystem may be adapted to identify certain patterns in emerging consensus. For instance, the system may identify users of a similar type. For instance, it is appreciated that a consensus about a ticket relating to a specific medical specialty held by users in that same medical specialty will have greater value. In other words, an opinion held universally by a sub-segment of the user population, which is known to be within that subset's area of expertise, indicates a far more important or &#x201c;pure&#x201d; consensus.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Further, by collecting profile information, other types of trends may be observed. For instance, the ecosystem may cross-reference emerging consensus with a geographic and/or institutional distribution of the users. Also, geographic information may be used to recognize collusion outside of the system. Further, by observing voting patterns among users, collusion may be detected. For instance, patterns of voting that use the exact same population of users, or likewise the same sequence of users, can be a signal for off-line collusion.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Ecosystem Rules</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The success of the ecosystem depends on the dynamic content created by its users. But the freedom necessary for this creates a problem: How can users be encouraged to act in a manner that is productive to the community without administrative oversight? According to one embodiment, users are provided incentives that match their personalities and interests that will encourage them to share their knowledge with the ecosystem. Further, it is appreciated that users should be discouraged from &#x201c;gaming&#x201d; the system to their benefit. For example, if a physician will gain a reward for creating a new ticket, what will prevent them from creating fifty meaningless ones?</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Further, if there is a financial reward for submitting a correct vote, it is appreciated that there may be a mechanism that prohibits a user (e.g., a physician) from voting on every issue (i.e., guessing). Similarly, the ecosystem may be modulated to provide the types of information that might be of interest to customers at a particular point in time. According to one aspect of the present invention, the ecosystem employs a set of rules that provide incentives for certain actions and provide disincentives for other actions.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">For the ecosystem to remain viable, the system may include a mechanism to achieve certain things, for example:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0138">Maintain a high throughput of fresh tickets.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0139">Maintain sufficient volume of votes so that opinions are rendered and &#x201c;signals&#x201d; can be detected.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0140">Create incentive and disincentive that keeps users' interests aligned with the overall goals of the ecosystem, preventing gaming of the system.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0141">According to one embodiment, one method for balancing the interests of the users with that of the ecosystem is a basic set of rules. In one embodiment, these rules should to be sufficiently transparent so that users can understand the rules that are dictating their compensation, but retain a degree of opacity so that the system operator can manipulate them to achieve commercial success. According to one embodiment, four basic laws may be used to govern an online ecosystem:</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0142">Rank:</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0143">It may be beneficial to disincentivize random voting and/or random ticket creation. This rule not only prevents users from blanketing the ecosystem with as many votes as possible (in the hopes that one of those tickets will reflect a large financial reward), but the rule also forces users to write tickets and/or vote on those topics for which they think they might have a unique insight or &#x201c;edge.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0144">According to one embodiment, a user's rank is calculated dynamically and is applied to a ticket at the time of writing or voting, and remains constant for the income related to that ticket. Therefore, at any given moment, a user's reputation (as represented by a user's rank), is based on how accurately they have predicted the future consensus of the ecosystem on any given ticket. Stated differently, rank is a reflection how often those who rendered an opinion after another user who rendered an opinion, agreed with the voter.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0145">According to one embodiment, rank may be determined using the following equation:</p>

<p id="p-0149" num="0154">Ticket weight or value may have an associated value that is designated by the system at the time of ticket creation, and reflects the commercial value of the ticket to the client (information consumer). One implementation using weight includes using the weight value as a multiplier that raises or lowers the value that the ticket generates. Alternatively, weight can be defined as a dollar value that is assigned to the ticket, and then is gradually drawn down as each successive voter is paid out.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0155">Consensus quality may be measured, for example, by a variable that the client describes to end users. A temporal weight may be defined within the income equation that rewards early voters and ticket writers, and then exponentially decreases payout to later voters and ticket authors.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0156">Balance:</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0157">A rule may be used that brings into balance voting and ticket writing. In some applications, user income for writing highly successful tickets may be considerable. As such, it is expected that users will be inclined to write as many tickets as possible. This creates two challenges to the health of the ecosystem. First, the ecosystem's ability to render a consensus on any given ticket is based upon the number of votes that the ticket attracts. An ecosystem where a relatively small number of votes are spread out among a large number of tickets is not a healthy one, as it becomes difficult to determine consensus on any particular ticket due to the spread out. Second, according to one embodiment, users should be incentivized to only write tickets on topics for which they believe that they have an insight.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0158">These opposing forces can be brought into balance by tying the number of tickets that a user can write to the number of votes they have rendered. In one example, one ticket can be written by a user for every five (5) votes rendered by a user. In another example, the number of tickets can be determined by a dynamically adjusted variable, based on the current health of the ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0159">According to one embodiment, balance may be ensured using the following equation:</p>

which ties the number of tickets to be written to the number of votes that can be cast. Alternatively, a &#x201c;points&#x201d; system may be used that relates the number of votes that could be cast by a particular user to the number of opinions (or tickets) authored (e.g., by awarding points when a user creates a ticket and decrementing points when a user votes on an opinion, or vice versa). Such a relation may encourage users to both author opinions and vote on the opinions of others.
</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0161">Self-Policing:</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0162">Through its users, the ecosystem has the capability to generate large amounts of information. However, this abundance of information creates a problem in information management. The freedom to create new tickets can lead to insightful new observations, but it can also lead to self-evident or clinically irrelevant ones.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0163">Additionally, multiple users can make the same observation, worded differently, causing confusion and decreasing the total votes made on the observation. It would be impossible for the ecosystem itself to manage the dynamic, user-created information. Therefore, the ecosystem has created a mechanism for users to be incentivized to manage the system themselves. Before the generation of any new ticket in the ecosystem, a user may be informed of basic guidelines. These guidelines may include the prohibition of self-evident or duplicate posts, or any posts that might be explained by information existing in the public domain (e.g., journals, textbooks, databases, and other medical references, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0164">When any user in the ecosystem views a ticket, s/he can &#x201c;report&#x201d; it as not conforming to these guidelines. This reporting will require some form of risk to that user in order to prevent frivolous reports. In his report, he will cite the ticket and explain his reasoning. Then, the ecosystem will distribute his report to a random selection of the highest-ranked users (e.g., the top 10 highest-ranked users) that the ecosystem has determined have expertise on the ticket's subject. These users will serve to arbitrate the report validity and will be rewarded for doing so. These users will then vote if they agree with the original author or the individual who cited the self-policing policy.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0165">If the post is found to not meet the ecosystem's basic criteria or to violate the self-policing policy it will be removed from the system, the creating user will be penalized, and the reporting user will be rewarded. If the post is valid, it will remain, and the reporting user will be penalized. Through this system, all users who voted in agreement with a removed ticket will lose the rank points they gained, and those rank points will be awarded to the user that successfully cited the law. In this way, the ecosystem simultaneously disincentivizes users from posting or voting on tickets that might be self-evident or unoriginal, while recruiting a population of users to self-police the system. Indeed, users will become increasingly inclined to examine tickets for violations of the Self-Policing rule as the tickets grow in their number of votes because the potential payout becomes higher and higher.</p>

For instance, the application program <b>810</b> may include one or more controls that, when selected by the user, perform functions for manipulating ticket information. These controls may be written in a variety of programming languages, and the invention is not limited to any particular language. In one specific example, the control may be a link that, when selected, performs one or more programmed functions. Such functions may permit the user to create, submit, view, search, and vote on tickets within an online ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0186">Information stored in the database <b>802</b> may include, for example, ticket information including, but not limited to, a unique ticket identifier, a description of the observation associated with the ticket, user information such as personal information, user names, ranking, voting history, classification information associated with the ticket (e.g., tag information) and other information that can be used to facilitate the online ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0187">This information may be collected from the user in an interface (e.g., as presented by program <b>810</b>) and stored in the database (e.g., database <b>802</b>). Additionally, client systems may store a local copy of a user's ticket information within a local database associated with the client system (e.g., database <b>811</b> located on client system <b>807</b>D). However, it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to storing ticket and/or user information in any particular location. A client system (e.g., clients <b>807</b>A-<b>807</b>D) may include one or more interfaces through which ticket information may be presented to the user. In one example, ticket information and status may be presented in an interface of a browser program (e.g., browser program <b>809</b>) executing on a client computer system (e.g., system <b>807</b>D).</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Example Implementations</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a block diagram showing an example creation of a ticket creation and tagging process according to one embodiment of the present invention. At block <b>901</b>, a user (e.g., a physician or other person that has an observation or prediction) authors a ticket (e.g., on a client system <b>807</b>A-<b>807</b>D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) for submission to the ecosystem (e.g., in the form of a distributed computer system <b>800</b>). At block <b>902</b>, the ticket is validated where it can be verified that the ticket is an original concept, is not similar to other tickets, etc. Further, the ticket may be analyzed in order to provide one or more classifications (e.g., tags) for the observations that may be associated with the ticket. Such tag information may be used to determine an initial value of the ticket, based on the related subject matter (e.g., an event related to a pacemaker vs. a general health event).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0189">In one embodiment, tags may initially be provided by the author of the ticket. Further, in another example system, the system may generate and/or suggest other tags that could be associated with the ticket. Such tags may be generated, for example, based on associations (or groups) of related tags defined for similar tickets. Such tickets may include, for example, tickets having similar tags and which feedback for such tickets has been provided. Tags may also be suggested based on comparison with industry databases, similar keywords, synonym databases, or any other source of tag information.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0190">In one example, the question or observation posed by the ticket may be compared to one or more databases (e.g., a keyword database <b>909</b> having keywords of other ticket entries) to determine whether the ticket is an original ticket, and to create tags for the ticket. Further, the ecosystem may have the ability to access other common databases such as, for example, disease and injury databases associated with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (commonly known by the abbreviation ICD) (e.g., ICD-9 database <b>908</b>), MEDLINE database (e.g., MeSH database <b>906</b>), geographic and institution databases (block <b>907</b>) or any other type of database resource to determine if the observation is original and/or determine the classification(s) of the ticket. Such classifications may occur automatically, or may be posed to the author of the ticket as suggested classifications.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0191">Once validated, the physician or other user may be presented a list of tags to which the ticket may be associated (block <b>903</b>). The physician may then review the tags and add to them or modify the tags, as appropriate (block <b>904</b>). Once the ticket is complete, the physician or other user submits the ticket to the ecosystem at block <b>905</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a block diagram showing example database elements according to one embodiment of the present invention that may be used in a ticket access and triggering process. For example, a user may search for and/or set triggers for particular tickets based on their tag information. For instance, a tagged ticket <b>911</b> in database <b>916</b> may be located in a user interface (e.g., a browser program interface) by entering in one or more tags (or classifications). For instance, tags may be located based on defined classifications in the database (e.g., medical terms in a MeSH database <b>912</b>, keywords <b>914</b> in a keyword database <b>909</b>, etc.). Further, the ticket may be searched according to other information, such as, for example, a location of or distance to the originator of the ticket (e.g., by accessing a geography database <b>913</b>), a particular vote pattern of the originating user <b>915</b> or any other type of information relating to the ticket and/or its user. In this way, users can both classify tickets and locate tickets of interest once submitted.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart showing an overall logic flow of ticket creation and lifetime in an online system according to one embodiment of the present invention. As discussed above, a user may make an observation and possibly submit the observation to an online ecosystem in the form of a ticket, or corroborate or refute a similar observation associated with an existing ticket. At block <b>1001</b>, the user makes an observation. As discussed above, the user may search an online ticket database (block <b>1002</b>) to determine whether a similar ticket exists, or may browse the ticket database (block <b>1003</b>) by viewing, for example, a list of recent tickets authored in a ticket database, highest ranked tickets, or other criteria or listing. In one embodiment, a user may locate tickets based on classification information associated with a ticket. Such classification information may be in the form of one or more tags created by the ticket creator, the ecosystem, or other entity.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0194">At block <b>1004</b>, the user may author a new ticket if the observation is original, or may alternatively find (block <b>1005</b>) and vote on (block <b>1006</b>) an existing ticket. According to one aspect of the present invention, as discussed above, tickets created in the ecosystem may have tags or other classification information associated with the ticket (block <b>1007</b>) so that the ticket may be located easily by users, the ecosystem, or other entity. According to one embodiment, tickets that are validated and classified may then be submitted to the ecosystem (block <b>1008</b>) where they can be viewed and voted on by users. Also as discussed, the observations may be stored in the form of a ticket in a database (block <b>1009</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0195">Users may set alerts or triggers (block <b>1010</b>) that, when activated, notify the other user that a ticket having particular criteria has been submitted to the ecosystem. For instance, such triggers may be activated based on classification information (e.g., tag information) associated with a particular ticket. Also, once submitted, a ticket may be forwarded to colleagues (block <b>1011</b>) or other types of users targeted by the ticket. Ticket status may also be viewed by the originator in real time, as votes are received along with any opinion data (block <b>1012</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0196">Users continue to vote and submit opinions on the created ticket until a signal strength is reached (e.g., a consensus is formed and determined by the ecosystem) at block <b>1013</b>. Determination of signal strength (or consensus) may be determined by any criteria, including, but not limited to determining a minimum number of votes received on a particular ticket, ratio of agreeing to disagreeing votes, or other criteria and/or combination thereof. At block <b>1014</b>, a final tally of the votes is determined, after which is determined a potential payout at block <b>1016</b>. At block <b>1015</b>, the user's profile (an originator, a voter) may be updated to reflect the final status of the ticket, and any adjustment in the user's rank or other profile information (e.g., ability to predict outcomes).</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0197">After a closing of the vote, there may be continued activity relating the ticket including, but not limited to, a user being able to change their vote (block <b>1018</b>), participation in an ongoing forum (block <b>1017</b>), or other activity relating to the ticket.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0198"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow chart showing a thematic logic flow of ticket creation and lifetime in an application to the healthcare industry according to one embodiment of the present invention. As discussed above, a user/physician <b>1101</b> may make an observation <b>1103</b> that may relate to one or more triggers set by a client <b>1102</b>. The user may either author an original ticket or vote on an existing ticket as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0199">In one example, client <b>1102</b> may be an investor that would like to observe a particular company and/or its products. To this end, the client <b>1102</b> sets a trigger <b>1104</b> that is stored in a database <b>1105</b> of the ecosystem. If the user/physician makes an observation that activates the trigger, client <b>1102</b> is notified. Similarly, client <b>1102</b> may make his/her own observation and propose the same to the ecosystem for action by one or more users.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0200">In any case, both the client <b>1102</b> and user/physician <b>1101</b> may view a status of the ticket. In one example, the user/physician may be presented a &#x201c;dashboard&#x201d; view <b>1108</b> of the tickets created by the particular user, and their statuses. Client <b>1102</b> may be presented real-time reports <b>1106</b> relating to the tickets owned by the client (e.g., through bidding or sponsorship) and may therefore view any insights related to consensus <b>1107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0201"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow chart showing another example logic flow of ticket creation and lifetime according to one embodiment of the present invention. At block <b>1201</b>, a user has an observation and authors a new ticket at bock <b>1202</b>. At block <b>1203</b>, a nominal signal strength of five (5) is assigned to the ticket, in that it will take five votes until signal strength is reached. Other methods for determining signal strength may be used, and using the number of received votes in one of many possible methods. The ticket may also be assigned an initial value of $500, although this value may be any value related to the worth of the observation.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0202">At block <b>1204</b>A, a first user (Dr. Dean, an intern (physician in-training) having a rank value of 30.5) submits a first vote on the ticket. Further users may submit votes on the ticket at blocks <b>1204</b>B-<b>1204</b>E until the ticket closes at block <b>1205</b>. Such votes may also have a corresponding vote value at blocks <b>1208</b>A-<b>1208</b>E, respectively. Notably, although the first user that votes has a lower rank (30.5) than a later user (50.5), the value of the first user's vote (<b>1208</b>A) is valued higher than the vote of the fifth user (<b>1208</b>E), as earlier votes are valued more highly than later votes on the same ticket. Also, it is noted that votes by users having a higher rank will be valued more highly (e.g., a vote by Dr. Johnson (<b>1208</b>C) than the first voter Dr. Dean (<b>1208</b>A), due to the different rankings of the users. Also, voters that incorrectly vote (Dr. Thomas at block <b>1204</b>D) will yield a value of $0 for their vote (e.g., <b>1208</b>D).</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0203">At block <b>1206</b>, a report is generated after ticket closing, summarizing the result of the voting process. Such a report may be made available to the user that originated the ticket and a client that subscribes to the ticket. After the voting concludes, and the ticket closes, one or more actions may occur, such as conducting a forum to receive additional comments (block <b>1207</b>), allowing users to change their votes, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0204"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a flow chart showing another example logic flow of ticket creation and lifetime according to another embodiment of the present invention which illustrates activity after the close of voting. For example, an observation &#x201c;Rituximab is effective against CD20-positive NHL.&#x201d; is made (block <b>1302</b>) by a physician. A ticket is authored by the physician/user (block <b>1303</b>) and is submitted to the ecosystem. A first vote is received (block <b>1304</b>) by an intern who votes &#x201c;yes&#x201d; to the observation, after which a vote of &#x201c;no&#x201d; is received (block <b>1305</b>) from a more experienced physician user. Afterwards, 200 users vote &#x201c;yes&#x201d; (block <b>1306</b>) and 50 users vote &#x201c;no&#x201d; (block <b>1307</b>). During the voting process and prior to ticket close, 45 of the users that voted &#x201c;no&#x201d; change their responses to &#x201c;yes&#x201d; (block <b>1308</b>), and at ticket close, there are 245 votes in favor of the observation (block <b>1309</b>) and 5 votes against the observation (block <b>1310</b>). Notably, due to the consensus forming in favor of the observation, the ranking and payout of the intern who voted &#x201c;yes&#x201d; increases, while the payout and the ranking of more-highly ranked user decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0205">However, after ticket close, the result of a clinical trial is released to the public wherein it is shown that the observation is false (e.g., Rituximab does not cure cancer). In response, 245 of the users who voted &#x201c;yes&#x201d; to ticket switch their answers to &#x201c;no&#x201d; (block <b>1312</b>) while 5 users maintain their answers as &#x201c;yes&#x201d; (block <b>1313</b>) until they change their votes to &#x201c;no&#x201d; after receiving the report (block <b>1315</b>). Notably, in this example, the intern keeps the money earned through the voting process prior to ticket closing, however, his ranking an respect is lost due to activity after ticket closing. Also, the higher-ranked user does not make any money due to the change in voting after ticket closing, but gains a higher ranking and respect. Additional forum comments may be received at block <b>1316</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">User Interfaces</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0206">The ecosystem and its associated computer system(s) may present various user interfaces for submitting, organizing, and reporting various information related to the ecosystem. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a diagram showing an example interface <b>1400</b> of an online system according to one embodiment of the present invention. The diagram shows a user screen that may be displayed, for example, in an interface of a browser program executing on a general purpose computer system as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0207">In one embodiment, interface <b>1400</b> may be personalized for a user that logs into the ecosystem. In one embodiment of the present invention, the user logs into the system and may be permitted to view his/her name, title, date, time, and status. In addition, the user may be permitted to view all the tickets <b>1401</b> he/she has authored and voted on, along with his/her rank <b>1403</b>, position <b>1402</b> and earnings <b>1404</b> generated through use of the system. The user can also view various statistics, such as the number of users that are in online in real-time, the number of users that are registered with the ecosystem, current ranking <b>1407</b> and the number of earned tickets <b>1408</b> for that particular user. The earning number of tickets may be, for example, determined based on the number of votes placed for other tickets existing in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0208">Also, there may be one or more controls (e.g., links, buttons, input fields, etc.) that permit a user to search and/or browse tickets in the database. For instance, a selection of control <b>1405</b> may cause an interface to be displayed that permits a user to locate tickets based on keyword, tag information, or other criteria. A control <b>1406</b> may, when selected by the user, display the most popular tickets in the system based on activity, value, and or any other parameter, either alone or in combination. A further control <b>1409</b> may be provide that, when activated, displays to the user an interface in which the user may author and submit a ticket to the ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0209">Interface <b>1400</b> may have one or more associated interfaces (not shown) in which a user (e.g., either an information provider or an information consumer) may perform functions relating to the ecosystem. For instance, an information provider may search and submit tickets, create descriptions of observations, set triggers, receive updates, forward tickets to user groups, colleagues, etc. Similarly, information consumers may be presented one or more additional interfaces that permit the information consumer to submit tickets for action by users, bid on outcomes of existing tickets, view reports and opinion results, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0210">For example, after a user votes on a ticket, the user may be informed where they are in the voting order (first, second, third, etc.). However, the user may, according to one embodiment, may not be given any information on the current &#x201c;state&#x201d; of the votes. In another embodiment, only the user originating the ticket may be permitted to view voting status. In parallel, the client that has successfully won the bid for that ticket may be permitted to see votes materializing in real-time. According to one embodiment, results of the ticket may be kept hidden from ecosystem users until the ticket closes. According to one embodiment, it is appreciated that actual results should be hidden from ecosystem users, otherwise the results of the votes of the users will influence how subsequent users vote. This is a critical flaw in conventional &#x201c;market style&#x201d; systems, where the issue's value (e.g., current market value) transmits information to the voter. When the ticket reaches signal strength (either an absolute number of votes and/or a clear consensus), the &#x201c;absolute results&#x201d; of the ticket may be &#x201c;published&#x201d; (e.g., by displaying and/or sending the results to affected users) and users are paid out.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows another example interface <b>1500</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. For example, an online ecosystem may support the creation of various types of tickets. For instance, one type of ticket may relate to an observation of a user (e.g., a &#x201c;Case&#x201d; ticket type, not shown), the user having a first-hand observation of an event. Other tickets may relate to an interpretation of observations (e.g., a &#x201c;Consult&#x201d; ticket type) upon which a survey of colleagues is desired. Tickets may have more that one type of classification, depending on the observation.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0212">A ticket may have one or more ticket types (e.g., ticket type <b>1501</b>) with which a ticket may be classified. One or more actions may be performed by the system in relation to the particular ticket type. For instance, users may be compensated differently based on a particular ticket type (e.g., a user authoring a &#x201c;Case&#x201d; ticket may be compensated independent of rank of the user as being the first to observe a particular event).</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0213">Interface <b>1500</b> may include other information associated with the ticket, such as a title <b>1502</b> and a description <b>1503</b> of the ticket. Such information may be used to form keywords, tags, or other classification information associated with the ticket, to locate similar tickets, and/or to send alerts to other users that a ticket has been created in a particular area or field. Interface <b>1500</b> may collect other information associated with a ticket, such as for example, specialty information <b>1504</b> and any other keywords <b>1505</b> that are associated with a ticket. Such information may also be used to locate tickets, trigger notifications to other users, or perform any other actions in the ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0214">A user may have an idea of possible responses that users may provide to the observation, and may propose such responses in area <b>1506</b> of interface <b>1500</b>. In one embodiment, other users may select the predefined responses (e.g., in a multiple choice listing) or they may propose an alternative response. Such an alternative response may be presented to other users as an optional response.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0215">Further, the author of the ticket may define the number of respondents needed (<b>1507</b>) on the ticket. The number of respondents may be used to determine when consensus is reached, or may be used to define a minimum level of response after which consensus can be determined. Further, the author may define a deadline (<b>1508</b>) for responding to the ticket. That is, the ticket may have some time priority to it, and if the deadline time is exceeded, the ticket may be automatically closed.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0216">Also, as discussed above, classification data (e.g., classification data <b>1509</b>) may be associated with a ticket in the form of one or more tags. Tags may, according to one embodiment, may take the form of keywords (<b>1510</b>) that are associated with tags created in the ecosystem. The user may be presented, in the interface of the system, a listing of the relevant tags associated with a ticket as it is being created. In a specific example, the presented list is changed dynamically in response to information being entered by the user in the ticket creation interface. For instance, as the user types in a description of the observation in the &#x201c;Body Text&#x201d; section, tags are automatically generated by the system in response to the entered information, and thus similar tickets may be located more easily, as tag information (and thus links to other similar tickets) is updated in real time. Interface <b>1500</b> may also use a quantity parameter (e.g., parameter <b>1511</b> indicating the quantity of tickets associated with a particular tag) or other relative parameter to indicate how frequently a tag is used or reference other tickets. A user may select the keyword or tag in the interface to locate other similar tickets, thus minimizing the number of similar tickets defined on such a system.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0217">This invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the previous description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; &#x201c;containing,&#x201d; &#x201c;involving,&#x201d; and/or variations thereof in this document, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items. Such terms are to be construed as open-ended, that is, to mean including but not limited to.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0218">Use of ordinal terms such as &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, &#x201c;third&#x201d;, etc., in the claims to modify a claim element does not by itself connote any priority, precedence, or order of one claim element over another or the temporal order in which acts of a method are performed, but are used merely as labels to distinguish one claim element having a certain name from another element having a same name (but for use of the ordinal term) to distinguish the claim elements.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0219">Having thus described several aspects of at least one embodiment of this invention, it is to be appreciated various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
