<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a technique of a signal line driver circuit. Further, the present invention relates to a light emitting device including the signal line driver circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, display devices for performing image display are being developed. Liquid crystal display apparatus that perform image display by using a liquid crystal device are widely used as display apparatus because of advantages of high image quality, thinness, lightweight, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, light emitting apparatus using self-light emitting devices as light emitting devices are recently being developed. The light emitting apparatus has characteristics of, for example, a high response speed suitable for motion image display, low voltage, and low power consumption, in addition to advantages of existing liquid crystal display apparatus, and thus, attracts a great deal of attention as the next generation display.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As gradation representation methods used in displaying a multi-gradation image on a light emitting apparatus, an analog gradation method and a digital gradation method are given. The former analog gradation method is a method in which the gradation is obtained by conducting analog control of the magnitude of a current that flows to a light emitting device. The latter digital gradation method is a method in which the light emitting device is driven only in two states thereof: an ON state (state where the luminance is substantially 100%) and an OFF state (state where the luminance is substantially 0%). In the digital gradation method, since only two gradations can be displayed, a method configured by combining the digital gradation method and a different method to display multi-gradation images has been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When classification is made based on the type of a signal that is input to pixels, a voltage input method and a current input method are given as pixel-driving methods. The former voltage input method is a method in which: a video signal (voltage) that is input to a pixel is input to a gate electrode of a driving element; and the driving element is used to control the luminance of a light emitting device. The latter current input method is a method in which the set signal current is flown to a light emitting device to control the luminance of the light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hereinafter, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(A)</figref>, a brief description will be made of an example of a circuit of a pixel in a light emitting apparatus employing the voltage input method and a driving method thereof. The pixel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(A)</figref> includes a signal line <b>501</b>, a scanning line <b>502</b>, a switching TFT <b>503</b>, a driving TFT <b>504</b>, a capacitor device <b>505</b>, a light emitting device <b>506</b>, and power sources <b>507</b> and <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the potential of the scanning line <b>502</b> varies, and the switching TFT <b>503</b> is turned ON, a video signal that has been input to the signal line <b>501</b> is input to a gate electrode of the driving TFT <b>504</b>. According to the potential of the input video signal, a gate-source voltage of the driving TFT <b>504</b> is determined, and a current flowing between the source and the drain of the driving TFT <b>504</b> is determined. This current is supplied to the light emitting device <b>506</b>, and the light emitting device <b>506</b> emits light.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a semiconductor device for driving the light emitting device, a polysilicon transistor is used. However, the polysilicon transistor is prone to variation in electrical characteristics, such as a threshold value and an ON current, due to defects in a grain boundary. In the pixel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(A)</figref>, if characteristics of the driving TFT <b>504</b> vary in units of the pixel, even when identical video signals have been input, the magnitudes of the corresponding drain currents of the driving TFTs <b>504</b> are different. Thus, the luminance of the light emitting device <b>506</b> varies.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To solve the problems described above, a desired current may be input to the light emitting device, regardless of the characteristics of the TFTs for driving the light emitting device. From this viewpoint, the current input method has been proposed which can control the magnitude of a current that is supplied to a light emitting device regardless of the TFT characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16(B) and 17</figref>, a brief description will be made of a circuit of a pixel in a light emitting apparatus employing the current input method and a driving method thereof. The pixel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(B)</figref> includes a signal line <b>601</b>, first to third scanning lines <b>602</b> to <b>604</b>, a current line <b>605</b>, TFTs <b>606</b> to <b>609</b>, a capacitor device <b>610</b>, and a light emitting device <b>611</b>. A current source circuit <b>612</b> is disposed to each signal line (each column).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Operations of from video signal-writing to light emission will be described by using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, reference numerals denoting respective portions conform to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17(A) to 17(C)</figref> schematically show current paths. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(D)</figref> shows the relationship between currents flowing through respective paths during a write of a video signal, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(E)</figref> shows a voltage accumulated in the capacitor device <b>610</b> also during the write of a video signal, that is, a gate-source voltage of the TFT <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">First, a pulse is input to the first and second scanning lines <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> to turn the TFTs <b>606</b> and <b>607</b> ON. A signal current flowing through the signal line <b>601</b> at this time will be referred to as I<sub>data</sub>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(A)</figref>, since the signal current I<sub>data </sub>is flowing through the signal line <b>601</b>, the current separately flows through current paths I<sub>1 </sub>and I<sub>2 </sub>in the pixel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(D)</figref> shows the relationship between the currents. Needless to say, the relationship is expressed as I<sub>data</sub>=I<sub>1+I</sub><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The moment the TFT <b>606</b> is turned ON, no charge is yet accumulated in the capacitor device <b>610</b>, and thus, the TFT <b>608</b> is OFF. Accordingly, I<sub>2</sub>=0 and I<sub>data</sub>=I<sub>1 </sub>are established. In the moment, the current flows between electrodes of the capacitor device <b>610</b>, and charge accumulation is performed in the capacitor device <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Charge is gradually accumulated in the capacitor device <b>610</b>, and a potential difference begins to develop between both the electrodes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(E)</figref>). When the potential difference of both the electrodes has reached V<sub>th </sub>(point A in FIG. <b>17</b>(E)), the TFT <b>608</b> is turned ON, and I<sub>2 </sub>occurs. As described above, since I<sub>data</sub>=I<sub>1</sub>+I<sub>2 </sub>is established, while I<sub>1 </sub>gradually decreases, the current keeps flowing, and charge accumulation is continuously performed in the capacitor device <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the capacitor device <b>610</b>, charge accumulation continues until the potential difference between both the electrodes, that is, the gate-source voltage of the TFT <b>608</b> reaches a desired voltage. That is, charge accumulation continues until the voltage reaches a level at which the TFT <b>608</b> can allow the current I<sub>data </sub>to flow. When charge accumulation terminates (B point in FIG. <b>17</b>(E)), the current I<sub>1 </sub>stops flowing. Further, since the TFT <b>608</b> is fully ON, I<sub>data</sub>=I<sub>2 </sub>is established (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(B)</figref>). According to the operations described above, the operation of writing the signal to the pixel is completed. Finally, selection of the first and second scanning lines <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> is completed, and the TFTs <b>606</b> and <b>607</b> are turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Subsequently, a pulse is input to the third scanning line <b>604</b>, and the TFT <b>609</b> is turned ON. Since VGS that has been just written is held in the capacitor device <b>610</b>, the TFT <b>608</b> is already turned ON, and a current identical to I<sub>data </sub>flows thereto from the current line <b>605</b>. Thus, the light emitting device <b>611</b> emits light. At this time, when the TFT <b>608</b> is set to operate in a saturation region, even if the source-drain voltage of the TFT <b>608</b> varies, a light emitting current I<sub>EL </sub>flowing to the light emitting device <b>611</b> flows continuously.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As described above, the current input method refers to a method in which the drain current of the TFT <b>609</b> is set to have the same current value as that of the signal current I<sub>data </sub>set in the current source circuit <b>612</b>, and the light emitting device <b>611</b> emits light with the luminance corresponding to the drain current. By using the thus structured pixel, influence of variation in characteristics of the TFTs constituting the pixel is suppressed, and a desired current can be supplied to the light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Incidentally, in the light emitting apparatus employing the current input method, a signal current corresponding to a video signal needs to be precisely input to a pixel. However, when a signal line driver circuit (corresponding to the current source circuit <b>612</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) used to input the signal current to the pixel is constituted by polysilicon transistors, variation in characteristics thereof occurs, thereby also causing variation in characteristics of the signal current.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">That is, in the light emitting apparatus employing the current input method, variation in characteristics of TFTs constituting the pixel and the signal line driver circuit need to be suppressed. However, while the influence of variation in characteristics of the TFTs constituting the pixel can be suppressed by using the pixel having the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(B)</figref>, suppression of the influence of variation in characteristics of the TFTs constituting the signal line driver circuit is difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Hereinafter, using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a brief description will be made of the structure and operation of a current source circuit disposed in the signal line driver circuit that drives the pixel employing the current input method.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The above-described current source circuit <b>612</b> is set so that the ratio of ON-state currents of the transistors becomes 1:2:4:8 by designing L/W value. However, as for the transistors <b>555</b>-<b>558</b>, the factors of variation such as the gate length, the gate width and the film thickness of a gate insulating film, which are generated by the difference of fabricating steps and substrates to be used are piled up, and the variation is generated in the threshold value and mobility. Therefore, it is difficult to precisely make the ratio of ON-state currents of the transistors <b>555</b>-<b>558</b> to be 1:2:4:8 as it has been designed. Specifically, the variation of the values of currents for supplying to the pixels is generated depending upon the column.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to precisely make the ratio of ON-state currents of the transistors <b>555</b>-<b>558</b> to be 1:2:4:8 as it has been designed, it is necessary to make all the characteristics of the current source circuits existing in the whole columns the same. Specifically, it is necessary to make all the characteristics of the transistors of the current source circuits that signal line drive circuit has the same, however, it is very difficult to realize it.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention has been carried out by considering the above-described problems, the present invention provides a signal line drive circuit capable of suppressing the influence of the characteristic variation of TFTs and supplying the desired signal current to the pixels. Furthermore, the present invention provides alight emitting apparatus capable of suppressing the influence of variation of the characteristics of TFTs which configure both a pixel and a drive circuit and supplying the desired signal current to a light emitting device which configures both of a pixel and a drive circuit by utilizing a pixel having a circuit configuration which has suppressed the influence of variation of the characteristics of TFTs.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention provides a signal line drive circuit having a new configuration in which an electric circuit (in the present specification, referred to as current source circuit) for suppressing the influence of variation of the characteristics of TFTs and passing the desired constant current has been provided. Furthermore, the present invention provides a light emitting apparatus equipped with the foregoing signal line drive circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention provides a signal line drive circuit in which a current source circuit is disposed on each column (each signal line or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A signal line drive circuit of the present invention is set so that the predetermined signal current is supplied to a current source circuit disposed on each signal line (each column) using a constant current source for reference. A current source circuit set so as to supply the signal current has the ability to pass the current in proportion to that of the constant current source for reference. As a result, the influence of variation of the characteristics of TFTs which configure the signal line drive circuit can be suppressed by utilizing the foregoing current source circuit. Then, in a signal line drive circuit of the present invention, a switch for determining whether or not a signal current set in a current source circuit is supplied to the pixel is controlled by a video signal.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Specifically, in the case where it is necessary to pass a signal current in proportion to a video signal through a signal line, there is a switch for determining whether or not the signal current is supplied from the current source circuit to the signal line drive circuit, which is controlled by the video signal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be noted that in the present specification, the switch for determining whether or not the signal current is supplied from the current source circuit to the signal line drive circuit is defined to be referred to as a signal current control switch.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be noted that the constant current source for reference might be integrally formed with the signal line drive circuit on the substrate. Or, as a current for reference, a certain current may be inputted from the exterior of the substrate using IC or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The outline of a signal line drive circuit of the present invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the signal line drive circuits around the three signal lines from i th column to (i+2)th column are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">First, the case where it is necessary to pass the signal current in proportion to that of the video signal through the signal line will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as for a signal line drive circuit <b>403</b>, a current source circuit <b>420</b> is disposed on each signal line (each column). The current source circuit <b>420</b> has a terminal a, a terminal b and a terminal c. A set point signal is inputted into the terminal a. The current (current for reference) is supplied from the constant current source for reference <b>109</b>, which is connected to the current line, to the terminal b. Moreover, the terminal c outputs a signal kept in the current source circuit <b>420</b> via a switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) outputs. Specifically, the current source circuit <b>420</b> is controlled by the set point signal inputted from the terminal a, current (current for reference) is supplied from the terminal b, and the current (signal current) in proportion to the relevant current (current for reference) is outputted from the terminal c. The switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is disposed between the current source circuit <b>420</b> and the pixel, turning ON or OFF of the foregoing switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is controlled by a video signal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Subsequently, a signal line drive circuit of the present invention having a configuration different from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the signal line drive circuit <b>403</b>, two or more current source circuits are disposed on each signal line (each column). Here, supposing that two current source circuits are disposed on each column, the current source circuit <b>420</b> has a first current source circuit <b>421</b> and a second current source circuit <b>422</b>, a first current source circuit <b>421</b> and a second current source circuit <b>422</b> have the terminals a-d. A set point signal is inputted into the terminal a. The current (current for reference) is supplied from the constant current source for reference <b>109</b> which is connected to the current line, to the terminal b. Moreover, the terminal c outputs a signal (signal current) kept in the first current source circuit <b>421</b> and the second current source circuit <b>422</b> via the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch). A control signal is inputted from the terminal d. Specifically, the current source circuit <b>420</b> is controlled by a set point signal inputted from the terminal a and by a control signal inputted from the terminal d, the current (current for reference) is supplied from the terminal b, the current (signal current) in proportion to the relevant current (current for reference) is outputted from the terminal c. The switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is disposed between the current source circuit <b>420</b> and the pixel, and turning ON and OFF of the foregoing switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) are controlled by a video signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is defined that an operation for terminating writing of a signal current with respect to the current source circuit <b>420</b> (an operation defining so that the current source circuit <b>420</b> for setting the signal current by the current for reference can output the signal current) is referred to as a setting operation and an operation for inputting the signal current into a pixel (operation that the current source circuit <b>420</b> outputs the signal current) is referred to as an input operation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, since control signals inputted into the first current source circuit <b>421</b> and the second current source circuit <b>422</b> are different from each other, as for the first current source circuit <b>421</b> and the second current source circuit <b>422</b>, one performs a setting operation and the other performs an input operation, thereby capable of carrying out two operations on each column at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be noted that a setting operation might be carried out during an optional time period at an optional timing, and optional times. That at what kind of timing the setting operation is carried out is capable of being optionally adjusted by a pixel configuration (current source circuit disposed in a pixel) and by configuration such as a current source circuit disposed in the signal line drive circuit. As for the number of times the setting operation is carried out, at least one time may be carried out at the time when the electric source is supplied to the signal line drive circuit and the operation is initiated. However, actually, since there are some cases where the acquired information is leaked by the setting operation, the setting operation may be again carried out when the good timing for acquiring the information comes again.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Concerning with the signal line drive circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the case where the signal current in proportion to a video signal is supplied to the signal line has been described. However, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the current may be supplied to another wiring different from the signal line. In this case, it is not necessary to dispose the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch). The case where the switch <b>101</b> is not disposed is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> concerning with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> concerning with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this case, the current is outputted into a current line for pixel and a video signal is outputted into a signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present invention provides a signal line drive circuit which provides two shift registers (first and second shift register). The first and second shift registers, one is a current source circuit, and the other is a circuit for controlling a video signal, that is, a circuit operated for displaying an image, it controls, for example, a latch circuit, a sampling switch and the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) and the like. Then, an operation of the first and second shift registers is capable of being independently carried out, and necessarily, the setting operation of the current source circuit and the image displaying operation are capable of being independently carried out. Since the setting operation of the current source circuit is precisely carried out when the time is taken much, the configuration of the present invention in which the current source circuit and the latch circuit are capable of being independently operated is very effective.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be noted that a shift register is configured with circuits such as a flip-flop circuit and a decoder circuit. In the case where the shift register is configured with a flip-flop circuit, usually a plurality of wirings are in turn selected from the first column to the final column. On the other hand, in the case where the shift register is configured with a decoder circuit or the like, a plurality of wirings are capable of being selected at random. The configuration of the shift register may be appropriately selected according to the use. If a plurality of wirings can be selected at random, the setting signal is also capable of being outputted. Therefore, the setting operation of the current source circuit is also capable of being carried out not sequentially from the first column but at random. Then, in the case where there is a malfunction accompanying with the setting operation, it can be realized so that the malfunction is overshadowed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be noted that in the present invention, a TFT is capable of being applied by substituting it for a transistor using a usual single crystal, a transistor using SOI, an organic transistor or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, in the present invention, a light emitting apparatus includes a panel in which a pixel section having a light emitting device and a signal line drive circuit are sealed between the substrate and the cover material, a module in which IC or the like is mounted on the foregoing panel, a display or the like in the category. Specifically, a light emitting apparatus corresponds to the general term including a panel, a module, a display and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present invention provides a signal line drive circuit having a current source circuit as described above. Furthermore, the present invention provides a light emitting apparatus capable of suppressing the influence of variation of the characteristics of the TFTs configuring both a pixel and a drive circuit and supplying the desired signal current I data to a light emitting device by utilizing a pixel of circuit configuration which is not influenced by the characteristics of TFTs.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">BEST MODE FOR EMBODYING THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In this embodiment, a description will be made of a structure and an operation of a current source circuit <b>420</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provided to a signal line driver circuit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The signal line driver circuit includes the current control source circuit <b>420</b>, a shift register, and a latch circuit. Further, the signal line driver circuit has the first shift register that controls the current source circuit <b>420</b> and the second shift register that controls the latch circuit etc.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the present invention, a setting signal input from a terminal a corresponds to a sampling pulse from a first shift register. That is, the setting signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> corresponds to the sampling pulse supplied from the first shift register. The present invention performs setting of the current source circuit <b>420</b> in accordance with the timing of the sampling pulse supplied from the first shift register.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the present invention, independent operations of the first shift register and the second shift register can be fully conducted by means of providing the first shift register that controls the current source circuit <b>420</b> and the second shift register that controls the latch circuit. That is, the first shift register can be operated at a low speed while the second shift register is operated at a high speed. Accordingly, it is possible that the setting of the current source circuit <b>420</b> spend as much as time as it is conducted precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Note that a shift register includes a flip-flop circuit, a decoder circuit, or the like. In the case where the shift register includes the flip-flop circuit, in general, a plurality of wirings are sequentially selected from the first column to the last column. On the other hand, in the case where the shift register includes the decoder circuit or the like, a plurality of wirings are sequentially selected from the first column to the last column or selected at random. The shift register may select properly according to the usage. In the case of selecting the structure having a function capable of selecting a plurality of wirings at random, setting can be output randomly. Therefore, the setting operation of the current source circuit is not performed sequentially from the first column to the last column, and can be performed randomly. When the setting operation of the current source circuit can be performed at random as described above, in the case where there exists a defect accompanied with the setting operation of the current source circuit, the defect can be made inconspicuous. The shift register may select properly according to the usage.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Note that a shift register has a structure including, for example, flip-flop circuits (FFs) in a plurality of columns. A clock signal (S-CLK), a start pulse (S-SP), and an inverted clock signal (S-CLKb) are input to the shift register, and signals serially output according to the timing of the input signals are referred to as sampling pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>, a circuit including switches <b>104</b>, <b>105</b><i>a</i>, and <b>106</b>, a transistor <b>102</b> (n-channel type), and a capacitor device <b>103</b> for retaining a gate-source voltage VGS of the transistor <b>102</b> corresponds to the current source circuit <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the current source circuit <b>420</b>, the switch <b>104</b> and the switch <b>105</b><i>a </i>are turned ON by a sampling pulse input via the terminal a. Then, a current (reference current) is supplied via the terminal b from the reference constant current source <b>109</b> (hereinafter referred to as constant current source <b>109</b>) connected to the current line, and a predetermined charge is retained in the capacitor device <b>103</b>. The charge is retained in the capacitor device <b>103</b> until the current (reference current) flown from the constant current source <b>109</b> becomes identical with a drain current of the transistor <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Then, the switches <b>104</b> and <b>105</b><i>a </i>are turned OFF by the signal input via the terminal a. As a result, since the predetermined charge is retained in the capacitor device <b>103</b>, the transistor <b>102</b> has a capability of flowing a current having a magnitude corresponding to the signal current I<sub>data</sub>. If the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) and the switch <b>106</b> are turned into a conductive state, a current flows to a pixel connected to the signal line via the terminal c. At this time, since the gate voltage of the transistor <b>102</b> is set to a predetermined gate voltage by the capacitor device <b>103</b>, a drain current corresponding to the signal current I<sub>data </sub>flows to the drain region of the transistor <b>102</b>. Thus, the magnitude of the current input to the pixel can be controlled without being influenced by the variation in characteristics of the transistors constituting the signal line driver circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Note that, in the case where the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is not arranged, when the switch <b>116</b> is turned into a conductive state, a current is supplied to the pixel connected to the signal line via the terminal c.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The connection structure of the switches <b>104</b> and <b>105</b><i>a </i>is not limited to the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>. For example, the structure may be such that: one of terminals of the switch <b>104</b> is connected to the terminal b, and the other terminal is connected to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>102</b>; and one of terminals of the switch <b>105</b><i>a </i>is connected to the terminal b via the switch <b>104</b>, and the other terminal is connected to the switch <b>106</b>. The switch <b>104</b> and the switch <b>105</b><i>a </i>are controlled by the signal inputted from the terminal a.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Alternatively, the switch <b>104</b> may be arranged between the terminal b and the gate electrode of the transistor <b>102</b>, and the switch <b>105</b><i>a </i>may be arranged between the terminal b and the switch <b>116</b>. Incidentally, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31(A)</figref>, switches may be arranged such that the connection is structured as shown in FIG. <b>31</b>(A<b>1</b>) in the setting operation, and the connection is structured as shown in FIG. <b>31</b>(A<b>2</b>) in the input operation. The number of switches and the number of wirings, which are arranged in the current source circuit and the connection are not particularly limited.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the current source circuit <b>420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>, the operation for setting the signal (setting operation) cannot be performed simultaneously with the operation for inputting the signal (input operation) to the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref>, a circuit including a switch <b>124</b>, a switch <b>125</b>, a transistor <b>122</b> (n-channel type), a capacitor device <b>123</b> for retaining a gate-source voltage VGS of the transistor <b>122</b>, and a transistor <b>126</b> (n-channel type) corresponds to the current source circuit <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The transistor <b>126</b> functions as either a switch or a part of a current source transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the current source circuit <b>420</b>, the switch <b>124</b> and the switch <b>125</b> are turned ON by a sampling pulse input via the terminal a. Then, a current (reference current) is supplied via the terminal b from the constant current source <b>109</b> connected to the current line, and a predetermined charge is retained in the capacitor device <b>123</b>. The charge is retained until the current (reference current) flown from the constant current source <b>109</b> becomes identical with a drain current of the transistor <b>122</b>. Note that, when the switch <b>124</b> is turned ON, since a gate-source voltage VGS of the transistor <b>126</b> is set to 0 V, the transistor <b>126</b> is turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Subsequently, the switches <b>124</b> and <b>125</b> are turned OFF. As a result, since the predetermined charge is retained in the capacitor device <b>123</b>, the transistor <b>122</b> has a capability of flowing a current having a magnitude corresponding to that of the signal current I<sub>data</sub>. If the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is turned into the conductive state, a current flows to a pixel connected to the signal line via the terminal c. This is because the gate voltage of the transistor <b>122</b> is set at a predetermined gate voltage by the capacitor device <b>123</b>, and thus, a drain current corresponding to the signal current I<sub>data </sub>flows to the drain region of the transistor <b>122</b>. Therefore, the magnitude of the current that is input to the pixel can be controlled without being influenced by the variation in characteristics of the transistors constituting the signal line driver circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Note that, when the switches <b>124</b> and <b>125</b> have been turned OFF, a gate and a source of the transistor <b>126</b> do not have the same potential. As a result, since the charge retained in the capacitor device <b>123</b> is distributed also to the transistor <b>126</b>, and the transistor <b>126</b> is automatically turned ON. Here, the transistors <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> are connected in series, and the gates thereof are connected to each other. Accordingly, the transistors <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> each serve as a multi-gate transistor. That is, a gate length L of the transistor varies between the setting operation and the input operation. Therefore, the value of the current supplied from the terminal b at the time of the setting operation can be made larger than the value of the current supplied from the terminal c at the time of the input operation. Thus, various loads (such as wiring resistances and cross capacitances) disposed between the terminal b and the reference constant current source can be charged even faster. Consequently, the setting operation can be completed quickly. In the case where the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is not arranged, when the switch <b>126</b> is turned into the conductive state, a current flows via the terminal c to the pixel connected to the signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Further, the number of switches and the number of wirings, which are arranged in the current source circuit, and the connection are not particularly limited. Specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31(B)</figref>, wirings and switches may be arranged such that the connection is structured as shown in FIG. <b>31</b>(B<b>1</b>) in the setting operation, and the connection is structured as shown in FIG. <b>31</b>(B<b>2</b>) in the input operation. In particular, in FIG. <b>31</b>(C<b>2</b>), it is sufficient that the charge accumulated in a capacitor device <b>107</b> does not leak.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the current source circuit <b>420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>, the operation for setting the signal (setting operation) cannot be performed simultaneously with the operation for inputting the signal (input operation) to the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (C), a circuit including a switch <b>108</b>, a switch <b>110</b>, transistors <b>105</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b> (n-channel type), and a capacitor device <b>107</b> for retaining gate-source voltages VGS of the transistors <b>105</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b> corresponds to the current source circuit <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the current source circuit <b>420</b>, the switch <b>108</b> and the switch <b>110</b> are turned ON by a sampling pulse input via the terminal a. Then, a current (reference current) is supplied via the terminal b from the constant current source <b>109</b> connected to the current line, and a predetermined charge is retained in the capacitor device <b>107</b>. The charge is retained until the current (reference current) flown from the constant current source <b>109</b> becomes identical with a drain current of the transistor <b>105</b><i>b</i>. At this time, since the gate electrodes of the transistor <b>105</b><i>b </i>and of the transistor <b>106</b> are connected to each other, the gate voltages of the transistor <b>105</b><i>b </i>and the transistor <b>106</b> are retained by the capacitor device <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Then, the switches <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> are turned OFF by a signal input via the terminal a. At this time, since the predetermined charge is retained in the capacitor device <b>107</b>, the transistor <b>106</b> has a capability of flowing a current having a magnitude corresponding to that of the current (reference current). If the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is turned to the conductive state, a current flows to a pixel connected to the signal line via the terminal c. This is because the gate voltage of the transistor <b>106</b> is set to a predetermined gate voltage by the capacitor device <b>107</b>, and thus, a drain current corresponding to the current (reference current) flows to the drain region of the transistor <b>106</b>. Thus, the magnitude of the current input to the pixel can be controlled without being influenced by the variation in characteristics of the transistors constituting the signal line driver circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Note that, in the case where the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is not arranged, a current flows to the pixel connected to the signal line via the terminal c.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">At this time, characteristics of the transistor <b>105</b><i>b </i>and the transistor <b>106</b> need to be the same to cause the drain current corresponding to the signal current I<sub>data </sub>to flow precisely to the drain region of the transistor <b>106</b>. To be more specific, values such as mobility and thresholds of the transistors <b>105</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b> need to be the same. In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(C)</figref>, the value of W/L of each of the transistors <b>105</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b> may be arbitrarily set, and a current proportional to the current supplied from the constant current source <b>109</b> may be supplied to the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Further, the value of W/L of the transistor <b>105</b><i>b </i>or the transistor <b>106</b> that is connected to the constant current source <b>109</b> is set high, whereby the write speed can be increased by supplying a large current from the constant current source <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Note that, with the current source circuit <b>420</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(C)</figref>, the setting operation for conducting setting to make the current source circuit have a capability of flowing a signal current can be performed simultaneously with the input operation for inputting the signal current to the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The current source circuit <b>420</b> shown in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(D) and 6(E)</figref> has the same structure as that of the current source circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(C)</figref>, except for the connection of the switch <b>110</b>. In addition, since the operation of the current source circuit <b>420</b> of each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(D) and 6(E)</figref> conforms to the operation of the current source circuit <b>420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(C)</figref>, a description thereof will be omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Note that, the number of switches and the connection structure are not particularly limited. Specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31(C)</figref>, wirings and switches may be arranged such that the connection is structured as shown in FIG. <b>31</b>(C<b>1</b>) in the setting operation, and the connection is structured as shown in FIG. <b>31</b>(C<b>2</b>) in the input operation. In particular, in FIG. <b>31</b>(C<b>2</b>) it is sufficient that the charge held in the capacitor device <b>107</b> does not leak. The number of wirings, the number of switches, and the connection structures are not particularly limited.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32(A)</figref>, a circuit including switches <b>195</b><i>b</i>, <b>195</b><i>c</i>, <b>195</b><i>d</i>, and <b>195</b><i>f</i>, a transistor <b>195</b><i>a</i>, and a capacitor device <b>195</b><i>e </i>corresponds to the current source circuit. In the current source circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32(A)</figref>, the switches <b>195</b><i>b</i>, <b>195</b><i>c</i>, <b>195</b><i>d</i>, and <b>195</b><i>f </i>are turned ON by a signal input via the terminal a. Then, a current is supplied via the terminal b from the constant current source <b>109</b> connected to the current line. A predetermined charge is retained in the capacitor device <b>195</b><i>e </i>until the signal current supplied from the constant current source <b>109</b> becomes identical with a drain current of the transistor <b>195</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Then, the switches <b>195</b><i>b</i>, <b>195</b><i>c</i>, <b>195</b><i>d</i>, and <b>195</b><i>f </i>are turned OFF by the signal input via the terminal a. At this time, since the predetermined charge is retained in the capacitor device <b>195</b><i>e</i>, the transistor <b>195</b><i>a </i>has a capability of flowing a current having a magnitude corresponding to that of the signal current. This is because the gate voltage of the transistor <b>195</b><i>a </i>is set to a predetermined gate voltage by the capacitor device <b>195</b><i>e</i>, and thus, a drain current corresponding to a current (reference current) flows to the drain region of the transistor <b>195</b><i>a</i>. In this state, a current is supplied to the outside via the terminal c. Note that, in the current source circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32(A)</figref>, the operation for setting the current source circuit to have a capability of flowing a signal current cannot be performed simultaneously with the input operation for inputting the signal current to the pixel. Incidentally, when a switch controlled by the signal input via the terminal a is ON, and also, when a current is controlled not to flow from the terminal c, the terminal c needs to be connected to another wiring of the other potential. Assuming that the wiring potential is represented by Va, Va may have any value as long as Va is a potential sufficient to flow a current flowing from the terminal b as it is. A power supply voltage Vdd may be adopted as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Note that, the number of switches, and the connection are not particularly limited. Specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32(B) and 32(C)</figref>, wirings and switches may be arranged such that the connection is structured as shown in either FIG. <b>32</b>(B<b>1</b>) or <b>32</b>(C<b>1</b>) in the setting operation, and the connection is structured as shown in either FIG. <b>32</b>(B<b>2</b>) or <b>32</b>(C<b>2</b>) in the input operation.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>, with the capacitor device arranged between the gate and the source, even when the source potential varies, the gate-source voltage can be maintained.

<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Operation of the current source circuit <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is similar to that shown in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20(A) to 20(C)</figref> except for the current-flow direction, and thus, a description thereof will be omitted here. In the case of designing the current source circuit in which the polarities of the transistors <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> are changed without changing the current-flow direction, the circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref> may be referenced.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In addition, the transistor polarity can be changed without changing the current-flow direction. This conforms to the operation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, so that a description thereof will be omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In summary, in the current source circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the current having the same magnitude as that of the signal current I<sub>data </sub>set in the current source flows to the pixel. In other words, the signal current I<sub>data </sub>set in the constant current source is identical in value with the current flowing to the pixel. The current is not influenced by variation in characteristics of the transistors provided in the current source circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In each of the current source circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref>, the signal current I<sub>data </sub>cannot be output to the pixel from the current source circuit in a period during which the setting operation is performed. Thus, two current source circuits are preferably provided for each signal line, in which an operation (setting operation) for setting a signal is performed to one of the current source circuits, and an operation (input operation) for inputting I<sub>data </sub>to the pixel is performed using the other current source circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Incidentally, in the case where the setting operation and the input operation are not performed at the same time, only one current source circuit may be provided for each column. The current source circuit of each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32(A) and 33(A)</figref> is similar to the current source circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, except for the connection and current-flow paths. The current source circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35(A)</figref> is similar to the current source circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, except for the difference in magnitude between the current supplied from the constant current source and the current flowing from the current source circuit. The current source circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(B) and 33(B)</figref> are similar to the current source circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, except for the difference in magnitude between the current supplied from the constant current source and the current flowing from the current source circuit. Specifically, in the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35(A)</figref>, only the gate width W of the transistor is different between the setting operation and the input operation; in the structure of each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(B) and 33(B)</figref>, only the gate length L is different between the setting operation and the input operation; and others are similar to those of the structure of the current source circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">On the other hand, in each of the current source circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, the signal current I<sub>data </sub>set in the constant current source and the value of the current flowing to the pixel are dependent on the sizes of the two transistors provided in the current source circuit. In other words, the signal current I<sub>data </sub>set in the constant current source and the current flowing to the pixel can be arbitrarily changed by arbitrarily designing the sizes (W (gate width) IL (gate length)) of the two transistors provided in the current source circuit. However, output of precise signal current I<sub>data </sub>to the pixel is difficult in the case where variation is caused in the characteristics of the two transistors, such as threshold values and mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Further, in each of the current source circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, the signal can be input to the pixel in the period during which the setting operation is performed. That is, the operation (setting operation) for setting the signal can be performed simultaneously with the operation (input operation) for inputting the signal to the pixel. Thus, unlike the current source circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, two current source circuits do not need to be provided in a single signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">There are three general classifications for providing the current source circuit in the signal line driver circuit.

And third, the current source lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> are formed in each signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In one case among above three for providing one current source circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> in each signal line, the operation of the first shift register needs to be performed during the period that the second shift register is not operating.

It results from the fact that the setting operation and the input operation can not be performed simultaneously in the case of providing the current source circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> in each signal line. When the second shift register is used when the input operation is performed, and the first shift register is used when the setting operation is performed. Namely, the first shift register can not perform during the period that the second shift register is operated, since the input operation is performed through that period.</p>

<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The above has described that, for the current source circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (or, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref>, <b>33</b>(B), <b>35</b>(A), or the like), preferably, two current source circuits are provided for each signal line (each column), in which one of the current source circuits is used to perform the setting operation, and the other current source circuit is used to perform the setting operation. This is because the setting operation and the input operation cannot be performed simultaneously. In this embodiment, the structure and operation of either the first current source circuit <b>421</b> or the second current source circuit <b>422</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Note that the signal line driver circuit includes the current source circuit <b>420</b>, the shift register, the latch circuits, and the like. The signal line driver circuit of the present invention includes the first shift register that controls the current source circuit <b>420</b> and the second shift register that controls the latch circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In the present invention, a setting signal input from a terminal a corresponds to a sampling pulse supplied from a first shift register. That is, the setting signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> corresponds to the sampling pulse supplied from the first shift register. The present invention performs setting of the current source circuit <b>420</b> in accordance with the timing of the sampling pulse supplied from the first shift register and the control line.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In the present invention, independent operations of the first shift register and the second shift register can be fully conducted by means of providing the first shift register that controls the current source circuit <b>420</b> and the second shift register that controls the latch circuit. That is, the first shift register can be operated at a low speed while the second shift register is operated at a high speed. Accordingly, it is possible that the setting of the current source circuit <b>420</b> spend as much as time as it is conducted precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Note that a shift register has a structure including, for example, flip-flop circuits (FFs) in a plurality of columns. A clock signal (S-CLK), a start pulse (S-SP), and an inverted clock signal (S-CLKb) are input to the shift register, and signals serially output according to the timing of the input signals are referred to as sampling pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Note that a shift register includes a flip-flop circuit, a decoder circuit, or the like. In the case where the shift register includes the flip-flop circuit, in general, a plurality of wirings are sequentially selected from the first column to the last column. On the other hand, in the case where the shift register includes the decoder circuit or the like, a plurality of wirings are sequentially selected from the first column to the last column or selected at random. The shift register may select properly according to the usage. In the case of selecting the structure having a function capable of selecting a plurality of wirings at random, setting can be output randomly. Therefore, the setting operation of the current source circuit is not performed sequentially from the first column to the last column, and can be performed randomly. When the setting operation of the current source circuit can be performed at random as described above, in the case where there exists a defect accompanied with the setting operation of the current source circuit, the defect can be made inconspicuous. The shift register may select properly according to the usage.</p>

<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Subsequently, the switches <b>144</b> to <b>147</b> are turned OFF by the signals input via the terminals a and d.

Here, the transistors <b>142</b> and <b>148</b> are coupled in series, and the gates thereof are connected to each other. Therefore, the transistors <b>142</b> and <b>148</b> each operate as a multi-gate transistor. That is, a gate length L of the transistor differs between the setting operation and the input operation. Thus, the value of current supplied from the terminal b in the setting operation can be made larger than the value of current supplied from the terminal c in the input operation. Thus, various loads (such as wiring resistance and cross capacitance) disposed between the terminal b and the reference constant current source can be charged even faster.

It should be noted that in the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38A</figref> and B, the number of wirings to be wired are capable of being reduced comparing to that of the decoder of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Operations of the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</figref> will be briefly described below. The flip-flop circuit (FF) <b>221</b> in turn outputs the sampling pulse according to the timing of a clock signal (CLK), a start pulse (SP) and a clock reverse signal (CLKb). The sampling pulse outputted from the flip-flop circuit <b>221</b> is inputted into the latch (LAT<b>1</b>) <b>222</b>. A column selection signal is inputted into the latch <b>222</b>, the selection signal is kept only in the latch <b>222</b> of the columns which are desired to select according to the timing of the sampling pulse inputted.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">During the time when the sampling pulse is outputted from the flip-flop circuit <b>221</b>, the selection control signal is made L signal. Then, the selection signal is not outputted regardless of the state of the latch <b>222</b>. Because the output of the latch (LAT<b>1</b>) <b>222</b> has been inputted into an AND circuit. In another input terminal of the AND circuit, a selection control signal has been inputted. Therefore, when a L signal is inputted for the selection control signal, L signal is always outputted from the AND circuit. Specifically, the selection signal is not outputted regardless of the state of the latch <b>222</b>. Then, the sampling pulses are outputted to all the columns from the flip-flop circuit <b>221</b>, after the selection signal is kept in the latch <b>222</b> of the rows which are desired to select by the row section signal, the selection control signal is made a H signal. Then, a signal of the latch <b>222</b> is outputted from the AND circuit. In the case where the signal of the latch <b>222</b> is a H signal, a H signal is outputted from the AND circuit, and in the case where the signal of the latch <b>222</b> is a L signal, a L signal is outputted from the AND circuit. As a result, the selection signal is outputted only in the columns which are desired to select. Because only the signals of the latch <b>222</b> of the columns which are desired to select have been H signals. Then, when the output of the selection signal is desired to stop, the selection control signal is made L signal. Then, the selection signal is not outputted. Therefore, the period during the wires are selected is capable of being freely controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Then, again, a start pulse (SP) is inputted, the sampling pulse is outputted from the flip-flop circuit (FF), and a similar operation is repeated. In this way, by controlling the timing of the row selection signal, an optional row is capable of being selected at random, and the row is capable of being also optionally changed even during the time when the row is selected. Specifically, the setting operation is capable of being carried out with respect to the current source circuit of an optional row, the period during the time when the setting operation is carried out is capable of being optionally changed. However, in the case of this circuit, during the time when the sampling pulse is outputted from the flip-flop circuit <b>221</b>, it is not desirable that the selection signal is outputted. Since there is a possibility that the information inputted immediately before this information being inputted is not still kept in the latch <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Then, a circuit which has been made so as to be capable of outputting the selection signal during the time when the sampling pulse is outputted from the flip-flop circuit <b>221</b> is the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref>, the sampling pulse is outputted from the flip-flop circuit <b>224</b>, and a column selection signal is inputted into the first latch <b>225</b>. Then, the output of the sampling pulse is terminated, and after the column selection signal was inputted into all the first latch <b>225</b>, signals of the first latch <b>225</b> are transferred to the second latch <b>226</b> using the latch for selection at the same time. Then, the selection signal is outputted from the second latch <b>226</b>. Then, again, the sampling pulse is outputted from the flip-flop circuit <b>224</b>, and the row selection signal is inputted into the first latch <b>225</b>. However, at that time and at the same time, the selection signal continues to be outputted from the second latch <b>226</b>. Therefore, each one is capable of being operated at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Using the circuit indicated in the above-described <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, <b>38</b>, the setting operation of the current source circuit is also capable of being not in turn carried out, but carried out at random. Moreover, the time period during which the setting operation is carried out is also capable of being freely taken for a long time. When the setting operation of the current source circuit is capable of being carried out at random, a variety of advantages will occur. For example, in the case where the time periods during which the setting operation is capable of being carried out are interspersed in one frame, if an optional column is capable of being selected, the degree of freedom is raised, and the time period of the setting operation is capable of being taken for a long time. For example, in the time periods during which the setting operation is capable of being carried out and which are interspersed in one frame, the setting operation of the current source circuit is capable of being carried out by one column fully using the time period.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">If the current source circuit of an optional column is not capable of being specified, and if the rows from the first row to the final row must be in turn specified, the time period of the setting operation per one column is shortened. This is the reason why the time period of the setting operation is shortened since in a certain determined time period, the setting operation must be carried out with respect to the current source circuit from the first column to the final column. As a result, the setting operation is not capable of being sufficiently carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">As the other advantages, the influence of the leak of the charge in a capacity element disposed within the current source circuit <b>420</b> (for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, corresponding to a capacity element <b>103</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, corresponding to a capacity element <b>123</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, corresponding to a capacity element <b>107</b> or the like) is capable of being overshadowed. In the case where the leak of the charge in turn occurs column by column, the influence is easily seen, but in the case where it occurs at random, it is not easily seen to human eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">It should be noted that a capacity element is disposed in the current source circuit <b>420</b>. However, a capacity element may be substituted with a gate capacity of a transistor. In the foregoing capacity element, the charge is accumulated by the setting operation of the current source circuit. Ideally, the setting operation of the current source circuit may be carried out only once at the time when the electric source is inputted. Specifically, when the signal line drive circuit is operated, during the first time period of the operation, it may be carried out once. Because the charge amount accumulated in a capacity element is not required to change by the operation state, the time and the like, and it is not changed. However, in reality, a variety of noises are entered into a capacity element or the leak current of the transistor connected to the capacity element flows. As a result, the charge amount accumulated in the capacity element may be changed accompanying with the time elapse. When the charge amount is changed, the current outputted from the current source circuit, that is, the current inputted into the pixel is also changed. As a result, the brightness of the pixel is also changed. Then, for the purpose that the charge accumulated in the capacity element does not vary, the setting operation of the current source circuit is carried out periodically in a certain cycle, the charge is refreshed, and the changed charge is again restored to the original, the necessity occurs that the correct amount of the charge must be again stored.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Supposing the case where the variation amount of the charge accumulated in a capacity element is large, the relevant charge is refreshed by carrying out the setting operation of the current source circuit, the changed charge is again restored to the original, and the correct amount of the charge is again stored, accompanying with this, the variation of the current amount that the current source circuit outputs becomes also large. Therefore, when the setting operation is in turn carried out from the first row, the variation of the current amount that the current source circuit outputs may cause the display disturbance to the extent that it is capable of being visibly recognized. Specifically, the change of the brightness of the pixel which in turn occurs from the first row may cause the display disturbance to the extent that it is capable of being visibly recognized. In this case, if the setting operation is not in turn carried out from the first row, but carried out at random, the variation of the current amount that the current source circuit outputs is capable of being overshadowed. In this way, by selecting a plurality of wirings at random, a variety of advantages will occur.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">On the other hand, in the case where the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C-E</figref> is employed for the current source circuit <b>420</b>, since the setting operation and the input operation are capable of being carried out at the same time, it is sufficient if the usual shift register capable of in turn selecting from the first column to the final column is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Moreover, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, although the setting operation is carried out column by column, it is not limited by this. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, the setting operation may be carried out on a plurality of columns at the same time. Here, that the setting operation is carried out on a plurality of columns at the same time is referred to as polyphasing. It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, although two pieces of the constant current source for reference <b>109</b> are disposed, the setting operation might be carried out from the constant current source for reference separately disposed with respect to these two pieces of the constant current source for reference.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Now, the detailed configuration of the constant current circuit <b>414</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> shows a circuit for applying that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> to the portion of the current source circuit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> shows a circuit for applying that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> to the portion of the current source circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">So far, the case of line sequential drive has been described. Subsequently, hereinafter, the case of dot sequential drive will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>, the sampling of a video signal supplied to the video line is carried out according to the timing of the sampling pulse supplied from the second shift register <b>411</b>. Moreover, the setting of the current source circuit <b>420</b> is carried out according to the timing of the sampling pulse supplied from the first shift register <b>415</b>. In this way, in the case where it has the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>, the dot sequential drive is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">It should be noted that in the case where only during the time when the sampling pulse is outputted and the video signal is supplied from the video line, the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is turned to be ON-state, and when the sampling pulse is not outputted and the video signal is not supplied from the video line, the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is turned to be OFF-state, it is not correctly operated. Because in the pixel, the switch for inputting the current remains to be ON-state. In this state, when the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is turned to be OFF-state, since the current is not inputted into the pixel, the signal is not correctly capable of being inputted.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Hence, in order to be capable of keeping the video signal supplied from the video line and maintaining the state of the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch), the latch circuit <b>452</b> is disposed. The latch circuit <b>452</b> may be configured only with a simple capacity element and a switch, or may be configured with a SRAM circuit. In this way, the sampling pulse is outputted, a video signal is in turn supplied column by column from the video line, the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) is turned to be ON-state or to be OFF-state based on its video signal, and the dot sequential drive is capable of being realized by controlling the supply of the current to the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">However, in the case where the columns from the first column to the final column are in turn selected, on the columns nearby the first column, the time period for inputting the signal to the pixel is long. On the other hand, on the columns nearby the final column, even when the video signal has been inputted, soon, the pixel of the next line is selected. As a result, the time period during which the signal is inputted into the pixel is shortened. In such a case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref>, the time period during which the signal is inputted into the pixel is capable of being lengthened by dividing the scan line disposed in the pixel <b>402</b> at the center. In this case, one piece of scan line drive circuit is disposed on the left side and right side of the pixel section <b>402</b>, respectively, and the pixel is driven using the relevant scan line drive circuit. If doing in such a way, even the pixels disposed on the same column, the pixel on the right side and the pixel on the left side are capable of shifting the time period that the signal is inputted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42C</figref>, the output waveform of the scan line drive circuits disposed on the right side and left side of the first line and second line and a start pulse (S<b>2</b>-SP) of the second shift register <b>411</b> is shown. By operating as the waveform described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42C</figref>, even the pixel on the left side is capable of lengthening the time period during which the signal is inputted into the pixel, the dot sequential drive is facilitated to carry out.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">It should be noted that the setting operation of the current source circuit <b>420</b> may be carried out by an optional times with an optional timing to a current source circuit disposed on an optional column regardless of whether it is the line sequential drive or the dot sequential drive. However, ideally, as far as the predetermined charge is kept in a capacity element connected between gate/source of the transistor disposed in the current source circuit <b>420</b>, it may be carried out only once when the setting operation is carried out. Or, it may be carried out in the case where the predetermined charge kept in a capacity element has been discharged (varied). Moreover, as for the setting operation of the current source circuit <b>420</b>, the setting operation of the current source circuit <b>420</b> of all the columns may be carried out even if it takes for any long time period. Specifically, the setting operation of the current source circuit <b>420</b> of all the columns may be carried out within one frame time period. Or, within one frame time period, the setting operation is carried out to the several columns of the current source circuits <b>420</b>, as a result of this, taking for over several frame time period, the setting operation of all the columns of the current source circuits <b>420</b> may be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Moreover, in the present embodiment, the case where one current source circuit is disposed on each column has been described above, but the present invention is not limited to this, and a plurality of current source circuit may be disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Then, as an example, the case where that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is applied to the portion of the current source circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is considered. The detailed configuration of the constant current circuit <b>414</b> in that case is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> shows a circuit for applying that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> to the portion of the current source circuit. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, the setting operation can be carried out to one of the current source, and at the same time, the other current source can carry out the input operation, by controlling the control line.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Moreover, the present invention provides a signal line drive circuit in which two shift registers (first and second shift registers) are provided. As for these first and second shift registers, one is a current source circuit, the other is a circuit for controlling the video signal, that is, a circuit for making an image display, controlling, for example, a latch circuit, a sampling switch and the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) and the like. Then, it is possible that the operation of the first and second shift registers are independently carried out, necessarily it is possible that the setting operation of the current source circuit and the operation of the image display are independently carried out. Since the setting operation of the current source circuit is capable of being precisely carried out when it is carried out by taking an enough time, a configuration of the present invention in which the current source circuit and the latch circuit are capable of being independently operated is very effective.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Moreover, as for a current source circuit in a signal line drive circuit of the present invention, the layout diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, and corresponding circuit diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">It should be noted that the present embodiment is capable of being optionally combined with Embodiments 1-3.</p>

<p id="p-0250" num="0249">In this embodiment, the detailed structure and operation of the signal line driver circuit <b>403</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(A)</figref> will be described. In this embodiment, a description is made of the signal line driver circuit <b>403</b> used in the case of performing 3-bit digital gradation display.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view of the signal line driver circuit <b>403</b> in the case of performing the 3-bit digital gradation display. The signal line driver circuit <b>403</b> includes a first shift register <b>415</b>, a second shift register <b>411</b>, a first latch circuit <b>412</b>, a second latch circuit <b>413</b>, and a constant current circuit <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">The operation will be briefly described below. The first shift register <b>415</b> and the second shift register <b>411</b> are formed using a plurality of flip-flop circuits (FF), and is input with a clock signal (S-CLK, (S<b>1</b>-CLK, S<b>2</b>-CLK)), a start pulse (S-SP (S<b>1</b>-SP, S<b>2</b>-SP)), and an inverted clock signal (S-CLKb (S<b>1</b>-CLKb, S<b>2</b>-CLKb)). In accordance with the timing of these signals, sampling pulses are sequentially output therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">The sampling pulses, which have been output from the first shift register <b>415</b>, are input to the constant current circuit <b>414</b>. The sampling pulses, which have been output from the shift register <b>411</b>, are input to the first latch circuit <b>412</b>. 3-bit digital video signals (Digital Data <b>1</b> to Digital Data <b>3</b>) have been input to the first latch circuit <b>412</b>, and a video signal is retained in each column in accordance with the timing at which the sampling pulse is input.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">In the first latch circuit <b>412</b>, upon completion of video-signal retaining in columns to the last column, during a horizontal return period, a latch pulse is input to the second latch circuit <b>413</b>, and the 3-bit digital video signals (Digital Data <b>1</b> to Digital Data <b>3</b>) retained in the first latch circuit <b>412</b> are transferred in batch to the second latch circuit <b>413</b>. Then, the 3-bit digital video signals (Digital Data <b>1</b> to Digital Data <b>3</b>) for one line, which are retained in the second latch circuit <b>413</b>, are input to the constant current circuit <b>414</b> at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">While the 3-bit digital video signals (Digital Data <b>1</b> to Digital Data <b>3</b>) retained in the second latch circuit <b>413</b> are input to the constant current circuit <b>414</b>, sampling pulses are again output in the shift register <b>411</b>. Thereafter, the operation is iterated, and video signals for one frame are thus processed.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">There is a case where the constant current circuit <b>414</b> plays a role of converting a digital signal into an analog signal. In the constant current circuit <b>414</b>, a plurality of current source circuits <b>420</b> are provided. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic view of the signal line driver circuit related to the three signal lines in i-th to (i+2)-th columns.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the case where a reference constant current source <b>109</b> corresponding to each bit is arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Each current source circuit <b>420</b> has a terminal a, a terminal b, and a terminal c. The current source circuit <b>420</b> is controlled by a signal input from the terminal a. Further, current is supplied via a terminal b from a reference constant current source <b>109</b> connected to a current line. Switches (signal current control switches) <b>111</b> to <b>113</b> are provided between the current source circuit <b>420</b> and a pixel connected to a signal line Sn, and the switches (signal current control switches) <b>111</b> to <b>113</b> are controlled by 1-bit to 3-bit video signals. In the case where the video signal is a bright signal, a current is supplied from the current source circuit to the pixel. On the contrary, in the case where the video signal is a dark signal, the switches (signal current control switches) <b>111</b> to <b>113</b> are controlled not to supply current to the pixel. That is, the current source circuit <b>420</b> has a capability of flowing a predetermined current, and the switches (signal current control switches) <b>111</b> to <b>113</b> control whether the current is supplied to the pixel or not.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the current lines and the reference constant current sources are disposed in correspondence with respective bits. The sum of the values of currents supplied from the current sources of the respective bits is supplied to the signal lines. That is, the constant current circuit <b>414</b> also has a function of digital-analog conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Note that the setting signal input from the terminal a corresponds to the sampling pulse supplied from the first shift register <b>415</b>. In the present invention, setting of the current source circuit <b>420</b> is performed in accordance with the sampling pulse supplied from the first shift register. In this embodiment, because of a description with reference to an example of the case of performing 3-bit digital gradation display, three current source circuits <b>420</b> are provided for each column. When signal currents supplied from the three current source circuits <b>420</b> connected to one signal line are set to a ratio of 1:2:4, the current magnitude can be controlled at 2<sup>3</sup>=8 levels.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">In the signal line driver circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, although dedicated reference constant current sources <b>109</b> are respectively disposed for the 1-bit to 3-bit, the present invention is not limited to this. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, reference constant current sources <b>109</b> the number of which is smaller than the number of bits may be disposed. For example, it may be such that only the reference constant current source <b>109</b> for the most significant bit (3-bit in this case) is disposed; one current source circuit selected from a plurality of current source circuits disposed in one column is set; and using the current source circuit for which the setting operation has already been performed, the operation is performed for other current source circuits. In other words, the current source circuit for which the setting operation has already been performed may be used to share setting information.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">For example, a setting operation is performed only for a 3-bit current source circuit <b>420</b>. Then, using the current source circuit <b>420</b> for which the setting operation has been performed, information is shared among other 1-bit and 2-bit current source circuits <b>420</b>. More specifically, among current source circuits <b>420</b>, the gate terminal of each current-supplying transistor (corresponding to a transistor <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>) is connected, and also the source terminal is connected. As a result, gate-source voltages of information-sharing transistors (current-supplying transistors) become identical.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the setting operation is performed not for the current source circuits of the least significant bit (1-bit in this case), but for the current source circuits of the most significant bit (3-bit in this case). Thus, when the setting operation is performed for the current source circuits of a greater-value bit, the influence of variation in characteristics of inter-bit current source circuits can be reduced. Suppose the setting operation is performed for the current source circuits of the least significant bit (1-bit in this case), information related to the setting operation performed for the current source circuits of the least significant bit is shared among the current source circuits of the upper bits. In this case, when the characteristics of the respective current source circuits vary, the values of currents of the upper bits lack precision. This is because since upper-bit current source circuits produce outputs having great current values, even when a small variation has occurred in their characteristics, the influence of the variation is magnified, and also output current values are also varied great. In contrast, in the case where the setting operation is performed for the current source circuits of the most significant bit (3-bit in this case), information related thereto is shared among the current source circuits of the lower bits. Even when the characteristics of the respective current source circuits have varied, since output current values are small, differences in the current value due to variation are small, and the influence is small.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">The structure of the current source circuit <b>420</b> may be arbitrarily adopted among structures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, and <b>35</b>.

<p id="p-0277" num="0276">In the current source circuit <b>420</b>, when the transistor <b>187</b> and the transistor <b>188</b> are turned ON, a current flows to the capacitor device <b>189</b> from a reference constant current source (not shown) connected to the current line <b>190</b>. At this time, the transistors <b>180</b> to <b>182</b> are OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Charge is then gradually accumulated in the capacitor device <b>189</b>, and an potential difference begins to occur between both the electrodes.

<p id="p-0279" num="0278">The charge accumulation continues until the potential difference between both the electrodes, that is, each gate-source voltage of the transistors <b>183</b> to <b>186</b> increases up to a desired voltage.

<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Upon completion of the charge accumulation, the transistors <b>183</b> and <b>186</b> are fully turned ON.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Subsequently, in the current source circuit <b>420</b>, conductivity/non-conductivity of the transistors <b>180</b> to <b>182</b> is selected according to the 3-bit digital video signal. For example, when all the transistors <b>180</b> to <b>182</b> are turned to the conductive state, the current supplied to the signal line (Si) corresponds to the sum of the drain current of the transistor <b>183</b>, the drain current of the transistor <b>184</b>, and the drain current of the transistor <b>185</b>. When only the transistor <b>180</b> has been turned to the conductive state, only the drain current of the transistor <b>183</b> flows to the signal line (Si).</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">As described above, the gate terminals of the transistors <b>183</b> to <b>185</b> are connected, whereby setting-operation information can be shared.

For example, the setting-operation information may be shared also with transistors in a different column. That is, the transistor gate terminals may be connected to the different column transistors. Thus, the number of current source circuits to be set can be reduced. Consequently, time required for the setting operation can be reduced. In addition, since the number of circuits can be reduced, the layout area can be made small.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the setting operation is performed for the current source circuit with the transistors <b>182</b> being turned OFF.

Thus, when design is performed with the values of W (channel width)/L (channel length) of the transistors <b>183</b> to <b>185</b> set to 1:2:4, the respective ON currents are set to 1:2:4.</p>

<p id="p-0286" num="0285">The current source circuit <b>420</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is similar in operation to the current source circuit <b>420</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> except the point in that when the switches <b>191</b> and <b>192</b> are turned ON, a current flows to the capacitor device <b>189</b> via the transistor <b>185</b> from the reference constant current source (not shown) connected to the current line <b>190</b>. Thus, a description thereof will be omitted in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Meanwhile, in this embodiment, while all the transistors contained in the current source circuit <b>420</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, <b>24</b>, or <b>46</b> are of n-channel type, the present invention is not limited to this.

<p id="p-0288" num="0287">When using the p-channel transistors, the case where Vss is not replaced with Vdd, that is, the case where the current-flow direction is not changed can be easily applied with the comparison between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">One current source circuit for each bit is disposed for each signal line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The constant current source for reference <b>109</b> for supplying the current to the current source circuit may be integrally formed with a signal line drive circuit on the substrate, or is disposed to the exterior of the substrate using IC or the like. In the case where these are integrally formed on the substrate, it may be formed with any one of the current source circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6-FIG</figref>. <b>8</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31-FIG</figref>. <b>35</b>. Or, simply one piece of transistor is disposed, which may control the current value corresponding to the voltage applied to the gate. In the present Embodiment, an example of the current source for reference <b>109</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, as an example, the simplest case is shown. Specifically, this is a method in which the voltage of the gate is adjusted by applying the voltage to the gate of the transistor, and the case where 3 pieces of current line are required is shown. If only one piece of the current line is required, the current lines corresponding to the transistors <b>1840</b>, <b>1850</b> may be simply deleted from the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the largeness of the current is controlled by adjusting the gate voltage applied to the transistors <b>1830</b>, <b>1840</b> and <b>1850</b> from the exterior via the terminal f. It should be noted that at this time, when it is designed by making W/L values of the transistors <b>1830</b>, <b>1840</b> and <b>1850</b> into the ratio of 1:2:4, the ratio of the ON-state current becomes 1:2:4.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, the case where the current is supplied from the terminal f is illustrated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, in the case where it is adjusted by applying the voltage to the gate, the current value of the transistor may vary by the temperature characteristics or the like. However, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, when it is inputted by means of the current, its influence is capable of being suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">It should be noted that in the case of the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, during the time when the current is passed through the current line, it is necessary to continue to input the voltage or current from the terminal f. However, in the case where it is not necessary to pass the current through the current line, it is not necessary to input the voltage or current from the terminal f.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref>, switches <b>1870</b>, <b>1880</b>, and a capacity element <b>1890</b> may be added to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>. Then, even when the current is supplied to the current line, it is possible to stop the supply (supply of the current or voltage inputted from the terminal f) from the IC for reference, the consuming power becomes smaller. It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, it has shared the information with the other transistor for current source disposed at the constant current source for reference. Specifically, the gates of transistors <b>1830</b>, <b>1840</b> and <b>1850</b> were connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Hence, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the case where the setting operation is carried out to the respective current source circuits is shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the current is inputted from the terminal f, and the timing is controlled by the signal supplied from the terminal e. It should be noted that the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is an example to which the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is applied. Therefore, the setting operation and the input operation are not carried out at the same time. Therefore, in the case of this circuit, it is necessary that the setting operation with respect to the constant current source for reference is carried out at the timing when the current is not required to pass the current through the current line.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, an example of the constant current source for reference <b>109</b> which has been polyphased is shown. Specifically, it corresponds to the current source for reference <b>109</b> to which the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> is applied. In the case of being polyphased, the circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> may be applied. However, since the current values supplied to the current lines are the same, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, when the setting operation is carried out with respect to the respective current source circuits using one current, the number of currents inputted from the exterior can be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0300" num="0299">In the above embodiments, primarily, the case where the signal current control switch exist has been described. In this embodiment, a description will be made of a case where the signal current control switch is not provided, that is, a case where a current (constant current) disproportional to a video signal is supplied to a wiring different from a signal line. In this case, the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch) does not need to be disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Note that the case where the signal current control switch does not exist is similar to the case where the signal current control switch exists, except for the absence of the signal current control switch. Thus, the case will be briefly described, and descriptions of the similar portions will be omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">For comparison with the case where the signal current control switch is disposed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> shows a structure corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> shows a structure corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49(A)</figref> shows a structure corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>. According to the structures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>B, the signal current control switch is controlled by the video signal to output the current to the signal line. In the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29</figref>, <b>30</b>, and <b>49</b>A, however, the current is output to a pixel current line, and the video signal is output to the signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">A schematic view of the pixel structure in the above case is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49(B)</figref>. Next, a pixel operating method will be briefly described. First, when a switching transistor is ON, a video signal is passed through a signal line, is input to a pixel, and is then stored into a capacitor device. A driving transistor is turned ON or OFF depending on the value of the video signal. On the other hand, a current source circuit has a capability of flowing a constant current. Hence, when the driving transistor is ON, the constant current flows to a light emitting device, and the light emitting device emits light. When the driving transistor is OFF, since no current flows to the light emitting device, the light emitting device does not emit light. In this manner, an image is displayed. In this case, however, only two states, namely, emission or non-emission, can be displayed. For this reason, multi-gradation is implemented using, for example, a time gradation method and area gradation method.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Note that, for the portion of the current source circuit, any one of circuits of, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>, and <b>31</b> to <b>35</b> is used. The setting operation may be performed to enable the current source circuit to be flown with a constant current. When performing the setting operation for the current source circuit of the pixel, the operation is performed by inputting the current through a pixel current line. The setting operation for the current source circuit of the pixel may be performed an arbitrary number of times at arbitrary time and an arbitrary timing. The setting operation for the current source circuit of the pixel can be performed completely independent of an operation for displaying an image. Preferably, the setting operation is performed when charge stored in the capacitor device provided in the current source circuit leaks.</p>

<p id="p-0308" num="0307">The present Embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52A</figref>, the signal line drive circuit is disposed above the pixel section, the constant current circuit is disposed below the pixel section, the current source A is disposed in the foregoing signal line drive circuit, and the current source B is disposed in the constant current circuit. Supposing that the currents supplied form the current sources A, B are IA, IB, and the signal current supplied to the pixel is I data, the equation IA=IB+I data is held. Then, when the signal current is written into the pixel, it is set so that the current is supplied from both the current sources A and B. At this time, when IA and IB are enlarged, thereby capable of accelerating the writing speed of the signal current with respect to the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">At this time, the setting operation of the current source B is carried out using the current source A. The current that the current of the current source B has subtracted from the current of the current source A flows through the pixel. Therefore, a variety of influences such as noise or the like can be reduced by carrying out the setting operation of the current source B using the current source A.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52B</figref>, the constant current source for reference (hereinafter, referred to as constant current source) C, E is disposed above and below the pixel section. Then, the setting operation of the current source circuit disposed in the signal line drive circuit and constant current circuit is carried out using the current sources C, E. The current source D corresponds to the current source setting the current sources C, E, and the current for reference is supplied from the exterior.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52B</figref>, the constant current circuit disposed below the pixel section may be made a signal line drive circuit, thereby capable of disposing the signal line drive circuits at both above and below. Then, each of them takes charge of control of the upper portion and lower portion of the screen (the whole of the pixel section) in half. By doing it in this way, the pixels can be controlled by two lines simultaneously. Therefore, it is possible that it takes a long time to carry out the setting operation (signal input operation) to the current source of the signal line drive circuit, the pixel, the current source of the pixel and the like. Therefore, the setting is capable of being more precisely carried out.</p>

This enables flickers (flickering of a screen) not to be recognized by the human eye. At this time, a period during which screen rendering is performed once is called one frame period.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">As an example, in this example, a description will be made of a time gradation method disclosed in the publication as Patent Document 1. In the time gradation method, one frame period is divided into a plurality of subframe periods. In many cases, the number of divisions at this time is identical to the number of gradation bits. For the sake of a simple description, a case where the number of divisions is identical to the number of gradation bits is shown. Specifically, since the 3-bit gradation is employed in this example, an example is shown in which one frame period is divided into three subframe periods SF<b>1</b> to SF<b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(B)</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">Each of the subframe periods includes an address (writing) period Ta and a sustain (light emission) period (Ts). The address period is a period during which a video signal is written to a pixel, and the length thereof is the same among respective subframe periods. The sustain period is a period during which the light emitting device emits light or does not emit light in response to the video signal written in the address period. At this time, the sustain periods Ts<b>1</b> to Ts<b>3</b> are set at a length ratio of Ts<b>1</b>:Ts<b>2</b>:Ts<b>3</b>=4:2:1. More specifically, the length ratio of n sustain periods is set to 2<sup>(n-1)</sup>:2<sup>(n-2)</sup>: . . . :2<sup>1</sup>:2<sup>0</sup>. Depending on which one of the sustain periods a light emitting device performs emission or non-emission in, the length of the period during which each pixel emits light in one frame period is determined, and the gradation representation is thus performed.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">Next, a specific operation of a pixel employing the time gradation method will be described. In this example, a description thereof will be made referring to the pixel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(B)</figref>. A current input method is applied to the pixel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(B)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">First, the following operation is performed during the address period Ta. A first scanning line <b>602</b> and a second scanning line <b>603</b> are selected, and TFTs <b>606</b> and <b>607</b> are turned ON. A current flowing through a signal line <b>601</b> at this time is used as a signal current I<sub>data</sub>. Then, when a predetermined charge has been accumulated in a capacitor device <b>610</b>, selection of the first scanning line <b>602</b> and the second scanning line <b>603</b> is terminated, and the TFTs <b>606</b> and <b>607</b> are turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">Subsequently, the following operation is performed in the sustain period Ts. A third scanning line <b>604</b> is selected, and a TFT <b>609</b> is turned ON. Since the predetermined charge that has been written is stored in the capacitor device <b>610</b>, the TFT <b>608</b> is already turned ON, and a current identical with the signal current I<sub>data </sub>flows thereto from a current line <b>605</b>. Thus, a light emitting device <b>611</b> emits light.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">The operations described above are performed in each subframe period, thereby forming one frame period. According to this method, the number of divisions for subframe periods may be increased to increase the number of display gradations. Also, the order of the subframe periods does not necessarily need to be the order from an upper bit to a lower bit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14(B) and 14(C)</figref>, and the subframe periods may be disposed at random within one frame period. In addition, the order may be variable within each frame period.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">Further, a subframe period SF<b>2</b> of an m-th scanning line is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(D)</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(D)</figref>, in the pixel, upon termination of an address period Ta<b>2</b>, a sustain period Ts<b>2</b> is immediately started.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">Next, the portion related to the current source circuit of the signal driver circuit, especially a driving method of the portion related to the setting operation will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">Note that it is described in the above embodiments that the current source circuit has the method in which a setting operation and an input operation can be simultaneously performed and the method in which these operations cannot be simultaneously performed.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">In the former current source circuit capable of simultaneously performing the setting operation and the input operation, the timing of conducting each operation is not particularly limited. This is also the same in the case where a plurality of current source circuits are arranged in one column as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, or the like. However, in the latter current source circuit not capable of simultaneously performing the setting operation and the input operation, the timing of conducting the setting operation needs to be devised. In the case of adopting the time gradation method, the setting operation needs to be performed while the output operation is not performed. For example, in the case of the structure of the driver portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the pixel with the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(B)</figref>, the setting operation needs to be conducted in the period except the address period Ta in any scanning line in a pixel portion. Further, in the case of the structure of the driver portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> and the pixel with the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49(B)</figref>, the setting operation of the current source circuit arranged in the driver portion needs to be conducted in the period during which the setting operation is not conducted for the current source circuit arranged in the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">Note that, at this time, a frequency of a shift register that controls the current source circuit may be set at a low speed in some cases. Thus the setting operation of the current source circuit can be performed for an enough time with accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">Alternatively, the setting operation of the current source circuit may be performed at random by using the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 to 39</figref> or the like as the circuit (the first shift register) for controlling the current source circuit. Then, even if the periods during which the setting operation can be performed are dotted about one frame, the periods are effectively utilized, thereby being capable of performing the setting operation. Further, it may be such that the setting operation for all the current source circuits is not conducted in one frame period but conducted in several frame periods or more. From the above, the setting operation of the current source circuit can be performed for an enough time with accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">In the present invention, independent operations of the first shift register and the second shift register can be fully conducted by means of providing the first shift register that controls the current source circuit <b>420</b> and the second shift register that controls the image display circuit. The second shift register is used when the input operation is performed, and the first shift register is used when the setting operation is performed. Then, the first shift register can be operated at a low speed while the second shift register is operated at a high speed. Accordingly, it is possible that the setting of the current source circuit <b>420</b> spend as much as time as it is conducted precisely. Note that in the case of the structure of the driver portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the pixel with the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(B)</figref>, the input operation may be conducted in the period during which the scanning line in the pixel portion is selected (address period Ta). Further, in the case of the structure of the driver portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the pixel with the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49(B)</figref>, the setting operation of the current source circuit arranged in the driver portion may be conducted in the period during which the setting operation is not conducted for the current source circuit arranged in the pixel.</p>

The input operation of the current source circuit of the signal line drive circuit is usually carried out over one frame period.

In the circuits as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(C) to 6(E)</figref>, the W/L ratio of two transistors forming the current mirror circuit is changed depending on the color. Thus, the magnitude of the current to be input to the pixel can be changed depending on the color.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">Still another technique is to change the length of a lightening period.

<p id="p-0407" num="0406">When the emission luminance of light emitting materials are increased in the future, the light emitting device will be able to be applied to a front or rear type projector by expanding and projecting light containing image information having been output lenses or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">Cases are increasing in which the above-described electronic devices display information distributed via electronic communication lines such as the Internet and CATVs (cable TVs). Particularly increased are cases where moving picture information is displayed. Since the response speed of the light emitting material is very high, the light emitting apparatus is preferably used for moving picture display.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">Since the light emitting apparatus consume the power in light emitting portions, information is desirably displayed so that the light emitting portions are reduced as much as possible. Thus, in the case where the light emitting apparatus are used for a display portion of a mobile information terminal, particularly, a mobile telephone, an audio playback device, or the like, which primarily displays character information, it is preferable that the character information be formed in the light emitting portions with the non-light emitting portions being used as the background.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">As described above, the application range of the present invention is very wide, so that the invention can be used for electronics in all of fields. The electronics according to this example may use the light emitting apparatus with the structure according to any one of Embodiments 1 to 8 and Examples 1 to 4.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">The present invention having the structures described above can suppress influences of variation in characteristics of TFTs, and can supply a desired current to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">The present invention provides the signal line driver circuit having two shift registers (the first and the second shift registers). One of the two shift register is the power source circuit and the other is the circuit for controlling a video signal, for example, for controlling a latch circuit, a sampling switch, and the switch <b>101</b> (signal current control switch). Accordingly, it is possible to operate the first and the second shift registers independently, and it leads inevitably to perform a setting operation of the power source circuit and the image display operation independently. The composition of the present invention capable of operating the power source circuit and the latch circuit independently is very beneficial because the setting operation can be performed with accuracy when it has enough time for the setting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">Note that a shift register includes a flip-flop circuit, a decoder circuit, or the like. In the case where the shift register includes the flip-flop circuit, in general, a plurality of wirings are sequentially selected from the first column to the last column. On the other hand, in the case where the shift register is comprised of the decoder circuit or the like, a plurality of wiring are selected at random. If the plurality of wiring can be selected at random, the setting signal become able to be output at random. Thus, setting operation of the current source circuit can be performed randomly instead of being performed sequentially from the first column to the last column. When the setting operation can be performed at random for the current source circuit, various advantages are exhibited. For example, a sufficient time can be arbitrarily used to perform the setting operation for the current source circuit. In addition, in the case where periods during which the setting operation can be performed are dotted in one frame, when an arbitrary column can be selected, the degree of freedom is increased, and a setting operation period can be sufficiently secured. One of other advantages is that the influence of charge leakage in a capacitor device disposed in the current source circuit can be made inconspicuous. Thus, when a defect has occurred in association with the setting operation, the defect can be made inconspicuous.</p>
