<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Continuation of International Application No. PCT/AT2011/000065, filed Feb. 4, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention concerns a movable furniture extension arrangement for an article of furniture comprising a side wall arranged between a rear wall and a front panel and a rail bar arranged between the rear wall and the front panel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention also concerns an article of furniture comprising a movable furniture extension arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furniture extension arrangements which are movable in that way are already known in large numbers. In those arrangements, the side walls of the furniture extension arrangement usually do not extend over its entire height. Thus, the front panel is only partly supported by the side wall. For that reason it is already known to fit rail bars to enhance the stability of the front panel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the invention is to provide a stable movable furniture extension arrangement. That is achieved by the movable furniture extension arrangement according to the invention in that the rail bar is arranged beneath the side wall and below the rail system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Arranging the rail bar beneath the side wall makes it possible for the side wall to be arranged in the upper region of the furniture extension arrangement while the stability of the front panel is increased by arranging the rail bar beneath the side wall.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Especially in the case of movable furniture extension arrangements which serve to store articles which can be removed in hanging relationship&#x2014;like for example in the case of garbage separation systems&#x2014;stability must be afforded especially in the upper region of the furniture extension arrangement as the highest force action is to be found at that region. In order nonetheless to ensure stability for the front panel, the rail bar is arranged beneath the side wall.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further advantageous embodiments of the invention are defined in the appendant claims.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It has proven to be particularly advantageous if the rail bar has an adjusting device by which the front panel can be inclined. An adjusting device makes it possible to orient the front panel on the furniture carcass, which is necessary in particular when there are tolerances in the positions of the guide system and as a result the front panel is inclined away from the furniture carcass or moves towards it in the upper region or even strikes against it.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferred embodiment, the adjusting device can be adapted so that it changes the effective length of the rail bar. The rail bar is supported on the one hand at the front at the inside of the front panel, and on the other hand at the rear at the rear wall. A variable-length rail bar makes it possible to easily influence the inclination of the front panel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It can further preferably be provided that the side wall is provided at least partially and preferably substantially completely above the rail system. A rail system affords a convenient and comfortable option for displacing the movable furniture extension arrangement out and in. By virtue of the arrangement of the side wall above the rail system, the side wall can be supported at the rail system and this arrangement therefore contributes to a stable system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the furniture extension arrangement can have a receiving device&#x2014;preferably for a storage system for garbage separation&#x2014;, wherein the&#x2014;preferably frame-shaped&#x2014;receiving device is provided at least partially, preferably substantially completely, above and/or at least partially between two side walls of the furniture extension arrangement. By virtue of the receiving device being mounted above the side walls, it can be easily hung in position, or the positioning of the receiving device between the two side walls provides for a stable system for the movable furniture extension arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In that respect, it has proven to be particularly advantageous if the furniture extension arrangement has a storage system for garbage separation, wherein the storage system can be releasably fixed to the receiving device, preferably without a tool. Garbage separation systems are especially highly suited to be arranged releasably fixably on the receiving device as they often have to be removed for emptying thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a preferred embodiment, the storage system can be arranged hangingly in the receiving device and the receiving containers can be removed substantially perpendicularly from the receiving device when the furniture extension arrangement is pulled out. Perpendicular removal can be easily effected by a user, and a practicable working procedure can thus be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It has further proven to be advantageous if the rear wall of the furniture extension arrangement is arranged spaced apart from the rear end of the furniture extension arrangement. A rear wall which is displaced forwardly in the direction of the front panel can prevent the storage system being disposed too far in the rear region of the furniture extension arrangement whereby easy removal would be impeded.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It has proven to be advantageous if the rear wall of the furniture extension arrangement is arranged spaced apart from the rear end of the rail system, preferably a drawer rail of the rail system. That makes it possible for rail systems which already belong to the state of the art to be used in such a furniture extension arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It can further preferably be provided that the rear wall of the furniture extension arrangement is arranged displaced forwardly at a spacing from the rear edges of the side walls of the furniture extension arrangement. In that way, it is possible that side walls already belonging to the state of the art can be fitted to this furniture extension arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a possible embodiment, fitment portions&#x2014;preferably made from plastic material&#x2014;can be provided to connect the rear wall to&#x2014;preferably the rear edges of&#x2014;the side walls&#x2014;preferably without the use of a tool and/or releasably. That makes it possible for the rear wall to be easily mounted to the side walls by the fitment portions while at the same time making it possible to arrive at a reduced spacing of the rear wall relative to the front panel by way of those fitment portions.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a preferred embodiment, the rear wall of the furniture extension arrangement can be in one piece or the rear wall of the furniture extension arrangement can have two or more rear wall portions. The rear wall portions respectively extend from side wall towards side wall. Because the rear wall or the rear wall portions respectively extend over the entire width, it is possible to produce a stable structure.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Desirably, a furniture drive can be arranged behind the rear wall or a rear wall portion of the furniture extension arrangement. In that way such a furniture extension arrangement can also be driven.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In specific terms, the invention is also directed to an article of furniture comprising a movable furniture extension arrangement of the described embodiments.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a side view in section through an article of furniture <b>10</b>. Arranged in the upper part of the article of furniture <b>10</b> is a drawer in accordance with the state of the art, and the drawer is movably arranged by way of a drawer rail <b>16</b> of a rail system <b>12</b> in the article of furniture <b>10</b> or its furniture carcass <b>17</b>. That drawer in accordance with the state of the art is equipped with a rail bar <b>1</b>, side walls <b>4</b>, a rear wall <b>2</b> and a front panel <b>3</b>. In this arrangement, the front panel <b>3</b> can be changed in its inclination relative to the furniture carcass <b>17</b> by means of the rail bar <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Arranged in the lower region of the article of furniture <b>10</b> is the movable furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> which is movably arranged on the rail system <b>12</b> by way of drawer rails <b>16</b>. In this case, the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> also has side walls <b>4</b>, a rear wall <b>2</b>, a front panel <b>3</b> and a rail bar <b>1</b> with the difference in relation to the state of the art that the rail bar <b>1</b> is arranged below the side wall. That provides a stable furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> for side walls <b>4</b>&#x2014;mounted in the upper region&#x2014;which have to receive a storage system <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this case the front panel <b>3</b> extends both to below the side wall <b>4</b> and also to below the rail bar <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a section through the side view of an article of furniture <b>10</b>, in which the movable furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> is in the retracted position. The inclination of the front panel <b>3</b> can be altered by the adjusting device <b>5</b> and thus oriented to the furniture carcass <b>17</b>, by means of the rail bar <b>1</b>. In this case, the length of the rail bar <b>1</b> which is supported on the one hand at the inside of the front panel <b>3</b> and on the other hand at the rear at the rear wall <b>2</b> is altered by the adjusting device <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this case, the rear wall <b>2</b> of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> is spaced from the rear end of the rail system <b>12</b>, with the result that both a discharge flow system for a washbasin <b>18</b> can be arranged behind the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> in the article of furniture <b>10</b> and also a furniture drive <b>15</b> for automatic movement of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> has space behind the rear wall <b>2</b> and in front of the discharge flow system <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a movable furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> as is arranged in the usual manner in an article of furniture <b>10</b> (not shown here) or its furniture carcass <b>17</b> (not shown). This view also does not show the front panel <b>3</b> of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>. That front panel <b>3</b> is arranged in the usual fashion at the ends of the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; by way of the fixing devices <b>19</b> on the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>. The furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> also has the rail bars <b>1</b> and the adjusting devices <b>5</b> which are disposed thereon and which are between the front panel <b>3</b> and the rear wall <b>2</b>. The effective length of the rail bars <b>1</b> can be changed by way of the adjusting devices <b>5</b>, with the result that the front panel <b>3</b> can be inclined and thus oriented on the furniture carcass <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">This furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> is arranged on a rail system <b>12</b>, by way of which the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> can be moved horizontally out of the article of furniture <b>10</b> or the furniture carcass <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; are arranged in the upper region of this furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> as they are intended to receive a hanging storage system <b>13</b>. For that purpose, a high level of stability is desired&#x2014;especially in the upper region of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>. In that respect, to enhance the stability of such a furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>, the rail bars <b>1</b> are arranged below the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032;. In that case, the rail bars <b>1</b> can be altered in their effective length by the adjusting devices <b>5</b>, in which case the rail bars <b>1</b> are supported on the one hand at the front at the inside of the front panel <b>3</b> and on the other hand at the rear at the rear wall <b>2</b>. That change in length of the rail bars <b>1</b> leads to tilting of the front panel <b>3</b> whereby the front panel <b>3</b> can be arranged parallel at the front side of the furniture carcass <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this embodiment, the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; are arranged substantially over the rail system <b>12</b> whereby rail systems <b>12</b> already belonging to the state of the art and their drawer rails <b>16</b> (not shown) can be used for this specific furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>. The rail bars <b>1</b>, in contrast, are arranged below the rail system <b>12</b> (and side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032;) whereby&#x2014;by that distribution of the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; above the rail system <b>12</b>&#x2014;and the rail bars <b>1</b> below the rail system <b>12</b>, this affords an extremely stable construction for a furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this case, the rear wall <b>2</b> of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> is spaced from (in front of) the rear end of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>. Thus, for example, a discharge flow system <b>18</b> (not shown) can extend behind the rear wall <b>2</b>, and the assembly ensures that the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> can be moved completely into the furniture carcass <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this case, the rear wall <b>2</b> of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> is also spaced from the rear end of the rail system <b>12</b> or the drawer rail <b>16</b> of the rail system <b>12</b>, which causes the positive effect that a rail system belonging to the state of the art can be used and nonetheless a spacing of the rear wall <b>2</b> relative to the rear side of the furniture carcass <b>17</b> is afforded.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Likewise, the rear wall <b>2</b> of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> can be arranged displaced forwardly at a spacing from the rear edges of the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>, with the result that side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; already belonging to the state of the art can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In that respect, fitment portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>&#x2032; are used, which arrange the rear wall <b>2</b> in displaced relationship with the rear edges of the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032;. In this embodiment, those fitment portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>&#x2032; are made of plastic or metal and can be arranged on the rear wall <b>2</b> or the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; respectively without the use of a tool.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this embodiment, the rear wall <b>2</b> is in one piece, wherein a furniture drive <b>15</b> (not shown) can have space behind the lower region of the rear wall <b>2</b>. That rear wall <b>2</b> could likewise comprise a plurality of rear walls portions <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> if that provides advantages in terms of production engineering. Here, the rear wall <b>2</b> is in one piece and extends in the upper region without interruption from a side wall <b>4</b> to the second side wall <b>4</b>&#x2032; and in the lower region from a rail bar <b>1</b> to the second rail bar <b>1</b>. The stability of the overall structure is increased by that interruption-free connection.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, wherein a frame-shaped receiving device <b>6</b> is already fitted thereon without the use of a tool.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, that receiving device <b>6</b> is intended for receiving a storage system <b>13</b>. In this case, the storage system <b>13</b> has four storage containers <b>14</b> which can be removed releasably and without a tool upwardly from the receiving device <b>6</b>. That is equally possible with the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> fully pulled out (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> as just described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in which case here it is now in its second maximum position&#x2014;fully pulled-out&#x2014;. In this position it is possible to see the furniture drive <b>15</b> which serves for motor-driven horizontal movement of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a </i>shows the frame-shaped receiving device <b>6</b> which is preferably made in one piece and which serves to receive in hanging relationship the storage containers <b>14</b> (not shown) of the storage system <b>13</b> (not shown) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b </i>shows the rear wall <b>2</b>, on which are arranged at left and right the two fitment portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>&#x2032; by way of which the rear wall <b>2</b> can be releasably connected without a tool to the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; (not shown here) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Arranged in the lower region of the rear wall <b>2</b> are the rail bars <b>1</b> (not shown here). In this embodiment, the rear wall <b>2</b> is in one piece and has a Z-shaped profile member <b>20</b>. It would also be conceivable for the rear wall <b>2</b> to be made from two or more rear wall portions <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an article of furniture <b>10</b> having a furniture carcass <b>17</b> and a furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>. The furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> has a receiving means <b>6</b> for receiving a storage system <b>13</b> having storage containers <b>14</b>. When the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> is pulled out, those storage containers <b>14</b> can be removed substantially perpendicularly from the receiving device <b>6</b>. The rail bars <b>1</b> arranged below the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; (only one rail bar <b>1</b> is visible) enhance the stability of the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> and further afford the capability that the front panel <b>3</b> can be inclined by way of the adjusting devices <b>5</b> (only one adjusting device <b>5</b> is shown), whereby the front panel <b>3</b> can be oriented relative to the furniture carcass <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a perspective rear view of an article of furniture <b>10</b> with a furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>, the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b> being in its fully retracted condition in the furniture carcass <b>17</b>. Because the rear wall <b>2</b> is spaced from the rear end of the rail system <b>12</b> or the rear end of the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; (side wall <b>4</b> not visible), it is thus possible that a discharge flow system <b>18</b> or the like can extend behind the furniture extension arrangement <b>11</b>. That spacing of the rear wall <b>2</b> from the rail system <b>12</b> or the side walls <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>&#x2032; is achieved by the fitment portions <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>&#x2032; (fitment <b>7</b> not visible).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Even if the invention has been specifically described by means of the illustrated embodiment by way of example, it will be appreciated that the subject of the application is not limited to this embodiment. Rather it will be self-evident that features and modifications which serve to carry the concept of the invention into practice are certainly conceivable and desired.</p>
