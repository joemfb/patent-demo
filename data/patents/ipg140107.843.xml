<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate an animal feeder <b>100</b> according to some embodiments of the invention. The feeder <b>100</b> can be used for dispensing feed to animals, specifically birds. The feeder <b>100</b> can in particular be used for dispensing feed to birds having long bills, such as, for example, hummingbirds. The feeder <b>100</b> includes a feed reservoir <b>102</b> and a feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The feed reservoir <b>102</b> is a flexible bag having an interior cavity <b>106</b> for holding feed. The feed reservoir <b>102</b> can be formed of a waterproof material for holding water or other fluids within the cavity. The feed reservoir <b>102</b> includes a hook, loop, latch, adhesive, suction cup or other mechanical or non-mechanical connector for securing the feeder to a support structure such as a wall, post, tree or window. In the illustrated embodiment, the feed reservoir <b>102</b> includes a reinforced loop <b>108</b> for mounting to a branch. In some embodiments, the feed reservoir <b>102</b> is positioned within a rigid protective housing (not shown) to protect the feed reservoir <b>102</b> from accidental punctures and tears by animals, tree branches, etc. Such a protective housing can be permanently or removably attached to the feed reservoir <b>102</b> and can be formed from plastic, metal, wire mesh, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b> is coupled to the feed reservoir <b>102</b> at an access port or opening <b>110</b> in the feed reservoir <b>102</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b> is located toward a bottom of the feed reservoir <b>102</b> when the feed reservoir <b>102</b> is installed on a support structure. The feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b> includes an adaptor <b>112</b> supporting a valve <b>114</b>. The adaptor <b>112</b> can be detachably coupled to the feed reservoir <b>102</b>, permitting access to the cavity <b>106</b> through the access port <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, the adaptor <b>112</b> can be permanently and/or non-removably secured to the feed reservoir <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the valve <b>114</b> in greater detail. The valve <b>114</b> may be any type of valve that is actuatable by a bird, such as, for example, a check valve. Check valves allow fluid flow in a first direction when actuated, or opened, and inhibit, or check, fluid flow in a second, opposite direction. There are several types of check valves. In the illustrated embodiment, the valve <b>114</b> is a duckbill valve or a duckbill check valve. The valve <b>114</b> includes opposing flexible lip members <b>116</b> supported on a ring <b>118</b>. The ring <b>118</b> is coupled to adaptor <b>112</b> so that the lip members <b>116</b> extend towards the cavity <b>106</b> in a V-shape. The lip members <b>116</b> are compressed against one another along a lip <b>120</b>. The durometer or flexibility of the lip members <b>116</b> can be such that the lip members <b>116</b> are easily deflected toward and away from one another. In addition, the lip members <b>116</b> extend into the adaptor <b>112</b> to inhibit spillage of feed material within feeder <b>100</b> when a user is carrying the feeder <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The valve <b>114</b> is constructed such that the valve <b>114</b> is normally in a closed position, i.e., the lip members <b>116</b> are compressed against one another, when feed is not being accessed. This can be accomplished by preloading the lip members <b>116</b> such that the lip members <b>120</b> are tightly compressed against one another. In other embodiments, the valve <b>114</b> is constructed such that the valve <b>114</b> is normally in a substantially closed position, i.e., the lip members <b>116</b> are retained in a closed position by the feed in the cavity <b>106</b> impinging on the lip members <b>116</b>, which reinforces the lip compression, preventing leakage of feed from the feed reservoir <b>102</b>. Although the valve <b>114</b> can be located anywhere on the feed reservoir <b>102</b>, by locating the valve <b>114</b> toward the bottom of the feed reservoir <b>102</b>, substantially any feed in the reservoir <b>102</b> impinges on the valve <b>114</b> under the influence of gravity. As such, a minimal amount of feed can retain the valve <b>114</b> in a closed configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The valve <b>114</b> also remains closed despite fluctuations in air pressure within the feed reservoir <b>102</b> or if the air pressure within the feed reservoir <b>102</b> exceeds the atmospheric pressure outside of the feed reservoir <b>102</b>. Fluctuations in pressure within the feed reservoir <b>102</b> can be caused by temperature changes, or changes in feed volume within the cavity <b>106</b>. In other words, it is not necessary for the air pressure in the feed reservoir <b>102</b> to be lower than the atmospheric pressure so as to prevent feed leakage. This is in contrast to vertical water dispensing vessels used to provide water to cats and dogs. In such an arrangement, negative pressure above the fluid in the vessel is needed in order to prevent the fluid from leaking out of the vessel. Such an arrangement requires an air tight, rigid vessel to maintain the pressure in the vessel above the fluid line. In contrast, the construction of the duckbill valve prevents feed leakage, so that the feed reservoir <b>102</b> can be formed of a flexible material, and openings in the feed reservoir <b>102</b> above the feed line do not cause feed leakage at the valve <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, the valve <b>114</b> can be oriented in substantially any direction on the feeder <b>100</b>. Since the valve <b>114</b> does not include a ball that relies on gravity to close the valve <b>114</b>, the valve may be positioned facing the ground, horizontal to the ground, facing away from the ground, or in any positions therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The feed is accessed by inserting a member through the ring <b>118</b> between the lip members <b>116</b>, thereby creating a gap at the lip <b>120</b> through which feed is released. Typically, the beak or bill of an animal such as a hummingbird is inserted into the valve <b>114</b> to access the feed. Both the diameter of the ring <b>118</b> and the distance between the ring <b>118</b> and the lip <b>120</b> can be sized to restrict access to the feed reservoir <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The duckbill valve <b>114</b> can have a variety of configurations in accordance with embodiments of the invention, some of which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,925 describes a duckbill valve that can be used for embodiments of the invention, and is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> illustrate other types of check valves that can be substituted for the duckbill valve <b>114</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a poppet check valve, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an umbrella check valve, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a flapper valve, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a combination duckbill-umbrella check valve.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The type of check valve can be selected to encourage and/or inhibit various types of animals such as birds from accessing feed in the animal feeder <b>100</b>. For example, depending on the physiology of the bird, such as the shape of the bird's beak, some check valves are more easily accessed. In another example, it has been found that hummingbirds tend to avoid the taste of metal. Therefore, the check valve may be selected to ensure that a hummingbird would encounter only plastic parts. The illustrated check valves are also composed of a soft, flexible plastic, silicon, or another elastomeric material that simulates the feel of a real flower. When the bird contacts or inserts his/her beak into the valve, the soft plastic gives way in a manner similar to a flower.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Check valves also inhibit rain from entering the feed reservoir <b>102</b> and, thereby, diluting or otherwise contaminating the feed material in the reservoir <b>102</b>. The check valves not only inhibit direct dripping of rain into the feed reservoir <b>102</b>, but also prevent water sliding along an outside surface of the reservoir <b>102</b> from seeping or weeping into the reservoir <b>102</b>. Furthermore, the check valves inhibit insects (e.g., ants, bees, or the like) from crawling into the reservoir, while allowing birds to open the valves with their beaks.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the feed reservoir <b>102</b> is preloaded with a solid or fluid feed material. In some embodiments, the feed reservoir <b>102</b> is preloaded with a solid or semi-solid feed material such as suet. In other embodiments, the feed reservoir <b>102</b> is preloaded with a powdered or otherwise incomplete feed material (e.g., a liquid feed concentrate) and the user subsequently adds a fluid such as water into the feed reservoir <b>102</b> to fluidize the feed. In some embodiments, the feed reservoir <b>102</b> comes completely filled with a ready-to-use feed material.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The feed reservoir <b>102</b> can be formed of a material selected to inhibit destruction by pests attracted to the animal feed contained therein, including, for example, squirrels. In one embodiment, the feed reservoir <b>102</b> is formed of a material such as plastic that is coated or imbued with a foul tasting agent. When a squirrel attempts to chew on the feed reservoir <b>102</b> so as to bypass the feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b>, the foul taste encountered at the feed reservoir <b>102</b> discourages continued chewing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b> can be permanently attached or integrally formed with the feed reservoir <b>102</b> to prevent replenishment of feed within the feed reservoir <b>102</b>. In this sense, the entire feeder <b>100</b> is disposable, in that the feeder <b>100</b> can only be exhausted once, after which the feeder <b>100</b> can be thrown away.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In other embodiments, the feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b> can be detachably coupled to the feed reservoir <b>102</b>. This allows the user to remove the feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b> from the feed reservoir <b>102</b> to fluidize the feed, or to first fluidize the feed within the feed reservoir <b>102</b> and then install the feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b> on the feed reservoir <b>102</b>. If a protective housing is provided as previously discussed (not shown), the protective housing can be discarded along with the exhausted feed reservoir <b>102</b>. Alternately, the protective housing can be permanently attached to the feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b> such that only the feed reservoir <b>102</b> is discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The feed reservoir <b>102</b> can be sold separately from the feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b>, such that when a feed reservoir <b>102</b> is exhausted, the feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b> is removed from the feed reservoir <b>102</b> and the feed reservoir <b>102</b> is disposed of. The same feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b> can then be installed on a new feed reservoir <b>102</b>. Replacement feed reservoirs <b>102</b> can be sold in pre-packaged multiples of 3-7. This arrangement is similar in concept to personal grooming razors with replaceable blade cartridges. This allows the user to avoid cleaning and refilling the feed reservoir <b>102</b>. Nonetheless, the user is free to detach the feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b>, replenish the feed within the exhausted feed reservoir <b>102</b>, and then reattach the feed dispensing assembly <b>104</b>, so that the feeder <b>100</b> can be replenished and exhausted repeatedly. Alternatively or in addition, by replacing the feed reservoir, the transmission of disease between animals feeding from the feeder and between the animals and humans can be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the illustrated embodiment, the feed reservoir <b>902</b> is a flexible bag that collapses (i.e., decreases in volume) as feed material is emptied from the bag. When the feed reservoir <b>902</b> is coupled to the feed dispensing assembly <b>904</b>, the feed reservoir <b>902</b> can continuously pour fluid (e.g., liquidized feed material) into a bird's mouth without requiring air to be vented or circulated back into the reservoir <b>902</b>. In some embodiments, the liquidized feed material may be poured into a bird's mouth at about &#xbc; pounds per square inch (psi) per second. Such an arrangement prevents air, and more particularly oxygen, from entering the reservoir <b>902</b> and contaminating the feed material. Without oxygen, the amount of aerobic bacteria that may grow in the bag is significantly reduced, thereby reducing the possibility of a bird using the feeder <b>900</b> becoming sick. To counteract aerobic bacteria growth, conventional (e.g., rigid) feeders should typically be cleaned every three to four days. However, flexible bags may be cleaned significantly less often, or simply disposed of after use.</p>
