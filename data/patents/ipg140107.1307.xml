<heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention was first described in a notarized Official Record of Invention on Sep. 25, 2009, that is on file at the offices of Montgomery Patent and Design, LLC, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to shelving units, and in particular, to a vertically deployable and retractable shelving unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">No matter how much storage space is provided in the typical home, there is always a need for more. The use of shelving units provides a means for storing many items along a single vertical surface; however, in many cases closets, cabinets, garages, basements, and storage sheds are still quickly filled to capacity. Any attempt to add additional storage space which is easily accessible quickly competes with living space in a typical home.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Any storage space created in inaccessible spaces is inconvenient to reach and often requires the use of a ladder or similar device to access. Furthermore, such inaccessible locations are a safety issue, particularly for children and older adults.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various attempts have been made to provide overhead storage units. Examples of these attempts can be seen by reference to several U.S. patents. U.S. Pat. No. 3,485,544, issued in the name of Beckerman, describes an overhead storage apparatus which swings downward from a ceiling location in order to provide access to a plurality of storage compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,851,376, issued in the name of D'Agostino, describes a pull down overhead storage shelf with a spring rewinding mechanism for returning the shelf to an upward location.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives, each of these references suffer from one (1) or more of the aforementioned disadvantages. Many such devices are difficult or dangerous to deploy or retract. Also, many such devices do not provide sufficient securement for contained objects during deployment and retraction, or may upset or damage those objects. Furthermore, many such devices are limited as to the amount of storage space they can provide. Accordingly, there exists a need for an overhead storage device without the disadvantages as described above. The development of the present invention substantially departs from the conventional solutions and in doing so fulfills this need.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing references, the inventor recognized the aforementioned inherent problems and observed that there is a need for overhead storage which provides a significant amount of usable storage space in a manner which is secure and easy to deploy or retract. Thus, the object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned disadvantages and provide for this need.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the above objectives, it is an object of the present invention to provide a vertically retractable shelving apparatus comprising a shelf enclosure and a track system.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the present invention is to mount to a vertical surface such as a door or wall.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet still another object of the present invention is to comprise the shelf enclosure of a plurality of shelves for storing a variety of objects.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide secure retention of objects stored within the apparatus. The shelf enclosure may further comprise a plurality of guide rails located along a front portion of each shelf in order to prevent accidental falling of the stored objects.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet still another object of the present invention is to comprise a handle which allows a user to pull the shelf enclosure downwardly along the track system. A rear surface of the enclosure comprises a pair of upper rollers and a pair of lower rollers which engage the track system to further facilitate movement of the shelf enclosure along the track system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Yet still another object of the present invention is to allow the user to secure the shelf enclosure at a desired vertical position along the track system with a locking mechanism comprising a pivoting hook and a locking rod which the user may rotate to engage one of a plurality of catches located along an outer surface of the track system.</p>
