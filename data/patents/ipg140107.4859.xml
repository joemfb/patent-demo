<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Fiber optic cable mounting adapters and related fiber optic cable assemblies and methods for attaching an external mounting device to the fiber optic cable are disclosed. The fiber optic mounting adapters can be configured to be secured to a portion of a fiber optic cable. The fiber optic mounting adapters can also be configured to be secured to external mounting devices compatible to be secured to fiber optic equipment, to secure the fiber optic mounting adapter, and in turn the fiber optic cable, to the fiber optic equipment. Securing a portion of a fiber optic cable can reduce or prevent bending strain from being propagated along the fiber optic cable. Undesired bending strain of a fiber optic cable can cause undesired optical attenuation. Bending strain can also risk damaging optical fibers, such as furcated legs, exposed from the end portion of the fiber optic cable.</p>

The external mounting device may be used to secure the fiber optic cable to fiber optic equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Technical Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Benefits of optical fiber use include extremely wide bandwidth and low noise operation. Because of these advantages, optical fiber is increasingly being used for a variety of applications, including but not limited to broadband voice, video, and data transmission. As a result, fiber optic communications networks include a number of interconnection points at which multiple optical fibers are interconnected. Typically, the interconnections use connectors and ports at patch panels for making interconnections. Near these interconnection locations it is typically desired to secure the cable assemblies so that pulling and bending forces are not transferred to the connector ports since these forces can adversely affect optical signal transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fiber optic cables, such as trunk cables, may extend large distances between fiber optic equipment and the connector ports in the network. Such fiber optic cable routing can involve bending the fiber optic cable, which imposes bending strain on the fiber optic cable. Fiber optic cables are designed to tolerate a certain amount of bending strain without damaging the optical fibers disposed inside the fiber optic cable. Materials of the cable jacket and the inclusion of strength members inside the cable jacket can be selected to achieve the desired strain tolerance of a fiber optic cable. Even so, extreme bending strain beyond designed limits can risk damaging optical fibers disposed inside the fiber optic cable. Further, bending of the fiber optic cable can cause undesired optical attenuation. Bending strain can also risk damaging optical fibers, such as furcated legs, exposed from the end portion of the fiber optic cable near the interconnection point.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To prevent or reduce bending strain on a fiber optic cable, strain relief devices may be employed at suitable locations. A strain relief device may be attached or assembled on portions of a fiber optic cable and configured to be secured to fiber optic equipment, such as a cabinet or equipment rack as examples. The strain relief device may be configured to be secured to a mounting device, wherein the mounting device is secured to fiber optic equipment to secure the strain relief device and in turn the fiber optic cable. Securing a portion of a fiber optic cable can reduce or prevent bending strain from being propagated along the fiber optic cable and/or to the connection points.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments disclosed in the detailed description include fiber optic cable mounting adapters and related fiber optic cable assemblies and methods for attaching external mounting devices to the fiber optic cable.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments are shown. Indeed, the concepts may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limiting herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Whenever possible, like reference numbers will be used to refer to like components or parts.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Embodiments disclosed in the detailed description include fiber optic cable mounting adapters and related fiber optic cable assemblies and methods for attaching external mounting devices to the fiber optic cable. The fiber optic mounting adapters can configured to be secured to a portion of a fiber optic cable. The fiber optic mounting adapters can also be configured to be secured to external mounting devices compatible to be secured to fiber optic equipment, to secure the fiber optic mounting adapter, and in turn the fiber optic cable, to the fiber optic equipment. Securing a portion of a fiber optic cable can reduce or prevent bending strain from being propagated along the fiber optic cable. Undesired bending strain of a fiber optic cable can cause undesired optical attenuation. Bending strain can also risk damaging optical fibers, such as furcated legs, exposed from the end portion of the fiber optic cable. Multiple fiber optic mounting adapters can be secured to multiple portions of a fiber optic cable to secure the fiber optic cable in multiple locations to fiber optic equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of an exemplary fiber optic cable mounting assembly <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> depicts an exploded view of the fiber optic cable mounting assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the fiber optic cable mounting assembly <b>10</b> in this embodiment includes a fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b> (hereafter referred to &#x201c;mounting adapter <b>12</b>&#x201d;) mounted to a fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. The fiber optic cable <b>14</b> may be utilized as a distribution cable, drop cable, or other type of cable. As will be discussed below in more detail, the mounting adapter <b>12</b> is also configured to be secured to or receive an external mounting structure, such as external mounting structure <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, that can be secured to fiber optic equipment, such as an equipment rack, chassis, or other mounting structure. In this manner, because the external mounting structure <b>16</b> is also secured to the mounting adapter <b>12</b>, securing the external mounting structure <b>16</b> to fiber optic equipment also secures the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. For example, protrusions <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B disposed in the external mounting structure <b>16</b> may be configured to be received within openings in fiber optic equipment in a compatible arrangement with the protrusions <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B to secure the external mounting structure <b>16</b> to the fiber optic equipment. Securing the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> to fiber optic equipment in this manner can provide strain relief to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. Providing strain relief to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> may prevent or reduce undesired optical attenuation caused by bending of optical fibers <b>32</b> in the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. Providing strain relief to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> may also prevent or reduce the possibility of damaging optical fibers in the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The external mounting structure <b>16</b> may be hardware equipment such as a cabinet, rack enclosure, or an intermediate accessory that attaches to the hardware equipment to secure the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> to the equipment and/or to provide strain relief. The recently mentioned external mounting structure <b>16</b> may be made of a strong flexible material or a rigid material, for example, plastic, aluminum, or steel as non-limiting examples.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b> can be provided in a fiber optic cable assembly. In this regard, a cabling assembly will be discussed. As shown in an exemplary embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, the first extension member <b>20</b> is secured to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> with the first extension member fastener <b>22</b>, and the second extension member <b>34</b> is secured to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> with the second extension member fastener <b>26</b>. One or more first and second extension member fasteners <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> may be used in this embodiment. More specifically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the at least one of the one or more first extension member fasteners <b>22</b> encircles both the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> and the first extension member <b>20</b>, and at least one of the one or more second extension member fasteners <b>26</b> encircles both the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> and the second extension member <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another embodiment, glue <b>27</b> may be disposed between at least one of the first extension member fasteners <b>22</b> and first extension member <b>20</b> and/or between at least one of the second extension member fasteners <b>26</b> and the second extension member <b>24</b>. As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> depicts glue <b>27</b> within the second extension member fastener <b>26</b>. The glue <b>27</b> may be, for example, an epoxy-based substance, an adhesive, or a cohesive.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The mounting adapter <b>12</b> may be secured to any desired portion of the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the mounting adapter <b>12</b> is secured to an end portion <b>28</b> of the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. In this embodiment, the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> defines a longitudinal direction A<sub>l </sub>and includes a plurality of optical fiber sub-units <b>30</b> each containing one or more optical fibers <b>32</b> disposed longitudinally within a cable jacket <b>34</b> of the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. The optical fiber sub-units <b>30</b> may exposed from the cable jacket <b>34</b> to establish connections between the optical fibers <b>32</b> disposed therein and fiber optic equipment. The optic fibers <b>32</b> may or may not be buffered. The ends of the optical fibers <b>32</b> may be &#x201c;connectorized&#x201d; with fiber optic connectors (examples: FC, LC, ST, MTP, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the mounting adapter <b>12</b> in this embodiment is configured to be conveniently secured to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below, the mounting adapter <b>12</b> is configured to be secured to various outer diameters of fiber optic cable <b>14</b> as opposed to only be configured to be compatible with one type or narrow range of outer diameters of fiber optic cable <b>14</b> for increased flexibility. This may also be advantageous over furcation plugs which are typically custom designed for the particular outer diameter of a fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. In this regard as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, to easily and conveniently be able to secure the mounting adapter <b>12</b> to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>, the mounting adapter <b>12</b> is comprised of three main components. A mounting body <b>36</b> is provided that is configured to receive the external mounting structure <b>16</b>. A first extension member <b>20</b> and a second extension member <b>24</b> are disposed on and extend from a first end <b>38</b> and second end <b>40</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b>, respectively. The first extension member <b>20</b> and second extension member <b>24</b> are configured to receive first and second extension member fasteners <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, respectively, to secure the first extension member <b>20</b> and second extension member <b>24</b> to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. By securing the first extension member <b>20</b> and second extension member <b>24</b> to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>, the mounting body <b>36</b> is secured to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As one non-limiting example, the first and second extension member fasteners <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, respectively may be heat shrink tubing that can be disposed around a portion of the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> disposed adjacent to the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>, respectively, and heat shrunk to secure the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> to the cable jacket <b>34</b>. Other types of first and second extension member fasteners <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> may be employed. Examples of other types of first and second extension member fasteners <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, a method is disclosed for attaching the fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b> to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> and the external mounting structure <b>16</b>. The process may first include placing the cable mounting surface <b>42</b> of a mounting adapter <b>12</b>, a first extension member cable mounting surface <b>46</b>, and a second extension member cable mounting surface <b>48</b> in abutment with a fiber optic cable <b>14</b> as to align the mounting adapter <b>12</b> with a longitudinal axis A<sub>1 </sub>of the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> (block <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Next, a first extension member <b>20</b> of the mounting adapter <b>12</b> may be secured to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> with one or more first extension member fasteners <b>22</b> (block <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the next step, a second extension member <b>24</b> of the mounting adapter <b>12</b> may be secured to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> with one or more second extension member fasteners <b>26</b> (block <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Lastly, a mounting body <b>36</b> of the mounting adapter <b>12</b> may be secured to an external mounting structure <b>16</b> using one or more fastener interfaces <b>56</b> of the mounting adapter <b>12</b> (block <b>58</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3G</figref>, illustrate various views of the exemplary mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>1</b>) that is similar to the mounting adapter <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. In this embodiment of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>1</b>), the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> are attached or integrated with the mounting body <b>36</b> without providing an intermediate transition member as will be discussed in more detail below. Common components between the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>1</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3G</figref> and the mounting adapter <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are shown with common element numbers. As discussed above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>, the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>1</b>) comprises the mounting body <b>36</b>, a first extension member <b>20</b>, and a second extension member <b>24</b>. The mounting body <b>36</b> may be made of a strong flexible or rigid structure, for example, hard plastic, aluminum, or steel, as non-limiting examples. The flexibility or lack thereof of the mounting body <b>36</b> will affect the amount of strain relief provided by the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>1</b>). The greater the flexibility, the less strain relief provided by the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>1</b>). However, providing flexibility in the mounting body <b>36</b> may also provide greater avoidance of sharp bending of the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> at the first and second ends <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b>. Similarly, the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> may be made of a strong flexible or rigid structure, for example, hard plastic, aluminum, or steel, as non-limiting examples. The first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> may be made of the same material as the mounting body <b>36</b>. Again the greater the flexibility of the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>, the less strain relief provided, but the greater avoidance of sharp bending of the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> adjacent to the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In continuation of the previous discussion, but in a greater level of detail regarding the individual components, the mounting body <b>36</b> may include the first end <b>38</b> and the second end <b>40</b>. The first end <b>38</b> may be opposite the second end <b>40</b>. A cable mounting surface <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> and disposed longitudinally between the first end <b>38</b> and second end <b>40</b> may be included as part of the mounting body <b>36</b>. The cable mounting surface <b>42</b> may be a main contact surface between the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> and the mounting body <b>36</b>. The cable mounting surface <b>42</b> may be used to support the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> in combination with the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>. The mounting body <b>36</b> may also include one or more fastener interfaces <b>56</b> configured to communicate with an external mounting structure <b>16</b>. The purpose of the fastener interfaces <b>56</b> may be to provide surfaces upon the mounting body <b>36</b> for attachment to the external mounting structure <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first extension member <b>20</b> may extend from the first end <b>38</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b> and may include a first extension cable mounting surface <b>46</b>. Likewise, the second extension member <b>24</b> may extend from the second end <b>40</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b> and may include a second extension cable mounting surface <b>48</b>. The first and the second extension cable mounting surfaces <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> contact the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> to provide support and thereby relieve strain from the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. In this embodiment, both the first extension member <b>20</b> and the second extension member <b>24</b> have a first maximum width W<sub>1 </sub>and a second maximum width W<sub>2 </sub>respectively as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. Both W<sub>1 </sub>and W<sub>2 </sub>may each be less than the minimum width W<sub>0 </sub>of the mounting body <b>36</b>. One advantage of having this relationship between widths W<sub>0</sub>, W<sub>1</sub>, and W<sub>2 </sub>may be to provide for the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> to establish a more secure attachment to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> than possible if the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> were wider and thus were more difficult to attach to a broad range of outer diameters of the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another embodiment, at least one of the first maximum width W<sub>1 </sub>of the first extension member <b>20</b> and the second maximum width W<sub>2 </sub>of the second extension member <b>24</b> may be less than eighty percent (80%) of the minimum width W<sub>0 </sub>of the mounting body <b>36</b>. This may enable the first or second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> to more easily attach to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> because different fasteners (discussed later) may travel a shorter distance around these elements. In other embodiments, the first maximum width W<sub>1 </sub>and the second maximum width W<sub>2 </sub>of the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> may not be equal.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In yet another embodiment, with continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the mounting body <b>36</b> may include one or more fastener interfaces <b>56</b> to attach the fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b> to the external mounting structure <b>16</b>. The one or more fastener interfaces <b>56</b> may comprise a slot <b>60</b> disposed longitudinally in the mounting body <b>36</b> adjacent to the cable mounting surface <b>42</b> and configured to receive the external mounting structure <b>16</b>. Providing the slot <b>60</b> as the fastener interface <b>56</b> in the fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b> may create a stable connector for attachment and securing of the external mounting structure <b>16</b> due to its longitudinal orientation. For example, the slot <b>60</b>, when used in combination with a male T-slot member <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), may form a stable connection that resists twisting movement of the mounting adapter <b>12</b> with respect to the external mounting structure <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3F-3G</figref>, the slot <b>60</b> may comprise an internal cavity <b>64</b> between the first end <b>38</b> and the second end <b>40</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b>. The slot <b>60</b> may further comprise a slot orifice <b>66</b> in communication with the internal cavity <b>64</b> at an end surface <b>68</b> at the first end <b>38</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b>. The end surface <b>68</b> may face the first extension member <b>20</b> and may also be included as part of the first transition member <b>70</b>, which will be discussed below in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The slot orifice <b>66</b> may also extend into a top surface <b>72</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b> opposite the cable mounting surface <b>42</b>. The slot orifice <b>66</b> may enable the male T-slot member <b>62</b> to enter the internal cavity <b>64</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b> to form an attachment and to depart the internal cavity <b>64</b> when the attachment between the external mounting structure <b>16</b> and the mounting adapter <b>12</b> is no longer required.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the slot <b>60</b> may be T-shaped and may also be in a geometric plane P<sub>1 </sub>adjacent to the cable mounting surface <b>42</b>. Other shaped slots <b>60</b> may also be used, for example a star-shaped slot or polygonal-shaped slot, or partially curved slot as non-limiting examples. The T-shaped slot <b>60</b> may be employed to provide effective resistance to twisting. The T-shaped slot <b>60</b> may also form a tight attachment of the external mounting structure <b>16</b> to the mounting body <b>36</b> and is relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the one or more fastener interfaces <b>56</b> may additionally comprise one or more fastener orifices <b>74</b> configured to communicate with, for example, one or more fastener devices (not shown), such as screws or bolts to further secure. Other embodiments of the one or more fastener interfaces <b>56</b> may include, for example, combinations of the one or more slots <b>60</b> and the one or more fastener orifices <b>74</b>. Further, the term fastener interfaces <b>56</b> as used in this disclosure may be interpreted broadly to be any one or more objects, devices or surfaces to secure the mounting body <b>36</b> to the external mounting structure <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a top view of the exemplary mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>2</b>) that is similar to the mounting adapter <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. In this embodiment of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>2</b>), the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> are attached or integrated with the mounting body <b>36</b> with first and second transition members <b>70</b>, <b>78</b> as will be discussed in more detail below. Common components between the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>2</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the mounting adapter <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are shown with common element numbers. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another exemplary fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>2</b>) is provided. Common components between the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>2</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the mounting adapter <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are shown with common element numbers. In this embodiment, the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>2</b>) may optionally further comprise a first transition member <b>70</b> disposed between the first end <b>38</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b> and a proximal end <b>76</b> of the first extension member <b>20</b>. In addition, it may also optionally comprise a second transition member <b>78</b> disposed between the second end <b>40</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b> and a proximal end <b>80</b> of the second extension member <b>24</b>. For example, the first and second transition members <b>70</b>, <b>78</b> may allow a wider mounting body <b>36</b> to be attached to narrower first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> without damage due to cracking caused by cycle fatigue. More specifically, after the fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>2</b>) is installed, cyclical stresses may be experienced over time by the cable mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>2</b>), the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>, or the external mounting structure <b>16</b>. Different embodiments of the first and second transition members <b>70</b>, <b>78</b> may reduce failures of the fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>2</b>) due to cyclical stress cracking between the mounting body <b>36</b> and the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Variations of the first and second transition members <b>70</b>, <b>78</b> are also possible. For example, in one embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the width of the first transition member <b>70</b> can vary between the first end <b>38</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b> and the proximal end <b>76</b> of the first extension member <b>20</b> as illustrated by the first transition member <b>70</b> widths W<sub>3 </sub>and W<sub>4</sub>. The varying width both enables the larger mounting body <b>36</b> to be attached to smaller first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> and also reduces the chance of failure due to cyclical stress cracking. Similarly, the width may also vary (not shown) for the second transition member <b>78</b>. Further, embodiments of the first and second transition members <b>70</b>, <b>78</b> may include one or more various tapered portions to vary width or height because cyclical stress cracking also may occur along the height of the mounting body <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref>, illustrate top views of a curved width tapered portion and a straight width tapered portion of the exemplary mounting adapters <b>12</b>(<b>3</b>) and <b>12</b>(<b>4</b>) respectively that are similar to the mounting adapter <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C-5D</figref>, illustrate side views of a curved height tapered portion and a straight height tapered portion of the exemplary mounting adapters <b>12</b>(<b>5</b>) and <b>12</b>(<b>6</b>) respectively that are similar to the mounting adapter <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. In these embodiments of the mounting adapters <b>12</b>(<b>3</b>) to <b>12</b>(<b>6</b>), the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> are attached or integrated with the mounting body <b>36</b> utilizing an intermediate transition member having various tapered portions. Common components between the mounting adapters <b>12</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>12</b>(<b>6</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref> and the mounting adapter <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are shown with common element numbers. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a curved width tapered portion <b>82</b> of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>3</b>). FIG. <b>5</b>B depicts an embodiment of a straight width tapered portion <b>84</b> of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>4</b>) because straight tapered portions may have lower manufacturing cost. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref> depict a curved height tapered portion <b>86</b> of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>5</b>) and a straight height tapered portion <b>88</b> of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>6</b>) for either a first or second transition member <b>70</b>, <b>78</b> utilizing the terms H<sub>1 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>to designate height measurements. The tapered portions may be used to minimize cyclical stress cracking, as previously discussed. The taper may be straight or curved in either the width and/or height of the first or second transition members <b>70</b>, <b>78</b>. This allows a taller mounting body <b>36</b> than the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>. Thereby more material volume may be available to support the stronger fastener interfaces <b>56</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b>, for example, a slot <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, illustrate a bottom and cutaway views, respectively, of the exemplary mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>7</b>) that is similar to the mounting adapter <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. In this embodiment of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>7</b>), flexure members <b>90</b> are provided as will be discussed in more detail below. Common components between the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>7</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> and the mounting adapter <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are shown with common element numbers. In this embodiment of mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>7</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>7</b>) may also comprise at least one flexure member <b>90</b> disposed in the cable mounting surface <b>42</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b>. The at least one flexure member <b>90</b> may be disposed between the first end <b>38</b> and the second end <b>40</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b>. The flexure member <b>90</b> may provide stiffness to the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>7</b>) through voids of material (first and second adjacent cavities <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>) between the flexure members <b>90</b> in the mounting body <b>36</b>. Each flexure member <b>90</b> may be connected to a first longitudinal surface <b>96</b> and a second longitudinal surface <b>98</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b>. The first and second longitudinal surfaces <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> may be opposite to each other and each are adjacent to the cable mounting surface <b>42</b>. The flexure member <b>90</b> may be separated by first and second adjacent cavities <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> disposed within the cable mounting surface <b>42</b> of the mounting body <b>36</b>. The first and second adjacent cavities <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> may or may not breakthrough to the opposite side of the mounting body <b>36</b>, but may extend at least one-quarter of the distance required from the cable mounting surface <b>42</b> to breakthrough to the opposite side of the mounting body <b>36</b>. The adjacent cavities <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> in combination with the at least one flexure member <b>90</b> may reduce the weight of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>7</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> depicts the first adjacent cavity <b>92</b> measured from the cable mounting surface <b>42</b> to a depth measured as distance D<sub>1 </sub>that is less than the distance D<sub>2 </sub>needed to breakthrough to the opposite side of the cable mounting surface <b>42</b>. The depth of the first or second adjacent cavities <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> may be different. The at least one flexure members <b>90</b> may have different cross sections at the cable mounting surface <b>42</b> to meet the flexibility requirements of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>7</b>). For example, a chevron-shaped cross-section <b>90</b>A of mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>10</b>) may be used as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, a curved cross section <b>80</b>B of mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>11</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, or a straight cross section <b>80</b>C of mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>12</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. For example, the chevron-shaped cross-section <b>90</b>A may be a V-shape of various angles. Alternatively, the fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>1</b>) may be solid without the adjacent cavities <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> as shown earlier in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, to minimize flexibility of the mounting body <b>36</b> and thereby offer maximum resistance to the bending of the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, illustrates a perspective view of the exemplary mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>8</b>) that is similar to the mounting adapter <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. In this embodiment of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>8</b>), the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> include a first and second protrusion <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> respectively. Common components between the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>8</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and the mounting adapter <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are shown with common element numbers. In this embodiment of mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>8</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the fiber optic mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>8</b>) may optionally include one or more first protrusions <b>100</b> disposed on the first extension member <b>20</b> and one or more second protrusions <b>102</b> disposed on the second extension member <b>24</b>. As discussed in more detail below, the first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may prevent first and second extension member fasteners <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> from slipping on the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>. This slipping may occur as the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>8</b>) is subject to cyclic movement from the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. Slipping of the first and second extension member fasteners <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> can cause the connection between the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>8</b>) and the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> to fail and disengage, causing damage to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b>. In order to prevent or reduce slipping of the first and second extension member fasteners <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> from the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>, the first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may be located on surfaces <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> respectively that are opposite the first and second extension member cable mounting surfaces <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> further depicts one of the first protrusions <b>100</b> located at a distal end <b>108</b> of the first extension member <b>20</b> and one of the second protrusions <b>102</b> located at a distal end <b>110</b> of the second extension member <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It may also be desired to provide multiple fasteners along the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the exemplary mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>9</b>) that is similar to the mounting adapter <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. In this embodiment of the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>9</b>), the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> include a plurality of both first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> respectively. Common components between the mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>9</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and the mounting adapter <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are shown with common element numbers. The mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>9</b>) includes one or more first protrusions <b>100</b> at multiple locations on the first extension member <b>20</b> and the one or more second protrusions <b>102</b> at multiple locations on the second extension member <b>24</b>. Providing multiple first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may prevent or reduce slipping of a plurality of first and second extension member fasteners <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> from the first and second extension members <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may also have variations. As depicted in the close-up drawing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may comprise an orthogonal protrusion surface <b>112</b> which is orthogonal to the longitudinal direction (A<sub>1</sub>) of the fiber optic cable mounting adapter <b>12</b>(<b>8</b>). The first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may also comprise an angled protrusion surface <b>114</b> adjacent to the orthogonal protrusion surface <b>112</b>. The orthogonal protrusion surface <b>112</b> may face the mounting body <b>36</b>, and the angled protrusion surface <b>114</b> may face away from the mounting body <b>36</b>. Other embodiments of the first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may have combinations of the orthogonal and angled protrusion surfaces <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> which may be adjacent or opposite to each other. The first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may optionally incorporate a rougher surface texture for more friction grip with the one or more first and second extension member fasteners <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>. The optional rougher surface texture may also prevent slipping and may be for example applied by machining the first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> with a relatively coarse abrasive. In addition, the different embodiments disclosed of the first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may be used by those skilled in the art to optimize attachment to the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> using different embodiments of first and second protrusions <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>.</p>

The shapes of the cable mounting surfaces <b>42</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> may enable the mounting adapter <b>12</b> to increase the contact area abutting the fiber optic cable <b>14</b> to provide a more secure attachment for a wide range of fiber optic cable diameters. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref>, <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>C, and <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C, illustrate side, bottom, and cutaway views of the exemplary mounting adapters <b>12</b>(<b>10</b>), <b>12</b>(<b>11</b>), and <b>12</b>(<b>12</b>) that are similar to the mounting adapter <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>.
