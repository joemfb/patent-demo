<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The greatest source of multiple contamination agents introduced to interiors of homes, hospitals, schools, and offices is carried on contaminated bottom of footwear. A recent study by the University of Arizona (2008), confirmed this finding by testing of the bottom of the footwear picked up 420,000 units of bacteria in just two weeks. Of that bacterium, 27% were the deadly <i>E. coli </i>virus. The bacterium, K. pneumonia was also found which can cause pneumonia and sepsis. Also identified was <i>S. ficaria</i>, which can lead to infection of the respiratory tract.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It was found out that a square inch of a typical carpet at home can contain as much as 100,000 of various bacteria and over 16,000 of various bacteria on every square inch of a bathroom floor. The interesting part of this research is that a toilet seat has only 50 bacteria. This confirms that the source of contamination that is being introduced to a typical home is done by contaminated footwear.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Using steam cleaners to kill the bacteria was found ineffective in killing germs and bacteria in Home and public places. Although at the source steam can be 100 degrees C. however by the time this steam gets in contact with the carpets or the floor the temperature drops drastically and as such does not kill the bacteria and the viruses. Chemical products that may be used by spraying or spreading on floors or carpets create potential hazards to health and safety and exacerbate allergies.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, with the probability of a pandemic caused by certain viruses, a portable ultraviolet sterilizing device will be essential in eradicating these viruses.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The best known source of sterilization is UV-C radiation. However this source of radiation used without protective eyewear and shielding the skin from the UV-C rays will create safety hazards. A sterilization device to be used by the public must be designed in a way to completely protect the people from being exposed to UV-C radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">UV-C radiation is a unique and rapid method of surface disinfection, utilizing germicidal ultraviolet lamps that produce short wave radiation that is lethal to bacteria, virus, pathogens and other microorganisms.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention generally relates to using UV-C radiation to sterilize the bottom of footwear which may include shoes, athletic shoes, socks, and sandals utilizing a safe and portable device. The invention more particularly relates to a portable device that can be used both in the home and in public places such as hospitals, schools, food preparation areas, office buildings, and other public buildings. This device will be activated by a person stepping on the glass platform. Once activated, the device will turn on a UV-C bulbs which will sterilize the bottom of footwear using UV-C radiation. The bottom of footwear will be exposed for a time specified by and controlled by an electronic timer.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention generally relates to using ultraviolet radiation to sterilize the bottom of footwear which may include shoes, athletic shoes, socks, and sandals utilizing a safe and portable device. The invention more particularly relates to a portable device that can be used both in the home and in public places such as hospitals, schools, office buildings, and other public buildings. This device will be activated by a person stepping on the glass platform and by the presence of footwear in a designated area within the device. Once activated, the device will turn on UV-C bulbs which will sterilize the bottom of footwear using UV-C radiation. The bottom of footwear will be exposed for a time specified by an electronic timer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Ultraviolet radiation is a unique and rapid method for surface disinfection, utilizing germicidal ultraviolet lamps produce short wave radiation that is lethal to bacteria, virus, pathogens and other microorganisms. However, UV-C radiation is harmful to humans and in particular human eyes. In order to prevent corneal damage, you must wear protective eyewear. Our device circumvents protective eyewear through a protective shield over the stepping platform, which will eliminate any exposure to the UV-C radiation for the person stepping on the device. To add additional protection and safety, we use spring-loaded actuators, calibrated to sense the presence of a person weight, stepping on the device. The spring-loaded actuators will be calibrated to a pre-determined weight in order to activate the micro-switches. This will ensure that no pets, babies, or toddlers will activate the device. In addition, a motion sensing switch needs to be activated by the placement of the footwear completely within a specific area in the device. The device cannot be activated by weight alone and must be activated by a combination of weight and motion sensing switches.</p>
