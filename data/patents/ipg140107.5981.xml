<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to computer security software, and more particularly to software for scanning data.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Unwanted data is generally a sequence of commands or instructions that interfere with a user's operation of, or cause damage to, his or her computer system. Such unwanted data may include viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, and so forth. As an example, unwanted data may damage a computer system directly, such as by deleting files or formatting a disk, or indirectly, such as by altering system protective measures, thus making the computer vulnerable to probing or other attacks. Other types of unwanted data may simply inconvenience a user of a computer, for example, by displaying an unwanted political message in a dialogue box, tracking actions performed on the computer by such a user (e.g. tracking websites visited by a user, etc.), theft of personal information, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unwanted data therefore presents a significant threat to the integrity and reliability of computer systems and continues to present such a threat due to the interconnecting of computers (e.g. through networks, the Internet, etc.). The increase in computer-to-computer communications, via the Internet for example, has caused a commensurate increase in the spread of unwanted data because infected files are spread more easily and rapidly than ever before.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Detection of unwanted data is thus an essential element in the effective maintenance of computer systems. In order to detect unwanted data, a detection program is generally employed in conjunction with a series of &#x201c;profiles&#x201d; or &#x201c;signatures&#x201d; which represent characteristics or patterns of known unwanted data. One type of detection routine monitors a program suspected of being infected by unwanted data. The behavior of the program is compared to a profile of operating characteristics of known unwanted data and, if a match is found, the program is assumed to contain the unwanted data.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One solution for detecting unwanted data is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,230,288.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A system, method, and computer program product are provided for scanning data values. Initially, a set of data values are received. Null values between the data values are then removed such that the data values are contiguous. Further, the data values with the null values removed are scanned for the purpose of identifying unwanted data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, it may be determined if a threshold is met before removing the null values. Such threshold may be indicative of a size of the set of data values. Accordingly, only a portion of the set of data values may be received if the set of data values is larger than the threshold. Still yet, the portion of the set of data values may only include the data values that are necessary for the scanning.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the present embodiment, the portion of the set of data values may be identified utilizing a key position. Such key position may be based on a virus signature associated with the scanning. Furthermore, after the null values are removed in a first portion of the set of data values, the first portion of the set of data values may be stored with the null values removed, and it may also be determined whether a second portion of the set of data values is to be received. In addition, after all of the portions of the set of data values are stored with the null values removed, all such portions may be scanned.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect of the present embodiment, an offset may be utilized for determining a location in the set of data values where the scanning is to start. The offset may optionally be based on a number of the null values located between a beginning of the portions of the set of data values, and the location where the scanning is to start. Additionally, a Global Regular Expression Print (GREP) function may be utilized for locating the offset. Even still, the offset may match the location where the scanning is to start, with a first portion of a virus signature.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In still yet another embodiment, it may be determined if the scanned data values include the unwanted data. As an option, a reaction may be initiated based on the determination. In one aspect, the scanned data values may be processed based on the determination.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in operation <b>302</b>, a set of data values is received. The set of data values may include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), plain text, JavaScript, VBScript, and/or any other data and/or code capable of including null values, which will be described in further detail during reference to operation <b>304</b>. The set of data values may also be received in the form of a file (e.g. text file, etc.). Further, such set of data values may be received at any device capable of receiving a set of data values. Just by way of example, the set of data values may be received at a computer, such as those described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">After the set of data values are received in operation <b>302</b>, null values between the data values are removed such that the data values are contiguous, as depicted in operation <b>304</b>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As an option, the set of data values with the null values removed may be temporarily stored, for example, in a temporary text file. After operation <b>304</b>, the reconstructed data may be submitted to further preprocessing operations, if any. Of course, this is an option.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, after the null values are removed in operation <b>304</b>, the set of data values with the null values removed are scanned for the purpose of identifying unwanted data, as in operation <b>306</b>. The scanning may be performed by any scanning application capable of detecting unwanted data. Further, the scanning may be performed on the computer device receiving the set of data values in operation <b>302</b>, or may be performed on any other computer device capable of receiving and scanning the set of data values with the null values removed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thus, a set of data values may be scanned for unwanted data in a more accurate and efficient manner. Specifically, unwanted data may be located even if a creator of the unwanted data attempts to circumvent detection techniques by adding null values to a set of data values. Furthermore, removing the null values may create a shorter set of data values to be scanned, thus lessening the time required to complete the scanning.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">More illustrative information will now be set forth regarding various optional architectures and features with which the foregoing method <b>300</b> may or may not be implemented, per the desires of the user. It should be strongly noted that the following information is set forth for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as limiting in any manner. Any of the following features may be optionally incorporated with or without the exclusion of other features described.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a method <b>400</b> for removing null values during scanning, in accordance with another embodiment. As an option, the present method <b>400</b> may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. Of course, however, the method <b>400</b> may be carried out in any desired environment. In addition, the definitions referred to with respect to the method <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also apply in the context of the method <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in operation <b>402</b>, a set of data values to be scanned is identified. As described with reference to operation <b>302</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, such set of data values may include any data and/or code capable of including null values.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As an option, a database of signatures to be used in subsequent scanning may indicate that a particular unwanted data, or each unwanted data, must include at least a predetermined threshold amount of data (e.g. 20K). Thus, it may be determined at this point if the identified set of data values is at least the predetermined threshold amount, before any processing commences. If it is not, additional processing (e.g. scanning, etc.) is not necessary, and resources may be preserved. Further, after null values have been removed (as will soon be set forth), the revised data set size must again be more than the threshold. Again, if it is not, additional processing is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, if it is determined in decision <b>404</b> that the set of data values is not larger than a pre-defined threshold [X (e.g. X=2, etc.) times an amount of associated signature(s)], the set of data values identified in operation <b>402</b> is received (see operation <b>406</b>). Null values located between data values in the received set of data values of operation <b>406</b> are then removed, as shown in operation <b>408</b>. The set of data values with the null values removed is then stored, as in operation <b>410</b>. Such set of data values with the null values removed may be stored permanently or temporarily for a predetermined period of time, such as, for example, until after the stored set of data values is scanned. After operation <b>410</b>, the reconstructed data may be submitted to further preprocessing operations, if any. Of course, this is an option.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, after the set of data values with the null values removed is stored in operation <b>410</b>, such set of data values is then scanned for unwanted data, as illustrated in operation <b>412</b>. If it is determined in decision <b>414</b> that the stored set of data values of operation <b>410</b> does include unwanted data, a reaction is initiated based on the scan (see operation <b>416</b>). Such reaction may include quarantining or deleting the set of data values received in operation <b>406</b> and/or the set of data values stored in operation <b>410</b>, notifying a user of the unwanted data, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, if it is determined in decision <b>414</b> that the stored set of data values of operation <b>410</b> does not include unwanted data, the set of data values received in operation <b>406</b> and/or the stored set of data values of operation <b>410</b> may optionally be subject to additional processing (e.g. opening/execution by a user/program, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The additional processing may, in one embodiment, include that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,230,288, which is incorporated herein by reference, as an optional way of collapsing whitespace, etc. It should be noted that the additional processing described in U.S. Patent No. 6,230,288 may alternatively be performed prior to the operations of the method <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thus, in one embodiment, null values may be removed, after which whitespace may be collapsed. Whitespace placing may be relevant, since HTML and scripting languages are typically driven by keywords. If all words or text are transformed together, the keyword may not exist, rendering the code inoperable. Further, detecting it as unwanted data may be erroneous. If the data values are received with null values interspersed, and whitespace strewn throughtout, the system may be able to process the related file, and execute any pertinent script. Therefore, in one embodiment, a collapsed baseline may be provided so all such data values look the same, from the point of view of a scanner, etc., so that one basic detection string, signature, schema, etc. may be able to detect unwanted data).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If, in decision <b>404</b>, it is determined that the set of data values is larger than the pre-defined threshold [X (e.g. X=2, etc.) times an amount of associated signature(s)], only a portion of the set of data values identified in operation <b>402</b> may be received, as illustrated in operation <b>418</b>. The portion of the set of data values may include any portion of the set of data values necessary for scanning. For example, such portion of the set of data values may include only data relevant to a signature utilized in association with a scanning of the set of data values. Additionally, the portion of the set of data values may be based on a maximum pre-defined size, such that only a specific amount of the set of data values may be received in operation <b>418</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, the portion of the set of data values may be identified utilizing a key position. Such key position may be located in a database in association with a specific signature or may be located in any other desired manner. For example, the key position may be based on a virus signature associated with a scanning to be performed on the set of data values. In this way, a key position is capable of identifying a beginning of a portion of a set of data values, which may be relevant during scanning.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">After the portion of the set of data values is received in operation <b>418</b>, null values located between the data values are removed such that the data values are contiguous, as shown in operation <b>420</b>. The portion of the set of data values is then stored in operation <b>422</b> after the null values are removed in operation <b>420</b>. As described with respect to operation <b>410</b>, such portion of the set of data values (with the null values removed) may be stored temporarily or permanently, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is then determined in decision <b>424</b> whether another portion of the set of data values is to be received. The decision <b>424</b> may optionally be based on whether additional data values from the set of data values identified in operation <b>402</b> are needed for scanning. If it is determined in operation <b>424</b> that another portion of the set of data values is to be received, the method <b>400</b> returns to operation <b>418</b>, where the next portion of the set of data values is received. In this way, a set of data values may be received portion-by-portion such that each portion is eradicated of null values and stored before a next portion is received. Of course, in other embodiments, each portion may be received prior to the null value removal.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Once it is determined in operation <b>424</b> that no further portions of the set of data values needs to be received, an offset of the stored set of data values is identified, as shown in operation <b>426</b>. As an option, prior to operation <b>426</b> and after operation <b>424</b>, the reconstructed data may be submitted to further preprocessing operations, if any.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The offset may be utilized for determining a location in the stored set of data values, where the scanning is to start. For example, the offset may be based on a number of the null values located between a first data value received in operation <b>418</b>, and a location in the stored set of data values where the scanning is to start. Thus, the offset may map the location in the stored set of data values where the scanning is to start, with a first portion of a virus signature.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Utilizing the offset identified in operation <b>426</b>, the stored set of data values, including all of the relevant portions of the set of data values from operation <b>422</b> are scanned beginning at the offset (see operation <b>428</b>). A Global Regular Expression Print (GREP) function may optionally be utilized for locating the offset within the stored set of data values. It is then determined in decision <b>430</b> whether the scanned set of data values of operation <b>428</b> includes unwanted data. If it is determined in decision <b>430</b> that the stored set of data values of operation <b>422</b> does include unwanted data, a reaction is initiated based on the scan (see operation <b>432</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Examples of such reactions may include those described with reference to operation <b>416</b>. However, if it is determined in decision <b>430</b> that the stored set of data values of operation <b>422</b> does not include unwanted data, the set of data values received in operation <b>418</b> and/or the stored set of data values of operation <b>422</b> may optionally be subject to additional processing.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Such additional processing was described in detail hereinabove. Specifically, the additional processing may, in one embodiment, include that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,230,288, which is incorporated herein by reference, as an optional way of collapsing whitespace, etc. It should be noted that the additional processing described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,230,288 may alternatively be performed prior to the operations of the method <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this way, the method <b>400</b> allows for only the relevant portions of the set of data values (which need to be scanned) to be stored for scanning, and therefore limits the overall scanning time in operation <b>428</b>. Specifically, in an example where an amount of an associated signature(s) is 20K and the pre-defined threshold from decision <b>404</b> is twice such size (i.e. 40K), the set of data values may be read starting at a point near the 20K mark, but not at the 20K mark. That is, one may be able to determine &#x201c;into&#x201d; the data sequence a position where the unwanted data may be found. This may possibly cause more processing time to determine the offset where the unwanted data may be found. However, disk access time costs more. Thus, time may be saved, in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a method <b>500</b> for scanning a text file, in accordance with still yet another embodiment. As an option, the present method <b>500</b> may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. Of course, however, the method <b>500</b> may be carried out in any desired environment. In addition, the definitions referred to with respect to the method <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also apply in the context of the method <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in operation <b>502</b>, a text file including a set of data values and null values is identified. The null values in the set of data values of operation <b>502</b> are then removed and the resulting set of data values is stored in a temporary text file, as shown in operation <b>504</b>. Finally, the temporary text file of operation <b>504</b> is sent to a scanner that scans the set of data values for unwanted data. See operation <b>506</b>. As an option, after operation <b>504</b> and before operation <b>506</b>, the reconstructed data may be submitted to further preprocessing operations, if any.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As a further option, null values within the signatures utilized in the scanning may also be removed such that only actual data values within the signatures may be compared against a set of actual data values in a temporary text file. Thus, the scanner is able to match signatures without null values, with a set of data that also does not include null values.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. For example, any of the network elements may employ any of the desired functionality set forth hereinabove.
