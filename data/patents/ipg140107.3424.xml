<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A film having multilayer barrier coating creates a barrier film with unsurpassed barrier performance, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,268,695, entitled &#x201c;Environmental Barrier Material For Organic Light Emitting Device And Method Of Making,&#x201d; issued Jul. 31, 2001; U.S. Pat.

No. 7,198,832, entitled &#x201c;Method for Edge Sealing Barrier Films&#x201d;, issued Apr. 3, 2007; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/068,356, entitled &#x201c;Method for Edge Sealing Barrier Films&#x201d;, filed Feb. 28, 2005; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/693,020, entitled &#x201c;Method for Edge Sealing Barrier Films&#x201d;, filed Mar. 29, 2007; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/693,022, entitled &#x201c;Method for Edge Sealing Barrier Films&#x201d;, filed Mar. 29, 2007; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/776,616, entitled &#x201c;Multilayer Barrier Stacks and Methods of Making Multilayer Barrier Stacks,&#x201d; filed Jul. 12, 2007; each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The number of barrier stacks is not limited. The number of barrier stacks needed depends on the substrate material used and on the level of permeation resistance needed for the particular application. One or two barrier stacks may provide sufficient barrier properties for some applications. The most stringent applications may require five or more barrier stacks.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The barrier stacks may include at least one decoupling layer and at least one barrier layer. There may be one decoupling layer and one barrier layer, there may be at least one decoupling layer disposed on one side of at least one barrier layer, there may be at least one decoupling layer disposed on both sides of at least one barrier layer, or there may be at least one barrier layer disposed on both sides of at least one decoupling layer. A barrier stack may include at least one decoupling layer and at least one barrier layer. The barrier layers in the barrier stacks may be made of the same material or of a different material as each other, and the decoupling layers may also be made of the same material or of a different material as each other.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each of the barrier layers may be typically about 100 to about 2000 &#x212b; thick. In some embodiments a first barrier layer which is first formed among all battier layers may be thicker than later barrier layers which are later formed among all battier layers in comparison with the first barrier layer, if desired. For example, the first barrier layer may have a thickness of about 1000 &#x212b; to about 1500 &#x212b;, while later barrier layers may have a thickness of about 400 &#x212b; to about 500 &#x212b;. In some other embodiments, the first barrier layer may be thinner than later barrier layers. For example, the first barrier layer may have a thickness of about 100 &#x212b; to about 400 &#x212b;, while later barrier layers may have a thickness of about 400 &#x212b; to about 500 &#x212b;. The decoupling layers may be typically about 0.1 to about 10 &#x3bc;m thick. In some embodiments the first decoupling layer may be thicker than later decoupling layers, if desired. For example, the first decoupling layer which is first formed among all decoupling layers may have a thickness of about 3 &#x3bc;m to about 5 &#x3bc;m, while later decoupling layers which are later formed among all decoupling layers in comparison with the first decoupling layer may have a thickness of about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to about 2 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The barrier stacks may include the same or different layers, and the layers may be arranged in the same or different sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The decoupling layers may be made from the same decoupling material or different decoupling materials. The decoupling layers may be made of at least one selected from among, but not limited to, organic polymers, polymers including inorganic elements, organometallic polymers, hybrid organic/inorganic polymer systems, and combinations thereof. The organic polymers may be at least one selected from among, but not limited to, urethanes, polyamides, polyimides, polybutylenes, isobutylene isoprene, polyolefins, epoxies, parylenes, benzocyclobutadiene, polynorbornenes, polyarylethers, polycarbonates, alkyds, polyaniline, ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene acrylic acid, and combinations thereof. The polymers including inorganic elements may be at least one selected from among, but not limited to, silicones, polyphosphazenes, polysilazanes, polycarbosilanes, polycarboranes, carborane siloxanes, polysilanes, phosphonitriles, sulfur nitride polymers, siloxanes, and combinations thereof. The organometallic polymers may be at least one selected from among, but not limited to, organometallic polymers of main group metals, transition metals, and lanthanide/actinide metals, and combinations thereof. The hybrid organic/inorganic polymer systems may be at least one selected from among, but not limited to, organically modified silicates, preceramic polymers, polyimide-silica hybrids, (meth)acrylate-silica hybrids, polydimethylsiloxane-silica hybrids, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The barrier layers may be made from the same barrier material or different barrier materials. The barrier layers may be made of any suitable barrier material. Suitable inorganic materials based on metals may be at least selected from among, but not limited to, individual metals, two or more metals as mixtures, inter-metallics or alloys, metal and mixed metal oxides, metal and mixed metal fluorides, metal and mixed metal nitrides, metal and mixed metal carbides, metal and mixed metal carbonitrides, metal and mixed metal oxynitrides, metal and mixed metal borides, metal and mixed metal oxyborides, metal and mixed metal silicides, and combinations thereof. The metals may be at least one selected from among, not limited to, transition (&#x201c;d&#x201d; block) metals, lanthanide (&#x201c;f&#x201d; block) metals, aluminum, indium, germanium, tin, antimony and bismuth, and combinations thereof. Many of the resultant metal based materials will be conductors or semiconductors. The fluorides and oxides may be at least one selected from among, but not limited to, dielectrics (insulators), semiconductors and metallic conductors.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The barrier layers may be deposited by using any suitable process including, but not limited to, contemporary vacuum processes such as sputtering, evaporation, sublimation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), electron cyclotron resonance-plasma enhanced vapor deposition (ECR-PECVD), and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The decoupling layers may be produced by using a number of known processes which provide improved surface planarity, including both atmospheric processes and vacuum processes. The decoupling layers may be formed by depositing a layer of liquid and subsequently processing the layer of liquid into a solid film. Depositing the decoupling layers as a liquid allows the liquid to flow over and to compensate the defects in the substrate or a previous layer, fill in lower areas, and cover up higher points, providing a surface with significantly improved planarity. When the decoupling layers is processed into a solid film, the improved surface planarity is retained. Suitable processes for depositing a layer of liquid material and processing it into a solid film include, but are not limited to, vacuum processes and atmospheric processes. Suitable vacuum processes include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,260,095, 5,395,644, 5,547,508, 5,691,615, 5,902,641, 5,440,446, and 5,725,909, which are incorporated herein by reference. Liquid spreading apparatuses described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,260,095, 5,395,644, and 5,547,508, which are incorporated herein by reference, may be further configured to print liquid monomer in discrete, precisely placed regions of the receiving substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Suitable atmospheric processes include, but are not limited to, spin coating, printing, ink jet printing, and/or spraying. Atmospheric processes refer to processes that run at pressures of about 1 atmosphere and can employ the ambient atmosphere. The use of atmospheric processes presents a number of difficulties including the need to cycle between a vacuum environment for depositing the barrier layer and ambient conditions for the decoupling layer, and exposure of the environmentally sensitive device to environmental contaminants, such as oxygen and moisture. One way to alleviate these problems is to use a specific gas (purge gas) during the atmospheric process to control exposure of the receiving substrate to the environmental contaminants. For example, the process may include cycling between a vacuum environment for barrier layer deposition and an ambient pressure nitrogen environment for the atmospheric process. Printing processes, including ink jet printing, allow the deposition of the decoupling layer in a precise area without the use of masks.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">One way to make a decoupling layer involves depositing a polymer precursor, such as a (meth)acrylate containing polymer precursor, and then polymerizing it in situ to form the decoupling layer. As used herein, the term &#x201c;polymer precursor&#x201d; means a material which may be polymerized to form a polymer, including, but not limited to, monomers, oligomers, and resins. As another example of a method of making a decoupling layer, a preceramic precursor may be deposited as a liquid by spin coating and then be converted to a solid layer. Full thermal conversion is possible for a film of this type directly on a glass or oxide coated substrate. Although the preceramic precursor sometimes cannot be fully converted to a ceramic at temperatures compatible with some flexible substrates, partial conversion to a cross-lined network structure would be satisfactory. Electron beam techniques may be used to crosslink and/or densify some of these types of polymers and may be combined with thermal techniques to overcome some of the substrate thermal limitations, provided the substrate may handle the electron beam exposure. Another example of making a decoupling layer involves depositing a material, such as a polymer precursor, as a liquid at a temperature above its melting point and subsequently freezing it in place.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">One method of making a barrier film composite includes providing a substrate, and depositing a barrier layer adjacent to the substrate at a barrier deposition station. The substrate with the barrier layer may be moved to a decoupling material deposition station. A mask is provided with an opening which limits the deposition of the decoupling layer to an area which is smaller than, and contained within, the area covered by the barrier layer. The first layer deposited may be either the barrier layer or the decoupling layer, depending on the design of the composite.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">These multilayer, barrier coatings and barrier films are relatively flexible. These multilayer, barrier coatings and barrier films typically start cracking only when they are wrapped over a 7 mm radius spindle. For example, the thin (about 60 nm) aluminum oxide barrier layers in the barrier coating start showing cracks around a 0.75% tensile strain. While optimization of the adhesion and materials might be able to shift the threshold of first cracks to higher values, it is unlikely that such a multilayer barrier film could be stretched to several percent elongation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The pristine multilayer barrier film has been shown to be almost stress free (the tensile stress of the aluminum oxide layers is only 470 MPa, and the tensile stress of the polymers layers is even lower), resulting in processed films which are flat and which do not curl under heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The barrier properties of the pristine multilayer barrier films have been shown to have a water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>g/m<sup>2</sup>/day.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The application of such stretchable barrier films may be to protect a wide range of environmentally sensitive materials and objects, ranging from flexible displays and solar cells to car bumpers used for corrosion protection and medical applications.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Instead of applying a wet or spray coating to a three dimensional object (paint for instance), more and more industries prefer a moldable coating which may be wrapped on the object (e.g., a car bumper) without the manufacturing company having to conduct wet processing with environmentally unfriendly chemicals and having to deal with the resulting contaminant and waste effluent problems.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Another application of stretchable barrier film composites is to be used as a barrier coating on the exterior of a three dimensional object, which may be created by putting a barrier film in a mold and injecting plastic into the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Medical packaging for individual pills pockets using the multilayer barrier film is another potential application of stretchable barrier film composites.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">There are a number of ways to realize such structures. These methods make use of the flexibility of the barrier layer or take into account that the barrier layers break on stretching.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">One aspect of the invention is either to prevent barrier layers from cracking or to minimize and compensate for cracks. The resulting barrier might not meet a WVTR of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>g/m<sup>2</sup>/day, but it may still have a good WVTR that is about 100 times better than a homogenous barrier film such as a polychlorotrifluoroethylene film (e.g., ACLAR&#xae; film available from Honeywell International, Inc.).</p>

The barrier film composite <b>6</b> is less likely to crack, and thus may protect the organic emission layer <b>23</b> from external moisture and oxygen, even when cracking occurs, due to the pitch P extending between the second regions <b>620</b> and potential external contamination paths are elongated as the barrier film composite <b>6</b> is stretched.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The organic light-emitting display apparatus <b>200</b> may further include the layer <b>30</b> which is disposed between the organic light-emitting device <b>20</b> and the barrier film composite <b>6</b>. The layer <b>30</b> may be a flexible layer.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a barrier film composite <b>7</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the barrier film composite <b>7</b> includes alternating layers of inorganic barrier layers <b>705</b> and decoupling layers <b>715</b> alternatingly disposed on a substrate <b>705</b>. Metal ribs <b>720</b> may be disposed in the inorganic barrier layers <b>705</b>, if partial loss of transparency is acceptable. Suitable materials for the metal ribs <b>720</b> include, but are not limited to, soft metals, alloys, tin (Sn), indium (In), and combinations thereof. The metal ribs <b>720</b> can be stretched without breaking. The metal ribs <b>720</b> may be two-dimensional.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Another method of making barrier film composites involves making the inorganic barrier layers out of a very ductile soft metal or metal alloy, such as tin. The multiplayer structure will be semitransparent or even opaque, depending on the thickness and number of layers used. There are however many applications for the stretchable multilayer barrier which do not require a transparent barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Another method of making barrier film composites is to cover the inorganic barrier layers with a thin layer of nanoparticles of an inorganic oxide or nitride. The inorganic barrier layer may crack when it is stretched, but the nanoparticles should reduce the effect of the cracks by increasing the length of the undulating path.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Another method of making barrier film composites is to stretch a soft substrate and deposit the inorganic barrier layers on the substrate while the soft substrate is being stretched. When the tension is released, the inorganic barrier layer will be compressed. This will allow some stretching of the inorganic layers when the structure is used.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As described above, according to the one or more embodiments of the present invention, a stretchable barrier film composite provides a soft, elastic polymer-based structure with an undulating surface, and a display apparatus may be manufactured using the flexible barrier film composite.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.</p>
