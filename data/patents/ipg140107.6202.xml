<p id="p-0002" num="0001">I. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to data processing. More particularly, the present invention relates to quantitative measurements of applications at one or more computers in a multiprocessor computing environment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">II. Background and Material Information</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In multiprocessor computing environments, such as distributed, parallel, grid, or peer-to-peer computing environments, an application may be instantiated (or executed) on a computer. However, the source of an application that will be instantiated on a computer may not have any information concerning the state of the computer or the state of any applications on the computer. The lack of such state information may become a concern when there are insufficient resources at the computer to accommodate a new application. When there are insufficient resources at the computer, the performance of the computer and its applications degrade. For example, computer performance degradations may occur when there is insufficient memory at the computer or when CPU (central processing unit) utilization is too high. Performance degradations of an application can manifest themselves when the application has too many incoming calls, too many started threads, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a multiprocessor computing environment, knowledge of performance degradations can be used to decide whether to open a new instance of an application (or execute the new application) at a computer. For example, in a multiprocessor environment, a source computer may prefer instantiating a new application at a computer with sufficient resources to avoid having any performance degradations. In contrast, if a new application is instantiated (or executed) at a computer with insufficient resources, it is more likely that performance degradations will impact the computer or the application.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reference will now be made in detail to the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The implementations set forth in the following description do not represent all implementations consistent with the claimed invention. Instead, they are merely some examples consistent with certain aspects related to the invention. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary system environment <b>100</b> consistent with certain aspects related to the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>100</b> includes client systems <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> connected by a network <b>118</b> to one or more servers <b>120</b>-<b>124</b>. Although the description of system <b>100</b> is made in the context of a client-server environment, any other environment can be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one exemplary embodiment, there is provided a regulator <b>140</b> for determining whether to instantiate a new application on one of a plurality of interconnected computers, such as servers <b>120</b>-<b>124</b> or clients <b>112</b>-<b>116</b>. Moreover, regulator <b>140</b> may receive information regarding the application to be instantiated on the computer and receive information regarding the computer on which the application is to be instantiated. The computer on which the application is to be instantiated can be any computer, such as server <b>122</b>. Regulator <b>140</b> then determines a measurement based on the received application information and the received computer information. Based on the determined measurement, regulator <b>140</b> determines whether to instantiate the application. For example, if the measurement indicates that the computer, such as server <b>112</b>, has sufficient resources to accommodate the new application, regulator <b>140</b> allows that application to be instantiated on the computer. If the measurement indicates that the computer has insufficient resources for the new application, regulator <b>140</b> may not allow the application to be instantiated. In some cases, regulator <b>140</b> may then evaluate another computer, such as server <b>124</b>, to determine whether it has sufficient resources. The use of regulator <b>140</b> may enable a computer having a regulator to autonomously instantiate applications in one or more computers of a multiprocessor computing environment.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Clients <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> may each include a computer capable of making a request through network <b>180</b> to instantiate an application on servers <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;instantiate&#x201d; means, in an object oriented programming environment, an object of a particular class, and, more generally, includes deploying, customizing, running and/or executing an application.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A computer suitable for use as a client or a server includes, among other things, a processor for executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing computer program instructions and data. The computer may also receive data from and/or transfer data to one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, or optical disks. Furthermore, the computer may be capable of interfacing to a network, such as network <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Network <b>118</b> may include, alone or in any suitable combination, a telephony-based network, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a dedicated intranet, a wireless LAN, the Internet, a wireless network, a bus, or any other any communication mechanisms. Further, any suitable combination of wired and/or wireless components and systems may be used to provide a communication mechanism. Moreover, network <b>118</b> may be embodied using bi-directional or unidirectional communication links. Further, network <b>118</b> may utilize protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), and Remote Procedure Call (RPC).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Servers <b>120</b>-<b>124</b> may each include a computer with a coupled storage device and a memory. The memory may contain an operating system, one or more applications as well as their corresponding interfaces. Moreover, the memory may further include regulator application <b>140</b>. Regulator <b>140</b> can be implemented as a software application that controls whether an application should be instantiated at a computer, such as a server of system <b>100</b>. Regulator <b>140</b> receives information regarding measurements of the computer and/or its operating system (e.g., available memory at a server, processing power of a server, available disk space at a server, available network bandwidth at server, and the like). Furthermore, regulator <b>140</b> receives information regarding measurements of the application to be instantiated (e.g., memory required by the application, processing power required by application, disk space required by the application, bandwidth required by the application, and the like). Based on the received information regarding the computer and the application to be instantiated, regulator <b>140</b> determines whether the application should be instantiated at a given computer, such as one of the servers of system <b>100</b>. Moreover, the measurements may be normalized, so that different types of measurements can be processed, combined, compared, etc. Furthermore, the measurements may be weighted so that importance (or lack thereof) can be taken into account. Although the previous example regarding regulator <b>140</b> describes a server, regulator <b>140</b> can be used in connection with any computer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary flow chart with steps <b>200</b> consistent with certain aspects related to the present invention. Regulator <b>140</b> may receive information regarding an application to be instantiated (step <b>210</b>) and receive information regarding a computer on which the application is to be instantiated (step <b>220</b>). Regulator <b>140</b> may then determine a dual measurement value based on the received information of steps <b>210</b> and <b>220</b>. Moreover, regulator <b>140</b> may determine, based on the determined dual measurement, whether to instantiate the application on the computer (step <b>240</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a block diagram of another exemplary system environment <b>300</b> consistent with certain aspects related to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in many respects, but shows additional components. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, server <b>120</b> includes a central processing unit (labeled &#x201c;processor&#x201d;) <b>332</b>, a memory <b>334</b>, and a storage device <b>336</b> coupled to server <b>120</b>. Moreover, servers <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> may each include applications <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, respectively. In some embodiments, servers <b>120</b>-<b>124</b> each include multiple applications that when executed, require and consume resources of that server since multiple applications executed at a single server compete for its finite resources. Furthermore, the resources available at any given server may vary over time.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Memory <b>334</b> includes an operating system (OS) <b>338</b>, one or more software applications, such as an application <b>126</b>, a regulator <b>140</b>, a process application <b>330</b>, and an application program interface <b>342</b>. Memory <b>334</b> may include any type of physical memory including RAM, DRAM, FLASH memory, or the like. Storage device <b>336</b> may include any storage medium including a disk drive, an optical drive, FLASH memory, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Application <b>126</b> can be any type of software application. As noted above, regulator <b>140</b> may be a software application that controls whether one or more instances of applications in the distributed computing environment <b>100</b> should be instantiated. In one exemplary embodiment, regulator <b>140</b> uses application programming interface (API) <b>342</b> to receive quantitative measurement information about an application to be instantiated at a server (step <b>210</b>). API <b>342</b> may provide information regarding the application, such as system resources needed by the application including required processing, required main memory, required disk space, required network bandwidth, and the like. Moreover, the information regarding the application may be stored, for example, in a storage device, such as a database. Alternatively, the information regarding the application can be retrieved through the Internet or an intranet from a service that provides such information. Furthermore, for different applications the information regarding each of the application may be the same or may be different. Regulator <b>140</b> may also use API <b>342</b> to receive quantitative measurement information concerning the current system resources available on a computer, such as one of the servers <b>120</b>-<b>124</b>, on which the application is to be instantiated (step <b>220</b>). Examples of such measurements include the following: processing power available at the computer, available main memory at the computer, available disk space at the computer, available network bandwidth, and the like. Retrieval of the measurements may be implemented using services provided by an operating system or using commercially available tools, such as saposcol (available from SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Regulator <b>140</b> may combine the measurement information regarding the application and the system (e.g., server <b>120</b>) to generate a dual measurement (step <b>230</b>). As noted above, the dual measurement value may be normalized and/or may be weighted. If such measurements indicate that server <b>120</b> can accommodate the instantiation of the application, regulator <b>140</b> may allow the application to be instantiated on server <b>120</b> (step <b>240</b>). If such measurements indicate that server <b>120</b> cannot accommodate the application, regulator may make additional measurements at another computer, such as server <b>122</b> or <b>124</b>, to determine whether (or where) the application can be instantiated. Thus, regulator <b>140</b> controls whether the application is instantiated at a computer, such as server <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows system <b>300</b> after regulator <b>140</b> allows an application <b>390</b> to be instantiated based on the dual measurement. Although server <b>120</b> and application <b>390</b> are described in the above example, any computer or application can be used instead. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> depict a single regulator <b>140</b> at server <b>140</b>, regulator <b>140</b> can be located anywhere and in multiple locations.

where vector c=c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, . . . c<sub>n </sub>are determined as a function of vectors a and b. For example, vector c=c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, . . . c<sub>n </sub>may be determined by dividing every element of vector a by its corresponding element in vector b. Specifically, a<sub>1 </sub>is divided by b<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2 </sub>divided by b<sub>2</sub>, and so forth. Furthermore, if after such division, any element of b is zero (0), then the element is removed from the resulting vector c. If after such division, any element of the resulting vector c is greater than (one) 1, then the greater-than-one element is set to one (1). As such, vector c is normalized to values between zero and one. Although vector c is normalized, some embodiments may not perform such normalization as part of combining vectors a and b to generate vector c.

If after the division operation, the resulting element is greater than one (1), then the greater-than-one-element is set to one (1).

where the gamma value is within an interval of zero (0) to one (1). More specifically, gamma is the average (i.e., equal to the sum of alpha and beta divided by 2) of alpha and beta. When gamma equals one (1), all conditions are appropriate for the instantiating the application (e.g., the resources available are sufficient). When gamma equals zero (0), then none of the requirements of the application are able to be satisfied. In some embodiments, a threshold T is used within the interval of zero (0) to one (1). When the value of gamma is above the threshold T, regulator <b>140</b> allows the application to be instantiated. Moreover, when gamma is less than (or equal to) the threshold value T, regulator <b>40</b> may indicate that additional computing resources are needed, e.g., another server. Although the above example describes the use of zero and one, such values are exemplary since other values may be used instead to determine whether to instantiate the application.

where w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, . . . , w<sub>n </sub>are the weights. The weights may have values within the range of zero to infinity. The weights are used to adjust the elements within one of the vectors c, q and z. For example, if element c<sub>2 </sub>of vector c represents available main memory, it can be weighted relative to the other elements of vector c. For example, w<sub>2 </sub>can be set equal to two (2), while w<sub>1 </sub>and the other elements are set to a value of (one) 1. In this example, c<sub>2 </sub>is adjusted to have twice the impact (or weight) of the other elements. When weighted, c<sub>2 </sub>will have a greater contribution to gamma, and, as such, may be considered more significant when determining whether to instantiate the application when compared to the other elements of vector c. The subsequent computations of alpha, beta and gamma would change accordingly. For example, the computation of alpha would be based on the following equation:
