<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/146,208, filed on Jan. 21, 2009, the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates in general to the field of palletizers and depalletizers. More particularly, the present invention relates to a palletizer or depalletizer for moving containers of various shapes, e.g., bottles, to or from a pallet.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Containers, e.g., bottles, are typically shipped and stored using pallets. At some point, the containers must be moved onto or removed from the pallet. In order to do so, the pallet is typically positioned near the end of a conveyor belt. In a depalletizing application, the containers are pushed off of the pallet and onto the conveyor belt as a group. In a palletizing application, the containers are pushed onto the pallet from the conveyor belt.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, these types of systems can have undesirable consequences. For example, some of the containers may be tipped over during the process, particularly if the containers are top heavy or unstable, e.g., containers that are reverse tapered and thus have a higher center of gravity or a relatively small foot area compared to the upper portions of the container. Additionally, some containers, e.g., those near the edges of the group, may shift position and fall off of the pallet or the conveyor belt during movement. Still further, the conventional manner of moving containers onto or off pallets will likely cause individual containers to knock into one another, which may damage and/or destroy the containers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed is a container moving system for efficiently moving containers relative to pallets that maintains the containers in an upright orientation and that reduces the potential for damaging, tipping and/or losing containers during movement.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">By way of summary, the present invention is directed to a palletizer or depalletizer that includes a pin matrix. A primary object of the invention is to provide a palletizer or depalletizer that can move containers, e.g., bottles, relative to a pallet while maintaining the containers upright and preventing damage to the containers. Another object of the present invention is to provide a palletizer or depalletizer that may be used with containers having a variety of shapes and sizes, so that the palletizer or depalletizer does not have to be recalibrated for each different configuration of container. A further object of the invention is to provide a palletizer or depalletizer wherein the pin matrix may be selectively used depending on the type of container to be moved. Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus that is ruggedized and reliable, thereby decreasing down time and operating costs. Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus that has one or more of the characteristics discussed above but which is relatively simple to manufacture and assemble using a minimum of equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, these objects are achieved by providing a palletizer or depalletizer having a frame and a movable pin matrix supported by the frame. The pin matrix may have any number of pins and a plate having an array of apertures, each aperture being adapted to receive a respective one of the number of pins. The palletizer or depalletizer may further include a pair of tracks that straddle a conveyor belt and extend beyond an end of the conveyor belt, wherein the pin matrix assembly is movably connected to the tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a palletizer or depalletizer is in the form of a frame having two substantially parallel tracks that are spaced apart from one another. The palletizer or depalletizer further includes a pin matrix assembly movably supported by the tracks, wherein the pin matrix assembly includes a plate having a number of apertures and a corresponding number of pins forming a pin matrix that is received by the apertures. The palletizer or depalletizer may further include a lift assembly for raising and lowering the plate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a method for unloading containers from a pallet, or loading containers onto a pallet, is accomplished using a pin matrix. The method includes the steps of moving the pin matrix relative to the pallet, lowering the pin matrix, securing the containers within the pin matrix, moving the pin matrix and the containers to a desired location, and raising the pin matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and other aspects and objects of the present invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the present invention, is given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments described in detail in the following description.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">1. System Overture</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Generally speaking, the present invention relates to a device for moving a plurality of containers while maintaining the containers in an upright orientation. The device may be used in a palletizing application for moving containers onto a pallet, or in a depalletizing application for moving containers off a pallet. The drawings and the following description illustrate the device of the present invention used in a depalletizing application for moving products off a pallet and onto a conveyor belt. It is understood, however, that the device of the present invention may also be used in a palletizing application to move or sweep the containers onto a pallet. It is also understood that the device of the present invention is not necessarily limited to moving containers onto or off of a pallet, and instead may be used in any application in which it is desired to move a group of articles from one location to another while maintaining the articles in an upright position.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, the present invention may be used to load or unload a pallet regardless of the positioning of the containers with respect to the pallet, e.g., the containers may be organized in rows or they may be randomly positioned on the surface of the pallet. Thus, the containers do not need to be pre-arranged into a certain position or pattern in order to be loaded or unloaded by the depalletizer/palletizer of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the example of the invention that will be shown and described, the depalletizer of the present invention comprises a frame and a pin matrix assembly that is supported by the frame. The frame enables the pin matrix assembly to be moved over a pallet of containers so that the containers can be secured by the pin matrix and removed from the pallet and onto the conveyor belt. The depalletizer may further include an arm assembly for further securing the containers within the pin matrix assembly and a pallet removal assembly for discarding the pallet after the containers have been removed. The depalletizer may be manually operated, or it may be electronically controlled from a remote location. Alternatively, the depalletizer may be automated using a computer and/or computer network.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">2. Detailed Description of Illustrated Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A depalletizer <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention generally comprises a frame <b>12</b> and a pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> that is supported by the frame <b>12</b>. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> includes a pin matrix <b>32</b>, and is movably attached to the frame <b>12</b> so that the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> can move laterally with respect to the frame <b>12</b>. For example, once the pin matrix <b>32</b> has engaged the containers (which are still on the pallet), the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> is moved laterally, e.g., horizontally, with respect to the frame to slide the containers off of the pallet and onto a conveyor belt <b>11</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-21</figref>. The lateral motion of the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> with respect to the frame <b>12</b> may also be along the same direction as the motion of the conveyor belt <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the frame <b>12</b> preferably has two spaced-apart frame supports <b>14</b> that are substantially parallel to one another. The frame supports <b>14</b> are positioned on either side of the conveyor belt <b>11</b> that receives the containers that are removed from the pallet by the depalletizer <b>10</b>. The frame supports <b>14</b> may also house all or a portion of the conveyor belt <b>11</b>. The size and shape of the frame supports <b>14</b> may vary, and in the illustrated embodiment the frame supports <b>14</b> are C-shaped channel members. This configuration provides a frame support <b>14</b> having an upper surface that is substantially horizontal, which makes it relatively easy to attach other components of the depalletizer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The frame <b>12</b> further includes two spaced-apart tracks <b>16</b> that support and guide the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>. The tracks <b>16</b> are supported by the frame supports <b>14</b> and extend along side a portion of the conveyor belt <b>11</b> and beyond the end of the conveyor belt <b>11</b>. In operation, a pallet is situated near the end of the conveyor belt <b>11</b> and between the tracks <b>16</b>. Preferably, the pallet is raised up from below using an elevator (not shown). The pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> then slides over the pallet, secures the containers in the pin matrix <b>32</b>, and slides the containers off of the pallet and onto the conveyor belt <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each track <b>16</b> has a groove for receiving one or more bearings <b>18</b> that are operably connected to the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Accordingly, the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> can slide smoothly along the track. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, one of the bearings <b>18</b> has its rotational axis substantially horizontal (i.e., the bearing <b>18</b> that is positioned within the C-channel of the track <b>16</b>) and the other bearing has its rotational axis substantially vertical (i.e., the bearing <b>18</b> that is adjacent the track <b>16</b> and below the horizontally oriented bearing <b>18</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The frame <b>12</b> also has guides <b>19</b> that extend along either side of the conveyor belt <b>11</b> and that are substantially parallel to tracks <b>16</b>. The guides <b>19</b> help to guide the containers as they are swept from the pallet to the conveyor belt <b>11</b>. The guides <b>19</b> further prevent containers from tipping over as the pin matrix <b>32</b> is lowered over the containers to secure them within the pin matrix <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The depalletizer <b>10</b> further includes an actuator <b>20</b> for moving the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> along the tracks <b>16</b>. The actuator <b>20</b> is operably coupled with the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> to move it along the tracks <b>16</b> as desired. The actuator <b>20</b> may be any device suitable for moving the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the actuator <b>20</b> is a motor that is coupled with a reducer <b>22</b> to provide the desirable actuation for moving the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The actuator <b>20</b> may be operably coupled with a drive assembly <b>23</b> for moving the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> along the tracks <b>16</b>. A portion of the drive assembly <b>23</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the drive assembly <b>23</b> includes a shaft <b>24</b>, belts <b>25</b> and pulleys <b>26</b> for moving the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>. See FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>-<b>15</b>. Specifically, the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> is secured to each of the belts <b>25</b> by one or more clamps <b>27</b>. Thus, the actuator <b>20</b> turns the shaft <b>24</b> which rotates the pulleys <b>26</b> and the belts <b>25</b>, which in turn pulls the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> along the tracks <b>16</b>. When the actuator <b>20</b> rotates in a first direction, the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> moves in a first direction along the tracks <b>16</b>. Conversely, when the actuator <b>20</b> rotates in the opposite direction, the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> moves in a second direction along the tracks opposite the first direction. It is also understood, however, that any other mechanism may be employed for moving the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>, e.g. a hydraulic cylinder assembly, linear actuators, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Pin Matrix Assembly</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the illustrated embodiment, the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> includes the pin matrix <b>32</b> and a plate <b>34</b> that houses the pin matrix <b>32</b>. The pin matrix <b>32</b> comprises a plurality of pins <b>33</b> that are preferably arranged in a particular manner. In the illustrated embodiment, the pins <b>33</b> are arranged into rows and columns as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Adjacent rows of pins <b>33</b> are offset from one another so as to eliminate extra space between pins <b>33</b>. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. It is understood, however, that the pins <b>33</b> may be arranged in any other pattern or configuration as desired in order to accommodate differently configured objects to be moved or swept by the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The plate <b>34</b> has a plurality of apertures <b>35</b> that correspond with and house the pins <b>33</b> to form the pin matrix <b>32</b>. The pin matrix <b>32</b> preferably has a footprint that is about the same size as the footprint of the pallet with which the depalletizer <b>10</b> is intended to be used. Thus, the pin matrix <b>32</b> will be able to secure and sweep all of the containers positioned on a given pallet. Moreover, there should be a sufficient number of pins <b>33</b> to secure the containers within the pin matrix <b>32</b>. If there are too few pins <b>33</b>, the containers may not be adequately secured and they may tip over when they are swept off of the pallet and onto the conveyor belt <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-21</figref>, the plate <b>34</b> is positioned substantially horizontally so that the pins <b>33</b> hang below the plate <b>34</b> under the force of gravity. In the illustrated embodiment, the apertures <b>35</b> are slightly larger than the pins <b>33</b> so that the pins <b>33</b> are movable with respect to the apertures <b>35</b>, i.e., the pins <b>33</b> can be raised upwardly with respect to the plate <b>34</b> when the pins <b>33</b> come into contact with a container as the plate <b>34</b> is lowered over the container.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In operation, the pin matrix <b>32</b> and the plate <b>34</b> are positioned over the containers on the pallet, e.g., by moving the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> along the tracks <b>16</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The pin matrix <b>32</b> and the plate <b>34</b> are then lowered over the containers. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. As certain pins <b>33</b> contact the containers, the containers push those pins <b>33</b> upwardly with respect to the plate <b>34</b>. Other pins <b>33</b> fall between the containers, thus securing the containers within the pin matrix <b>32</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In a bottle application, certain of the pins <b>33</b> are moved upwardly when they engage the top end of the bottle neck, and other pins <b>33</b> are moved upwardly when they engage the shoulder area of the bottle. Other pins <b>33</b> are not moved upwardly at all, and instead fall into the open areas between the bottles. Once the plate <b>34</b> has been lowered to a desirable level, e.g., one that is sufficient to secure the containers within the pin matrix <b>32</b>, the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> is moved along tracks <b>16</b> to slide the containers off of the pallet and onto the conveyor belt <b>11</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Engagement of the pins <b>33</b> with and about the containers functions to draw the containers along with the pin matrix <b>32</b> as the pin matrix <b>32</b> is moved along the tracks <b>16</b>. The pin matrix <b>32</b> and the plate <b>34</b> are then lifted upwardly above the containers, such that the pins <b>33</b> are moved upwardly out of contact with the containers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The pins <b>33</b> may be in the form of rods or cylinders. The rounded edges of the pins <b>33</b> reduce the potential of damaging the containers, e.g., glass bottles. Additionally, the pins <b>33</b> preferably have a tapered end (at the end that contacts the containers) which helps to guide the pins between containers and also may prevent damage to the containers. The pins <b>33</b> are of a sufficient weight so as to be able to secure the containers with the pin matrix <b>32</b> and slide the containers off of the pallet.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the illustrated embodiment, each pin <b>33</b> has a retainer area or head <b>36</b> that is located at the top of the pin <b>33</b>. The size and shape of the retainer area <b>36</b> may vary so long as the retainer area <b>36</b> prevents the pin from falling through the corresponding aperture <b>35</b> in the plate <b>34</b>. Where the pins <b>33</b> are cylinders, the retainer area <b>36</b> is preferably a circular disc having a diameter that is slightly larger than the diameter of both the pin <b>33</b> and the aperture <b>35</b>. However, the diameter of the retainer area <b>36</b> should be of such size that it does not interfere with adjacent pins <b>33</b> or their retainer areas <b>36</b>. The retainer area <b>36</b> may be attached to the pin <b>33</b> using any suitable means, e.g., screws, bolts, and adhesives. Alternatively, the retainer area <b>36</b> may be integral with the pin <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> also includes support members <b>38</b> and side walls <b>39</b> that support the pin matrix <b>32</b> and the plate <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are two-spaced apart support members <b>38</b> near the top of the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> that are substantially parallel to one another. The pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> also has two spaced-apart side walls <b>39</b> that are generally parallel to one another. The support members <b>38</b> and the side walls <b>39</b> are substantially perpendicular to one another so as to form a substantially rectangular footprint for housing the pin matrix <b>32</b> and plate <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The side walls <b>39</b> are substantially vertical and provide a guide for the plate <b>34</b> as it is raised and lowered. For example, one or more of the side walls <b>39</b> may have a guide, e.g., a groove, which interfaces with the plate <b>34</b>. It should be noted that alternative configurations with regard to support members may be used to support the pin matrix <b>32</b> and plate <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should further be noted that, if desired, the depalletizer <b>10</b> may be operated while the pin matrix <b>32</b> and plate <b>34</b> are in the raised position, i.e., so that the pins <b>33</b> do not contact or secure the containers for removal. Thus, where the pin matrix <b>32</b> is not needed to support or stabilize the containers, the depalletizer <b>10</b> is capable of removing containers in the traditional manner, i.e., by pushing them of the pallet and onto the conveyor belt using an arm <b>37</b> located near the back of the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Lift Assembly</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> further includes a lift assembly <b>40</b> for raising and lowering pin matrix <b>32</b> and the plate <b>34</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the lift assembly <b>40</b> includes an actuator <b>50</b>, an actuation member <b>52</b>, and a bracket <b>54</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the actuator <b>50</b> has a piston configuration that has a connecting rod <b>51</b> that is rotatably connected at one end to the actuation member <b>52</b>. The actuation member <b>52</b> is fixedly connected to the bracket <b>54</b><i>a</i>, which is in turn rotatably connected to a side wall <b>39</b> of the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>is a triangle-shaped plate, and may be in the form of an isosceles triangle. In the illustrated embodiment (where the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>is an isosceles triangle), the longest side of the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>is substantially vertical when the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> is in the lowered position. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the lowered position, the lowest corner of the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>is attached to the plate <b>34</b>. Preferably, the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>is attached to the plate using a support rod <b>55</b> that is rotatably attached to the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the plate <b>34</b> at each respective end of the support rod <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The corner of the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>opposite the longest side of the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>is a pivot corner <b>53</b>, i.e., the corner about which the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>rotates, and is rotatably attached to a side wall <b>39</b> on the outward facing side of the bracket <b>54</b><i>a</i>. On the inward facing side of the bracket <b>54</b><i>a</i>, the pivot corner <b>53</b> is fixedly connected to the actuation member <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In operation, when the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> is in the lowered position, the connecting rod <b>51</b> extends outwardly from the actuator <b>50</b> to rotate the actuation member <b>52</b> and the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>in a counter-clockwise direction about the pivot corner <b>53</b>. This in turn rotates the lowest corner (the corner attached to the plate <b>34</b>) upwardly and raises the plate <b>34</b> and the pin matrix <b>32</b>. Conversely, when the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> is in the raised position, the connecting rod <b>51</b> is retracted back into the actuator <b>50</b> to rotate the actuation member <b>52</b> and the bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>in a clockwise direction about the pivot corner <b>53</b> which lowers the plate <b>34</b> and the pin matrix <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the illustrated embodiment, the actuator <b>50</b> is rotatably connected to the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> at the end of the actuator <b>50</b> opposite the connecting rod <b>51</b>. Such a configuration allows the actuator <b>50</b> to have a desired range of motion during operation, e.g., it can rotate as the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> is raised and lowered. This in turn enables the plate <b>34</b> and pin matrix <b>32</b> to be linearly translated, e.g., vertically, as opposed to multi-directional translation, e.g., vertically and horizontally. It is desirable to eliminate horizontal movement of the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> during the raising/lowering operation because such movement can cause the containers to tip over.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The lift assembly <b>40</b> may further include a second triangle-shaped bracket <b>54</b><i>b </i>located rearward of the first bracket <b>54</b><i>a</i>. The second bracket <b>54</b><i>b </i>is the same size and shape as the first bracket <b>54</b><i>a</i>, and it is similarly rotatably connected to the side wall <b>39</b> at a pivot corner <b>53</b>. The second bracket <b>54</b><i>b </i>is connected to the plate <b>34</b> at the lowest corner (when the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> is in the lowered position). As with the first bracket <b>54</b><i>a</i>, the second bracket <b>54</b><i>b </i>is preferably connected to the plate <b>34</b> by a support rod <b>55</b> that is rotatably connected to the second bracket <b>54</b><i>b </i>and plate <b>34</b> at each respective end.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The first bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second bracket <b>54</b><i>b </i>are preferably positioned in the same substantially vertical plane with the respective pivot corners <b>53</b> aligned along a substantially horizontal line within that plane. Moreover, the axis of rotation of the first bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the axis of rotation of the second bracket <b>54</b><i>b </i>are substantially parallel to one another. The first bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second bracket <b>54</b><i>b </i>are connected to each other via a linkage <b>56</b> at their respective uppermost corners (when the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> is in the lowered position). The linkage <b>56</b> is rotatably connected to the brackets <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b </i>at each end. Thus, when the first bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>is rotated by the actuator <b>50</b>, the first bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>rotates the second bracket <b>54</b><i>b </i>via the linkage <b>56</b> which in turn raises the plate <b>34</b> and pin matrix <b>32</b>. This configuration provides further stability to the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> during the raising/lowering operation.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the illustrated embodiment, the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> has two lift assemblies <b>40</b> located on either side of the pin matrix assembly generally along each of the side walls <b>39</b>. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The two lift assemblies <b>40</b> are connected to one another by one or more connecting rods <b>42</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the first brackets <b>54</b><i>a </i>is connected via a connecting rod <b>42</b> near the respective pivot corners <b>53</b> of the brackets <b>54</b><i>a</i>. Thus, each of the first brackets <b>54</b><i>a </i>share an axis of rotation that extends through the pivot corner <b>53</b> of each of the brackets <b>54</b><i>a</i>. Additionally, the connecting rod <b>42</b> in this configuration serves as the rigid connection between the actuation member <b>52</b> and the bracket <b>54</b><i>a</i>. Thus, for each lift assembly <b>40</b>, the actuation member <b>52</b> moves the connecting rod <b>42</b> and causes the first bracket <b>54</b><i>a </i>to rotate about the pivot corner <b>53</b>. During operation, the connecting rod <b>42</b> rotates about the axis of rotation that extends through the pivot corners <b>53</b> of the first brackets <b>54</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The second brackets <b>54</b><i>b </i>of the respective lift assemblies <b>40</b> are similarly connected via a connecting rod <b>42</b> to further stabilize the pin matrix assembly and provide a smoother raising/lowering operation, e.g., by lifting the plate <b>34</b> near each of its four corners. As with the first brackets <b>54</b><i>a</i>, the second brackets <b>54</b><i>b </i>preferably share an axis of rotation that extends through the pivot corner <b>53</b> of each of the brackets <b>54</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the connecting rod <b>42</b> attached to the second brackets <b>54</b><i>b </i>rotates about the axis of rotation that extends through the pivot corners <b>53</b> of the second brackets <b>54</b><i>b. </i></p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Arm Assembly</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> preferably also includes an arm assembly <b>60</b> located near the front of the depalletizer <b>10</b> that further secures and guides the containers as they are swept from the pallet. The arm assembly <b>60</b> includes an arm <b>62</b>, an arm guide <b>63</b>, an arm actuator <b>64</b> and arm supports <b>66</b>. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The arm supports <b>66</b> are spaced apart and positioned substantially parallel to each other and to the side walls <b>39</b> of the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Each of the arm supports <b>66</b> is attached to the support members <b>38</b> (which are substantially perpendicular to the arm supports <b>66</b>) at the top of the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for each lift assembly <b>40</b>, the actuator <b>50</b> is attached to a respective arm support <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The arm <b>62</b> is pivotally attached to each of the arm supports <b>66</b>. Accordingly, the arm <b>62</b> can rotate upwardly thus raising the arm guide <b>63</b> (which is attached to one end of the arm <b>62</b>). For example, after the containers have been removed from the pallet and positioned on the conveyor belt <b>11</b>, the arm <b>62</b> and arm guide <b>63</b> are raised to allow the containers to move out from under the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> and along the conveyor belt. Conversely, the arm <b>62</b> and arm guide <b>63</b> are lowered when the containers are still on the pallet to further secure the containers within the pin matrix assembly <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The arm actuator <b>64</b> is operably coupled with the arm <b>62</b> to raise and lower the arm <b>62</b> by pivoting the arm <b>62</b> about its connections with the arm supports <b>66</b>. The actuator <b>64</b> may be any suitable device for moving the arm, but preferably the actuator <b>64</b> is a piston configuration wherein a connecting rod is extended and retracted from the actuator <b>64</b> in order to raise and lower the arm <b>62</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Pallet Removal Assembly</heading>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The depalletizer <b>10</b> of the present invention further includes a pallet removal assembly <b>80</b> located near the rear of the depalletizer <b>10</b>. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>6</b>. The pallet removal assembly <b>80</b> includes support members <b>82</b>, an actuator <b>84</b> and a pallet removal structure <b>86</b>.</p>

In the illustrated embodiment, the actuator <b>84</b> is configured to linearly move the pallet removal structure <b>86</b> along a substantially vertical axis, i.e., to lift pallet upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the pallet removal structure <b>86</b> is formed by four side members <b>87</b> and is generally rectangular in shape. There is a cross-member <b>88</b> connecting two of the side members <b>87</b>, and the cross-member <b>88</b> also passes through the center of the rectangular footprint of the pallet removal structure <b>86</b>. The actuator <b>82</b> is operably connected to the cross-member <b>88</b> near the centers of the cross member <b>88</b> and the pallet removal structure <b>86</b>. The pallet removal structure further includes gripping members <b>89</b>, which releasably secure the pallet to the pallet removal structure <b>86</b>. The gripping members <b>89</b> are positioned so that they generally align with the four corners of a rectangular-shaped pallet.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In operation, the pallet removal assembly <b>80</b> is positioned over an empty pallet. The pallet removal structure <b>86</b> is lowered by the actuator until the gripping members <b>89</b> have releasably secured the pallet to the pallet removal structure <b>86</b>. The pallet removal structure <b>86</b> is then raised up to lift the pallet. The pin matrix assembly <b>30</b> is then moved along the tracks <b>16</b> to position the pallet over a disposal conveyor, where the pallet is placed on the disposal conveyor by lowering the pallet removal structure <b>86</b> and releasing the pallet from the gripping members <b>89</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It should be noted that there are many suitable configurations for the pallet removal assembly <b>80</b>. For example, the pallet removal structure <b>86</b> does not need to be rectangular in shape. Rather, the pallet removal structure <b>86</b> may be any shape that provides suitable support for raising, lowering and moving pallets. In another example, there may be a single gripping member <b>89</b> as opposed to multiple gripping members <b>89</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Method of Removing Containers from Pallet</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In another aspect of the present invention, a method for removing containers from a pallet with a pin matrix assembly (such as the one described in detail above) includes the following steps.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Step <b>200</b> comprises positioning a pallet to be emptied near the depalletizer. Preferably, the pallet is positioned between the tracks of the depalletizer and near the end of a conveyor belt for receiving and transporting containers from the pallet. The positioning step <b>200</b> may be performed using any suitable means, but preferably is performed using an elevator. More specifically, the depalletizer and conveyor belt for receiving the containers from the pallet preferably are raised off of the ground. Accordingly, the pallet with the containers is placed on the elevator and raised up to the depalletizer and conveyor belt.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Step <b>210</b> comprises positioning the depalletizer so that the pin matrix assembly is located above the pallet of containers. Step <b>210</b> may be accomplished by sliding the pin matrix assembly along the tracks of the depalletizer. Moving the pin matrix assembly may be accomplished by any suitable means, e.g., manually or using an actuator. The pin matrix assembly may representatively be positioned using an actuator that is operably coupled to a shaft, belts and pulleys.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Step <b>220</b> comprises lowering the pin matrix assembly until the containers are secured within the pin matrix. Step <b>230</b> comprises securing the containers within the pin matrix. Step <b>220</b> may be accomplished using any suitable means, e.g., manually or using an actuator. The pin matrix assembly may be lowered using an actuator coupled with a linkage assembly, e.g., an actuation member and a bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Step <b>240</b> comprises moving the pin matrix assembly along a track (thus sliding the containers off of the pallet and onto the conveyor belt) and positioning the containers on the conveyor belt (or at another desired location). Step <b>250</b> comprises raising the pin matrix assembly and thus freeing the containers from the pin matrix. The method may further comprise the step of transporting the containers on the conveyor belt. Steps <b>210</b>-<b>250</b> may be repeated as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The method may also include the step of further securing the containers using an arm. Specifically, once the pin matrix has been lowered over the containers, the arm is lowered to further secure the containers. Alternatively, the arm could be lowered before the pin matrix is lowered. Once the containers have been swept off of the pallet and onto the conveyor belt, the arm is raised to allow the containers to move along the conveyor belt.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The method may further include the step of removing the emptied pallet. For example, the pallet may be removed using a pallet removal assembly that is attached to the depalletizer. Specifically, the pallet removal assembly (which may comprise an actuator, a pallet removal structure and grippers) is positioned over the empty pallet, e.g., by moving the pin matrix assembly along the tracks. The pallet removal structure is lowered and the grippers releasably grip the pallet. The pallet is raised up, moved, and lowered onto a conveyor belt that transports the emptied pallet away.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Although an exemplary mode contemplated by the inventors of carrying out the present invention is disclosed above, practice of the present invention is not limited thereto. It will be manifest that various additions, modifications and rearrangements of the features of the present invention may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the underlying inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Moreover, the individual components need not be formed in the disclosed shapes, or assembled in the disclosed configuration, but could be provided in virtually any shape, and assembled in virtually any configuration. Further, although the depalletizer described herein is a physically separate module, it will be manifest that the may be integrated into the apparatus, e.g., a conveyor belt, with which it is associated. Furthermore, all the disclosed features of each disclosed embodiment can be combined with, or substituted for, the disclosed features of every other disclosed embodiment except where such features are mutually exclusive.</p>
