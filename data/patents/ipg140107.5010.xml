<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to mobile machines provided with Global Position System (GPS) devices, more particularly, to a system and method of managing communication by systematically entering a GPS device into sleep mode for energy conservation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The Global Position System is a system that may be used to remotely determine the geographic location of a target or moveable entity. Typically, the system operates with a processor of a software system and a GPS receiver device. When a GPS receiver device is installed on the target entity, which may be a mobile machine, for example, the machine can then be remotely located and managed by the combination of the GPS receiver device and local cellular communication.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The GPS device may be placed &#x201c;on-board&#x201d; the machine and in the situation where the machine is a heavy machine being operated at a construction site, the GPS device receives power from its alternator or power generator during operation and, in contrast, receives power solely from the battery when the machine is powered off. However, the power from the battery will be depleted quickly if the machine engine is not operating to replenish or recharge the battery assuming the GPS device continues to consume power by engaging in communication with remote entities, for example. Hence, the ability to collect machine data via the GPS device regardless of the operational status of the machine is important and remains a challenge for these machines.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,445,341 to Hasegawa attempts to address adopting a power saving strategy to ensure GPS data collection is not disabled. Hasegawa provides a GPS receiver having a GPS antenna adapted to communicate with a satellite periodically and if the machine is not changed in location, then the GPS system is urged into standby. Hasegawa further suggests using a timer to switch the GPS system to active mode once a predetermined time period has lapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, Hasegawa uses a frequency oscillator to initiate standby which is expensive and complicated to adapt to a mobile machine. For example, it is complex to read and determine the orbit information in order to switch the GPS receiver into a standby mode. Moreover, the oscillation frequency fluctuates before connecting and after disconnecting power to the GPS receiver and this frequency fluctuation directly affects the reading of the orbit information. As a result, the accuracy of the device during such fluctuation is questionable and therefore the application of standby is inconsistent.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to provide solutions to overcome one or more of the deficiencies set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To overcome the above deficiencies, the present disclosure provides a system and a method for managing communication of a moveable entity, which enables power savings of the power source at a low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a system for managing communication of a moveable entity. The system may include a rechargeable power source and at least one sensor unit attached to the moveable entity. The system may include a global positioning device, which is powered by the power source and attached to the moveable entity. The global positioning device may be structured and arranged to track moveable entity status in response to sensor data received from at least one sensor unit. Wherein said global positioning device is configured to execute a power saving mode based on moveable entity status information.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for managing communication of a moveable entity. The method may include checking on the signal of the entity engine sensor if the movable entity is powered off. The method may also include switching the global positioning device from work mode to sleep mode. During the sleep mode, global positioning device may detect signal from other members of the entity. The method may further include determining if a predetermined event happens and communicating with a remote controller system if a predetermined event happens.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Now the invention will be described in detail with reference to the attaching drawings and in conjunction with the specific embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary disclosed system <b>100</b> including a mobile entity, for example a machine <b>60</b> which may be configured to perform an operation associated with a particular industry, such as mining, construction, farming, etc. Other examples may include, but should not be limited to, vocational machines, trucks, cranes, earth moving vehicles, mining vehicles, backhoes, material handling equipment, farming equipment, marine vessels, aircraft, and any other type of movable entity or machine. A machine may be powered by a combustion engine, an electric motor, transported by another machine or any other propulsion means known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">System <b>100</b> may include a remote entity or entities, such as controller center <b>30</b>, and a mobile communication system <b>20</b> to provide a channel for communication between the machine and the remote entity. It is known to send machine information to a remote entity and in return the remote entity may transmit instruction and command to the machine. For example, mobile communication system <b>20</b> could be a satellite system, a cellular network, or other network and operate on 2G cellular standards, such as, for example, CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), and TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access). Alternatively, or in addition, mobile communication system <b>20</b> may also operate on 2.5G and/or 3G standards, such as, for example, GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), TD-SCDMA (Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access) or WCDM (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) via one or any combination of cellular network providers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Information, perhaps in the form of an instruction, may be voice, data, or image information. In an exemplary embodiment, information to be transferred over mobile communication system <b>20</b> could be SMS (Short Message Service). Other software application platforms could also be implemented to transfer information between machine <b>60</b> and controller center <b>30</b>, such as instant communication software and all other software applications known to those having skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, controller center <b>30</b> is generally remotely located relative to machine <b>60</b> and is configured to monitor and manage machine <b>60</b> or a fleet of machines. Controller center <b>30</b> may be used as a platform to send instructions to machine <b>60</b> via mobile communication system <b>20</b>. The machine owner or business owner may require up-to-date machine status, for example, such as machine ID and machine work status.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Alternatively, controller center <b>30</b> may be a central data distribution center with responsibility to dispatch machine data to multiple management centers. In an exemplary embodiment, controller center <b>30</b> may communicate with a plurality of off-board management centers through communication platform <b>40</b>. Management center <b>50</b> may send out instructions and commands to control machine operations and may also transmit information to control machine <b>60</b>. Communication platform <b>40</b> may be a cellular network, or other network such as Bluetooth, microwave, point-to-point wireless, point-to-multipoint wireless, multipoint-to-multipoint wireless, or any other appropriate communication platform known to those having skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">System <b>100</b> includes GPS satellite <b>10</b> and a GPS receiver (not shown) mounted in machine <b>60</b> to communicate machine location information. Machine location information may be forwarded to controller center <b>30</b> and/or management center <b>50</b>. When there's a request for obtaining machine location information, GPS receiver may start a dialogue with GPS satellite <b>10</b>. Such request may be systematically transmitted at intervals such as, for example, every hour. The location information would be sent to controller center <b>30</b> when the interval had lapsed, however, information communicated in between intervals would be stored in the GPS device unless there's a command from controller center <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exemplary block diagram of GPS device <b>70</b> which may be mounted in machine <b>60</b> according to the present disclosure. GPS device <b>70</b> may be powered by a battery, which is recharged by the machine power system (not shown) during machine operation as is customary. Once machine <b>60</b> is powered off, power from the battery will continue to be consumed and eventually the communication between machine and remote entities, such as GPS satellite <b>10</b> and/or controller center <b>30</b>, would fail without the standby strategy set forth by the present disclosure. Therefore, in order to avoid losing data stored in GPS device <b>70</b>, GPS device <b>70</b> must shift to a standby or sleep mode when machine <b>60</b> shuts down.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">GPS device <b>70</b> includes position information module <b>204</b> to obtain machine location by communication with GPS satellite <b>10</b>. GPS device <b>70</b> may also include communication module <b>202</b> to transmit required machine information and/or instruction between machine <b>60</b> and controller center <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, GPS device may further include CPU <b>210</b>, memory <b>206</b> and Input/Output bus line <b>212</b> configured to communicate with other components, such as an engine through engine sensor <b>80</b>, of machine <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As part of the CPU <b>210</b> execution function, a machine location request may be made and information from position information module <b>204</b> and machine work information from engine sensor <b>80</b> via Input/Output bus <b>212</b> may be obtained. CPU <b>210</b> may also receive instruction data from communication module <b>202</b> simultaneously with such request and prompt for instruction based on machine position and/or engine sensor information. CPU <b>210</b> may also manage the storage of machine information and instruction data in a storage device, such as memory <b>206</b>. In addition, CPU <b>210</b> may also detect a signal from machine components, such as engine sensor <b>80</b>, and shut down one or more functions of GPS device <b>70</b> to conserve power and streamline data collection of actual machine condition and status. For example, CPU <b>210</b> may only shut down position information module <b>204</b>; however sustain communication between controller center <b>30</b> and machine <b>60</b> in the event machine <b>60</b> is shutdown.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an exemplary embodiment, GPS device <b>70</b> may also include a device, for example, timer <b>208</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for generating a signal to send to CPU <b>210</b> for the purpose of systematically returning the GPS device <b>70</b> to work mode. Furthermore, GPS device <b>70</b> may include a sensor to monitor machine movement, such as motion sensor <b>214</b>. Motion sensor <b>214</b> may communicate with CPU <b>210</b> through Input/Output bus <b>212</b>. Signal from motion sensor <b>214</b> may be detected by CPU <b>210</b> and activate GPS device <b>70</b> to re-initiate data collection since the machine is active.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exemplary method of a sleep mode determination <b>300</b> for GPS device <b>70</b> will now be described. When machine <b>60</b> is operating, GPS device <b>70</b> is in work mode and sleep mode is inactive. For example, in work mode position information module <b>204</b> may acquire machine position information and, per request of CPU <b>210</b>, store such information in memory <b>206</b>, and thereafter communication module <b>202</b> may communicate machine information to controller center <b>30</b>. Periodically CPU <b>210</b> may check whether machine <b>60</b> is shut down by requesting a signal be sent from engine sensor <b>80</b>. If there's no engine signal, GPS device <b>70</b> will enter sleep mode as shown in step <b>306</b>. Otherwise, GPS device will remain in work mode.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In contrast, GPS device <b>70</b> may be urged to enter sleep mode when the machine <b>60</b> is not in operation and one or more components within GPS device <b>70</b> may be shut down to conserve energy. Typically, communication module <b>202</b> and position information module <b>204</b> require a significant amount of power; therefore, CPU <b>210</b> is designed to shut down these two components when appropriate to save power. It should be apparent to those having skill in the art that other components may also be shut down to minimize power consumption, for example memory <b>206</b> may be shut down. However, if controller center <b>30</b> requires ongoing communication with machine <b>60</b>, communication module <b>202</b> will not be deactivated. Since controller center <b>30</b> communicates instruction to machine <b>60</b> over communication module <b>202</b>, such as, for example, an instruction for activating GPS device <b>70</b>, a timer may be used with the communication module <b>202</b> to shut down communication module <b>202</b> for short periods of time to conserve energy.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to specific steps according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as stated in Step <b>308</b>, CPU <b>210</b> determines whether there's a signal received, such signal may be the signal from timer <b>208</b>, engine sensor <b>80</b> or motion sensor <b>214</b>, or any other of the above-mentioned components. If there's no signal received, GPS device <b>70</b> may remain in sleep mode. If there's a signal GPS device <b>70</b> may be activated (Step <b>310</b>), the components that were shut down may be re-energized and power re-supplied. Immediately after the power is re-supplied, position information module <b>204</b> may receive real time location information from machine through GPS satellite <b>10</b> to ensure the machine has not been moved out of range. In addition, it may be prudent to urge communication module <b>204</b> to purge all machine information in queue to controller center <b>30</b>, which may have been stored in memory <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Step <b>312</b> of sleep mode determination flowchart <b>300</b> prompts for determination of whether a pre-determined event has occurred. A pre-determined event, which will be described in further detail herein below, may be, for example, a situation where the machine <b>60</b> is in transit but not detectably operating signifying that the machine may be subject to theft. If such a pre-determined event has occurred, there will be an urgent need to immediately communicate this event to controller center <b>30</b>. Otherwise, CPU <b>210</b> will return to execute Step <b>304</b>, which is to detect whether machine <b>60</b> is working, for example, by detecting whether there's a signal from engine sensor <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, further explanation for the pre-determined event determination in Step <b>312</b> will now be explained. Such pre-determined event may be a potential theft <b>401</b>, for example. If CPU <b>210</b> detects a signal from motion sensor <b>214</b>, but no contemporaneous signal from engine sensor <b>80</b>, it could be considered that machine is being transported, signifying a potential theft is happening. GPS device <b>70</b> would then report machine's location information to controller center <b>30</b> and await further instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Another predetermined event may occur when CPU <b>210</b> detects that the power storage of GPS battery has fallen to a critically low level or reached a &#x201c;pre-set percentage&#x201d; <b>402</b>, for example, such as 10% of maximum power. If the battery has reached or fallen below the pre-set percentage, then CPU <b>210</b> will require that communication module <b>202</b> immediately report the current machine information to controller center <b>30</b> in order to memorialize the available data to avoid the situation where GPS device <b>70</b> loses power and is no longer able to record machine data. Additionally, controller center <b>30</b> may send a message to machine operator so the operator can service the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Yet another pre-determined event may be triggered when a required communication <b>403</b> is initiated by controller center <b>30</b>. For example, the controller center <b>30</b> may be programmed to automatically collect machine data at a pre-set time point, for example, every two hours, rather than collecting ceaselessly, so that the electricity consumption and the communication resources of the mobile communication system <b>20</b> are saved. If GPS device <b>70</b> is activated just at the preset time point for reporting information of the machine, communication module <b>202</b> will send all the information of the machine to controller center <b>30</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although methods and systems associated with the disclosed embodiments are described in relation to machines and system, they may be applicable to any environment or situation where it may be advantageous to utilize a GPS system with a local mobile communication system to process data using an on-board GPS device to communicate to a remote controller center.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation, the GPS device <b>70</b> having communication module <b>202</b> and position information module <b>204</b> may be mounted in the machine <b>60</b> for communication between the machine <b>60</b> and a controller center <b>30</b>. During machine <b>60</b> operation, the GPS device <b>70</b> is in work mode, that is, position information module <b>204</b> may receive machine location data periodically and such machine location data could be transmitted to controller center <b>30</b> over communication module <b>202</b>. In this manner it is contemplated that the GPS device <b>70</b> would be powered by the battery (not shown) at full charge due to the alternator or power generator supplying a contemporaneous recharge to the battery. However, while machine is shutdown or powered off, the GPS device <b>70</b> receives power exclusively from the battery and therefore exhaustion of the battery is a concern if the GPS device <b>70</b> continues to collect data for an extended period during shutdown.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when shutdown of the machine <b>60</b> is detected, GPS device <b>70</b> will return to sleep mode to conserve battery power. In sleep mode, a plurality of components may be shut down, such as the position information module <b>204</b> and the communication module <b>202</b>. To reactivate the GPS device <b>70</b> a signal must be transmitted to the GPS device <b>70</b>. Such signal may be a signal from motion sensor <b>214</b>, engine sensor <b>80</b> or timer <b>208</b>. Whether a predetermined event has occurred may be determined by the GPS device <b>70</b> when it's active. If such predetermined event occurs, the GPS device <b>70</b> will communicate with the controller center <b>30</b> and wait for further instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a predetermined event may refer to a potential theft <b>401</b>, a power storage level <b>402</b>, or a required communication <b>403</b>. For example, if there's no signal from engine sensor <b>80</b> however a signal from motion sensor <b>214</b> is detected, a potential theft will be considered. GPS device <b>70</b> may report to the controller center <b>30</b>, and in order to safeguard the asset, controller center <b>30</b> may send instruction to lock or disable the machine, track its movement, or send an alert message to local authorities so the machine may be repossessed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The disclosed system and method could be applied to facilitate power savings for the battery powering the GPS device by systematically switching between sleep mode and work mode. The system and method also prevents machines from being stolen or lost which is a significant risk in emerging markets. It is envisioned that rental companies could benefit from such a system and method and operate their businesses with little additional cost by using the disclosed system and method since many of the communications may be carried out on a local cellular network.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It will be noted that the invention is mot limited to the exemplary embodiments described in detail in the above. And it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made without departing the scope or spirit of the invention.</p>
