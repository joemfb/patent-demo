<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to provide electronic products with colorful appearances, electromagnetic interference shielding, and protection from oxidation, they may be subjected to a sputter coating process. For example, an electromagnetic interference mask may be coated on a case of an electronic product to protect inner electronic components from outer electromagnetic interferences.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sputter coating is a process whereby atoms are ejected from a solid target material due to bombardment on the target by energetic particles, for example by plasma ion. Sputtered atoms ejected into the plasma gas are not in their thermodynamic equilibrium state, and tend to deposit on all surfaces in the chamber. A workpiece placed in the chamber will be coated with a thin film. However, the plasma bombardments on the workpiece may heat the workpiece and damage the film coating. In addition, movement of at least some of the plasma ions will be random, which may lead to an uneven coating film.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is desirable to provide a coating apparatus which can overcome the above-mentioned limitations.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the present disclosure will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, a coating apparatus <b>100</b>, according to a first embodiment, includes a base <b>10</b>, eleven separating boards <b>30</b>, eleven actuators <b>20</b>, and a gas guide grill <b>40</b>. The base <b>10</b> supports a workpiece <b>150</b>. The eleven separating boards <b>30</b> control movement of plasma gas. Each actuator <b>20</b> is configured for rotating a corresponding one of the separating boards <b>30</b>. The gas guide grill <b>40</b> guides the plasma gas into the spaces between the separating boards <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The base <b>10</b> is a cuboid plate including a carrying surface <b>101</b>, a bottom surface <b>102</b> opposite to the carrying surface <b>101</b>, and a side surface <b>103</b> connecting the carrying surface <b>101</b> to the bottom surface <b>102</b>. The carrying surface <b>101</b> carries the workpiece <b>150</b> to be coated. The side surface <b>103</b> is adjacent to a long side of the carrying surface <b>101</b>. The base <b>10</b> defines eleven recesses <b>12</b> on the carrying surface <b>101</b>. Each recess <b>12</b> extends along the direction of a short side of the carrying surface <b>101</b>, and is perpendicular to the long side of the carrying surface <b>101</b>. The recesses <b>12</b> are aligned along the long side of the carrying surface <b>101</b>. The recesses <b>12</b> are equidistant from each other. A cross-section of each recess <b>12</b> taken parallel to the side surface <b>103</b> has an arc shape, with an angle subtended by the arc being greater than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees for receiving and retaining a portion of the actuator <b>20</b>. The workpiece <b>150</b> to be coated may be placed between two adjacent separating boards <b>30</b>. The number and position of the workpiece <b>150</b> are not limited by this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the base <b>10</b> may further define ten cooling pipes <b>14</b> therein. Cooling liquid or gas can flow in the cooling pipes <b>14</b> to cool the workpiece <b>150</b>. Accordingly, overheating of the workpiece <b>150</b> is avoided, and quality of the film coating is increased. The cooling pipes <b>14</b> can be located under the carrying surface <b>101</b> between the adjacent separating boards <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each actuator <b>20</b> includes a motor <b>24</b> and a shaft <b>22</b>. The shafts <b>22</b> are rotatably located in the recesses <b>12</b> correspondingly. The motors <b>24</b> are located outside the base <b>10</b> and beside the side surface <b>103</b>. The actuators <b>20</b> are mainly for driving the separating boards <b>30</b> to rotate by various degrees and are not limited to this embodiment, and other configurations that can perform the rotations can be employed too.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The separating boards <b>30</b> define ten chambers <b>16</b> therebetween on the carrying surface <b>101</b>. The separating boards <b>30</b> are parallel to the corresponding shafts <b>22</b>. Each separating board <b>30</b> is securely connected to the corresponding shaft <b>22</b>. The shafts <b>22</b> are coupled to the motors <b>22</b> to obtain the driving force. Thus, the separating boards <b>30</b> can be driven to tilt toward the carrying surface <b>101</b> of the base <b>10</b> by the motors <b>24</b>. The separating boards <b>30</b> can change the flowing direction of the plasma gas as required, so a direct plasma bombardment on the workpiece <b>150</b> can be avoided. Accordingly, the workpiece <b>150</b> will not be overheated by the bombardment, and bombardment damage to the film coating is prevented. The uniformity of the coating can be further improved by adjusting the flow amount and flow rate of the plasma gas by adjusting orientations of the separating boards <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When the coating apparatus <b>100</b> is in the first state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each separating board <b>30</b> is perpendicular to the carrying surface <b>101</b>, thus each chamber <b>16</b> is a cube-shaped space. When the coating apparatus <b>100</b> is in the second state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, all the separating boards <b>30</b> are rotated to tilt in the same direction, so that each chamber <b>16</b> is a parallelepiped-shaped space. Accordingly, direct plasma bombardment on the workpiece <b>150</b> is effectively reduced. When the coating apparatus <b>100</b> is in the third state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each two adjacent separating boards <b>30</b> tilt toward different directions, and each chamber <b>16</b> is a trapezoidal-shaped space. The workpiece <b>150</b> may be placed between two adjacent separating boards <b>30</b> tilting toward the workpiece <b>150</b>, and thereby the separating boards <b>30</b> reduce the flow gas reaching the workpiece <b>150</b>. The workpiece <b>150</b> may be placed between two adjacent separating boards <b>30</b> tilting away from the workpiece <b>150</b>, and thereby the separating boards <b>30</b> increase the flow gas reaching the workpiece <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The gas guide grill <b>40</b> is located above the base <b>10</b>. The gas guide grill <b>40</b> defines ten gas guide holes <b>42</b> corresponding to the ten chambers <b>16</b> respectively. The gas guide grill <b>40</b> guides the plasma gas through the gas guide holes <b>42</b> into the chambers <b>16</b>, so the workpiece <b>150</b> placed therein can be coated.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The base <b>10</b>, the chambers <b>16</b>, and the separating board <b>30</b> can have other configurations in other embodiments. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, the coating apparatus <b>200</b> is similar to the coating apparatus <b>100</b>, except that the base <b>210</b> and the gas guide grill <b>240</b> have substantially cylindrical configurations. The base <b>210</b> is substantially a cylindrical plate including a circular carrying surface <b>201</b> and a cylindrical setting <b>211</b> located at the center of the circular carrying surface <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cylindrical setting <b>211</b> is substantially a protruding cylinder including a through hole <b>205</b> at the center. The through hole <b>205</b> extends through the base <b>210</b>, and thus communicates the circular carrying surface <b>201</b> with the bottom surface <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The recesses <b>212</b> surround the cylindrical setting <b>211</b>, and are arranged in the radial directions of the base <b>210</b>. The recesses <b>212</b> are equidistant from each other in the circumferential directions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A cross-section of each recess <b>212</b> taken parallel to the side surface <b>203</b> has an arc shape, with an angle subtended by the arc being greater than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees for receiving and retaining a portion of the shaft <b>224</b>. The recesses <b>212</b> may extend into the cylindrical setting <b>211</b> in other embodiments. When the recesses <b>212</b> extend into the cylindrical setting <b>211</b>, the cross-section of each recess <b>212</b> in the cylindrical setting <b>211</b> is circular, and the shafts <b>224</b> can be held in place by the circular areas in the cylindrical setting <b>211</b>. In such a case, portions of the recesses <b>212</b> outside the cylindrical setting <b>211</b> may form arcs subtending angles less than 180 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The actuators <b>220</b> including motors <b>222</b> and shafts <b>224</b> are accordingly arranged in a radial configuration on the base <b>210</b>. The shafts <b>224</b> are rotatably located in the recesses <b>212</b>. The motors <b>222</b> are located outside the base <b>210</b> and beside the side surface <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Ten separating boards <b>230</b> define ten chambers <b>216</b> therebetween above the carrying surface <b>201</b>, and accordingly each chamber <b>216</b> includes an arc-shaped space. Each separating board <b>230</b> is securely connected to the corresponding shaft <b>224</b>, and thus the separating boards <b>230</b> are arranged in the radial configuration. The separating boards <b>230</b> can be driven to tilt toward the carrying surface <b>201</b> of the base <b>210</b> by the motors <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The gas guide grill <b>240</b> is substantially a cylinder located above the base <b>210</b>, and includes ten gas guide holes <b>242</b> corresponding to the ten chambers <b>216</b>. The gas guide holes <b>242</b> are equidistant from each other in the circumferential directions of the gas guide grill <b>240</b>. In this embodiment, the gas guide grill <b>240</b> further includes a location pole <b>244</b> fitting for the through hole <b>205</b> of the cylindrical setting <b>211</b>. The location pole <b>244</b> is longer than the through hole <b>205</b>, so the gas guide grill <b>240</b> can be engaged with the base <b>210</b> through the location pole <b>244</b> and the through hole <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the location pole <b>244</b> includes a transition portion <b>2441</b> and a matching portion <b>2442</b> in this embodiment. The transition portion <b>2441</b> connects the matching portion <b>2442</b> to the main cylindrical plate defining the gas guide holes <b>242</b>. The diameter of the transition portion <b>2441</b> may be less than the diameter of the matching portion <b>2442</b>. The matching portion <b>2442</b> matches in size and shape the through hole <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The base <b>210</b> may further define ten cooling pipes <b>214</b>. The cooling pipes <b>214</b> are arranged in the circumferential directions of the base <b>210</b>, surrounds the setting <b>211</b>, and are located corresponding to the ten chambers <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the coating apparatus <b>300</b> is similar to the coating apparatus <b>200</b>, except that the cylindrical setting <b>311</b> of the coating apparatus <b>300</b> defines a cavity <b>304</b>, and a valve <b>306</b> under the cavity <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cavity <b>304</b> is distant from the bottom surface <b>302</b> of the base <b>310</b>. The cavity <b>304</b> includes a cylinder portion <b>3042</b> and a contraction portion <b>3041</b>. The cylinder portion <b>3042</b> is wider than the contraction portion <b>3041</b>. The contraction portion <b>3041</b> is located on the top of the cylindrical setting <b>311</b>. The valve <b>306</b> is located in the bottom surface <b>302</b> of the base <b>310</b> to control flow of liquid or gas between the cylinder portion <b>3042</b> and an external device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The gas guide grill <b>340</b> includes a piston <b>342</b> extending into the cavity <b>304</b>. The piston <b>342</b> includes a piston rod <b>3421</b> and a piston cap <b>3422</b> fitting tightly on the head of the piston rod <b>3421</b>. The diameter of the piston rod <b>3421</b> is substantially equal to the diameter of the contraction portion <b>3041</b>, and the outer diameter of the piston cap <b>3422</b> is substantially equal to the diameter of the cylinder portion <b>3042</b>, so the piston cap <b>3422</b> can press against the inner surface of the cylinder portion <b>3042</b> to form a seal between the piston cap <b>3422</b> and the cylinder portion <b>3042</b>. The piston cap <b>3422</b> can prevent the piston <b>342</b> escaping from the cylindrical setting <b>311</b>, and prevents leakage of inner fluid through the contraction portion <b>3041</b>. The piston <b>342</b> may further include a rubber ring covering the outer surface of the piston cap <b>3422</b> and a lubricant on the inner surface of the cylinder portion <b>3042</b>, so the wear-resistance and tightness between the piston cap <b>3422</b> and the cylinder portion <b>3042</b> are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In operation, fluid can be forced to flow in or out the cylinder portion <b>3042</b> through the valve <b>306</b>, by, for example, pressure developed by the external device. The introduction of fluid increases the fluid pressure under the piston <b>342</b>, and pushes the piston <b>342</b> and the gas guide grill <b>340</b> up and away from the carrying surface <b>301</b>. The extraction of fluid decreases the fluid pressure under the piston <b>342</b>, and pulls the piston <b>342</b> and the gas guide grill <b>340</b> down toward the carrying surface <b>301</b>. Accordingly, a distance between the carrying surface <b>301</b> of the base <b>310</b> and the gas guide grill <b>340</b> can be adjusted. A distance for the plasma gas from the gas guide grill <b>340</b> to the workpiece <b>150</b> and a concentration of the plasma gas reaching the workpiece <b>150</b> can also be adjusted. Thus, the thickness and the uniformity of the film coating can be controlled as required.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The configurations of the bases and the gas guide grills of the coating apparatuses are not limited by the above embodiments but can be redesigned depending on requirements. For example, the bases and the gas guide grills may be substantially cuboid, triangular prism-shaped, elliptical columnar, or cylindrical.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Compared to the prior art, the coating apparatus of the present disclosure includes separating boards that define chambers therebetween above the carrying surface, and a gas guide grill corresponding to the chambers, actuators that drive the rotation of the separating boards. Accordingly, the coating apparatus can control the flowing paths of the plasma gas by the separating boards and the gas guide grill. A direct plasma ion bombardment on the workpiece can be prevented, and overheat of the workpiece is avoided. As a result, stability of the coating process, the coating uniformity and coating quality are improved.</p>
