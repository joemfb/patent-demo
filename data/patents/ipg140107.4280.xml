<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A non-volatile memory system includes one or more non-volatile memory cells. Each non-volatile memory cell provides a floating gate, a coupling device, a first floating gate transistor, and a second floating gate transistor. The coupling device is located in a first conductivity region. The first floating gate transistor is located in a second conductivity region, and supplies read current sensed during a read operation. The second floating gate transistor is located in a third conductivity region. Such non-volatile memory cell further provides two transistors for injecting negative charge into the floating gate during a programming operation, and removing negative charge from the second floating gate transistor during an erase operation. The floating gate is shared by the first floating gate transistor, the coupling device, and the second floating gate transistor, and extends over active regions of the first floating gate transistor, the coupling device and the second floating gate transistor.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to multiple time programming (MTP) memory cells, and more particularly, to a logic-based MTP memory cell compatible with generic complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As diverse types of circuit blocks are integrated into single integrated circuits (ICs), it becomes desirous to integrate non-volatile memory blocks with logic function blocks. However, many non-volatile memory processes require stacked gate structures, which are not available in conventional logic gate fabrication processes, e.g. semiconductor processes using only one polysilicon layer and no special charge-trapping structures.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,382,658 (hereinafter '658), 7,391,647 (hereinafter '647), 7,263,001 (hereinafter '001), 7,423,903 (hereinafter '903), 7,209,392 (hereinafter '392) teach various architectures for forming memory cells. '658 teaches one p-type access transistor sharing its floating gate with one n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (n-MOSC). '647 teaches one p-type access transistor with one p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (p-MOSC) and one n-MOSC. '001 teaches one p-type access transistor sharing a floating gate with two p-MOSCs. '903 teaches a p-type field effect transistor (P-FET) for programming through channel hot electron (CHE) injection, and an n-type field effect transistor (N-FET) for erasing through Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling. '392 teaches one n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (n-MOSFET) sharing its floating gate with one p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (p-MOSFET), each transistor coupled to its own access transistor.</p>

The first PMOS transistor T<sub>1 </sub>and the first NMOS transistor T<sub>3 </sub>are access transistors for the second PMOS transistor T<sub>2 </sub>and the second NMOS transistor T<sub>4</sub>, respectively, and are controlled by a control voltage V<sub>SG</sub>. Input terminals of the first PMOS transistor T<sub>1 </sub>and the first NMOS transistor T<sub>3 </sub>receive a select line voltage V<sub>SL</sub>, and input terminals of the second PMOS transistor T<sub>2 </sub>and the second NMOS transistor T<sub>4 </sub>receive a first bit line voltage V<sub>BL1 </sub>and a second bit line voltage V<sub>BL2</sub>, respectively. The second NMOS transistor T<sub>4 </sub>and the second PMOS transistor T<sub>2 </sub>share a floating gate.</p>
