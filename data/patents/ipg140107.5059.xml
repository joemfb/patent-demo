<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject matter described herein relates to policy provisioning. More specifically, the subject matter relates to methods, systems, and computer readable media for selective PE for high-usage roamers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Traditionally, control of quality of service (QoS) within telecommunications networks has been achieved using a combination of best-effort data delivery, network resources reservation, or data packet marking on data communication paths. However, the design of emerging next generation network (NGN) architectures (e.g., Internet protocol (IP) multimedia subsystem (IMS) and long term evolution (LTE)) will render this approach no longer viable. One feature of network topology within the various NGNs is that the signaling required to negotiate a data transfer (e.g., application signaling) may not travel on the same logical path as the actual data transfer itself (e.g., data traffic). Therefore, a policy entity is needed to link the application signaling on the service plane to data traffic on the transport plane in order to allow applications to request QoS to be performed on the traffic plane.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example of such a policy entity is a policy and charging rules function (PCRF). The PCRF, or policy server, generally is a policy decision point that may be centrally located in the network and may communicate with access edge devices (e.g., policy enforcement points), applications, and operational support systems/business support systems (OSS/BSS) platforms to manage subscriber and network information according to policy rules. These policy rules may be used to define how broadband network resources should be allocated to subscribers and applications and under what conditions. Policy rules may encompass the business and technological rules that govern which network services a subscriber can access, at what bandwidth level, when, and for how long. The PCRF may identify appropriate policy rules by querying a subscription profile repository (SPR) for relevant policy information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some policy and charging control (PCC) architectures retrieve policy rules associated with a roaming subscriber from the PCRF in the roaming subscriber's home network. The policy rules may be applied in the visited network such that the roaming subscriber receives a similar experience or quality of service (QoS) as when using the roaming subscriber's home network. One drawback or issue with these architectures is that a visited network typically may not dictate policy or QoS attributes for a roaming subscriber. Another drawback is that the visited network may not fully utilize marketing opportunities to potential subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a need exists for methods, systems, and computer readable media for selective policy enhancement (PE) for high-usage roamers.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The subject matter described herein includes methods, systems, and computer readable media for selective policy enhancement (PE). According to one aspect, the present subject matter described herein allows a network operator or service provider to identify a subscriber that has roamed into its network and to temporarily &#x201c;boost&#x201d; or enhance one or more policy or QoS attributes that are provided to the roaming subscriber via the network operator's policy and charging enforcement function (PCEF). For example, a network element (e.g., a Diameter signaling agent (DRA), a Diameter signaling router (DSR), a policy and charging rule function (PCRF), or a resource admissions control subsystem (RACS)) may monitor and log, over time, usage information about roaming subscribers. Using this collected information, the operator may strategically target and entice certain roaming subscribers (e.g., high-usage roamers) to switch service providers by temporarily providing the roaming subscriber with &#x201c;boosted&#x201d; or enhanced policy or QoS attributes within the operator's network.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, the network element, the network operator, or an associated entity may notify the roaming subscriber of the temporarily enhanced service, such as for marketing purposes. For example, after enhancing a roaming subscriber's service, a message indicating the change and including an offer for switching to the providing operator's service may be sent to the subscriber. Notification messages may be provided in various forms, such as a short message service (SMS) message, a multimedia message service (MMS) message, an instant message (IM) message, an email message, an extensible markup language (XML) message, a simple object access protocol (SOAP) message, a Diameter protocol message, a session initiation protocol (SIP) message, an Internet protocol (IP) message, or a voice message.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the subject matter described herein, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a network diagram showing an exemplary network for selective PE according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary communications network <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, network <b>100</b> may include user equipment (UE) <b>102</b>, an access node (AN) <b>104</b> (e.g., a base transceiver station (BTS) or evolved node b (e node b)), a visited network <b>106</b>, a home network <b>116</b>, and Internet <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">UE <b>102</b> represents a device, such as a mobile handset, for communicating with one or more portions of network <b>100</b>. For example, UEs may include a computer, a pager, a smartphone, a phone, a wireless modem, a hotspot, a computing platform, a mobile handset, and other subscriber devices.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">UE <b>102</b> may be associated with a home network <b>116</b>. For example, a user of UE <b>102</b> may be a subscriber of home network <b>116</b> or a related service provider. Home network <b>116</b> may be a network for providing various services for UE <b>102</b>. For example, home network <b>116</b> may perform network aggregation, charging, and authentication functions for UE <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, home network <b>116</b> may be at least one of a 3G network, a 3G+ network, a GSM network, a 4G network, an LTE network, an EPC network, a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network, a GPRS core network, or other network. Home network <b>116</b> may include a PCRF <b>120</b>. PCRF <b>120</b> may determine and/or provide policy and charging control (PCC) rules for UE <b>102</b>. For example, in a roaming scenario, PCRF <b>120</b> may communicate policy information for one of its subscribers to foreign nodes in other networks (e.g., a visited network <b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While roaming, UE <b>102</b> may communicate with access node <b>104</b> associated with visited network <b>106</b>. Access node <b>104</b> may be located within an access network (not shown). An access network may include nodes, functions, devices, and/or components for providing a UE <b>102</b> access to services, functions, or devices in one or more networks (e.g., visited network <b>106</b>). For example, an access network may include a radio access network (RAN) or other access network, such as a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) RAN (GRAN), a GSM enhanced data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE) RAN (GERAN), a general packet radio service (GPRS) access network, a universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) RAN (UTRAN), an evolved UTRAN (eUTRAN), an Internet protocol (IP) connectivity access network (IP CAN), a code division multiple access (CDMA) network, an Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO), a wideband CDMA (WCDMA) network, a High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) network, or an evolved HSPA (eHSPA+) network.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Access node <b>104</b> may perform radio access functions for connecting UE <b>102</b> with various communications networks and/or nodes. Access node <b>104</b> may communicate with visited network <b>106</b> using gateway functionality. For example, access node <b>104</b> or other node (e.g., a gateway) may communicate messages (e.g., authentication or mobility related messages) to one or more nodes within the visited network <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Visited network <b>106</b> may be a network for providing services UE <b>102</b>. For example, visited network <b>106</b> may perform network aggregation, charging, and authentication functions for UE <b>102</b> in association with home network <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, visited network <b>106</b> may be at least one of a 3G network, a 3G+ network, a GSM network, a 4G network, an LTE network, an EPC network, a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network, a GPRS core network, or other network.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Visited network <b>106</b> may include a PCEF <b>108</b> and a PCRF <b>110</b>. Visited network <b>106</b> may also include other nodes, such as a DRA/DSR <b>112</b>, a policy database <b>114</b>, a mobility management entity (MME), a home subscriber server (HSS), an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server, and a bearer binding and event reporting function (BBERF).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">PCEF <b>108</b> may be any suitable entity for generating and/or enforcing policies (e.g., one or more policy rules). For example, PCEF <b>108</b> may include functionality located at a gateway (e.g., a packet data network (PDN) gateway) or other node for communicating between networks, e.g., Internet <b>118</b>. In one embodiment, PCEF <b>108</b> manages and enforces policy and charging control (PCC) rules provided by PCRF <b>110</b>. For example, rules may be provided for each session data flow (SDF) and/or UE <b>102</b> attempting to use PCEF <b>108</b>. In this example, PCEF <b>108</b> may control access to external networks and charge for such access based on rules received from PCRF <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, PCEF <b>108</b> may include or be integrated with a gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) for communicating between a GPRS network and external networks, e.g., Internet <b>118</b>. For example, in an embodiment where visited network <b>106</b> includes a GPRS core network, PCEF <b>108</b> may include a GGSN. PCEF <b>108</b> may communicate with serving GPRS support node (SGSN) or other gateway for providing services to UE <b>102</b>. For example, PCEF <b>108</b> may request and receive PCC rules from PCRF <b>110</b>. Using the PCC rules, PCEF <b>108</b> may control access to external networks and charge for such access based on the PCC rules. For example, for an SDF (e.g., one or more related packets) that is under policy control, PCEF <b>108</b> may allow the SDF to pass through the node if the corresponding gate is open (e.g., as determined by one or more relevant PCC rules). For an SDF that is under charging control, PCEF <b>108</b> may allow the SDF to pass through the node if there is a corresponding active PCC rule and, for online charging, the OCS has authorized the applicable credit with that charging key. PCEF <b>108</b> may let an SDF pass through the gateway during the course of the credit re-authorization procedure. If requested by PCRF <b>110</b>, PCEF <b>108</b> may report to PCRF <b>110</b> when the status of the related SDF changes, which can be used to monitor an IP-CAN bearer path dedicated for AF signaling traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">PCEF <b>108</b> may also include a BBERF. The BBERF may be any suitable entity for performing bearer binding and/or event reporting. In one embodiment, the BBERF may control user plane traffic. For example, the BBERF may ensure that an SDF is carried over a bearer path with an appropriate quality of service and may perform resource reservation. The BBERF may also provide event reporting to one or more nodes in network <b>100</b>. For example, the BBERF may inform PCRF <b>110</b> of various network or bearer-related events, e.g., based on event triggers installed or requested by PCRF <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may be any suitable entity for routing or relaying Diameter signaling messages routing between Diameter nodes. For example, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may be an LTE signaling router, an LTE Diameter signaling router, a Diameter signaling agent, a Diameter proxy, a Diameter routing agent, or a Diameter redirect agent.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may communicate with PCEF <b>108</b>, PCRF <b>110</b>, policy database <b>114</b>, and/or other nodes via one or more signaling interfaces. For example, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may exchange or communicate messages between PCEF <b>108</b> and PCRF <b>110</b> via one or more LTE Gx interfaces. In a second example, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may exchange or communicate messages via an HTTP interface, an XML interface, or another interface.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">PCRF <b>110</b> may be any suitable entity for creating, selecting, or otherwise determining policies (e.g., one or more PCC rules). For example, PCRF <b>110</b> may be a stand-alone node, e.g., a policy server or a multimedia policy engine (MPE), or may be co-located or integrated with one or more nodes in network <b>100</b>, e.g., a DRA/DSR. PCRF <b>110</b> may inform PCEF <b>108</b>, through the use of PCC rules, on the treatment of each SDF that is under PCC control, in accordance with policy decisions. In performing policy decisions, PCRF <b>110</b> may communicate with one or more nodes in network <b>100</b> for gathering subscription related information. For example, PCRF <b>110</b> may communicate with SPRs to retrieve policy information. In another example, PCRF <b>110</b> may communicate with a network management system (NMS), e.g., via a simple network management protocol (SNMP) interface. In this example, PCRF <b>110</b> may poll or otherwise query the NMS or a related database to receive information, e.g., regarding the state of one or more devices in an access network, core network, or other network.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">PCRF <b>110</b> may communicate with PCRF <b>120</b> for determining PCC rules for communications associated with a roaming subscriber. For example, PCRF <b>110</b> may request policy information from PCRF <b>120</b> via one or more interfaces, such as an S9 interface, an extensible markup language (XML) interface, etc. In another example, PCRF <b>120</b> may send policy information (e.g., via a re-authorization request (RAR) message) to PCRF <b>110</b> dynamically or in response to triggers.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Subscription related information may be used (e.g., by PCRF <b>110</b> or PCRF <b>120</b>) in generating PCC rules. PCC rules typically include information for managing user plane traffic (e.g., data packets). For example, a PCC rule may include a rule name, service identifier, SDF filter(s), precedence information, gate status, QoS parameters, charging key (i.e., rating group), other charging parameters, and/or monitoring key. The rule name or PCC rule identifier may be used to reference a PCC rule in the communication between the PCEF and the PCRF and may be unique for each PCC rule used during an IP-CAN session. The service identifier may be used to identify the service or the service component to which the SDF relates. The SDF filter(s) may be used to select the traffic for which the rule applies.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, an SDF filter make take the form of an IP five-tuple specifying: (1) source IP address(es), (2) destination IP address(es), (3) source port number(s), (4) destination port number(s), and (5) application protocol(s) (e.g., transmission control protocol (TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP)). In this example, packets containing information matching the IP five-tuple may be considered part of the SDF for which the corresponding PCC rule is to be applied. In another example, an SDF filter may be based on fewer, different, and/or additional criteria. For instance, UE <b>102</b> or another node in network <b>100</b> may assign an SDF identifier (e.g., a value) to packets in a custom parameter field. In this instance, an SDF filter in a PCC rule may use this parameter for determining traffic for which the rule applies.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">PCC policy decisions may be based on one or more of the following: information obtained from an AF via the Rx interface (e.g., session, media, and subscriber related information), information obtained from PCEF <b>108</b> (e.g., Internet Protocol Connectivity Access Network (IP-CAN) bearer attributes, request type, device information, and subscriber related information), information obtained from SPR (e.g., subscriber and service related data), information obtained from nodes in other networks (e.g., PCRF <b>120</b> via an S9 interface), and pre-configured information. If the information from PCEF <b>108</b> contains traffic mapping information not matching any SDF filter known to PCRF <b>110</b>, and PCRF <b>110</b> allows the UE to request enhanced QoS for services not known to PCRF <b>110</b>, PCRF <b>110</b> may add the traffic mapping information as SDF filters to the corresponding authorized PCC rule. PCRF <b>110</b> may wildcard missing filter parameters, e.g., missing uplink TFT address and port information in case of GPRS. For example, a blank or &#x201c;wildcard&#x201d; filter (e.g., port number=&#x201c;*&#x2019;) may consider any value (including an empty or zero value) as matching the filter criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Policy database <b>114</b> may represent a suitable entity for storing or maintaining subscription related information, such as subscription profiles, policy information, and/or PCC rules. For example, policy database <b>114</b> may include an SPR, an HSS, an AAA, or other node. Policy database <b>114</b> may store policy information for use by PCRF <b>110</b> in making policy decisions. In one embodiment, a subscription profile may include authorization information, charging information, subscription information (e.g., access or service tiers), and quality of service (QoS) information associated with a subscriber, session, device, and/or an SDF. For example, a subscription profile may include information on a subscriber's permitted services, service pre-emption priorities, allowed QoS, and charging related data information for different types of SDFs.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Policy database <b>114</b> may maintain information about roaming subscribers. For example, policy database <b>114</b> may store information associated with subscriber usage information, e.g., hours of use per month, amount of data consumed, types of data consumed, and roaming frequency. Policy database <b>114</b> may also store information associated with PE, such as triggers or enhancement criteria, enhancement offers (e.g., policy attributes and percentage increased or decreased during enhancement), history of enhancements, and duration of enhancements. The stored information may be used to determine whether a roaming subscriber should be provided PE. Additional information regarding exemplary data that may be stored at or in policy database <b>114</b> is discussed below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Policy database <b>114</b> may communicate with or be accessed by PCRF <b>110</b> and various other nodes, e.g., a HSS, an AAA, an MME, an application function (AF) and or DRA/DSR <b>112</b>. Policy database <b>114</b> may be located external to or distinct from PCRF <b>110</b> or may be co-located or integrated with PCRF <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, network <b>100</b> may include multiple policy databases. For example, some policy databases may be located in various locations (e.g., networks) distinct from PCRF <b>110</b> and another policy database may be co-located or integrated with PCRF <b>110</b> or another node in network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It will be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is for illustrative purposes and that various nodes, their locations, and/or their functions may be changed, altered, added, or removed. For example, some nodes and/or functions may be combined into a single entity, e.g., policy database <b>114</b> and PCRF <b>110</b> may be included in an MPE. In a second example, a node and/or function may be located at or implemented by two or more nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is block diagram illustrating an exemplary PE node <b>200</b> for selective PE according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. PE node <b>200</b> may be a stand-alone node or may be integrated with additional functionality or another node. For example, PE node <b>200</b> may be integrated with or include PCRF <b>110</b>, DRA/DSR <b>112</b>, or an AF.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, PE node <b>200</b> may include one or more communications interfaces <b>202</b> for communicating messages (e.g., via a Gx interface, Gxx interface, Sp interface, an extensible markup language (XML) interface, a SIP interface, a SOAP interface, or a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) interface or others). For example, where PE node <b>200</b> includes PCRF <b>110</b>, a credit control request (CCR) message may be received via a Gx interface from PCEF <b>108</b>. PE node <b>200</b> may modify the CCR message and provide it towards PCRF <b>120</b> via a Gx, Sp, or other interface. In another example, PE node <b>200</b> may receive a policy request message via an HTTP or SIP interface from an IMS node. In yet another example, PE node <b>200</b> may include one or more interfaces (e.g., Sp, SOAP, or HTTP) for communicating with policy database <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">PE node <b>200</b> may include a PE module <b>204</b> for modifying policy information. For example, PE module <b>204</b> may inspect a received Gx message, or portion thereof, (e.g., a CCR message from PCEF <b>108</b>) for subscriber identifying information. PE module <b>204</b> may use subscriber identifying information (e.g., an SDF identifier and/or an international mobile subscriber identifier (MI)) and/or other information for determining whether the subscriber is a roaming subscriber. For example, PE module <b>204</b> may request and receive usage statistics and other information associated with the subscriber identifying information from policy database <b>114</b>. Using the received information, PE module <b>204</b> may determine that the subscriber is a roaming subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an alternate embodiment, PE module <b>204</b> may receive and/or process only messages associated with roaming subscribers. For example, PCRF <b>110</b>, DRA/DSR <b>112</b>, or PCEF <b>108</b> may query an HSS or AAA for determining whether a message is associated with a roaming subscriber. If the message is determined to be associated with a roaming subscriber, the message may be sent to PE module <b>204</b> for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As stated above, PE module <b>204</b> may receive information associated with a roaming subscriber from policy database <b>114</b>. PE module <b>204</b> may also receive PE data from policy database <b>114</b>. PE data may include various information about relevant PE offers, such as enhancement criteria, attributes to be enhanced, amount of enhancement, and duration of enhancement. Using this information and/or other data (e.g., network conditions, user device location, and/or temporal information), PE module <b>204</b> may determine that PE should be performed. For example, after analyzing usage statistics retrieved from policy database <b>114</b>, PE module <b>204</b> may identify the subscriber as a high-usage, frequent roamer, e.g., a smartphone or tablet user that consumes a large amount of data per month in visited network <b>106</b>. Such usage statistics may indicate, based on one or more enhancement triggers associated with an enhancement offer, that PE should be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It will be appreciated that PE may be offered for various reasons, including marketing, experimental, educational, and/or other reasons. As such, enhancement offers may be triggered based on various factors, such as type of user device, day of week, time of day, user device location (e.g., a marketing partner's fast food restaurant or a school), roaming frequency, a network condition, an access network, SDF identifier, and/or other criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">After determining that PE should be performed, PE module <b>204</b> may initiate modifying policy information. For example, PE module <b>204</b> may receive a policy request message and set a trigger such that a corresponding answer message (e.g., from PCRF <b>110</b> or PCRF <b>120</b>) having policy information is detected and modified. For example, PE module may increase one or more policy or QoS attributes, such as a QoS class and a guaranteed download bitrate, associated with the roaming subscriber. PE module <b>204</b> or another entity (e.g., communications interface <b>202</b>) may provide or initiate providing the modified policy information (e.g., as PCC rules) to PCEF <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, modification of policy information may be for enticing potential subscribers to switch service providers by enhancing service and/or experience of the roaming subscriber via visited network <b>106</b>. For example, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may increase a guaranteed minimum download bitrate or QoS class associated with a roaming subscriber before sending the modified policy information to PCEF <b>108</b>. PCEF <b>108</b> may receive, apply, and/or enforce the modified policy information (e.g., PCC rules). In response, the roaming subscriber may experience a better service via visited network <b>108</b> vs. home network <b>116</b>. Hence, the roaming subscriber may be persuaded or enticed to switch providers based on the temporary PE.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">PE module <b>204</b> or another entity (e.g., communications interface <b>202</b>) may notify a roaming subscriber about PE. For example, concurrently, prior to, or after providing a modified policy to PCEF <b>108</b>, a message may be sent to the roaming subscriber indicating that enhanced data service is being provided courtesy of a providing network and/or a related marketing partner. The message may also include links, contact information, and other data for marketing purposes. Exemplary notification messages may include an SMS message, an MMS message, an IM message, an email message, an XML message, a SOAP message, a Diameter protocol message, a SIP message, an IP message, or a voice message.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, a roaming subscriber may be required to approve and/or accept PE and/or marketing offers before an enhanced or modified policy is enforced. For example, an SMS message may indicate that a roaming subscriber is eligible for enhanced data service courtesy of a providing network (e.g., Verizon Wireless or AT&#x26;T) and may receive this enhanced service if the user accepts by responding to the eligibility message with a valid email address so as to receive current promotional information.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a message flow diagram illustrating modifying policy information in a CCA message according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. In this embodiment, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may be PE node <b>200</b> having PE module <b>204</b>. DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may also access policy database <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">PCEF <b>108</b> may establish a session for roaming subscriber ID &#x2018;X&#x2019; through an IP Connectivity Access Network (e.g., a WLAN). IP-CAN is a collection of network entities and interfaces that provides IP transport connectivity between UEs and core network entities. In one exemplary IP-CAN session establishment scenario, PCEF <b>108</b> may receive an IP-CAN session creation request. The IP-CAN session creation request may be a GTP message or a trigger message. PCEF <b>108</b> may initiate a PULL procedure (e.g., policy provisioning that is solicited by PCEF <b>108</b>) for applying relevant PCC rules associated with the roaming subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In step <b>300</b>, PCEF <b>108</b> (e.g., PDN gateway or GGSN) may send a policy request message towards PCRF <b>110</b> (e.g., a policy server). For example, the policy request message may be a CCR message communicated via a Ox interface for requesting policies to be applied to the IP-CAN session. The policy request message may be for requesting PCC rules associated with a roaming subscriber and may include a subscriber identifier (ID), a hop-by-hop ID (for identifying the last hop or node), and SDF information, e.g., an SDF identifier. In an alternate embodiment, a policy request message may be sent to PCRF <b>110</b> via another interface, such as a SIP, a SOAP, or an HTTP interface.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In step <b>302</b>, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may intercept and/or receive the policy request message. DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may determine, using information in the message and/or other information, that the policy request message is associated with a foreign or roaming subscriber. For example, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may query an HSS or AAA using a subscriber ID from the message or other subscriber identifying information. The HSS or AAA may respond by indicating that the subscriber ID is associated with a roaming subscriber. DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may also query policy database <b>114</b> for information about the roaming subscriber. Using this information, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may determine that PE is to be performed. DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may set a trigger (e.g., using Hop-by-Hop ID value 2) or use another mechanism for detecting and modifying policy information in an associated answer message (e.g., a CCR message).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In step <b>304</b>, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may send the policy request message or similar message to PCRF <b>110</b>. The policy request message may include a different hop-by-hop ID (e.g., a hop-by-hop ID associated with DRA/DSR <b>112</b>). PCRF <b>110</b> may receive the message and, using information from that message and/or other information, may request and receive policy information from PCRF <b>120</b> and/or another node in home network <b>116</b>. For example, PCRF <b>110</b> may communicate with PCRF <b>120</b> via an S9 interface. After receiving policy information from home network <b>116</b>, PCRF <b>110</b> may generate an associated response or answer message (e.g., a CCR message). The answer message may include policy information (e.g., PCC rules) based, at least in part, on information received from PCRF <b>120</b>. For example, a CCR message may include charging rules (e.g., rules for billing a subscriber) and policy or QoS attributes, such as a QoS class identifier, a guaranteed download bitrate amount, and/or other service affecting information.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In step <b>306</b>, PCRF <b>110</b> may send the answer message towards PCEF <b>108</b>. DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may intercept and/or receive the answer message. DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may use triggers or other mechanisms for detecting answer messages that are associated with a PE service. For example, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may inspect hop-by-hop IDs stored in observed message for certain values. If an observed message is associated with a trigger indicating that PE is to be performed, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may modify policy information in the message before sending the message to PCEF <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In step <b>308</b>, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may detect that the answer message includes policy information that is to be modified and may modify policy information in the answer message.

In this example, DRA/DSR <b>112</b> may also modify other PCC rules (e.g., policy and/or QoS attributes). Such modifications may be limited based on time or other factors (e.g., network utilization). For example, modified PCC rules may expire after an hour or in response to other conditions. After the PCC rules have expired, new PCC rules may be required. In some embodiments, unmodified PCC rules may also be included in the answer message. In these embodiments, after the PCC rules have expired, the unmodified PCC rules may be applied.</p>

PCEF <b>108</b> may request and receive PCC rules to be applied. At some point in time, PCRF <b>110</b> may initiate a PUSH procedure to apply new PCC rules at PCEF <b>108</b>. For example, PCRF <b>110</b> may decide to provision PCC rules without obtaining a request from PCEF <b>108</b>, e.g., in response to information provided by PCRF <b>120</b> or a RACS in home network <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In step <b>600</b>, PCRF <b>120</b> may send a policy provisioning message towards PCRF <b>110</b>. For example, the policy provisioning message may be a RAR message communicated via a S9 or other LTE interface for providing policies to be applied to the IP-CAN session. In an alternate embodiment, a policy provisioning message may be sent from PCRF <b>120</b> to PCRF <b>110</b> via another interface, such as a SIP, a SOAP, or an HTTP interface. The policy provisioning message may include policy information (e.g., PCC rules).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In step <b>602</b>, PCRF <b>110</b> may receive the policy provisioning message. PCRF <b>110</b> may determine, using information in the message and/or other information, that the policy provisioning message is associated with a foreign or roaming subscriber. For example, PCRF <b>110</b> may query an HSS or AAA using a subscriber ID from the message or other subscriber identifying information. The HSS or AAA may respond by indicating that the subscriber ID is associated with a roaming subscriber. PCRF <b>110</b> may also query policy database <b>114</b> for information about the roaming subscriber. Using this information, PCRF <b>110</b> may determine that PE is to be performed. PCRF <b>110</b> may modify policy information in the policy provisioning message. For example, PCRF <b>110</b> may modify PCC rules for enhancing a roaming subscriber's usage experience.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In step <b>604</b>, PCRF <b>110</b> may send the policy provisioning message containing the modified policy information (e.g., PCC rules) to PCEF <b>108</b> and PCEF <b>108</b> may enforce the modified policy information. In step <b>606</b>, PCEF <b>108</b> may send an acknowledgement message (e.g., a re-authorization answer (RAA) message) towards PCRF <b>110</b> indicating receipt and/or enforcement of the new policy information.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In step <b>608</b>, PCRF <b>110</b> may send the acknowledgement message or a similar message to PCRF <b>120</b>. PCRF <b>110</b> may also send a message to an entity (e.g., policy database <b>114</b>) indicating that PE was performed and/or providing details about the PE. For example, PCRF <b>110</b> may maintain or track which roaming subscribers have received PE by storing relevant information in policy database <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In step <b>610</b>, a notification message may be sent from PCRF <b>110</b> to UE <b>102</b>. The notification message may indicate that PE has been performed. The notification message may also include additional information, such as promotional or marketing information. In some embodiments, a confirmation or eligibility message may occur prior to PE. The eligibility message may indicate that PE is available but that confirmation or acceptance is required before the PE is to occur. The confirmation may also require the roaming subscriber to provide contact information and/or receive additional information, such as promotional or marketing information.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram illustrating exemplary data for selective PE according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Table <b>700</b> and table <b>702</b> may represent exemplary data structures stored at or in policy database <b>114</b>. Table <b>700</b> may include exemplary data associated with roaming subscribers, such as subscriber usage profile data and/or log data. For example, as depicted in Table <b>700</b>, a subscriber ID may be associated with average observed roaming frequency data, service or access point name (APN) usage metrics data, and PE offer log data. The subscriber ID may include any information for identifying a subscriber or related UE. For example, subscriber identifying information may include at least one of an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) value, a mobile subscriber integrated services digital network (MSISDN) number, a short code, a uniform resource identifier (URI), an international mobile equipment identifier (IMEI), a mobile identification number (MIN), and a closed subscriber group (CSG) ID. Average observed roaming frequency data may include any information for identifying how frequently a subscriber roams in a given network (e.g., visited network <b>106</b>). For example, roaming frequency data may be indicated using ratios (e.g., 10 days out of 30 days), percentages (e.g., 33%), or other ways (e.g., a color scale). Service or APN usage metrics data may include information for identifying communications usage. For example, usage metric data may include a breakdown of the services or data consumed by a subscriber. For instance, usage metric data for subscriber &#x2018;Y&#x2019; may indicate amount of data is consumed as follows: 35% for web browsing, 30% for streaming video, 20% for voice calls, and 15% for email. PE offer log data may include information for identifying whether a subscriber has previously received PEs and other relevant details (e.g., date, extent, and duration of enhancements).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Table <b>702</b> may include exemplary data associated with PE offers, such as PE triggers, attributes or information to be enhanced, and duration of enhancement. For example, as depicted in Table <b>702</b>, a subscriber ID may be associated with one or more PE triggers, PE offer data, and a maximum duration of PE. The subscriber ID may include any information for identifying a subscriber or related UE. PE triggers may include any information usable to trigger or initiate PE. Exemplary PE triggers or criteria may be based on subscriber identification information, home network identifying information, subscriber usage information, roaming frequency, time of day, day of week, network utilization, type of data to be accessed, an SDF identifier, user device location, a network condition, an access network, and type of user device. For example, some PE offers may be based solely on location, date, or time, while PE triggers may be based on multiple factors. PE offer data include information for indicating what policy information is to be modified and/or for indicating how much the policy information is to be modified. For example, PE offer data may indicate various policy or QoS attributes and percentages that the attributes should be increased or decreased. Exemplary policy or QoS attributes may include a guaranteed download bitrate, a download bitrate, a guaranteed upload bitrate, an upload bitrate, a permitted service flow, a permitted QoS class, a permitted access point name (APN), charging information, a permitted destination IP address, or a permitted destination IP port. A maximum duration value may include information for indicating how long enhancement is to be applied. For example, a maximum duration for enhancement may be static (e.g., an hour) or may be dynamic (e.g., based on network utilization, time of day, or other factors).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">PE node <b>200</b> (e.g., PCRF <b>110</b> or DRA/DSR <b>112</b>) and/or PE module <b>204</b> may query policy database <b>114</b> for various information associated with a roaming subscriber (e.g., as identified by a subscriber ID) before determining whether to perform PE. For example, PCRF <b>110</b> may retrieve usage data (e.g., from Table <b>700</b>) and determine whether the subscriber is high-usage roamer or other preferable marketing target. In this example, if the subscriber has a roaming frequency above 20% and spends more than 50% of his time in the foreign network web browsing and/or streaming videos, PCRF <b>110</b> may retrieve PE offer data (e.g., from Table <b>702</b>). PCRF <b>110</b> may determine based on the PE offer data which, if any, PE offers are available to the subscriber. If one or more PE offers are available, PCRF <b>110</b> may select one or multiple offers to apply. In another example, PCRF <b>110</b> may retrieve usage data and PE data concurrently in determining whether policy information should be enhanced. PCRF <b>110</b> may analyze usage data to determine whether any PE triggers or criteria have been met. If PE triggers for a given PE offer has been met, PE may be performed using the relevant PE offer.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">It will be appreciated that the exemplary data and data structures in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are for illustrative purposes and that the data and/or data structures depicted may be changed or altered in various ways. For example, Tables <b>700</b> and <b>702</b> may be located at two separate nodes or may be combined into a single data structure. In a second example, additional and/or different information may be stored in or at policy database <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart illustrating exemplary steps for modifying policy information associated with a roaming subscriber according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. In some embodiments, the exemplary process described herein, or portions thereof, may be performed by PE node <b>200</b>, a PCRF <b>110</b>, and/or DRA/DSR <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in step <b>800</b>, a first signaling message may be received. The first signaling message may include a policy or QoS attribute. For example, a Diameter RAR message may be sent from PCRF <b>120</b> and received at PCRF <b>110</b>. The RAR message may include a subscriber ID and one or more PCC rules or attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In step <b>802</b>, using information associated with the roaming subscriber or a provider network, it may be determined that the policy or QoS attribute should be modified. For example, after receiving a message containing policy information, PCRF <b>110</b> or PE module <b>204</b> may query policy database <b>114</b> using a subscriber ID from the received message. The policy database <b>114</b> may return information regarding the subscriber, such as usage statistics and/or associated PE triggers. Using information from policy database <b>114</b> and/or other information (e.g., network conditions), PCRF <b>110</b> or PE module <b>204</b> may determine that one or more policy or QoS attributes should be modified or enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In step <b>804</b>, the policy or QoS attribute is modified for application in the provider network. For example, PCRF <b>110</b> may increase a download bitrate policy attribute associated with the roaming subscriber by 25%. PCRF <b>110</b> may then send the modified policy attribute to PCEF <b>108</b> for application. For example, PCRF <b>110</b> or PE module <b>204</b> may be configured to generate a PCC rule based on the modified policy or QoS attribute and may communicate the PCC rule to PCEF <b>108</b>. PCEF <b>108</b> may enforce the modified policy attribute for any communications associated with the roaming subscriber. PCRF <b>110</b> or another entity may notify the roaming subscriber about the PE.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, PCRF <b>110</b> or PE module <b>204</b> may send an unmodified version of the policy or QoS attribute in addition to the modified policy or QoS attribute. For example, PCEF <b>108</b> may apply the unmodified version of the policy or QoS attribute when the policy or QoS attribute expires.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It will be understood that various details of the subject matter described herein may be changed without departing from the scope of the subject matter described herein.
