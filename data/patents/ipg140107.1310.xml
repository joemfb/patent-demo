<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure generally relates to data centers, and particularly to a container data center.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Container data centers (CDCs) usually include servers, network equipments, storage devices, power supplies, and other electronic components. These electronic components are arranged or received within a metal container. However, when different CDCs need to be electrically connected to each other for communication, the connections are complicated and the debugging is inconvenient.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many aspects of a container data center can be better understood with reference to the following drawings. The components in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale, the emphasis instead being placed upon clearly illustrating the principles of the container data center. Moreover, in the drawings, like reference numerals designate corresponding parts throughout the several views. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like elements of an embodiment.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is schematic view of a container data center (CDC) <b>100</b> including a housing <b>10</b>, two driving devices <b>30</b>, and two gear devices <b>50</b>, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. The driving devices <b>30</b> and the gear devices <b>50</b> are received in the housing <b>10</b>. The CDC <b>100</b> further includes two ropes <b>40</b> connected to the gear devices <b>50</b> and the housing <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the ropes <b>40</b> may include any other similar structure, such as thread, wire, cable, chain, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in this embodiment, the housing <b>10</b> can be a container, and include two end walls <b>12</b>, a top wall <b>14</b>, a bottom wall <b>15</b>, two sidewalls <b>16</b>, and two support plates <b>18</b>. The end walls <b>12</b>, the top wall <b>14</b>, the bottom wall <b>15</b> and the sidewalls <b>16</b> form a substantially rectangular receiving space, to secure and receive servers, storage devices, power supplies, network equipments, and other electronic components, which are in electronic communication with data centers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The two end walls <b>12</b> are positioned substantially parallel and opposite to each other. Each end wall <b>12</b> includes a load-bearing member (not shown) to hold and fix an electronic equipment such as the driving device <b>30</b>. One of the end walls <b>12</b> defines an opening <b>122</b>; therefore, the connection lines between different CDCs <b>100</b> can pass through the opening <b>122</b>. Moreover, some electronic components can be moved and can be received in the housing <b>10</b> through the opening <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The top wall <b>14</b> is substantially parallel with the bottom wall <b>15</b>, and the end walls <b>12</b> are connected between the top wall <b>14</b> and the bottom wall <b>15</b>. The two sidewalls <b>16</b> are connected substantially parallel between the top wall <b>14</b> and the bottom wall <b>15</b>. One edge of one sidewall <b>16</b> is rotatably connected to the bottom wall <b>15</b> by means of hinges, for example, and the other edge is connected to the ropes <b>40</b>. Thus, the driving devices <b>50</b> can wind or unwind the ropes <b>40</b>, making the sidewall <b>16</b> rotatable to close or open relative to the bottom wall <b>15</b>. The support plates <b>18</b> are fixed on the top wall <b>14</b>, and perpendicularly extend towards the bottom wall <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in this embodiment, the driving devices <b>30</b> are fixed on the load-bearing members of the end wall <b>12</b> by means of riveting, for example. Each driving device <b>30</b> includes an electric motor <b>32</b>, a transmission element <b>34</b>, and a rotating shaft <b>36</b>. The electric motor <b>32</b> can generate force to rotate the rotating shaft <b>36</b> to wind the rope <b>40</b>, to further close the sidewall <b>16</b>. The transmission element <b>34</b> is mechanically connected between the electric motor <b>32</b> and the rotating shaft <b>36</b> to provide speed, and torque conversions, and transmit power from the electric motor <b>32</b> to the rotating shaft <b>36</b>, thereby activating, and rotating the rotating shaft <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, each gear device <b>50</b> includes a fixing frame <b>52</b>, a winding member <b>54</b>, and a connection member <b>58</b>. In this embodiment, the winding member <b>54</b> is a pulley, but in other embodiments, other structures, such as winding gears, may be used. In this embodiment, the fixing frame <b>52</b> includes two connection plates <b>522</b> and two connection posts <b>524</b>. Each connection plate <b>522</b> is a substantially rectangular plate, and each connection post <b>524</b> includes a fixing section <b>526</b>. The fixing section <b>526</b> can be a bolt; thereby, the connection posts <b>524</b> are mechanically connected between the two connection plates <b>522</b>, to assemble the connection plates <b>522</b>, the connection posts <b>524</b> and the winding member <b>54</b> together. Each connection plate <b>522</b> is fixed on the corresponding support plate <b>18</b> through the fixing section <b>526</b> by means of threaded connection, so the gear devices <b>50</b> are fixed on the top wall <b>14</b> through the support plates <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this embodiment, the winding member <b>54</b> usually comprising of a wheel with a grooved rim are mechanically rotatably connected to the connection plates <b>522</b>. The rope <b>40</b> is wound or unwound around the winding member <b>54</b>, so the winding member <b>54</b> can wind or unwind the rope <b>40</b> to open or close the hinged sidewall <b>16</b>. The connection member <b>58</b> is a substantially hollow cylinder and is rotatably positioned to one of the connection plates <b>522</b>. One end of the winding member <b>54</b> is mechanically connected and fixed to one end of the connection member <b>58</b>, and the rotating shaft <b>36</b> is mechanically connected and fixed within the other end of the connection member <b>58</b>. Thus, when the driving devices <b>30</b> are activated, rotating shafts <b>36</b> rotate the winding members <b>54</b> through the connection members <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In use, the electric motors <b>32</b> are activated and rotate the rotating shafts <b>36</b>, so the rotating shafts <b>36</b> drive the corresponding winding members <b>54</b> to turn in different directions to wind or unwind the ropes <b>40</b>. When the winding members <b>54</b> rotate in a direction, such as clockwise, to unwind the ropes <b>40</b>, the sidewall <b>16</b> rotates relative to the bottom wall <b>15</b> and can be opened to different angles. When the winding members <b>54</b> rotate in an opposite direction, such as counterclockwise, to wind the ropes <b>40</b>, the ropes <b>40</b> are wound or unwound around the winding members <b>54</b>, and the sidewall <b>16</b> rotates relative to the bottom wall <b>15</b> and is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, the driving devices <b>30</b> can be fixed on the corresponding support plates <b>18</b> of the top wall <b>14</b>, and the gear devices <b>50</b> can be fixed on the end wall <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In summary, in the CDC <b>100</b> of this disclosure, the electric motors <b>32</b> rotate the winding members <b>54</b> to wind or unwind the ropes <b>40</b>, so that the sidewall <b>16</b> is automatically closed or opened relative to the bottom wall <b>15</b> accordingly. This is suitable for debugging, installing, and connections of different CDCs <b>100</b> and can avoid frequent manual operations.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the present specification and claims the word &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; preceding an element does not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements. Further, the word &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; does not exclude the presence of other elements or steps than those listed.</p>
