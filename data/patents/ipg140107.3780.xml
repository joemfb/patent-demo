<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Application JP 2007-315286 filed in the Japan Patent Office on Dec. 5, 2007, the entire contents of which being incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a display device that has a display surface and which can display information such as an image, a character and the like on the display surface, and particularly to a display device configured to be able to detect an object to be detected in contact with or in proximity to a display surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Liquid crystal display devices, organic EL (Electro Luminescence) display devices, and display devices using electrophoresis are known as display devices capable of displaying information such as an image, a character and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With decreases in thickness of the display devices, the display devices are desired to become multifunctional combining an original function of displaying video and text information and the like and a function of an input device or the like to which a user designation or the like is input. A display device detecting that a finger of a user or a stylus pen (so-called touch pen or the like) has come into contact with or into proximity to a display surface is known as a display device that meets this desire.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Contact detection can be performed by a resistive film type or a capacitance type touch panel. A display device having a touch panel added to the display surface side of a display panel such as a liquid crystal panel or the like is known.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the addition of the touch panel is disadvantageous for reduction in thickness of the display panel, and is a factor in increasing cost. The resistive film type touch panel, in particular, cannot detect a change in resistance value unless a screen is pushed with a certain degree of force, so that a display surface is distorted. In addition, the resistive film type touch panel performs one-point detection in principle, and thus has limited uses.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A display device having an optical position detecting function by including a light receiving element for indicated position detection in a display panel is known as an indicated position detecting system that does not require a touch panel (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-275644 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2006-301864, hereinafter referred to as Patent Documents 1 and 2 respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A system that detects the shadow of extraneous light by a light receiving element is widely used in optical position detection.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">On the other hand, a display device described in Patent Document 2 includes a light receiving element (hereinafter referred to as a light sensor) having sensitivity to non-visible light within a liquid crystal (or an organic EL) display panel. In the case of the liquid crystal display panel, a backlight is disposed on one principal plane (rear) side of the liquid crystal display panel. Light from the backlight includes a visible light component and a non-visible light component. The light from the backlight undergoes modulation according to an input video signal in a liquid crystal layer when passing through the liquid crystal display panel, and is then emitted from another principal plane (a front or a display surface). A predetermined image is displayed by modulating the visible light component of the emitted light (outgoing light).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When there is an object (that is a finger of a human, a stylus pen, or the like, and which will hereinafter be referred to as an object to be detected) in contact with or in proximity to the display surface side of the liquid crystal display panel, a part of the emitted light is reflected by the object to be detected, and is then guided as reflected light to the side of the light sensor. The light sensor detects a non-visible light component, in particular, of the reflected light from the object to be detected. A visible light blocking (non-visible light selecting) filter is provided so as to correspond to a region where the light sensor is disposed, and the transmitted light does not undergo modulation according to a video signal in the region. Therefore the detection of the object to be detected can be performed without affecting a display state and without being affected by a degree of brightness of surroundings. The position and size of the object to be detected can be detected by arranging a large number of light sensors regularly (discretely and two-dimensionally).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The organic EL display device does not need a backlight. Pixels themselves emit light in the organic EL display device. In this case, non-visible light emitting elements and light receiving elements are arranged at predetermined intervals within the display region of a panel. A method itself of detecting an object to be detected is similar to that of the above-described liquid crystal display device. Non-visible light from the light emitting elements is reflected by the object to be detected. By detecting difference between amounts of reflected light at this time by the plurality of light receiving elements arranged discretely and two-dimensionally, the position and size of the object to be detected can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A display device described in Patent Document 1 includes a light sensor on the backlight side of a spacer separating a liquid crystal layer for each pixel. A region within a pixel which region is different from the region where the light sensor is disposed includes a region configured to dispose a light receiving element (hereinafter referred to as a visible light sensor) having sensitivity to visible light and a region that can change voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer and thus modulate transmitted light according to a video signal (which region will hereinafter be referred to as a light modulating region).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The display device described in Patent Document 1 is configured to be able to detect both the visible light component and the non-visible light component of light reflected by an object to be detected such as a finger of a human, a stylus pen or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the techniques described in Patent Documents 1 and 2, object detection is performed using non-visible light, which is invisible to the human eye and thus does not affect displayed video. Thus, in a case where an amount of transmitted light of visible light which transmitted light passes from a rear side to a front side is substantially close to zero as in black screen display, display is not affected even when non-visible light is passed to the front side. Therefore an object to be detected can be detected even at a time of black display. The object can be detected regardless of whether surroundings are dark or bright.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, although the display devices as described in Patent Documents 1 and 2, for example, distribute power for processing and perform operation for information display, information input or designating operation by a finger, a stylus pen or the like cannot be performed after an illumination power supply for the backlight or the like is turned off. In a case of a light transmissive type or a light reflective type display device having an illuminating section, for example, an illumination power supply can be accidentally turned off while the display device is being used in a totally dark environment. In such a case, it is convenient if information input or designating operation by a finger, a stylus pen or the like can be performed for a while after the illumination power supply is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, a display device for use in a mobile device or the like may be changed to a power saving mode when no operation is performed for a predetermined time, and an illumination power supply may be turned off automatically. In this case, when a user desires to resume operation, the user touches a position on a display surface to cancel the power saving mode, and then resumes operation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, when the illumination power supply is turned off in a completely dark environment, an operation of touching the position on the display surface needs to be performed by feeling, so that usability is poor.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">On the other hand, an emissive type display device causes an inconvenience in that when the display device is suddenly moved to a bright environment during use at a very low light emission intensity in a dark environment, it becomes momentarily difficult to see the screen, and an operation such as information input, designation or the like is forced to be stopped. This inconvenience is common to the light transmissive type and light reflective type display devices.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a display device according to another embodiment (fifth embodiment) of the present invention, in addition to the above-described second embodiment, further, the display section includes the display surface, the light storing section formed by a light storing material, and capable of absorbing a part of extraneous light incident on the light storing section from the display surface, outputting remaining extraneous light, and outputting the absorbed part of the extraneous light as an afterglow including non-visible light, a reflecting surface for reflecting output light from the light storing section to emit the output light from the display surface to an outside, a light modulating section configured to modulate the output light according to an input signal in an optical path in a mid course of the output light from the light storing section being reflected by the reflecting surface and emitted from the display surface, and the light sensor configured to detect non-visible light from reflected light resulting from the output light from the light storing section being reflected by the object to be detected on the side of the display surface.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a display device according to another embodiment (sixth embodiment) of the present invention, in addition to the above-described second embodiment, further, in the display section, a plurality of pixel regions configured to dispose a pixel and a plurality of sensor regions configured to dispose the light sensor are determined regularly as viewed from the display surface, and the light storing section is formed in each of the pixel regions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a display device according to another embodiment (seventh embodiment) of the present invention, in addition to the above-described sixth embodiment, further, the non-visible light is infrared light, the light sensor is an infrared light sensor having sensitivity to the infrared light, and the light storing section is formed by making a red light transmitting filter contain a light storing material.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a display device according to another embodiment (eighth embodiment) of the present invention, in addition to the above-described second embodiment, further, in the display section, a plurality of pixel regions configured to dispose a pixel and a plurality of sensor regions configured to dispose the light sensor are determined regularly as viewed from the display surface, and the light storing section is formed in each of the sensor regions.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition to the above-described first embodiment, further, a display device according to another embodiment (ninth embodiment) of the present invention includes a stylus pen having the light storing section in a region including a tip as an accessory.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a display device according to another embodiment (tenth embodiment) of the present invention, in addition to the above-described ninth embodiment, further, the display section includes an illuminating section configured to produce illuminating light including visible light, a light modulating section configured to receive the illuminating light incident on the light modulating section, modulate the incident illuminating light according to an input signal, and emit the modulated illuminating light, and the display surface for emitting the illuminating light modulated by the light modulating section to an outside.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the foregoing first to tenth embodiments, the display device has a light storing section. When light including ultraviolet to visible light, for example, is made incident on the light storing section, the light storing section can for example absorb a part of the incident light including the ultraviolet to visible light and temporarily retain the part of the incident light. The remaining incident light is emitted as it is. The absorbed light becomes an afterglow including non-visible light. That is, the afterglow can be output from the light storing section for a while even after supply of light energy is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The object to be detected can be detected on the basis of output light from the light storing section.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, when the object to be detected comes into contact with or into proximity to the display surface side of the display section configured to display information, the output light from the light storing section is input to the light sensor within the display section. The output light made incident on the light sensor includes a non-visible light component. The light sensor detects the object to be detected on the basis of the non-visible light component.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The light storing section has a light storing function, and thus outputs light (that is generally &#x201c;fluorescence&#x201d; or &#x201c;phosphorescence,&#x201d; and which will hereinafter be referred to as an &#x201c;afterglow&#x201d;) for a while even after the incidence of light is stopped. This afterglow includes non-visible light. Thus, the position, size and the like of the object to be detected can be detected by the light sensor for a while even after supply of light energy is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, because of the afterglow from the light storing section, the light storing section glows so as to be visible to the eye even after supply of light energy is stopped, for example after an illumination power supply is turned off. This light can be used as illuminating light for illuminating the display section.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The light storing section is provided within the display section (second embodiment) or the stylus pen (ninth embodiment).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the second embodiment, the display section includes an illuminating section, a light storing section, a light modulating section, a display surface, and a light sensor (third embodiment). In this embodiment, the light storing section acts to supply non-visible light to the light sensor on the basis of illuminating light from the illuminating section, and also acts as an auxiliary light source for the illuminating section. It is therefore possible to detect the position, size and the like of the object to be detected and display information for a while even after power supply to the illuminating section is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As a concrete example of arrangement of the third embodiment, the fourth embodiment presents an example of arrangement in which the illuminating section functions as a backlight. In this case, the light storing section is formed between the light emitting surface of a light guide plate of the illuminating section and the light modulating section. Thus, the light storing section receives illuminating light in a plane shape. While the illuminating section is lit, the light storing section stores a part of the illuminating light, and supplies the other light as light to be modulated on the side of the display section. After power to the illuminating section is turned off, light from the light storing section is used as light for detection of the position, size and the like of the object to be detected and as auxiliary illuminating light.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the other hand, a so-called front light disposition of the illuminating section is possible as another concrete example of arrangement of the third embodiment (fifth embodiment). In this case, the display section includes a display surface, a light storing section, a reflecting surface, a light modulating section, and a light sensor. Whether to provide an illuminating section or not is determined arbitrarily. Because an amount of light stored by a light storing material is limited, all of output light from the light storing section is used as light to be modulated after a part of extraneous light is stored. The output light from the light storing section undergoes modulation by the light modulating section in a process of being reflected by the reflecting surface and returning to the side of the display surface, so that information is added to the output light. Hence, the information can be displayed from the display surface. Meanwhile, a non-visible light component of the output light from the light storing section is used for detection of the position, size and the like of the object to be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the front light disposition, the reflecting surface can be positioned on the rear side of the light modulating section, and the light storing section and the display surface can be positioned on the front side. Therefore extraneous light is easily made incident on the light storing section. In addition, the light storing section and the light sensor can be disposed in close vicinity to the display surface. Hence, even when an amount of output non-visible light is small, the object to be detected is surely detected by the light sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The sixth embodiment and the eighth embodiment present an example of arrangement as viewed from the display surface of the light storing section. The seventh embodiment presents a concrete example in which the function of the light storing section in the sixth embodiment is provided to a so-called color filter.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The ninth embodiment and the tenth embodiment illustrate a case where the light storing section is formed at the part of a pen tip of a stylus pen.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a display device that enables information input and designation by a finger, a stylus pen or the like (object to be detected) even when a correspondence between the brightness of a surrounding environment and the brightness of a display surface changes suddenly.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The present embodiment relates to a transmissive type liquid crystal display device having a backlight.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of general constitution of the transmissive type liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The liquid crystal display device <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> as a &#x201c;display section,&#x201d; a backlight <b>300</b> as an &#x201c;illuminating section,&#x201d; a data processing section <b>400</b>, and a light storing section <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">One of the features of the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b> is that the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b> has the light storing section <b>60</b>. The light storing section <b>60</b> is a photoluminescent member that stores light within a material and which continues emitting light even after supply of light energy is stopped, that is, emits an &#x201c;afterglow.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The light storing section <b>60</b> is formed so as to be able to receive light incident on the light storing section <b>60</b> which light includes ultraviolet to visible light, for example, absorb a part of the incident light, and output an &#x201c;afterglow&#x201d; including visible light and non-visible light. While the light storing section <b>60</b> may be disposed in a dispersed manner within the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>, the light storing section <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is formed as for example a sheet-shaped constitution separate from the other constitution. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the light storing section <b>60</b> is formed between the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> and the backlight <b>300</b>. The light storing section <b>60</b> may be formed in the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>, or may be formed in the backlight <b>300</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The TFT array substrate <b>201</b> and the CF substrate <b>202</b> face each other at an interval. The liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> is formed in such a manner as to be sandwiched between the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> and the CF substrate <b>202</b>. Though not shown specifically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pair of alignment films for aligning a direction of arrangement of liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> is formed so as to sandwich the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A color filter <b>204</b> is formed in the surface of the CF substrate <b>202</b> on the side of the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The light sensor section <b>1</b> is formed to provide a function of a so-called touch panel to the inside of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>. When the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> is viewed from the side of a display surface <b>200</b>A (front side), light sensor sections <b>1</b> are regularly arranged within an effective display region PA.</p>

The number of light sensor sections <b>1</b> in one direction needs to be sufficiently larger than five for a purpose of position detection. The number of light sensor sections <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is reduced to five for convenience of illustration. When the function of position detection is limited to a part of the effective display region PA, light sensor sections <b>1</b> are arranged regularly in the limited display region.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Regions of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> in which regions a light sensor section <b>1</b> is formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as viewed from the effective display region PA of the display surface <b>200</b>A will be defined as &#x201c;sensor regions (PA<b>2</b>),&#x201d; and other regions of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> will be defined as &#x201c;pixel regions (PA<b>1</b>).&#x201d; Incidentally, these regions are three-dimensional regions including the direction of thickness of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The pixel regions (PA<b>1</b>) are pixel arranging regions in which a plurality of colors such as red (R), green (G), and blue (B), for example, are assigned to each pixel. The color assignment is determined by the transmission wavelength characteristic of a color filter opposed to the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Though not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pixel electrode and a common electrode (referred to also as a counter electrode) are formed in a pixel arranging region (pixel region (PA<b>1</b>)). The pixel electrode and the common electrode are formed by a transparent electrode material. A common electrode common to all pixels may be formed so as to be opposed to pixel electrodes on an anti-liquid crystal layer side of the pixel electrodes on the other surface side (liquid crystal layer side) of the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. Alternatively, the pixel electrodes may be formed on the other surface side of the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>, and the common electrode may be formed as electrode common to all the pixels at a position on the side of the CF substrate <b>202</b>, with the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> interposed between the pixel electrodes and the common electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Though not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an auxiliary capacitance auxiliary to a liquid crystal capacitance between the pixel electrode and the counter electrode, a switching element for controlling a potential applied to the pixel electrode according to the potential of an input video signal, and the like are also formed in the pixel arranging region according to a pixel configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">One mode of a &#x201c;light modulating section&#x201d; is formed by including the pixel electrode, the counter electrode, the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>, and the auxiliary capacitance and the switching element.</p>

The arrangement density of the light sensor sections <b>1</b> in the present embodiment may be at the above-described maximum, or may be lower.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The backlight <b>300</b> is disposed on the rear side of the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. The backlight <b>300</b> faces the rear side of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>, and emits illuminating light to the effective display region PA of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The backlight <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a light source <b>301</b> and a light guide plate <b>302</b> for converting light emitted from the light source <b>301</b> into plane-shaped light by diffusing the light emitted from the light source <b>301</b>. The backlight <b>300</b> includes a direct backlight and a side backlight according to the disposed position of the light source <b>301</b> with respect to the light guide plate <b>302</b>. In this case, however, a side backlight is illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The light source <b>301</b> is disposed in the rear of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> and on one side or both sides in a direction along the rear of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>. In other words, the light source <b>301</b> is disposed along one side or two opposed sides of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> as viewed from the display surface <b>200</b>A (front side). However, the light source <b>301</b> may be disposed along three or more sides of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The light source <b>301</b> is for example formed by a cold-cathode tube lamp. Specifically, the light source <b>301</b> converts ultraviolet rays produced by an arc discharge in a low-pressure mercury vapor within a glass tube into visible light by a phosphor, and radiates the visible light. Incidentally, the light source <b>301</b> is not limited to a cold-cathode tube lamp, but may be formed by an LED or an EL element, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this case, the light source <b>301</b> is formed by an LED. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a case where a visible light source <b>301</b><i>a </i>such as a white LED or the like and an IR light source <b>301</b><i>b </i>are arranged along two opposed sides.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The light guide plate <b>302</b> is for example formed by a translucent acrylic plate. The light guide plate <b>302</b> guides light from the light source <b>301</b> along surfaces (from one side to another side in the direction along the rear of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>) while effecting total reflection of the light. The rear of the light guide plate <b>302</b> is for example provided with a dot pattern not shown in the figure (a plurality of projecting parts) which dot pattern is formed integrally with the light guide plate <b>302</b> or formed by a member separate from the light guide plate <b>302</b>. The guided light is scattered by the dot pattern, and emitted to the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>. Incidentally, a reflecting sheet for reflecting light may be provided on the rear side of the light guide plate <b>302</b>, and a diffusing sheet or a prism sheet may be provided on the front side of the light guide plate <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Because the backlight <b>300</b> has the above constitution, the backlight <b>300</b> irradiates the entire surface of the effective display region PA of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> with substantially uniform plane light.</p>

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">&#x3c;Example of Combination Between Pixels and Light Sensor Sections&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As described above, the pixels and the light sensor sections are arranged regularly within the effective display region PA. While the rule of the arrangement is arbitrary, it is desirable to combine a plurality of pixels and one light sensor section into a set, and arrange such sets in the form of a matrix within the effective display region PA.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Description in the following will be made of an example of arrangement in which three pixels of R, G, and B and one light sensor section <b>1</b> form one set.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The color filter <b>204</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> substantially corresponds in size to the pixels (PIX) in a plan view. The color filter <b>204</b> has filters that selectively transmit the respective wavelength regions of R, G, and B and a black matrix that shields the periphery of the filters (all boundary parts) with a fixed width in order to prevent a color mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of a pattern of the black matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The black matrix <b>21</b>K illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> forms four openings according to the pattern of the black matrix <b>21</b>K. The filters of the three colors are disposed in three pixel openings XA of the four openings.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">More specifically, a red filter <b>21</b>R, a green filter <b>21</b>G, and a blue filter <b>21</b>B are arranged in this order in one direction. The red filter <b>21</b>R and the green filter <b>21</b>G are separated from each other via the black matrix <b>21</b>K having a fixed width, and the green filter <b>21</b>G and the blue filter <b>21</b>B are separated from each other via the black matrix <b>21</b>K having the fixed width. Because the three filters are disposed on a same pixel line, the three filters have a fixed height (size in a vertical direction).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The light sensor section <b>1</b> having the same height as the pixels (PIX) is disposed on the side of the red filter <b>21</b>R or the side of the blue filter <b>21</b>B (on the side of the red filter <b>21</b>R in this case). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, no filter is formed at the sensor opening SA of the black matrix in the light sensor section <b>1</b>. This is because light reflected from an object to be detected such as a finger of a human or the like needs to be passed through. When detected light is IR light, an IR filter selectively transmitting IR light may be disposed at the opening of the light sensor section <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Incidentally, the black matrix <b>21</b>K is not an essential constitution. Filters of three colors may be arranged two-dimensionally so as to overlap one another, and a part where the three colors all overlap one another may be used as a light shielding layer in place of the black matrix <b>21</b>K.</p>

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The light sensor section <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> has three transistors (N-channel type TFTs in this case) and a photodiode PD.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The three transistors are a reset transistor TS, an amplifier transistor TA, and a readout transistor TR.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The photodiode PD is an example of a &#x201c;light sensor.&#x201d; The photodiode PD has an anode connected to a storage node SN, and has a cathode connected to a line <b>31</b> supplying power supply voltage VDD (which line will hereinafter be referred to as a VDD line). As will be described later, the photodiode PD has a PIN structure or a PDN structure, and has a control gate CG that applies an electric field to an I (intrinsic) region (intrinsic semiconductor region of the PIN structure) or a D (doped) region (N<sup>&#x2212;</sup> region of the PDN structure) via an insulating film. The photodiode PD is used in a reverse-biased state, and has a structure that allows sensitivity of the photodiode PD to be optimized (normally maximized) by controlling a degree of depletion at that time by the control gate CG.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The reset transistor TS has a drain connected to the storage node SN, a source connected to a line <b>32</b> supplying reference voltage VSS (which line will hereinafter be referred to as a VSS line), and a gate connected to a line <b>33</b> supplying a reset signal (RESET) (which line will hereinafter be referred to as a reset line). The reset transistor TS changes the storage node SN from a floating state to a state of connection to the VSS line <b>32</b>, discharges the storage node SN, and thereby resets an amount of accumulated charge of the storage node SN.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The amplifier transistor TA has a drain connected to the VDD line <b>31</b>, a source connected to a line <b>35</b> for outputting a detection potential Vdet (or a detection current Idet) (which line will hereinafter be referred to as a detection line) via the readout transistor TR, and a gate connected to the storage node SN.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The readout transistor TR has a drain connected to the source of the amplifier transistor TA, a source connected to the detection line <b>35</b>, and a gate connected to a line <b>34</b> supplying a read control signal (READ) (which line will hereinafter be referred to as a read control line).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The amplifier transistor TA has a function of amplifying an amount of charge (received light potential) accumulated at the storage node SN when positive charge generated in the photodiode PD is accumulated at the storage node SN that is in the floating state again after being reset. The readout transistor TR controls timing of discharging the received light potential amplified by the amplifier transistor TA to the detection line <b>35</b>. After the passage of a certain accumulation time, the read control signal (READ) is activated to turn on the readout transistor TR. Thus, a voltage is applied to the source and the drain of the amplifier transistor TA, and the amplifier transistor TA passes a current corresponding to a gate potential at that time. Thereby a potential change corresponding to the received light potential and increased in amplitude appears in the detection line <b>35</b>. This potential change is output as the detection potential Vdet from the detection line <b>35</b> to the outside of the light sensor section <b>1</b>. Alternatively, the detection current Idet whose value changes according to the received light potential is output from the detection line <b>35</b> to the outside of the light sensor section <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The VDD line <b>31</b>, the VSS line <b>32</b>, and the detection line <b>35</b> are formed by a wiring layer of aluminum (AL), for example. The reset line <b>33</b> and the read control line <b>34</b> are formed by a gate metal (GM), for example molybdenum Mo. The gate metal (GM) is formed in a layer lower than the wiring layer of aluminum (AL). Four polysilicon (PS) layers are disposed in a state of being isolated from each other as a layer higher than the layer of the gate metal (GM) and lower than the layer of aluminum (AL). The reset transistor TS, the readout transistor TR, the amplifier transistor TA, and the photodiode PD each have the PS layer.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The transistors have a transistor structure in which an N-type impurity is introduced into one part and another part of the PS layer intersecting the gate metal (GM) to form a source and a drain.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">On the other hand, in the photodiode PD, a P-type impurity and an N-type impurity, that is, impurities of opposite conductivity types are introduced into one part and another part of a thin film semiconductor layer <b>36</b> formed by the PS layer, and thus the photodiode PD has a diode structure. The P-type impurity region forms the anode (A) region of the photodiode PD or the storage node SN. The N-type impurity region forms the cathode (K) region of the photodiode PD, and is connected to the VDD line <b>31</b> in the higher layer via a contact.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Incidentally, in the plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the backlight side of a light receiving region (an I-region or a D-region) possessed by the three transistors (TR, TS, and TA) is shielded from light by an electrode possessed by each transistor. However, the front side also needs to be shielded from extraneous light. Thus, in the plane pattern of the black matrix <b>21</b>K shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, a part of the sensor opening SA is in practice shielded from light by the same light shielding material as that of the black matrix <b>21</b>K or the like, though not specifically shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">For a similar reason, the front side of a switching element SW of a pixel (PIX) is also shielded from light.</p>

The other of the source and the drain of the thin film semiconductor layer <b>43</b> is connected with a signal line <b>45</b> formed by aluminum (AL). A vertical scanning line <b>44</b> intersecting in a lower layer than the thin film semiconductor layer <b>43</b> is formed by a gate metal (GM) such as molybdenum (Mo) or the like, and is disposed in a direction orthogonal to the signal line <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Incidentally, the CF substrate <b>202</b> is laid above the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> (a part not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) having the various patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> is formed between the two substrates (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).

<p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a photodiode PD of the PIN structure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows a photodiode PD of the PDN structure.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">A region having light receiving sensitivity in the thin film semiconductor layer <b>36</b> of the photodiode PD is an I-region into which no impurity is introduced in the PIN structure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>), and is a D-region (N<sup>&#x2212;</sup> region) into which an N-type impurity is introduced at a low concentration in the PDN structure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">When a reverse bias is applied to the thin film semiconductor layer <b>36</b> as shown in the figures, for example, a depletion layer expands within the I-region or the D-region. Back gate control (electric field control by the control gate CG) is performed to promote the depletion. However, a depletion of about 10 [&#x3bc;m] at most from a P<sup>+</sup> region occurs in the PIN structure. The PDN structure depletes substantially the whole of the D-region, and thus offers an advantage of having a correspondingly wider area with light receiving sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Either of the PIN structure and the PDN structure can be adopted in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The photodiode PD as a position sensor of such a structure is designed to have sensitivity to non-visible light, for example infrared light. It is desirable that the photodiode PD have a high sensitivity to infrared light. However, when the photodiode PD has a high sensitivity to visible light and near-ultraviolet light, the photodiode PD is desirably used in combination with an IR filter that selectively transmits infrared light.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Non-visible light includes for example infrared light or ultraviolet light. Incidentally, according to the International Commission on Illumination (CIE: Commission Internationale de l' Eclairage), a wavelength boundary between ultraviolet light (this is also an example of non-visible light) and visible light is 360 [nm] to 400 [nm], and a wavelength boundary between visible light and infrared light is 760 [nm] to 830 [nm]. In practice, however, wavelengths equal to or less than 350 [nm] may be regarded as ultraviolet light, and wavelengths equal to or more than 700 [nm] may be regarded as infrared light. In this case, suppose that a wavelength range of non-visible light is 350 [nm] to 700 [nm]. However, in the present embodiment, the wavelength boundaries of non-visible light may be defined arbitrarily within the above ranges of 360 [nm] to 400 [nm] and 760 [nm] to 830 [nm].</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">When infrared light (IR light) is used as non-visible light, the thin film semiconductor layer <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>) of the photodiode PD having a peak of sensitivity to IR light is desirably formed of polycrystalline silicon or crystalline silicon having an energy band gap of 1.1 [eV] between a valence band and a conduction band, the energy band gap of 1.1 [eV] being a smaller value than the energy band gap of a light receiving element receiving visible light (for example 1.6 [eV]). An optimum value for the energy band gap Eg is calculated by Eg=h&#x3bd; (h is Planck's constant, and &#x3bd;=1/&#x3bb; (&#x3bb; is the wavelength of light)).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">On the other hand, when the thin film semiconductor layer <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>) is formed of amorphous silicon or microcrystalline silicon, the energy band gap levels of these semiconductor materials have a distribution, and thus the semiconductor materials have a capability (sensitivity) of receiving infrared light and ultraviolet light. Hence, photodiodes PD formed of these semiconductor materials have a capability of receiving not only visible light but also non-visible light of infrared rays and ultraviolet rays, and are thus usable as a light receiving element for visible light and non-visible light.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">From the above description, the thin film semiconductor layer <b>36</b> of the photodiode PD suitably applicable to the present embodiment is formed of polycrystalline silicon, crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, or microcrystalline silicon. In any case, a semiconductor material for the photodiode PD in the present embodiment is desirably selected and designed to have a higher absorption coefficient than a photodiode designed to receive visible light. When such a design is difficult, the photodiode PD may be used in combination with an IR selecting filter.</p>

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">While the backlight <b>300</b> is being lit, the light storing section <b>60</b> absorbs ultraviolet to visible light (wavelengths of 250 [nm] to 780 [nm], for example) of the backlight light applied from the backlight <b>300</b>, and emits output light including non-visible light and visible light. After the backlight <b>300</b> is turned off, the light storing section <b>60</b> produces an afterglow including visible light and IR light (more than 780 [nm]). This action is referred to as &#x201c;light storage.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a time of output of an afterglow. The afterglow includes a non-visible light component, or an infrared light component (IR), and a visible light component (VL).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Depending on a light storing material forming the light storing section <b>60</b>, the duration of the afterglow ranges from a duration on the order of microseconds to a long duration of a few ten hours (about one day). A component of the long duration of the &#x201c;afterglow&#x201d; is referred to as &#x201c;phosphorescence,&#x201d; which differs from &#x201c;fluorescence,&#x201d; whose duration is on the order of nanoseconds. Incidentally, it suffices for the &#x201c;afterglow&#x201d; to include &#x201c;phosphorescence,&#x201d; and the afterglow may further include &#x201c;fluorescence.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The light storing effect of the light storing section <b>60</b> makes it possible to reduce the number of IR light sources <b>301</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or totally eliminate a need for the IR light sources <b>301</b><i>b </i>in some cases. As a result, a cost reduction can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In addition, because the afterglow includes a visible light component (VL), even when the backlight <b>300</b> is turned off in a dark, the visible light component (VL) is output from the light storing material, enabling supply of modulated light used to display images and characters. Further, the visible light component (VL) can be used as illuminating light illuminating a hand at a time of detecting an object to be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The infrared light component (IR) output from the light storing section <b>60</b> is light having wavelengths more than 780 [nm] to which the eye of a human does not have sensitivity. The photodiode PD including silicon as a main component of the thin film semiconductor layer <b>36</b> has high sensitivity to the infrared light component (IR) in a wavelength region of 780 [nm] to 1100 [nm] (matching is attained). Hence, it is desirable to select a material and the like for the light storing section <b>60</b> such that the afterglow includes light having wavelengths more than 780 [nm], more preferably wavelengths of 780 [nm] to 1100 [nm].</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Infrared photoluminescent materials such as organic fluorescent (phosphorescent) materials, inorganic phosphors, inorganic light storing materials and the like can be used as materials that absorb ultraviolet to visible light (wavelengths of 250 [nm] to 780 [nm]) of the backlight or ambient light (extraneous light) and emit light including IR light (wavelengths of more than 750 [nm]).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The light storing section <b>60</b> can be formed as an independent constitution or so as to be effectively included in another constitution as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">(1) The light storing section <b>60</b> is formed by making a light storing material into the form of a plate or laminating a plurality of sheets into layers.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">(2) An infrared photoluminescent material as described above is dispersed in a fluorescent tube backlight.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">(3) The IR light source <b>301</b><i>b </i>itself is formed by a white LED, and an infrared photoluminescent material is put inside the package sealed by glass or the like as a phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">(4) An infrared photoluminescent material is dispersed within the material of the light guide plate <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">(5) An infrared photoluminescent material is patterned as a diffusion material on the light guide plate <b>302</b>, or a diffusing sheet is coated with an infrared photoluminescent material and then the sheet is laminated to the light guide plate <b>302</b>. The patterning or sheet lamination can be performed at the position of the light emitting surface of the light guide plate <b>302</b> or a position closer to the light guide plate <b>302</b> than a reflecting surface as a surface opposed to the emitting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">(6) An infrared photoluminescent material is dispersed as particles on the submicron order into a planarizing film of a thin film transistor for driving.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Light storing materials such as organic fluorescent materials, organic phosphorescent materials, inorganic fluorescent materials, inorganic phosphorescent materials, and the like can be used as photoluminescent material. Among these infrared photoluminescent materials, inorganic light storing materials are excellent in terms of heat resistance and lightfastness, and enable position detection in a dark environment for a long period of time without light source driving.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">A zinc sulfide type (ZnS:Cu) or an oxide material formed by adding a rare-earth element or the like to an aluminum oxide can be used as inorganic light storing material. An oxide material formed by adding a rare-earth element or the like to an aluminum oxide is desirable because of a long duration of the afterglow. Specifically, LumiNova (proprietary name) formed by bonding a rare-earth metal to strontium aluminate emits high-luminance light for a long period of time, and is thus particularly desirable as an inorganic light storing material for the light storing section <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">&#x3c;Operation&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">An example of operation of the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b> will next be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Illuminating light from the backlight <b>300</b> placed on the rear side of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> is made incident on the inside of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> from the light storing section <b>60</b>, passes through the first polarizer <b>206</b>, the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>, the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>, the color filter <b>204</b>, the CF substrate <b>202</b>, and the second polarizer <b>207</b> in this order, and is then emitted from the front side to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The illuminating light during the passage undergoes polarization and modulation to be changed in plane of polarization, light intensity and the like. In addition, according to a realized form of the light storing section, the light storing section absorbs a part of the illuminating light, and is able to produce an afterglow after the illumination is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the illuminating light from the backlight <b>300</b> is made incident on the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> through the light storing section <b>60</b> and the first polarizer <b>206</b>, and efficiently passes through an opening provided within a light sensor section <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the photodiode PD is formed on the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. The backlight side of the photodiode PD is covered by an electrode, thus making it difficult to effect incidence of the illuminating light. Thus, the light is output from the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> through for example the opening within the light sensor section <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and the opening between pieces of wiring within the pixel (PIX) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The light output from the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> passes through the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>, the color filter <b>204</b>, the CF substrate <b>202</b>, and the second polarizer <b>207</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and is then output from the display surface <b>200</b>A to the outside for screen display.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In the process of the passage, the transmitted light is polarized in a first direction at the time of passing through the first polarizer <b>206</b>. While the light passes through the inside of the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>, the direction of polarization of the transmitted light is changed by a predetermined angle along a direction of molecular alignment of the liquid crystal due to an effect of optical anisotropy of the liquid crystal molecules. At the time of passing through the second polarizer <b>207</b>, the transmitted light is polarized in a second direction shifted from the first direction by a predetermined angle.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The direction of the polarized light being passed through the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> during the effect of the three-time polarization is changed independently for each pixel by controlling the intensity of an electric field applied to the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> according to the potential of an input video signal. Thus, the light passing through each pixel undergoes modulation to be changed to brightness corresponding to the potential of the video signal, and then emitted from the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> to be used for predetermined image display.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">As already described, the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> has an effective display region PA for displaying an image, and has a plurality of pixels arranged in the pixel regions (PA<b>1</b>) of the effective display region PA. A light sensor section <b>1</b> is disposed in the sensor regions (PA<b>2</b>) of the effective display region PA, the light sensor section <b>1</b> including a light receiving element that detects an object to be detected such as the finger of a human, a stylus pen or the like to realize a function of a so-called touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The light passed through the light sensor section <b>1</b> is emitted from the display surface <b>200</b>A of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> as it is without being modulated by an electric signal as with the light passing through a pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">There is a case where for example a display content according to an application prompts for a user designation during image display. In such a case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a user lightly touches the display screen with a finger (or a stylus pen or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">When an object to be detected such as a finger, a stylus pen or the like is brought into contact with or into proximity to the display screen, the light emitted from the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> is reflected by the object to be detected, and then returned to the inside of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>. This returned light (reflected light (RL)) is repeatedly refracted and reflected by layer interfaces and reflectors such as wiring and the like within the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>. Therefore, the reflected light generally travels so as to be spread in the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>. Thus, though depending on the size of the object to be detected, the reflected light reaches at least one of the plurality of photodiodes PD.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">When a part of the reflected light reaching the photodiode PD is made incident on the photodiode PD, to which a predetermined reverse bias is applied, the photodiode PD performs photoelectric conversion and then outputs a charge from the anode (A) electrode, for example. The amount of the charge at this time represents received light data proportional to an amount of received IR light. The received light data (charge amount) is output as a detection potential Vdet or a detection current Idet from the detection line <b>35</b> of the readout circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> already described above.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The detection potential Vdet or the detection current Idet is sent to the sensor driver <b>13</b> side by the switch array <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The detection potential Vdet or the detection current Idet is collected as received light data in the sensor driver <b>13</b>. Further, the detection potential Vdet or the detection current Idet is input to a position detecting section <b>402</b> within a data processing section <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A set of addresses of a row and a column for each detection potential Vdet or detection current Idet is sequentially input in real time from the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> side to the position detecting section <b>402</b> or a controlling section <b>401</b>. Thus, intra-panel positional information (the detection potential Vdet or the detection current Idet) for the object to be detected is associated with the row and column direction address information, and is then stored in a memory not shown in the figures within the data processing section <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">By superimposing the positional information of the object to be detected and display information on each other on the basis of the information within the memory, the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b> can determine that &#x201c;a user has made a designation on the basis of the display information, using a finger, a stylus pen or the like&#x201d; or that &#x201c;a user has input predetermined information by moving a stylus pen or the like on the display screen.&#x201d; That is, the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b> can realize a function similar to a function obtained when a touch panel is added to the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> by a thin display panel that does not have a touch panel added thereto. Such a display panel will be referred to as an in-cell touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">According to the present embodiment, even when the backlight light is off as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an infrared light component (IR) included in an afterglow is reflected by the object to be detected (finger or the like), and then made incident on photodiodes PD. Therefore the position and the size of the object to be detected can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The afterglow also includes a visible light component (VL). Therefore, even when a backlight power supply is turned off, a light modulating section having the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> as a center thereof is dimly illuminated, so that a displayed image or the like is visible. The user can thus continue designation input for operating an application or the like or information input by a finger, a stylus pen or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The backlight might be used in a dark environment with the brightness of the backlight extremely lowered even though the backlight power supply is not turned off. At this time, when the environment suddenly becomes brighter, it can be difficult to see an image until the eyes are adjusted to the brightness of the environment due to a lack of brightness of the backlight. Even in such a case, the visible light component (VL) output from the light storing section <b>60</b> becomes an auxiliary illuminating light to alleviate the difficulty in seeing the image.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The present embodiment relates to a reflective type liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">A typical reflective type liquid crystal panel does not have the backlight <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but instead has an illuminating section (front light) disposed between a liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> and a display surface <b>200</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic sectional view of a liquid crystal display device according to the present embodiment, the sectional view being of assistance in explaining IR light producing means used for position detection.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The liquid crystal display device <b>100</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> includes a photoluminescent member (light storing section <b>60</b>A) having a front light function on the display surface <b>200</b>A side of a reflective type liquid crystal panel. In addition, a reflecting surface <b>200</b>B is provided on a side opposite from the display surface <b>200</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The light storing section <b>60</b>A is formed by using a light storing material emitting both of visible light and infrared light as illustrated in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, illuminating light emitted from the light storing section <b>60</b>A includes a visible light component (VL) and an infrared light component (IR). The illuminating light passes through a CF substrate <b>202</b>, a liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>, and a TFT array substrate <b>201</b>, is reflected by the reflecting surface <b>200</b>B, follows the same path again, passes through the inside of the light storing section <b>60</b>A, and is then emitted from the display surface <b>200</b>A to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The visible light component (VL) of the illuminating light undergoes modulation according to an input signal in the middle of such a path, so that information is added to the visible light component (VL) to be used for display.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">On the other hand, the infrared light component (IR) of the illuminating light passes through a similar path and goes out from the display surface <b>200</b>A, whereas when an object to be detected such as a finger or the like is in contact with or in proximity to the display surface <b>200</b>A, there is a reflected infrared light component (IR_R) reflected and returned by the object to be detected. The reflected infrared light component (IR_R) is made incident from the CF substrate <b>202</b>, passed through the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>, and then received by photodiodes PD. Thereby the position and the size of the object to be detected can be detected as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">As in the first embodiment, the constitution of the second embodiment enables position detection after illumination is turned off. That is, in the present embodiment, even when light emission control on the light storing section <b>60</b>A serving also as an illuminating section is stopped, the position and the size of the object to be detected can be detected by an infrared light component (IR) of an afterglow even after the light emission stop control. In addition, as with the first embodiment, the second embodiment offers an advantage of ease of continuation of operation after illumination is turned off and an advantage of alleviating difficulty in seeing a displayed image which difficulty occurs momentarily at a time of a change in brightness of the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is a relatively great loss in the infrared light component (IR) due to absorption and reflection by members between the light storing section <b>60</b> and the display surface <b>200</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">On the other hand, in the second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the light storing section <b>60</b>A is disposed close to the display surface <b>200</b>A, thus resulting in a high efficiency of use of the infrared light component (IR) and a high S/N ratio of position detection.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Incidentally, the light storing section <b>60</b>A in the second embodiment may serve also as a protective plate of the surface of the image display device. An infrared photoluminescent material may be used in a state of being dispersed as particles on the submicron order in an overcoat material forming the display surface of the protective plate.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">When the light quantity of front light is insufficient, an illuminating section (front light) may be provided separately from the light storing section <b>60</b>A, and light from the light storing section <b>60</b>A may be used as auxiliary illuminating light for the illuminating section.</p>

<p id="p-0197" num="0196"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a schematic sectional view of a liquid crystal display device according to the present embodiment, the sectional view being of assistance in explaining IR light producing means used for position detection.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b>B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a plurality of light storing sections <b>60</b>B separated from each other are patterned on a color filter side of a CF substrate <b>202</b> of a liquid crystal panel. The surface of the CF substrate <b>202</b> on which surface the light storing sections <b>60</b>B are formed may be a surface on the side of a liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, or may be a surface on the side of a display surface <b>200</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In the present embodiment, the light storing sections <b>60</b>B can be disposed at only necessary positions. It is thereby possible not only to obtain similar advantages to those of the first embodiment but also improve accuracy of position detection.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In addition, for example, a combination with a color filter enables a design for improving accuracy of detection of IR light.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">A fourth embodiment and a fifth embodiment to be described next are more concrete embodiments of the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Incidentally, while an illuminating section is necessary in the third to fifth embodiments, a light storing section functions as a simple auxiliary light when illumination is turned off.</p>

<p id="p-0203" num="0202"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic sectional view of a liquid crystal display device according to a fourth embodiment, the sectional view being of assistance in explaining IR light producing means used for position detection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a sectional view of a comparative example in a liquid crystal display device to which the present invention is not applied, the sectional view showing substantially the same section as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The comparative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> has an IR transmitting filter (IRPF) that blocks a visible light component (VL) and which transmits infrared rays including a reflected infrared light component (IR_R). The IR transmitting filter (IRPF) is formed in a sensor region (PA<b>2</b>) or a light sensor section <b>1</b>. When a black matrix <b>21</b>K has a plane pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, the IR transmitting filter (IRPF) is disposed within the sensor opening SA of the black matrix <b>21</b>K in the light sensor section <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a red filter <b>21</b>R, a green filter <b>21</b>G, and a blue filter <b>21</b>B are disposed around the IR transmitting filter (IRPF). These four kinds of filters and the black matrix <b>21</b>K form a color filter <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The liquid crystal display device <b>100</b>C according to the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> has a photoluminescent member (light storing section <b>60</b>C) capable of outputting an afterglow including infrared rays in place of the IR transmitting filter (IRPF) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Because an S/N ratio is degraded when a visible light component (VL) is transmitted to the photodiode PD side, the light storing section <b>60</b>C in the present embodiment needs to have a filter function of blocking the visible light component (VL), which filter function is similar to that of the IR transmitting filter (IRPF) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Specifically, it is desirable to form the light storing section <b>60</b>C as a double-layer structure, and provide the layer on the photodiode PD side with a visible light blocking function similar to that of the IR transmitting filter (IRPF) and provide the other layer with a light storing function.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">However, the light storing function does not necessarily need to be realized by providing the light storing layer. A photoluminescent material may be dispersed in the layer that blocks visible light and transmits infrared rays, or a surface of the layer which surface is opposite from the display surface <b>200</b>A side may be coated with a photoluminescent material.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">According to the fourth embodiment, it is possible to obtain similar advantages to those of the first embodiment, and realize the light storing function by making a little change to the existing color filter <b>204</b> at a necessary position near the photodiode PD.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In addition, many of infrared photoluminescent materials (infrared light storing materials) are colored because the infrared photoluminescent materials absorb visible light. However, a decrease in transmittance of the panel can be avoided because an infrared photoluminescent material is selectively disposed in the region blocking visible light.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a schematic sectional view of a liquid crystal display device according to a fifth embodiment, the sectional view being of assistance in explaining IR light producing means used for position detection.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The liquid crystal display device <b>100</b>D shown by the diagram has a filter light storing section <b>60</b>D combining the function of the red filter <b>21</b>R and the light storing function in place of the red filter <b>21</b>R at the position of the red filter <b>21</b>R in the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Specifically, the light storing function can be provided by dispersing an infrared photoluminescent material in a conventional red filter <b>21</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Incidentally, when this constitution is adopted, the photoluminescent material desirably does not emit light in a red region. That is, the photoluminescent material desirably does not absorb a visible light component (VL) in the red region but transmits the visible light component (VL) in the red region so that the function of a pixel for red display is not impaired. Thus, the filter light storing section <b>60</b>D is desirably formed of a photoluminescent material absorbing a blue region and a green region of visible light. Thereby a decrease in transmittance of the liquid crystal panel can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">A reason why the red filter (red filter <b>21</b>R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) is provided with the light storing function to form the filter light storing section <b>60</b>D is that a red filter material has a high transmittance in an infrared region, and thus a transmittance characteristic can be controlled easily, and that luminous efficiency of an reflected infrared light component (IR_R) of an afterglow can be increased, and thus accuracy (S/N ratio) of position detection can be made higher. However, a green filter <b>21</b>G or a blue filter <b>21</b>B can be provided with the light storing function when the transmittance characteristic can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">According to the fifth embodiment, it is possible to obtain similar advantages to those of the first embodiment, and realize the light storing function by making a little change to the existing color filter <b>204</b> at a necessary position near the photodiode PD.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Incidentally, an IR transmitting filter (IRPF) is formed in a sensor region (PA<b>2</b>), and thus the functionality of blocking visible light is sufficiently high.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a schematic sectional view of a liquid crystal display device according to a sixth embodiment, the sectional view being of assistance in explaining IR light producing means used for position detection.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The liquid crystal display device <b>100</b>D illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> has a stylus pen <b>101</b> as an accessory, the stylus pen <b>101</b> being an object to be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">A light storing section <b>60</b>E provided in a region including a tip in the stylus pen <b>101</b> is formed of a light storing material (photoluminescent material) similar to that of the light storing section <b>60</b> in the first embodiment. The stylus pen <b>101</b> is used with the pen tip where the light storing section <b>60</b>E is formed in contact with or in proximity to the display surface <b>200</b>A of a liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> when a user gives an instruction in response to a display content of an application displayed on the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b>, or inputs information.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">The liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> includes photodiodes PD for detecting non-visible light (for example IR light), the photodiodes PD being formed on a TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. Because <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an example of a liquid crystal display device, the liquid crystal display device has a liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> and a CF substrate <b>202</b>, and additionally needs an illuminating section and the like. However, the illuminating section is unnecessary when the display panel is for example an emissive type organic EL panel other than a liquid crystal panel.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The present embodiment provides similar advantages to those of the first embodiment. In addition, even when means for producing non-visible light (IR light in this case) such as an illuminating section or the like is not present within the display panel, non-visible light (IR light) for detection (object detection) of the position, size and the like of the object to be detected is supplied from the light storing section <b>60</b>E formed at the pen tip through the display surface <b>200</b>A to the inside of the display panel. Thus, a light source for the object detection is not necessary within the display panel, and a power supply when light for the object detection is produced is not necessary for the stylus pen <b>101</b>, so that the display device as a whole can be reduced in cost.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">When the stylus pen <b>101</b> is provided with the light storing section <b>60</b>E, the detection of the stylus pen <b>101</b> uses direct light of non-visible light (detection light) instead of using reflection of non-visible light produced within the display panel or output to the outside through the inside of the display panel. Thus, the non-visible light (detection light) reaching a photodiode PD includes a small quantity of a stray light component, which is caused when the non-visible light is repeatedly reflected within the display panel. In addition, photodiodes PD can be disposed close to the display surface <b>200</b>A. For the two reasons, accuracy of position detection on the basis of output of the photodiodes PD is very high.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The display device according to the present embodiment is not limited to the above description, and various modifications below can be made.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">&#x3c;First Example of Modification&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The first example of modification includes a photodiode PD as a light receiving element for receiving non-visible light, and detects extraneous light including visible light as a main component and controls the intensity of light output from the backlight <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to a result of the detection. While description in the following will be made of an example of modification of the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref>, the first example of modification can be applied to other embodiments as long as the first example of modification has an illuminating section such as a backlight or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Though not specifically shown, an extraneous light sensor configured to detect extraneous light is disposed in an effective display region PA or a peripheral region CA in the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The arrangement position and the number of extraneous light sensors are arbitrary.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">When the extraneous light sensors are disposed within the effective display region PA, the extraneous light sensors can be arranged in the form of a matrix as with light sensors (photodiodes PD) for receiving non-visible light. In this case, each extraneous light sensor is disposed at equal distances from a plurality of light sensors present around the extraneous light sensor. For example, the photodiodes PD and the extraneous light sensors desirably form a checkered pattern in a plan view of the effective display region PA.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">The extraneous light sensors may be arranged at equal intervals if not in a checkered pattern. In addition, extraneous light sensors may be arranged around four corners of the effective display region PA, or extraneous light sensors may be arranged in line at positions close to at least one of outer sides of the effective display region PA. Thus, the arrangement and the number of extraneous light sensors are not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">An equivalent circuit and a plane pattern similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> can be applied to a basic constitution of the extraneous light sensor. However, the photodiode of the extraneous light sensor may include for example a different material for a thin film semiconductor layer from that of the photodiode PD as a light sensor. For example, the thin film semiconductor layer of the extraneous light sensor is desirably formed of amorphous silicon or microcrystalline silicon whose energy band gap is distributed broadly so that the extraneous light sensor has a peak of sensitivity to visible light defined in a wavelength range of 350 [nm] to 700 [nm]. For example, a material whose energy band gap is 1.6 [eV] can be used as the thin film semiconductor layer of the extraneous light sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Incidentally, as already described, amorphous silicon or microcrystalline silicon can be used as a material for the thin film semiconductor layer of the photodiode PD in the non-visible light sensor. Materials formed so as to have different energy band gaps and thus have different infrared absorption characteristics are used for the thin film semiconductor layer of the photodiode PD in this case and the thin film semiconductor layer of the extraneous light sensor. However, polysilicon or crystalline silicon, which has a different energy band gap and has somewhat lower sensitivity, can be used as a material for the thin film semiconductor layer of the visible light sensor and the light sensor. In such a case, wavelength selectivity may be imparted to the filter side.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">The data processing section <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> controls the operation of the backlight <b>300</b> emitting illuminating light on the basis of received light data obtained by the extraneous light sensors. The position detecting section <b>402</b> under control of the controlling section <b>401</b> detects the amplitude of a signal (amount of accumulated charge) proportional to the luminance of extraneous light by the received light data, that is, a voltage value (detection potential Vdet) or a current value (detection current Idet). The controlling section <b>401</b> adjusts the light emission intensity of the backlight <b>300</b> of the liquid crystal display device on the basis of a result of the detection.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Thus, when the received light data obtained by the extraneous light sensors indicates that received light has high intensity, the backlight <b>300</b> is controlled to apply illuminating light of higher intensity. When the received light data obtained by the extraneous light sensors indicates that the received light has low intensity, the backlight <b>300</b> is controlled to apply illuminating light of lower intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Generally, in an environment in which extraneous light (especially sunlight) comes into a display device having pixel switches of thin film transistors, the contrast of the display device may be lowered by reflection of the surface layer of a display panel, so that an image may not be recognized well. Therefore, the luminance of light emitted from the display panel itself to the outside of the surface of the display panel needs to be higher than reflection luminance on the surface of the display panel. For this, the light emission intensity of the backlight <b>300</b> irradiating the display panel from the rear is controlled to be higher.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">In conditions of a dark or the like in which the intensity of extraneous light is very low, light reflected by the surface of the display panel does not cause a degradation in image quality (decrease in contrast), and thus the light emission intensity of the backlight <b>300</b> needs to be decreased. The first example of modification can lower the surface luminance of the display device, and thereby reduce power consumption of the backlight <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The first example of modification has an advantage of being able to control such a degradation in image quality (decrease in contrast) and reduction in power consumption adaptively according to a change in the amount of extraneous light.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a diagram showing changes of received light data with respect to input light intensity, which diagram is obtained in a case where an extraneous light sensor is formed in the effective display region PA (application of disposition within the display region) and a case where the extraneous light sensor is formed in the peripheral region CA (non-application of disposition within the display region) in the first example of modification. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an axis of abscissas indicates the illuminance (unit: a lux) of extraneous light, and an axis of ordinates indicates illuminance (unit: [lx]) into which the value of the received light data obtained from the extraneous light sensor is converted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a solid line is a curve in the case where the disposition of the extraneous light sensor within the display region is applied, and a broken line is a curve in the case where the disposition of the extraneous light sensor within the display region is not applied.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, for example, when extraneous light of 1000 [lx] is made incident, the received light data corresponding to an illuminance of about 100 [lx] is obtained in the case where the extraneous light sensor is formed in the peripheral region CA, whereas the received light data corresponding to an illuminance of about 1000 [lx] is obtained in the case where the extraneous light sensor is formed in the effective display region PA. Thus, light of high intensity can be obtained by providing the extraneous light sensor in the effective display region PA.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Hence, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows that the extraneous light sensor is preferably disposed within the effective display region PA.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows a screen when a finger tip is detected without the first example of modification being applied, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> shows a screen when the finger tip is detected with the first example of modification applied.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The screens shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> are obtained by converting respective outputs of a plurality of light sensor sections finely arranged in the form of a matrix into dot display of detections (white) and non-detections (black) and mapping the dot display on a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> also show that detection accuracy is higher when the extraneous light sensor is disposed within the effective display region PA.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">According to the first example of modification, in addition to an advantage of being able to control a degradation in image quality (decrease in contrast) and reduction in power consumption adaptively according to a change in the amount of extraneous light, when there is a small amount of ambient extraneous light, in particular, a larger amount of light of the backlight <b>300</b> than is necessary is prevented from entering the liquid crystal panel, and thus occurrence of stray visible light can be prevented or suppressed correspondingly. This brings an advantage of being able to improve accuracy of position detection when the photodiode PD as a light sensor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> or the like has sensitivity not only to non-visible light (for example IR light) but also to visible light.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Incidentally, in the first example of modification, the shadow of an object to be detected that blocks extraneous light may be detected from the output of the light sensor sections <b>1</b> and the output of the extraneous light sensors when it is determined that extraneous light intensity detected by the extraneous light sensors is somewhat high, and the presence or absence, the position, or the size of the object to be detected may be detected on the basis of a result of the detection.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">&#x3c;Second Example of Modification: Other Modifiable Points&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">While infrared rays (IR light) are mainly used as non-visible light for the description of the foregoing embodiments and the first example of modification thereof, ultraviolet rays may be used as non-visible light.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The backlight <b>300</b> is not limited to a backlight having a light source and a light guiding member, but may be a backlight having only a light source such as a backlight having a plurality of LEDs arranged two-dimensionally, for example. In addition, the backlight <b>300</b> is not limited to a surface light source, but may be a line light source or a point light source. The light guiding member is not limited to the shape of a plate (light guide plate <b>302</b>), but may be for example a long rectangular parallelepiped or a cube.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">All the TFT structures including the photodiode PD, the reset transistor TS, the amplifier transistor TA, and the readout transistor TR in the readout circuit (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>) and the switching element SW in the pixel circuit as well as the TFD (Thin Film Diode) structure having the control gate CG may be formed as a top gate type. In this case, at least the rear side of the light receiving region of the TFD (the I-region or the D-region) and the channel forming regions of the TFTs is desirably covered with a light shielding layer so that direct light from the backlight <b>300</b> does not enter the light receiving region and the channel forming regions.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The constitution (arrangement and color types) of the pixel units shown by the filters (<b>21</b>R, <b>21</b>G, and <b>21</b>B) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and adjacent position relation of the sensor opening SA corresponding to the light sensor section to the pixel units are not limited to the constitution and the adjacent position relation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">&#x3c;Third Example of Modification&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The foregoing embodiments and the first and second examples of modification are not limited to liquid crystal display devices but are widely applicable to emissive type display devices such as organic EL display devices and the like, display devices using electrophoresis applicable to electronic paper, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">A display device using electrophoresis has an electronic ink between a pixel electrode and a common electrode provided to a counter substrate (transparent substrate). The electronic ink is a substitute for the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The electronic ink has a plurality of microcapsules including positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a liquid. Electrophoresis enables gradation display of a pixel according to input data by utilizing a fact that particles moving to the pixel electrode side and the common electrode side are inverted between white and black for a positive electric field and a negative electric field applied between the pixel electrode and the common electrode, and that the pixel appears to be bright as viewed from an observer when a large proportion of the white particles are moved to the transparent substrate side. Thus, the foregoing embodiments can be applied in substantially the same manner except for a method of light modulation of the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">On the other hand, an organic EL display device does not require the backlight <b>300</b>. An organic EL display device utilizes a phenomenon in which an organic material film itself laminated in each pixel within a display panel emits light at a luminance corresponding to the magnitude of an applied electric field. Thus, a condensing lens is desirably formed by an intra-layer lens layer, for example. Otherwise, the foregoing embodiments can be applied in substantially the same manner.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">&#x3c;Examples of Application of Display Device to Products&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">The embodiments and the first to third examples of modification can be applied as a display part for displaying characters and images in various products as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Specifically, the foregoing embodiments and the first to third examples of modification can be applied to for example television receivers, monitor devices of personal computers and the like, mobile devices having a video reproducing function such as portable telephones, game machines, PDAs and the like, picture taking devices such as still cameras, video cameras and the like, and vehicle mounting devices such as car navigation systems and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">According to the foregoing embodiments and the examples of modification thereof, the following advantages are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">A resistance type or a capacitance type touch panel having a two-layer conductive film or a thin glass, which touch panel is disposed on the front side of a display panel, is rendered unnecessary. That is, an &#x201c;in-cell touch panel&#x201d; having a function of a touch panel within a display panel can be realized. Thus, the display device can be miniaturized and, in particular, reduced in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Because received light data and an address of a detected position are stored in a memory as a set, a plurality of separate positions can be detected simultaneously. In addition, not only the position of an object to be detected but also the size of the object to be detected can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">In a case where an illuminating section is provided, it is possible to detect an object to be detected for a while (a maximum of about one day) even after illumination is turned off while an instruction or information is being input by making an object to be detected such as a finger, a stylus pen or the like recognized, or even after an automatic turnoff function is activated in a power saving mode. In addition, operation is not hindered even in a dark because illumination can be provided by an afterglow.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">In either of a case where an illuminating section is provided and a case where no illuminating section is provided, a momentary difficulty in seeing a screen when the brightness of an environment changes suddenly is prevented or alleviated by auxiliary illumination by an afterglow.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">A problem of being unable to detect a finger or a stylus pen when the screen is making totally black display can be solved without a light source of detection light being added.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Because auxiliary illumination by an afterglow is possible, the illuminating section can be reduced in cost. When use is limited to a dark environment, the illuminating section itself is rendered unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">The first example of modification enables extraneous light detection based on visible light to be performed in the display region of a display device. When an extraneous light sensor is disposed within an effective display region, as compared with a system in which the extraneous light sensor is disposed outside the display region, surface luminance on the display device can be measured more accurately, and therefore accuracy of control of light emission intensity of the backlight is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">The display device according to the present invention described above can be applied to display devices of various electronic devices, that is, electronic devices in all fields that display a video signal input thereto or a video signal generated therein as an image or video, such for example as digital cameras, notebook personal computers, portable terminal devices such as portable telephones and the like, and video cameras.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
