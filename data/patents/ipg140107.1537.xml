<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Reciprocating fluid pumps include a plunger configured to expand and compress in a reciprocating action to pump fluid, and one or more magnets carried by the plunger. The one or more magnets may be used to impart a force on the plunger when the plunger expands and compresses in the reciprocating action within a pump body responsive to a magnetic field. Shuttle valves for shifting flow of pressurized fluid between at least two conduits include a spool movable within a valve body and one or more magnets carried by the spool. The one or more magnets may be used to impart a force on the spool responsive to a magnetic field. Reciprocating fluid pumps may include such shuttle valves. Methods include forming and using such pumps and shuttle valves.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to reciprocating fluid pumps that include a reciprocating plunger, to components and devices for use with such pumps, and to methods of making and using such reciprocating fluid pumps and devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Reciprocating fluid pumps are used in many industries. Reciprocating fluid pumps generally include two fluid chambers in a pump body. A reciprocating piston or shaft is driven back and forth within the pump body. One or more plungers (e.g., diaphragms or bellows) may be connected to the reciprocating piston or shaft. As the reciprocating piston moves in one direction, the movement of the plungers results in fluid being drawn into a first fluid chamber of the two fluid chambers and expelled from the second chamber. As the reciprocating piston moves in the opposite direction, the movement of the plungers results in fluid being expelled from the first chamber and drawn into the second chamber. A chamber inlet and a chamber outlet may be provided in fluid communication with the first fluid chamber, and another chamber inlet and another chamber outlet may be provided in fluid communication with the second fluid chamber. The chamber inlets to the first and second fluid chambers may be in fluid communication with a common single pump inlet, and the chamber outlets from the first and second fluid chambers may be in fluid communication with a common single pump outlet, such that fluid may be drawn into the pump through the pump inlet from a single fluid source, and fluid may be expelled from the pump through a single pump outlet. Check valves may be provided at the chamber inlet and outlet of each of the fluid chambers to ensure that fluid can only flow into the fluid chambers through the chamber inlets, and fluid can only flow out of the of the fluid chambers through the chamber outlets.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of such reciprocating fluid pumps are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,507, which issued Dec. 6, 1994 to Dunn et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,506, which issued September 24, 1996 to Simmons et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,893,707, which issued Apr. 13, 1999 to Simmons et al., U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> of the present invention. In some embodiments, the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> is configured to pump a subject fluid, such as, for example, a liquid (e.g., water, oil, acid, etc.), gas, or powdered substance, using a pressurized drive fluid such as, for example, compressed gas (e.g., air). Thus, in some embodiments, the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> may comprise a pneumatically operated liquid pump.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> includes a pump body <b>102</b>, which may comprise two or more components that may be assembled together to form the pump body <b>102</b>. For example, the pump body <b>102</b> may include a center body <b>104</b>, a first end piece <b>106</b> that may be attached to the center body <b>104</b> on a first side thereof, and a second end piece <b>108</b> that may be attached to the center body <b>104</b> on an opposite, second side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a schematic cross-sectional illustration of the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pump body <b>102</b> may include therein a first cavity <b>110</b> and a second cavity <b>112</b>. A first plunger <b>120</b> may be disposed within the first cavity <b>110</b>, and a second plunger <b>122</b> may be disposed within the second cavity <b>112</b>. The plungers <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may each be formed of and comprise a flexible polymer material (e.g., an elastomer or a thermoplastic material). As discussed in further detail below, each of the plungers <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may comprise, for example, a diaphragm or a bellows (as shown in the figures), such that the plungers <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may be longitudinally extended and compressed as the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> is cycled (i.e., in the left and right horizontal directions from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) during operation thereof. The first plunger <b>120</b> may divide the first cavity <b>110</b> into a first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> on a first side of the first plunger <b>120</b> and a first drive fluid chamber <b>127</b> on an opposite, second side of the first plunger <b>120</b>. Similarly, the second plunger <b>122</b> may divide the second cavity <b>112</b> into a second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> on a first side of the second plunger <b>122</b> and a second drive fluid chamber <b>129</b> on an opposite, second side of the second plunger <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A peripheral edge of the first plunger <b>120</b> may be attached to the pump body <b>102</b>, and a fluid tight seal may be provided between the pump body <b>102</b> and the first plunger <b>120</b>. Similarly, a peripheral edge of the second plunger <b>122</b> may be attached to the pump body <b>102</b>, and a fluid tight seal may be provided between the pump body <b>102</b> and the second plunger <b>122</b>. The reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> includes a subject fluid inlet <b>114</b> and a subject fluid outlet <b>116</b>. During operation of the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b>, subject fluid may be drawn into the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> through the subject fluid inlet <b>114</b> and expelled out from the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> through the subject fluid outlet <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A first subject fluid inlet <b>130</b> may be provided in the pump body <b>102</b> that leads from the subject fluid inlet <b>114</b> into the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> through the pump body <b>102</b>, and a first subject fluid outlet <b>134</b> may be provided in the pump body <b>102</b> that leads out from the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> to the subject fluid outlet <b>116</b> through the pump body <b>102</b>. Similarly, a second subject fluid inlet <b>132</b> may be provided in the pump body <b>102</b> that leads from the subject fluid inlet <b>114</b> into the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> through the pump body <b>102</b>, and a second subject fluid outlet <b>136</b> may be provided in the pump body <b>102</b> that leads out from the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> to the subject fluid outlet <b>116</b> through the pump body <b>102</b>. Furthermore, a first subject fluid inlet check valve <b>131</b> may be provided proximate the first subject fluid inlet <b>130</b> to ensure that fluid is capable of flowing into the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> through the first subject fluid inlet <b>130</b>, but incapable of flowing out from the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> through the first subject fluid inlet <b>130</b>. A first subject fluid outlet check valve <b>135</b> may be provided proximate the first subject fluid outlet <b>134</b> to ensure that fluid is capable of flowing out from the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> through the first subject fluid outlet <b>134</b>, but incapable of flowing into the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> through the first subject fluid outlet <b>134</b>. Similarly, a second subject fluid inlet check valve <b>133</b> may be provided proximate the second subject fluid inlet <b>132</b> to ensure that fluid is capable of flowing into the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> through the second subject fluid inlet <b>132</b>, but incapable of flowing out from the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> through the second subject fluid inlet <b>132</b>. A second subject fluid outlet check valve <b>137</b> may be provided proximate the second subject fluid outlet <b>136</b> to ensure that fluid is capable of flowing out from the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> through the second subject fluid outlet <b>136</b>, but incapable of flowing into the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> through the second subject fluid outlet <b>136</b>. Each of the check valves <b>131</b>, <b>133</b>, <b>135</b>, and <b>137</b> may be any suitable valve that allows flow in one direction and restricts flow in an opposite direction, such as, for example, a ball check valve, a diaphragm check valve, a magnet check valve, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment of a magnet check valve <b>230</b> of the present disclosure that employs the use of one or more magnets to assist in restricting flow in at least one direction. The magnet check valve <b>230</b> may include a valve housing <b>232</b> with a valve seat <b>233</b>. A ball <b>234</b> may be configured to seal against the valve seat <b>233</b> of the valve housing <b>232</b> to restrict flow through the valve housing <b>232</b> in at least one direction (e.g., from left to right in the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The ball <b>234</b> may comprise a magnet and/or a magnetic material (e.g., a ferrous material). For example, the ball <b>234</b> may include an internal magnet <b>236</b> surrounded by a non-magnetic material (e.g., a polymer). In other embodiments, the entire ball <b>234</b> may be formed of a magnet. The magnet check valve <b>230</b> may also include an external magnet <b>238</b> configured to magnetically pull on the ball <b>234</b> to force it against the valve seat <b>233</b>. The external magnet <b>238</b> may comprise a permanent magnet or an electromagnetic device. By way of example and not limitation, the external magnet <b>238</b> may encircle an outer surface of the valve housing <b>232</b>. The configuration of the magnet check valve <b>230</b> may be tailored to allow flow through the magnet check valve <b>230</b> from right to left (from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) at a predetermined pressure and/or flow rate. For example, when sufficient fluid pressure is present on the right side (from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the ball <b>234</b>, the magnetic force between the external magnet <b>238</b> and the internal magnet <b>236</b> may be overcome and the ball <b>234</b> may be forced away from the valve seat <b>233</b> to open the magnet check valve <b>230</b> and allow flow therethrough. When such pressure and/or flow falls below a certain level, the external magnet <b>238</b> may pull on the internal magnet <b>236</b> of the ball <b>234</b> and the ball <b>234</b> may seal against the valve seat <b>233</b> again. In this manner the internal magnet <b>236</b> and the external magnet <b>238</b> may work to restrict flow through the magnet check valve <b>230</b> from the left to the right (from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although the magnet check valve <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown by way of example with a ball <b>234</b> that seals against the valve seat <b>233</b> to close the magnet check valve <b>230</b>, the present disclosure is not so limited. For example, a magnet check valve of the present disclosure may be a diaphragm or other type check valve that includes at least one magnet configured to assist in the sealing of the check valve and restricting flow therethrough in at least one direction.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the subject fluid inlets <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> leading to the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> and the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b>, respectively, may be in fluid communication with the subject fluid inlet <b>114</b>, and the subject fluid outlets <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> leading out from the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> and the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> may be in fluid communication with the subject fluid outlet <b>116</b>, such that subject fluid may be drawn into the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> through the subject fluid inlet <b>114</b> from a single fluid source, and subject fluid may be expelled from the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> through the subject fluid outlet <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the configuration described above, the first plunger <b>120</b> is capable of extending in the rightward direction and compressing in the leftward direction from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Similarly, the second plunger <b>122</b> is capable of extending in the leftward direction and compressing in the rightward direction from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As the first plunger <b>120</b> extends and the second plunger <b>122</b> compresses, the volume of the first drive fluid chamber <b>127</b> increases, the volume of the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> decreases, the volume of the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> increases, and the volume of the second drive fluid chamber <b>129</b> decreases. As a result, subject fluid may be expelled from the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> through the first subject fluid outlet <b>134</b>, and subject fluid may be drawn into the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> through the second subject fluid inlet <b>132</b>. The first plunger <b>120</b> may be extended and the second plunger <b>122</b> may be compressed by providing pressurized drive fluid within the first drive fluid chamber <b>127</b>. One or more magnetic devices may be used to compress, or at least assist in compression of the second plunger <b>122</b> responsive to extension of the first plunger <b>120</b>, as discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Conversely, as the second plunger <b>122</b> extends and the first plunger <b>120</b> compresses, the volume of the second drive fluid chamber <b>129</b> increases, the volume of the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> decreases, the volume of the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> increases, and the volume of the first drive fluid chamber <b>127</b> decreases. As a result, subject fluid may be expelled from the second subject fluid chamber <b>128</b> through the second subject fluid outlet <b>136</b>, and subject fluid may be drawn into the first subject fluid chamber <b>126</b> through the first subject fluid inlet <b>130</b>. The second plunger <b>122</b> may be extended and the first plunger <b>120</b> may be compressed by providing pressurized drive fluid within the second drive fluid chamber <b>129</b>. One or more magnetic devices may be used to compress, or at least assist in compression of the first plunger <b>120</b> responsive to extension of the second plunger <b>122</b>, as discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> may include one or more magnets. For example, the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> may include at least one magnet carried by at least one of the first plunger <b>120</b> and the second plunger <b>122</b>, and the at least one magnet may be located and configured to impart a force on the at least one of the first plunger <b>120</b> and the second plunger <b>122</b> when the plunger <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> expands and compresses in the reciprocating action within the pump body <b>102</b> responsive to a proximate magnetic field, which may be generated by another magnet. The another magnet may be a permanent magnet or an electromagnetic device, and may be disposed in or on the pump body <b>102</b> or outside the pump body <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b> includes a first magnet <b>138</b>A carried by the first plunger <b>120</b>, a second magnet <b>138</b>B carried by the second plunger <b>122</b>, and a third magnet <b>138</b>C disposed within the pump body <b>102</b>. The third magnet <b>138</b>C may be disposed within the center body <b>104</b> between the first plunger <b>120</b> and the second plunger <b>122</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The third magnet <b>138</b>C may be a permanent magnet or an electromagnetic device. The first plunger <b>120</b> may comprise a tubular body having a first closed end and an opposite, second open end. The tubular body of the first plunger <b>120</b> may have an end wall at the first closed end and a sidewall extending from the end wall toward the opposite, second open end of the tubular body. The first magnet <b>138</b>A may be carried by the end wall at the first closed end of the tubular body of the first plunger <b>120</b>. Similarly, the second plunger <b>122</b> may comprise a tubular body having a first closed end and an opposite, second open end. The tubular body of the second plunger <b>122</b> may have an end wall at the first closed end and a sidewall extending from the end wall toward the opposite, second open end of the tubular body. The second magnet <b>138</b>B may be carried by the end wall at the first closed end of the tubular body of the second plunger <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each of the magnets <b>138</b>A, <b>138</b>B, <b>138</b>C may comprise, for example, a permanent magnet that is at least substantially comprised of a magnetic material. The magnetic material may comprise, for example, a rare earth element (i.e., each of the magnets <b>138</b>A, <b>138</b>B, <b>138</b>C may comprise a permanent rare earth magnet). As non-limiting examples, the magnetic material may comprise at least one of a samarium cobalt alloy and a neodymium iron alloy. In some embodiments, the pump body <b>102</b> and other components of the reciprocating fluid pump <b>100</b>, with the exception of the magnets <b>138</b>A, <b>138</b>B, <b>138</b>C, may be at least substantially comprised of a non-magnetic material, such as a polymer and/or a non-magnetic metal. By way of example and not limitation, such a polymer may comprise one or more of a fluoropolymer, neoprene, buna-N, ethylene diene M-class (EPDM), VITON&#xae;, polyurethane, HYTREL&#xae;, SANTOPRENE&#xae;, fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP), perfluoroalkoxy fluorocarbon resin (PFA), ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymer (ECTFE), ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (ETFE), nylon, polyethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), NORDEL&#x2122;, and nitrile. By way of example and not limitation, such a non-magnetic metal may comprise one or more of a stainless steel, INCONEL&#xae;, MONEL&#xae;, HASTELLOY&#xae;, a high nickel alloy, brass, copper, bronze, aluminum, and zinc.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The magnets <b>138</b>A, <b>138</b>B, <b>138</b>C may be located, oriented, and configured to impart a force on each of the plungers <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> as the plungers <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> expand and compress in the reciprocating action within the pump body <b>102</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the reciprocating fluid pump <b>270</b> may function similarly to the reciprocating fluid pump <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as described above. For example, the first magnet <b>138</b>A carried by the first plunger <b>120</b> may be located and oriented to impart a force on the first plunger <b>120</b> responsive to a proximate magnetic field provided by the second magnet <b>138</b>B carried by the second plunger <b>122</b>, and the second magnet <b>138</b>B carried by the second plunger <b>122</b> may be located and oriented to impart a force on the second plunger <b>122</b> responsive to a proximate magnetic field provided by the first magnet <b>138</b>A carried by the first plunger <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">However, the presence of the magnetic field baffle <b>139</b> in the reciprocating fluid pump <b>270</b> of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may alter the magnetic field provided by the first magnet <b>138</b>A and the second magnet <b>138</b>B and change the magnitude of the force imparted between the first magnet <b>138</b>A and the second magnet <b>138</b>B. For example, the first magnet <b>138</b>A and the second magnet <b>138</b>B may be located a distance apart from each other and experience a magnetic force based on that distance. As the distance between the first magnet <b>138</b>A and the second magnet <b>138</b>B increases, the force may decrease.

The magnetic field baffle <b>139</b> of the reciprocating fluid pump <b>270</b> may enable the first plunger <b>120</b> and the second plunger <b>122</b> to expand and compress with a reduced force imparted by the first magnet <b>138</b>A and the second magnet <b>138</b>B when they are relatively more distant from each other.
