<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a national phase of PCT/JP2010/54039, filed Mar. 10, 2010, and is based on, and claims priority from, Japanese Application Number 2009-91505, filed Apr. 3, 2009.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to manufacturing methods and manufacturing apparatuses of composite sheets of absorbent articles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A disposable diaper and the like have conventionally been known as an example of an absorbent article that absorbs body waste fluid. In its manufacturing line, a continuous body of a sheet that is transported continuously in a transporting direction is attached continuously with a continuous body of an elastic member in a meander pattern such as a sine curve.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As an example of such an attaching method, PTL 1 discloses attaching an elastic member to the sheet while oscillating it, by arranging an oscillating arm that oscillates in a direction intersecting a transporting direction of a sheet in the vicinity of a transporting path of a sheet, and passing a threadlike elastic member through a through hole in an oscillating end of the oscillating arm.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, PTL 2 discloses, as shown in a perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, putting an elastic member <b>221</b> around a rolling roller <b>203</b> that rolls around an outer circumferential face of a transfer roll <b>201</b>, by reciprocating the rolling roller <b>203</b> in a rotational axis C<b>201</b> direction of the transfer roll <b>201</b>, the elastic member <b>221</b> is sucked and held in a meander pattern such as a sine curve on an outer circumferential face of the transfer roll <b>201</b>, and then a sheet <b>231</b> is made to contact the outer circumferential face of the transfer roll <b>201</b> to handover the elastic member <b>221</b> to the sheet <b>231</b> and to attach it thereon.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">In the case of using a strip member with a certain width (hereafter, also referred to as an elastic strip member) as the above described elastic member, however, with the above method in PTL1, the elastic strip member is folded when passing the through hole in the oscillating end and the like, and as a result, it is difficult to make the elastic strip member surface-contact the sheet and attach it thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">On the other hand, with the method in PTL2, the elastic member <b>221</b> is put around the outer circumferential face of the rolling roller <b>203</b>, therefore even in the case where the elastic member <b>221</b> is the elastic strip member, the elastic strip member <b>221</b> can be maintained in a flat state and transferred to the transfer roll <b>201</b>, and as a result, the elastic strip member <b>221</b> can be made to surface-contact the sheet <b>231</b> and be attached thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">As shown in for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, however, when arranging a pair of the elastic strip members <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> in a CD direction that is orthogonal to the transporting direction, and attaching them to sheet <b>231</b> in an arrangement pattern in which these elastic strip members <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> intersect each other partially, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, these rolling rollers <b>203</b>, <b>203</b> are aligned in the same positions in a circumferential direction of the transfer roll <b>201</b>, so that they will collide against each other when reciprocating in the CD direction. As a result, the elastic strip member <b>221</b> cannot be attached in such an arrangement pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">The present invention has been made in view of the above conventional problems, and an object is to provide a manufacturing method and a manufacturing apparatus of a composite sheet of an absorbent article in which surface-contact of at least a continuous body of a pair of elastic strip members to a continuous body of the sheet can be certainly achieved, when surface-contacting and attaching each of at least the continuous body of the pair of elastic strip members to the continuous body of the sheet in a predetermined meander pattern, and in which these elastic strip members can be attached to the sheet without any problem in an arrangement pattern in which the elastic strip members partially intersect or are close to each other.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0038">With the description in this specification and the attached drawings, at least the matters below will become clear.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">A manufacturing method of a composite sheet of an absorbent article in which a continuous body of an elastic strip member is joined in a predetermined meander pattern in respect to a continuous body of a sheet that is continuously transported in a transporting direction, the method including:</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">a first joining of joining a continuous body of a first elastic strip member to a continuous body of a sheet by feeding and surface-contacting the continuous body of the first elastic strip member to the continuous body of the sheet, via a first oscillating arm that oscillates in a direction intersecting the transporting direction with a first spindle portion as a swivel center; and</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">a second joining of joining a continuous body of a second elastic strip member to the continuous body of the sheet by feeding and surface-contacting the continuous body of the second elastic strip member to the continuous body of the sheet, via a second oscillating arm that oscillates in a direction intersecting the transporting direction with a second spindle portion as a swivel center,</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">wherein the first oscillating arm includes a first oscillating end side roller provided to an oscillating end side of the first oscillating arm and a first spindle portion side roller provided to the first spindle portion side,</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">wherein the second oscillating arm includes a second oscillating end side roller provided to an oscillating end side of the second oscillating arm and a second spindle portion side roller provided to the second spindle portion side,</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">wherein in the first joining, the continuous body of the first elastic strip member supplied toward the first spindle portion side roller through a first supply route is subsequently put around an outer circumferential face of the first spindle portion side roller and an outer circumferential face of the first oscillating end side roller, and, after being reversed in a travel direction with the first oscillating end side roller, is placed on the continuous body of the sheet and joined thereon,</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">wherein in the second joining, the continuous body of the second elastic strip member supplied toward the second spindle portion side roller through a second supply route is subsequently put around an outer circumferential face of the second spindle portion side roller and an outer circumferential face of the second oscillating end side roller, and, after being reversed in the travel direction with the second oscillating end side roller, is placed on the continuous body of the sheet and joined thereon,</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">wherein a first placing position where the continuous body of the first elastic strip member is to be placed on the continuous body of the sheet with the first oscillating arm and a second placing position where the continuous body of the second elastic strip member is to be placed on the continuous body of the sheet with the second oscillating arm are different from each other in the transporting direction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">With the manufacturing method of the composite sheet of the absorbent article, the first placing position of the first oscillating arm and the second placing position of the second oscillating arm are different from each other in the transporting direction of the sheet, so that interference between the first elastic strip member and the second elastic strip member when oscillating can be avoided. As a result, even with an arrangement pattern in which the meander pattern of the first elastic strip member to be attached to the sheet with the first oscillating arm and the meander pattern of the second elastic strip member to be attached to the sheet with the second oscillating arm partially intersect each other or come close to each other, these first and second elastic strip members can be attached without any problem.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">Further, the first elastic strip member and the second elastic strip member are each placed on the sheet, after being reversed in the travel direction with the first oscillating end side roller and the second oscillating end side roller. Then, when reversing, each of these first and second elastic strip members are wrapped around the outer circumferential face of the first and the second oscillating end side roller with a predetermined wraparound angle, and with the outer circumferential face, each of these elastic strip members are restrained in a flat shape, and as a result are maintained in a flat shape in the first and the second placing positions. Thus, the first and the second elastic strip members can be certainly surface-contacted and joined to the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">A manufacturing method of a composite sheet of an absorbent article, preferably</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">wherein the continuous body of the sheet is wrapped in a predetermined wraparound angle around an outer circumferential face of a transporting roll that rotates around a predetermined rotational axis with a direction along the transporting direction as a circumferential direction and transported,</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">wherein both the first placing position of the first oscillating arm and the second placing position of the second oscillating arm are set within a range of the wraparound angle,</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">wherein the second placing position is set to a downstream side than the first placing position in the circumferential direction,</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">wherein the second oscillating arm is arranged in a position where the first oscillating arm has rotationally moved to a downstream side in the circumferential direction by only a predetermined rotating angle (excluding 0&#xb0; and 360&#xb0;) around an imaginary axis parallel to the rotational axis of the transporting roll.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">With the manufacturing method of the composite sheet of the absorbent article, making the manufacturing apparatus of the manufacturing method compact, and improving a joining position precision of the first elastic strip member and the second elastic strip member on the sheet can be both successfully achieved. The details are as below.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">The second oscillating arm is arranged in a position where the first oscillating arm has been rotatingly moved by just the rotating angle around an imaginary axis. Thus, while certainly avoiding interference between the first oscillating arm and the second oscillating arm, the size of a space needed to avoid the interference can be made small. As a result, the manufacturing apparatus of the manufacturing method can be made compact.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">Further, with the rotational movement, a relative positional relationship between the first oscillating end side roller and the transporting roll, and between the second oscillating end side roller and the transporting roll are substantially maintained. Thus, both the first oscillating end side roller and the second oscillating end side roller can each be closely arranged to the transporting roll, and therefore both the first elastic strip member and the second elastic strip member can be attached at a high precision to the target joining position on the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">A manufacturing method of a composite sheet of an absorbent article,</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">wherein preferably the rotating angle is an arbitrary value in a range of 30&#xb0; to 150&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">With the manufacturing method of the composite sheet of the absorbent article, making the manufacturing apparatus of the manufacturing method compact and improving the joining position precision of the first elastic strip member and the second elastic strip member on the sheet can be both successfully certainly achieved.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0062">wherein both the first placing position of the first oscillating arm and the second placing position of the second oscillating arm are set within the wraparound angle range,</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">wherein a rotational central axis of the first spindle portion of the first oscillating arm and a rotational central axis of the second spindle portion of the second oscillating arm are facing directions intersecting each other in an imaginary plane with the rotational axis direction of the transporting roll as a direction of the normal.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">With the manufacturing method of the composite sheet of the absorbent article, the first oscillating arm and the second oscillating arm are arranged so as to intersect with each other in the imaginary plane.

<p id="p-0072" num="0072">With the manufacturing method of the composite sheet of the absorbent article, the first elastic strip member is fed to the first spindle portion side roller along the rotational central axis direction of the first spindle portion. Thus, movement in an intersecting direction of the first elastic strip member that may occur due to the oscillating movement of the first oscillating arm mainly appears as a twist of a portion of the first elastic strip member positioned to the upstream side than the first spindle portion side roller and is absorbed therein, and thus the falling off of the first elastic strip member from the first spindle portion side roller can be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">Similarly, the second elastic strip member is fed to the second spindle portion side roller along the rotational central axis direction of the second spindle portion.

<p id="p-0102" num="0102">Further, the crotch area <b>1</b><i>b </i>and its proximity is provided with a front elastic strip member <b>21</b> and a back elastic strip member <b>22</b> across and along a width direction of the diaper <b>1</b>. As these elastic strip members <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, for example, nonwoven fabric having stretchability or strip shaped rubber and the like is used. These elastic strip members <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> each extend in a width direction in a predetermined meander pattern that is curved in a convex shape toward a center line CL that divides the diaper <b>1</b> substantially in half to the front and back in the longitudinal direction, and the elastic strip members <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are provided in between the inner sheet <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the outer sheet <b>3</b><i>b </i>that structure the back face sheet <b>3</b> and, for example, are joined to an inner face of the outer sheet <b>3</b><i>b </i>in a stretched state. These front and back elastic strip members <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> cooperate to give elasticity to the around-leg concave portions <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0103">Note that, here, a sine curve is illustrated as an example as the meander pattern of these elastic strip members <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, but the meander pattern can be appropriately changed so that the around-leg convex portions <b>10</b> can effectively fit around the leg of the wearer of the diaper.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0104">Further, in order to increase fitting around substantially the entire length of the around-leg concave portion <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the elastic strip members <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> may be arranged to intersect each other at the returning portion of each meander pattern, and further in order to weaken the elasticity in the intersecting region R, a portion of the elastic strip members <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> belonging to the intersecting region R can be divided. Incidentally, elasticity of this intersected region R is weakened because if there is elasticity at the absorbent body <b>4</b> portion, creases are formed in the absorbent body <b>4</b>, and there is fear that fluid absorption performance may deteriorate.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0105">Such a diaper <b>1</b> is to be completed by a base material of the diaper <b>1</b> that is continuously flowing in the manufacturing line being joined and the like with various structural components. The manufacturing method and the manufacturing apparatus <b>30</b> of the composite sheet according to this embodiment carry out one of the processes. That is, here the manufacturing method and the manufacturing apparatus <b>30</b> are applied in a process of attaching in the above-described meander pattern a continuous body of an elastic strip member <b>121</b> to be the above-described front elastic strip member <b>21</b> (corresponds to a continuous body of a first elastic strip member, herein also referred to as a first elastic strip member <b>121</b>) and a continuous body of an elastic strip member <b>122</b> to be the above-described back elastic strip member <b>21</b> (corresponds to a continuous body of a second elastic strip member, herein also referred to as a second elastic strip member <b>122</b>) to a continuous body of a sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>to be an outer sheet <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the above-described back face sheet <b>3</b> (herein referred to as a sheet <b>103</b><i>b</i>).</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0107">Note that, hereinbelow, a width direction of the manufacturing apparatus <b>30</b> is referred to as a CD direction or front side-back side. Further, a direction that is perpendicular to the CD direction is referred to as an MD direction. That is, the MD direction is an arbitrary direction in a plane that is perpendicular to the CD direction. Further, regarding the MD direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the two direction that are perpendicular to each other are defined as an up-down direction (vertical direction) and a left-right direction (horizontal direction). Incidentally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the CD direction is also in a horizontal direction, and is in a perpendicular relation to the left-right direction in the horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">This manufacturing apparatus <b>30</b> includes (1) a transporting roll <b>50</b> that transports the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>in the MD direction (corresponds to the transporting direction) by wrapping the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>around in a predetermined wrapping angle and rotating, (2) a slitting apparatus <b>40</b> arranged to a left side of the transporting roll <b>50</b> and that divides in two in the center in the CD direction a sheet member <b>120</b>, that is an original sheet made of an elastic strip member that is sent continuously from the left, and forms first and second elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, (3) a first guide member <b>60</b> that continuously places the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> in a stretched state to a portion of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>that is wrapped around an outer circumferential face of the transporting roll <b>50</b> and joins them, and (4) a second guide member <b>160</b> that continuously places the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> in a stretched state to a portion of the same sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>and joins them.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">These first and second guide members <b>60</b>, <b>160</b> each feed the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> that they are in charge of toward the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>in the MD direction and reciprocates each of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> in the CD direction (corresponds to an intersecting direction). Thus, each of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> are overlapped on the sheet face of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>and joined while the joining position to the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>in the CD direction is changed every moment continuously. As a result, the sheet face of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>is attached in a surface-contact state with a pair of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> in an intended meander pattern such as a since curve.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0110">Incidentally, it is needless to say that before joining each of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> to the sheet <b>103</b><i>b</i>, a hot-melt adhesive and the like is to be applied to each of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> by an adhesive applying apparatus that is not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0111">Hereinbelow, each structural element <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>160</b> is described.

That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, at a back side in the CD direction (a back side of a plane of paper in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) is provided the support wall <b>92</b> along a direction substantially parallel to the MD direction (a direction substantially parallel to the plane of paper). A vertical wall face of this support wall <b>92</b> supports portions at the back side in the CD direction of each structural device, and portions at the front side are in a not supported state.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0112">(1) Transporting Roll <b>50</b></p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0113">The transporting roll <b>50</b> has a cylindrical body with a rotational axis C<b>50</b> in the horizontal CD direction as a main body, and rotates anti-clockwise in a predetermined peripheral speed in a direction along the MD direction as a circumferential direction Dc. This transporting roll <b>50</b> is supplied with the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>from the right substantially horizontally, for example. With an approximately 12 o'clock position at an upper portion of the transporting roll <b>50</b> as a wrap around starting position Ps, the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>is wrapped around an outer circumferential face of the transporting roll <b>50</b>, from the position Ps at a wrap around angle of, for example, 180&#xb0; to 200&#xb0;, and its transporting direction is reversed. Ultimately, the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>is fed to the right in the substantially horizontal direction, with an approximately 6 o'clock position at a lower portion of the transporting roll <b>50</b> as a wrap around finishing position Pe.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0114">This transporting roll <b>50</b> may be structured as a drive roll that rotatingly drives with an appropriate motor and the like as a driving source, or may be structured as a follower roll that is rotatingly driven by the sheet <b>103</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0115">(2) Slitting Apparatus <b>40</b></p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0116">A slitting apparatus <b>40</b> has a top and bottom pair of discal rotating blades <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>in the center in the CD direction. When passing these rotating blades <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, the sheet member <b>120</b> that is an original plate of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> is divided in half, and thereby a pair of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, namely the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> and the second elastic strip member <b>122</b>, is produced. The first elastic strip member <b>121</b> is fed to a first guide member <b>60</b> and the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> is fed to a second guide member <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0117">(3) First Guide Member <b>60</b></p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0118">The first guide member <b>60</b> has a tabular first oscillating arm <b>61</b> provided above the transporting roll <b>50</b>. The first oscillating arm <b>61</b> has a longitudinal direction and, with the longitudinal direction to the left and right in the horizontal direction, is arranged so as to cross over the rotational axis C<b>50</b> of the transporting roll <b>50</b> left and right in the horizontal direction. Then, with a spindle portion <b>65</b> (hereafter also referred to as a first spindle portion <b>65</b>) positioned to the left than the rotational axis C<b>50</b> as a swivel fulcrum, the oscillating end <b>61</b><i>a </i>positioned to the right than the rotational axis C<b>50</b> can be made to oscillate in the CD direction.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0119">Further, the first spindle portion <b>65</b> is, for example, a shaft body <b>65</b> that protrudes integrally and upwards from a top surface of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b>, and is rotatably supported inside an outer cylindrical member <b>66</b> via bearings <b>67</b>. The outer cylindrical member <b>66</b> is fixed to the support wall <b>92</b> via an appropriate bracket that is not shown, and thus the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> is supported to be able to swivel around a vertical rotational central axis C<b>65</b> of the first spindle portion <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0120">Further, a drive mechanism <b>70</b> of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> is a motor <b>72</b> combined with a crank mechanism <b>74</b>. A crank mechanism <b>74</b> has on a drive rotating axis <b>72</b><i>a </i>of the motor <b>72</b> in an up-down direction in the MD direction a circular disk member <b>75</b> that has been fixed integrally and concentrically and a rod-shaped link member <b>76</b> that connects the disk member <b>75</b> and a power point PP of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b>. Then, a position eccentric from a drive rotating axis <b>72</b><i>a </i>in the disk member <b>75</b> is connected with an end portion of the link member <b>76</b> by a coupling pin <b>78</b> or the like. Thus, every time the disk member <b>75</b> rotates once, the link member <b>76</b> is reciprocated once only in its longitudinal direction, and the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> performs an oscillating movement only once by this one reciprocating movement.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0121">On a lower surface which is a surface to a side opposing the transporting roll <b>50</b> of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> is rotatably supported a pair of rollers <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> around each of the horizontal rotational axes C<b>63</b>, C<b>64</b>. One roller <b>63</b> is a first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> provided to an oscillating end <b>61</b><i>a</i>, and the other roller <b>64</b> is a first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> provided to a position closer to the first spindle portion <b>65</b> than the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0122">Thus, the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> that is fed from the above-described slitting apparatus <b>40</b> is first fed from the left to the right along the horizontal direction, the travel direction is changed upwards in the vertical direction with the reversal roller <b>90</b> at a position that matches a plane position of the rotational central axis C<b>65</b> of the first spindle portion <b>65</b> of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b>, and the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> reaches the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> and is put around the outer circumferential face of the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b>. Then, with the roller <b>64</b>, the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> is guided to the oscillating end <b>61</b><i>a </i>that is to the right than transporting roll <b>50</b>, thereafter wrapped around the outer circumferential face of the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> at the oscillating end <b>61</b><i>a</i>, and after being reversed in the travel direction substantially to the left by the wrapping, is placed in the wraparound range Ps-Pe of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>from the upper right of the transporting roll <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0123">Then, during the above placing, the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> reciprocates in the CD direction due to the oscillating movement of the oscillating end <b>61</b><i>a</i>, thus the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> is joined to a sheet face of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>in a desired meander pattern with its joining position in the sheet face of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>being continuously changed in the CD direction. Further, at the time of this placing, the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> is restrained in a substantially flat shape by wrapping around the outer circumferential face of the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> and an outer circumferential face of the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b>, so that the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> is joined to the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>in a surface-contact state (corresponds to a &#x201c;first joining&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0124">Here, preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the position P<b>1</b> (hereafter, also referred to as first placing position P<b>1</b>) at which the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> is placed on the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>with the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> is set in a region to an upstream side than a middle position Pm in the circumferential direction Dc in the above wraparound range Ps-Pe. With this setting, the region to overlap and press against the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> on the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>of the transporting roll <b>50</b> can be widely ensured along the circumferential direction Dc, and as a result, the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> can be strongly joined to the sheet <b>103</b><i>b</i>. Note that, to elaborate on the above-described first placing position P<b>1</b>, the first placing position P<b>1</b> refers to a position where the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> fed from the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> first contacts the sheet <b>103</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0125">By the way, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, each of the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> and the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> is arranged on a line L<b>1</b> connecting the oscillating end <b>61</b><i>a </i>and the rotational central axis C<b>65</b> of the first spindle portion <b>65</b>. Further, the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> is fixed to the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> so that its direction to the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> is unchangeable, in a state the outer circumferential face is facing the rotational central axis C<b>65</b> of the first spindle portion <b>65</b>, while, the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> is also fixed to the first oscillating arm <b>61</b>, so that its direction to the arm <b>61</b> is unchangeable, in a state the outer circumferential face of the roller <b>64</b> is facing the oscillating end <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0126">Thus, with this configuration, in accordance with the reciprocating movement of the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b>, the outer circumferential face of the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> is always facing the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b>, thus, the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> can be certainly fed toward the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b>. As a result, the falling off of the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> from the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> can be effectively prevented and the like, and stability of the travel state of the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0127">Further, in accordance with the above configuration, the rotational axis C<b>63</b> of the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> and the rotational axis C<b>64</b> of the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> are always maintained in a parallel state, regardless of the oscillation movement of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b>. Thus, a tension difference to both end edges in the width direction of the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> that may occur with the oscillation movement of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> can be certainly eased, and as a result, the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> falling off from the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> or the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> can be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0128">To further stabilize the travel state, as shown in, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the supply route R<b>121</b> (hereafter, also referred to as first supply route R<b>121</b>) of the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> to the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> is aligned in a straight line with the rotational central axis C<b>65</b> of the first spindle portion <b>65</b>, and the roller <b>64</b> is arranged so that the outer circumferential face of the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> is in contact with the rotational central axis C<b>65</b> of the first spindle portion <b>65</b>. Thus, the movement of the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> in the CD direction that may occur with the oscillation movement of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> mainly appears as a twist in the portion <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> to the upstream side than the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> and is absorbed therein, and as a result, the falling off of the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> from the roller <b>64</b> can be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0129">Further, as described above, the outer circumferential face of the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> is in contact with the rotational central axis C<b>65</b> of the first spindle portion <b>65</b>, so that the movement amount in the CD direction of the roller <b>64</b> that may occur with the oscillation movement of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> can be made to substantially zero, and also with this, the falling off of the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> from the first spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> can be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0130">(4) The Second Guide Member <b>160</b></p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0131">The second guide member <b>160</b> is a member with roughly the same structure as the above-described first guide member <b>60</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the second guide member <b>160</b> is arranged more to the back side than the first guide member <b>60</b> in the CD direction. Thus, the second elastic strip member <b>122</b>, that this second guide member <b>160</b> is in charge of, is attached more to the back side in the CD direction than the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> and in parallel thereto, the elastic strip member <b>121</b> being attached to the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>by the first guide member <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0132">However, depending on the disposable diaper <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), an arrangement pattern of the first and the second elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> in which the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> (<b>221</b>) and the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> (<b>221</b>) are partially overlapped is possible. In that case, if the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> and the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> are arranged in parallel, these oscillating arms <b>61</b>, <b>161</b> will come in collision with each other and cannot form the above-described pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0133">In this embodiment, in order to avoid the above collision, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the position of the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> in a circumferential direction Dc of the transporting roll <b>50</b> is made different from that of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b>. That is, the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> is arranged displaced to a downstream side in the circumferential direction Dc than the first oscillating arm <b>61</b>. In accordance with this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a second placing position P<b>2</b> where the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> places the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> on the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>is positioned more to a downstream side in the circumferential direction Dc than the first placing position P<b>1</b> of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b>. Thus, interference between the first and the second elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> in the placing positions P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> can also be avoided. Incidentally, the above-described second placing position P<b>2</b> refers to a position that, as similar to the definition of the first placing position P<b>1</b>, the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> that has been fed from the second oscillating end side roller <b>163</b> of the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> first contacts the sheet <b>103</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0134">Hereafter, a structure of the second guide member <b>160</b> is described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0135">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> is at a position in which the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> is rotatingly moved to a downstream side in the circumferential direction Dc for a predetermined rotating angle &#x3b8;<i>a </i>only around an imaginary axis, that is not shown, parallel to the rotational axis C<b>50</b> of the transporting roll <b>50</b>, the rotating angle &#x3b8;<i>a </i>being 90&#xb0; in the shown example.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0136">With this 90&#xb0; rotational movement, the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> is arranged to the left of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> and the transporting roll <b>50</b>, and further the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> is arranged crossing over the rotational axis C<b>50</b> of the transporting roll <b>50</b> vertically in the vertical direction, with its longitudinal direction in the vertical direction. With the second spindle portion <b>165</b> that is positioned lower than the rotational axis C<b>50</b> as a swivel fulcrum, the oscillating end <b>161</b><i>a </i>positioned above the rotational axis C<b>50</b> is structured so as to be able to oscillate in the CD direction.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0137">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the driving mechanism <b>170</b> for the oscillating movement is the motor <b>172</b> combined with the crank mechanism <b>174</b>, as in the case for the first guide member <b>60</b>. Further, the second spindle <b>165</b> is a shaft body <b>165</b> that extends integrally and to the left from a left surface of the second oscillating arm <b>161</b>, as similar to the case with the first guide member <b>60</b>, and this shaft body <b>165</b> is supported rotatably in an outer cylindrical member <b>166</b> via the bearings <b>167</b>. Note that, the outer cylindrical member <b>166</b> is fixed to the support wall <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0138">Here, the second spindle portion <b>165</b> is formed with a through hole <b>165</b><i>h </i>along its rotational central axis C<b>165</b> direction, and corresponding to the through hole <b>165</b><i>h </i>the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> is also formed with a through hole <b>161</b><i>h </i>in the left to right direction. These through holes <b>165</b><i>h</i>, <b>61</b><i>h </i>serve as a supply route R<b>122</b> to the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> of the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0139">Further, on a right side surface of the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> which is a surface on a side opposing the transporting roll <b>50</b>, each of a pair of rollers <b>163</b>, <b>164</b> is rotatably supported around substantially horizontal rotating axes C<b>163</b>, C<b>164</b>. One roller <b>163</b> is a second oscillating end side roller <b>163</b> provided at an oscillating end <b>161</b><i>a</i>, and another roller <b>164</b> is a second spindle portion side roller <b>164</b> provided more to the second spindle portion <b>165</b> than the second oscillating end side roller <b>163</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0140">Therefore, the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> that is fed from the slitter apparatus <b>40</b> is fed from the left to the right in the horizontal direction, while being in parallel in the CD direction next to the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> that is to be sent to the above-described first guide member <b>60</b>. Then, the elastic strip member <b>122</b> passes through the through hole <b>65</b><i>h </i>in the second spindle portion <b>165</b> and exits in a surface to the right side of the second oscillating arm <b>161</b>. Then, by being put around the outer circumferential face of the second spindle portion side roller <b>164</b> installed on the same surface, the elastic strip member <b>122</b> is guided to the above oscillating end <b>161</b><i>a</i>, and thereafter, wrapped around the outer circumferential surface of the second oscillating end side roller <b>163</b> at the oscillating end <b>161</b><i>a </i>and after the travel direction is reversed substantially downwards with the wrapping, the elastic strip member <b>122</b> is placed in the wraparound range Ps to Pe of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>from the upper left of the transporting roll <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0141">Then, during the above placing, the second oscillating end side roller <b>163</b> reciprocates in the CD direction due to the oscillating movement of the oscillating end <b>161</b><i>a</i>, thus the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> is joined to a sheet face of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>in a desired meander pattern with its joining position in the sheet face of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>being continuously changed in the CD direction. Further, at the time of this placing, the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> is restrained in a substantially flat shape by wrapping around the outer circumferential face of the second spindle portion side roller <b>164</b> and an outer circumferential face of the second oscillating end side roller <b>163</b>, so that the elastic strip member <b>122</b> is joined to the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>in a surface-contact state (corresponds to a &#x201c;second joining&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0142">Here, preferably, similar to the case of the first placing position P<b>1</b> of the first elastic strip member <b>121</b>, the second placing position P<b>2</b> of the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> is set in a region to the upstream side than a middle position Pm of the circumferential direction Dc within the above wraparound range Ps-Pe (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). If the second placing position P<b>2</b> is set in this way, a region of the transporting roll <b>50</b> to overlap the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> on the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>and to press it against thereto can be obtained widely along the circumferential direction Dc, and as a result, the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> can be strongly joined to the sheet <b>103</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0143">Further, the above-described rotating angle &#x3b8;<i>a </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), namely, the rotating angle &#x3b8;<i>a </i>of the positional relationship between the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> and the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> is preferably selected from an angle excluding 0&#xb0; and 360&#xb0;, more preferably, is selected from a range of 30&#xb0;-150&#xb0;, further more preferably selected from a range of 45&#xb0;-135&#xb0;, and even more preferably selected from a range of 0&#xb0;-110&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0144">If P<b>2</b> is set to an arbitrary value in these ranges, while arranging both the first oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> and the second oscillating end side roller <b>163</b> close to the transporting roll <b>50</b>, a space occupied by the manufacturing apparatus <b>30</b> can be made small.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0145">For example, in the case where the rotational angle does not correspond to the above-described range, that is in the case the rotating angle &#x3b8;<i>a </i>is 0&#xb0;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the configuration of the manufacturing apparatus <b>30</b><i>a </i>is compact but the second oscillating end side roller <b>163</b> cannot be arranged close to the transporting roll <b>50</b>. Further, also in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> where the rotational angle does not correspond to the range, that is, in the case where the rotating angle &#x3b8;<i>a </i>is 180&#xb0;, both the first and the second oscillating end side rollers <b>63</b>, <b>163</b> can be arranged close to the transporting roll <b>50</b> but the configuration of the manufacturing apparatus <b>30</b><i>b </i>becomes large. That is, in either of the examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the close arrangement of the oscillating end side rollers <b>63</b>, <b>163</b> and making the manufacturing apparatus <b>30</b> compact cannot be both successfully achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0146">In contrast to this, in the case where the rotating angle &#x3b8;<i>a </i>is 90&#xb0; as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and the rotating angle is in a preferable range of the above-described rotating angle &#x3b8;<i>a</i>, and in the case where the rotating angle &#x3b8;<i>a </i>is 45&#xb0; as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, both the first and the second oscillating end side rollers <b>63</b>, <b>163</b> can be arranged close to the transporting roll <b>50</b>, and the manufacturing apparatuses <b>30</b>, <b>30</b><i>c </i>can be made compact. That is, the close arrangement of the oscillating end side rollers <b>63</b>, <b>163</b> and making the manufacturing apparatus <b>30</b> compact can be both successfully achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0147">By the way, the reason that each of the oscillating end side rollers <b>63</b>, <b>163</b> should be closely arranged to the transporting roll <b>50</b> is because if they are not closely arranged, the following property of the oscillating movements of each of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> in respect to the oscillating movements of each of the oscillating arms <b>61</b>, <b>161</b> deteriorates. Namely, in the case the rollers are not closely arranged, a portion of each of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> cast loose toward the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>from each of the oscillating end side rollers <b>63</b>, <b>163</b>, bends like a whip when reversing the oscillating movement, and a movement delay from each of the oscillating end side rollers <b>63</b>, <b>163</b> becomes large, and as a result the actual joining position of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>becomes easily displaced from a target joining position of each of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0148">Note that, a guideline of the close arrangement is exemplified below. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is exemplified that a distance between a position P<b>3</b> (P<b>4</b>) at which the elastic strip member <b>121</b> (<b>122</b>) comes apart from the outer circumferential face of the oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> (<b>163</b>) and a position P<b>1</b> (P<b>2</b>) at which the elastic strip member <b>121</b> (<b>122</b>) that has been cast loose from the position P<b>3</b> contacts the transporting roll <b>50</b> is made greater than 30 mm and smaller than 80 mm, in a state where the line L<b>1</b> of the oscillating arm <b>61</b> (<b>161</b>) is facing a direction parallel to the MD direction.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0149">By the way, the above described relative positional relationship of the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> in respect to the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> can be expressed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0150">The rotational central axis C<b>65</b> of the first spindle portion <b>65</b> of the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> and the rotational central axis C<b>165</b> of the second spindle portion <b>165</b> of the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> are facing a direction intersecting each other in an imaginary plane (a plane parallel to a paper plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that has the rotational axis C<b>50</b> direction of the transporting roll <b>50</b> as the direction of the normal, and the second oscillating arm <b>161</b> is arranged in respect to the first oscillating arm <b>61</b> so that the intersecting angle &#x3b8;<i>b </i>of the rotational central axis C<b>65</b> and the rotational central axis C<b>165</b> becomes 90&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0151">Here, as a preferable range of the intersecting angle &#x3b8;<i>b</i>, angles excluding 0&#xb0; and 360&#xb0; are given, more preferably a range of 30&#xb0;-150&#xb0; is given, further more preferably a range of 45&#xb0;-135&#xb0; is given, and even further more preferably a range of 80&#xb0;-110&#xb0; is given. Then, if the angle is set to an arbitrary value within these ranges, as described above, the close arrangement of the oscillating end side rollers <b>63</b>, <b>163</b> and making the manufacturing apparatus <b>30</b> compact can be both successfully achieved. Incidentally, the configuration example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> corresponds to a case where the above-described intersecting angle &#x3b8;<i>b </i>is 0&#xb0; or 360&#xb0;, the configuration example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> corresponds to a case where the intersecting angle &#x3b8;<i>b </i>is 180&#xb0;, the configuration example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> corresponds to the case where the angle is 45&#xb0;, and the configuration example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> corresponds to a case where the angle is 90&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0152">The configuration of the second guide member <b>160</b> has been described above, and the structure shown in below (a) to (c) are all the same as those for the first guide member <b>60</b>, and therefore their detailed description is omitted.

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0153" num="0156">The embodiments of the present invention have been described above, but the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, and below modifications are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0157">In the above-described embodiment, the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>is wrapped around the transporting roll <b>50</b> at a predetermined wraparound angle and transported, and the first elastic strip member <b>121</b> and the second elastic strip member <b>122</b> are placed to a portion of the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>that has been wrapped and joined, but it is not limited thereto. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>does not have to be wrapped around the transporting roll <b>50</b> at each of the placing positions P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> of each of the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>. That is, as in the illustrated example the first and the second placing positions P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> can be set in the transporting path of the linear sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>along the horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0158">In the above-described embodiment, the two oscillating arms <b>61</b>, <b>161</b> are set, but the number of the oscillating arms merely has to be a multiple, namely the number can be equal to or greater than three.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0159">In the above-described embodiment, the manufacturing step of the pants type diaper <b>1</b> is illustrated, but it is not limited thereto and the invention may be applied for manufacturing of expanding type diapers (a type of diaper in which the front torso area <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the back torso area <b>1</b><i>c </i>are held fixed by a tape fastener when wearing).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0160">In the above-described embodiment, there is illustrated a structure in which an oscillating arm <b>61</b> (<b>161</b>) has two rollers of an oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> (<b>163</b>) and a spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> (<b>164</b>), but it is not limited thereto, and one roller may be provided in between the oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> (<b>163</b>) and the spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> (<b>164</b>). Note that, in this case the rotating axis of the roller to be additionally provided may be in parallel to the rotational axis C<b>64</b> (C<b>164</b>) of the spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> (<b>164</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0161">In the above-described embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the rotational central axis C<b>65</b> of the first spindle portion <b>65</b> of the first guide member <b>60</b> is oriented in the up-down direction (vertical direction), the rotational central axis C<b>165</b> of the spindle portion <b>165</b> of the second guide member <b>160</b> is oriented in the left-right direction (horizontal direction), and the rotational axis C<b>50</b> of the transporting roll <b>50</b> is oriented in the CD direction (horizontal direction). However, it is not limited thereto, as long as the rotational central axis C<b>65</b> (C<b>165</b>) of the spindle portion <b>65</b> (<b>165</b>) of the first guide portion <b>60</b> or the second guide portion <b>160</b> and the rotational axis C<b>50</b> of the transporting roll <b>50</b> are in a perpendicular relationship with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0162">In the above-described embodiment, the rotational axis C<b>63</b> (C<b>163</b>) of the oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> (<b>163</b>) and the rotational axis C<b>64</b> (C<b>164</b>) of the spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> (<b>164</b>) are in the substantially horizontal direction. The reason is to hand over the elastic strip member <b>121</b> (<b>122</b>) in a substantially flat shape with little torsion in respect to the transporting roll <b>50</b> with the rotational axis C<b>50</b> in the horizontal direction that is the CD direction. Thus, the orientation of the rotational axes C<b>63</b> (C<b>163</b>), C<b>64</b> (C<b>164</b>) of the oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> (<b>163</b>) and the spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> (<b>164</b>) is not limited to a substantially horizontal direction in any way, and can be changed according to a direction in which the rotational axis C<b>50</b> of the transporting roll <b>50</b> faces. That is, the rotational axis C<b>63</b> (C<b>163</b>) of the oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> (<b>163</b>) and the rotational axis C<b>64</b> (C<b>164</b>) of the spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> (<b>164</b>) may be arranged so that the face that the rotational axes C<b>63</b> (C<b>163</b>), C<b>64</b> (C<b>164</b>) make with the oscillating movement of the oscillating arm <b>61</b> (<b>161</b>) is to be parallel to the rotational axis C<b>50</b> of the transporting roll <b>50</b>. Furthermore, the oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> (<b>163</b>) and the spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> (<b>164</b>) may be arranged so that the rotational axes C<b>63</b> (C<b>163</b>), C<b>64</b> (C<b>164</b>) become perpendicular to the rotational central axis C<b>65</b> (C<b>165</b>) of the spindle portion <b>65</b> (<b>165</b>) that is in a perpendicular relationship with the rotational axis C<b>50</b> of the transporting roll <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0163">In the above-described embodiment, a flat bone roll that has a circumferential face that is flat across the width direction (CD direction) of the roller is used as the oscillating end side roller <b>63</b> (<b>163</b>) and the spindle portion side roller <b>64</b> (<b>164</b>), but it is not limited thereto in any way. For example, a crowned roller may be used. This crowned roller refers to a roller with a largest diameter portion of the roller set in a central portion in the width direction. With this roller, the elastic strip member <b>121</b> (<b>122</b>) put around the outer circumferential face is given a centripetal force toward the central portion in the width direction of the roller by the largest diameter portion of the outer circumferential face so that it becomes difficult for the elastic strip member <b>121</b> (<b>122</b>) to fall off from the roller. As an example such a crowned roller, there may be, for example, such as a roller formed with annular ribs along a circumferential direction in only the central portion in the outer circumferential face, or a roller that has a radius that gradually increases from end portions toward the central portion of the outer circumferential face.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0164">In the above-described embodiment, a hot-melt adhesive was applied with an adhesive applying apparatus to the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, but it is not limited thereto in any way as long as the sheet <b>103</b><i>b </i>and the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> can be joined together. For example, the adhesive may be applied to just the sheet <b>103</b><i>b</i>, or to both the elastic strip members <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> and the sheet <b>103</b><i>b. </i></p>
