The positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b> may be connected to the electrode assembly <b>13</b> through a current collecting member <b>131</b> inside of the case <b>14</b>. The gaskets <b>155</b>, the first insulator <b>16</b>, and the second insulator <b>17</b> may electrically insulate the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b> from the cap plate <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first insulator <b>16</b> may be disposed on the cap plate <b>15</b>.

The gasket <b>155</b> may be interposed between the positive terminal hole <b>161</b> and the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and/or between the negative terminal hole <b>162</b> and the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b>. A bus bar <b>20</b> may be disposed on a pair of positive and negative first insulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>of adjacent unit cells <b>10</b>. Positive and negative nuts <b>111</b> and <b>121</b> may then be coupled to the positive and negative bolt portions <b>112</b> and <b>122</b>, respectively, to hold the bus bar <b>20</b> in place. The first joining unit <b>31</b> may thereby prevent rotation of the first insulators <b>16</b> on the outer surface of the cap plate <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first joining unit <b>31</b> will be described herein in detail. The first joining unit <b>31</b> may include an outer protrusion <b>311</b> and an outer groove <b>312</b>. The outer protrusion <b>311</b> may be disposed on the cap plate <b>15</b>, and may protrude toward the first insulator <b>16</b>. The outer groove <b>312</b> may be disposed on the first insulator <b>16</b>, and may be concave to correspond to the outer protrusion <b>311</b>. The outer protrusion <b>311</b> and the outer groove <b>312</b> may be coupled to each other, and may fix the first insulator <b>16</b> on the outer surface of the cap plate <b>15</b>. The first joining unit <b>31</b> may be in a periphery of the cap plate <b>15</b>, i.e., the first joining unit <b>31</b> for the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and negative electrode terminal <b>12</b> may be mirror images.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The bus bar <b>20</b> may be disposed on a pair of positive and negative first insulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) to electrically connect electrode terminals having opposite polarities of two adjacent unit cells <b>10</b>. The bus bar <b>20</b> may have a positive terminal hole <b>211</b> and a negative terminal hole <b>212</b> corresponding to the two electrode terminals having opposite polarities, e.g., the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> of a unit cell <b>10</b> and the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b> of an adjacent unit cell <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The bus bar <b>20</b> and the first insulator <b>16</b> may include a second joining unit <b>32</b>. The second joining unit <b>32</b> may couple a pair of positive and negative first insulators <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>of two adjacent unit cells <b>10</b> and a corresponding bus bar <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A first end of the second joining unit <b>32</b> may be coupled to a first side of the bus bar <b>20</b> and the positive first insulator <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b>. A second end of the second joining unit <b>32</b> may be coupled to a second side of the bus bar <b>20</b> and the negative first insulator <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b>. Because of this configuration, the coupling cannot be reversed so the unit cells <b>10</b> may only be connected in a single, proper configuration. Accordingly, the second joining unit <b>32</b> may prevent mis-assembly when connecting the unit cells <b>10</b> in series with the bus bar <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, when a joining structure, position, and range of the second joining unit <b>32</b> coupling the positive first insulator <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the bus bar <b>20</b> are compared with a joining structure, position, and range of the second joining unit <b>32</b> coupling the negative first insulator <b>16</b><i>b </i>and the bus bar <b>20</b>, at least one of the joining structure position, and range may be different. This difference may help ensure that the unit cells <b>10</b> are only aligned in a single direction when connected in series, lowering the possibility of mis-assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The second joining unit <b>32</b> will be described herein in detail. According to an embodiment, the second joining unit <b>32</b> of the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and the joining unit <b>32</b> of the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b> may have different joining structures, positions, and/or ranges. That is, the second joining unit <b>32</b> may include a positive joining portion <b>321</b> corresponding to the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and a negative joining portion <b>322</b> corresponding to the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b>. The negative joining portion <b>322</b> may have a different structure from the positive joining portion <b>321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The positive joining portion <b>321</b> may include, e.g., a circular hole <b>321</b><i>a </i>disposed on the first end of the bus bar <b>20</b> and a corresponding cylindrical protrusion <b>321</b><i>b </i>disposed on the positive first insulator <b>16</b><i>a</i>. During assembly of the rechargeable battery module M, the circular protrusion <b>321</b><i>b </i>may be coupled to the corresponding circular hole <b>321</b><i>a</i>. The negative joining portion <b>322</b> may include, e.g., a quadrangular cut portion <b>322</b><i>a </i>disposed on the second end of the bus bar <b>20</b> and a corresponding quadrangular column protrusion <b>322</b><i>b </i>disposed on the negative first insulator <b>16</b><i>b</i>. During assembly of the rechargeable battery module M, the quadrangular column protrusion <b>322</b><i>b </i>may be coupled to the quadrangular cut portion <b>322</b><i>a</i>. However, the shapes of the positive and negative joining portions <b>321</b> and <b>322</b> are not limited thereto. The positive and negative joining portions <b>321</b> and <b>322</b> may be any suitable complementary shapes that are able to couple amongst themselves while being unable to couple to the opposing joining portion.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A first joining structure and range of the circular hole <b>321</b><i>a </i>and the cylindrical column protrusion <b>321</b><i>b </i>of the positive joining portion <b>321</b> may be different from a second joining structure and range of the quadrangular cut portion <b>322</b><i>a </i>and the quadrangular column protrusion <b>322</b><i>b </i>of the negative joining portion <b>322</b>. Because the positive joining portion <b>321</b> and the negative joining portion <b>322</b> may have different joining structures and joining ranges, the bus bar <b>20</b> may only couple to the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b> of adjacent unit cells <b>10</b> in a single proper configuration. Therefore, the rechargeable battery module M cannot be mis-assembled in an improper configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second insulator <b>17</b> may be disposed on the inner surface of the cap plate <b>15</b>. The second insulator <b>17</b> and the cap plate <b>15</b> may include a third joining unit <b>33</b>. The second insulator <b>17</b> may have a terminal hole <b>171</b> corresponding to its adjacent electrode terminal <b>11</b> or <b>12</b>. A gasket <b>155</b> may be interposed between the terminal hole <b>171</b> and the electrode terminal <b>11</b> or <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The third joining unit <b>33</b> may include an inner protrusion <b>331</b> on the second insulator <b>17</b> protruding toward the cap plate <b>15</b>. The third joining unit <b>33</b> may also include a corresponding concave inner groove <b>332</b> in the cap plate <b>15</b>. The current collecting member <b>131</b> may be disposed below the second insulators <b>17</b>. When the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b> are riveted, the third joining unit <b>33</b> may advantageously prevent the second insulators <b>17</b> from moving on the inner surface of the cap plate <b>15</b>. The third joining unit <b>33</b> may be in a periphery of the cap plate <b>15</b>, i.e., the third joining unit <b>33</b> for the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and negative electrode terminal <b>12</b> may be mirror images</p>

A positive joining portion <b>2321</b> corresponding to the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and a negative joining portion <b>2322</b> corresponding to the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b> may have different joining structures, as described in the previous embodiment. Alternatively, the positive joining portion <b>2321</b> and the negative joining portion <b>2322</b> may have the same joining structure, e.g., circular, but at different positions, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A distance between the positive joining portion <b>2321</b> and the positive electrode terminal <b>11</b> and a distance between the negative joining portion <b>2322</b> and the negative electrode terminal <b>12</b> in an x-axis direction may be different from each other.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the negative joining portion <b>2322</b> on the bus bar <b>220</b> and negative first insulator <b>216</b><i>b </i>may be offset from a center line CL of the negative terminal hole <b>262</b> by a distance c in a y-axis direction. The positive joining portion <b>2321</b> on the bus bar <b>220</b> and the positive first insulator <b>216</b><i>a </i>may be disposed on the center line CL of the positive terminal hole <b>261</b>.

This difference in position may help ensure that the positive and negative first insulators <b>216</b><i>a </i>and <b>216</b><i>b </i>and bus bars <b>220</b> may only be aligned in a single, proper configuration, reducing errors during assembly of a rechargeable battery module M<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Specifically, the positive joining portion <b>2321</b> may include, e.g., a positive circular hole <b>2321</b><i>a </i>on the bus bar <b>220</b> and a positive cylindrical column protrusion <b>2321</b><i>b </i>on the positive first insulator <b>216</b><i>a</i>. The positive circular hole <b>2321</b><i>a </i>may be disposed at a first end of the bus bar <b>220</b>.
