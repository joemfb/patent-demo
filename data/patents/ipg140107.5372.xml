<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This application describes example systems and methods for placing onto a mammal's lower body, leg and thigh limbs, a set of paired bands to measure the lower body locomotion (for bipedalism, upright locomotion) and, if desired, additional arm strapped forearm and arm paired bands on the upper body (for complex motion, crawling, and in other applications, or four calf limb quadrupedalism locomotion). Each band contains multiple MEMs force sensors that measure muscle circumferential pressure at multiple positions, along with Earth's magnetic and gravitational fields. On-band data processing and networked, intra-band RF connectivity from multiple limbs, can be used to produce simple, energy-optimized, least-action metrics of mammal locomotion of two, interrelated functions defined as 1) Track, being a walking, running or other dynamic, from forward footpath creation over firm surfaces such as the ground, water-floats, or snow and ice, and 2) Balance, being required to efficiently move the lower body and/or upper body under Track. These technology metrics include assessment of locomotion related neurological functionality of body, limbs, and muscle disorders.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Details of Track differences in maintaining Balance are related to other physiological disorders, including detecting mental precursors, such as for fall-down behavior. An example system can be worn by many simultaneously and uniquely identified users, with metrics and location of each user being displayed on a laptop through additional RF connectivity, such as in recreational and professional sports. The system's on-band data processing units using battery supplied power, integrate the sensing to determine kinetic and potential energy of the body locomotion over time in a method that integrates out the aperiodic motion of the upper body and extended appendages, about center of mass (ACM), and uses the residual motion to measure the periodic center of mass (CM) locomotion from a known point.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The example systems and methods are self-calibrating, using calibration data collected when standing and jumping, at positions facing compass points. A GPS system can be incorporated for continuous motion measurement, to be used for calibration of the locomotion when GPS satellite data is available, and to establish the initiation geolocation point when beginning operation in GPS-denied regions for navigation, or to relatively geolocate multiple players in sport activities.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The body movement data, when combined with the band pressure and gravity data, removes the effects of the aperiodic, nonlinear locomotion, and leaves the residual movement for determining Track and Balance through a Euler-Lagrangian representation of the Equations of Motion.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The example systems and methods can be embodied for many applications (including the use of metric feedback for improved Balance and Track optimization), such as for human and non-human (e.g., horse) sports trainers, elder health care providers, and physical therapists for prevention and recovery from injuries of the back, knee, spine, and brain, such as from stroke, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, and dementia, as well as for other uses in mammal navigation and location purposes.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0121">The example systems and methods relate to the automation of the general field of determining mammal locomotion metrics, from a simple viewpoint when muscular-driven support members propel the body, being that of linear momentum relative to the ground or other surfaces, defined as Track-movement, and being that of angular momentum relative to the body, defined as Balance-movement. This is uniquely different from gait analysis because these measurements are made by totally self-contained, strap-on-bands that can be worn in any type of locomotion activity including sports, and also by other mammals, such as horses, and does not require human analysis of any collected data. The example systems and methods incorporate band sensors worn on body limbs with networked RF connectivity to compute, using related sensor data, muscular motion across multiple band links and within a group of interacting sports players or racing mammals.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0122">Because this real-time measurement and monitoring is being made with a very high fidelity, and is made outside the laboratory in the world of more natural activities, the Track and Balance motion viewpoint allows the measured information to be used in physical and mental health assessment. The metrics are in a database format for easy long-term trend analysis and population demographic characterization. Examples include use in sports training, in therapeutic injury-recovery monitoring (e.g., from either a predicted potential-injury diagnosis, or from post-disorders and post-injury repair assessment), and in general health care and treatment of the elderly.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0123">Real-time Track and Balance monitoring, with inexpensive components providing feedback to the individual, can also lead to mental changes for improved physical performance and mental stability. The system complements many of the laboratory based gait analysis techniques using treadmills and photographic or video analysis of body motion. By ignoring the detailed biometric models of individual muscle contributions to locomotion, it uniquely measures a subset of individual muscle action components and limb locations during interaction tasks, at a very fine detail to integrate local muscle's neural oscillator controlling functionality of Balance, with a global, brain controlling functionality of Track.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0124">Mammal locomotion is the process of self-powered movement, through muscular tension against bone stiffness that creates singular, two point limb-contacts with the ground by a foot (e.g., a &#x201c;footprint&#x201d; path of heel-strike or touchdown (TD) to toe-off (TO) defined contact periods, depending upon walking and running activities), using a complex pattern of continuous periodic and aperiodic activity, which leads to forward motion. Human's walk forward as if falling, but recover balance in the landing and sequence to the next step, similar in part to riding a Segway&#xae; 2-wheel tracking vehicle that falls forward if not kept in balance by the driver's balance. The human muscular functions involve a pre-planned control, based on a perceptual awareness of dynamic surroundings and limb locations, and current goal driven action-requirements. The motion changes with the speed of advancement and the number of &#x201c;legs&#x201d; being utilized, and is generally classified as gait analysis, because the legs lift the feet and place them at a forward location as a sequence of steps along a &#x201c;track.&#x201d; Failures in reacting to unforeseen changes in this locomotion advancement, especially when foot placement dramatically changes as a step-and-cut running motion, can lead to physical injury. A problem is to determine for a variety of applications, specific biomechanical and neurological disorders that can be measured in a more representative activity and with an automated analysis approach, than currently is practiced through gait laboratory measurements and data analysis being made by gait professionals. Here, the relevant information, e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, would be quite useful if made through a simpler measurement, and metrics were automatically computed in real-time, where information could be made available for not only diagnosis and assessment, but also for immediate training feedback during the occurrence of the physical locomotion events. The metrics can also include derived common gait and knee angle assessment parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0125">The following description demonstrates, among other things, the complexity of the prior art, which is why current gait analysis uses intensive human analysis of clinical recordings with no automated analysis, and hence a problem solution requires a simplification of biomechanical modeling metrics, used in diagnosis and assessment from current gait analysis, in order to have a more general utility. This simplification, described next, suppresses much of the biomechanics of locomotion, and injects new concepts involving other neural function beyond simple brain control functions of muscles, in order to develop simple methods for identifying locomotion and brain/neural control disorders.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0126">Prior techniques in gait analysis measure force plate data from a force plate in contact with the heel to determine heel strikes. The systems and methods described herein do not require such measurements. Instead, heel strikes can be measured by processing, for example, pressure measurement of the muscle and changes in location. Thus, the disclosed systems and methods move away from the traditional analysis of determining heel strikes. Consequently, the systems and methods described herein use, for example, the muscles to determine the &#x201c;cycle.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0127">Among other things, this advantageously allows these systems and methods to be used in situations in which, for example, the heel does not strike first (e.g., the toes strike or impact before the heel) or there is no heel strike (e.g., a surfer &#x201c;pumping&#x201d; a surf board). Thus, there is no requirement of measuring heel strikes.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a physical model of Balance and Track. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the body <b>100</b> is moving along with one foot <b>102</b> on the ground (schematically shown at <b>103</b>) on Track <b>110</b> and the other foot <b>104</b> off the ground in the swing phase. At the completion of this swing phase, foot <b>104</b> gets placed down on the ground on the next Track <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows human locomotion actions with a toy paddleball analogy being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> defines Track and Balance locomotion metric representations for the foot placement on a firm surface, as that of tracing out a sequence of footfalls along a changing track for the body weight (as mass M, being the sum of all mass elements, dm(r) at vector location r), shown in the figure at the body center to a gravitational vector force G (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with a projected forward motion vector in coordinates X, Y, Z). This motion continuously sweeps out a six degree of freedom (DOF), &#x201c;rigid body&#x201d; parametric as an up and down center of mass (CM) motion like the ball in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, being paddled up by the foot vector force thrusts, A, made to the &#x2018;ground,&#x2019; and then with the &#x2018;gravitational&#x2019; forces of the rubber band, G, pulling the ball back down to the &#x2018;ground&#x2019; of the paddle.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0134">The height and step motion combines as a parabolic CM half-period, of a periodic cyclic motion, with the L/R transition being the heading motion change from the changed foot angle placement. These steps start at heel-strike stance, by defining a step-length of forward momentum, and end with the toe-off of the swing, by defining a foot thrust of angular momentum, and for the case of the same foot repeating, this is a two step, gait stride-length (here the perpendicular distance between sequential foot steps is the walking base).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows the same 6-DOF upper body gyration motion, to swing the lower body legs as in standard Euler angles (&#x3b1;, &#x3b2;, &#x3b3;), but here in a Tait-Brian rigid body angle formulation (&#x3c6;, &#x3b8;, &#x3c8;) (as shown at <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), where the linear axis is body centered, as an angular motion description for the ball in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, moving freely from left-to-right above the paddle (ball spin-motion as yaw is not shown).</p>

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0140">Balance is not as a linear mass motion, but is an angular mass motion, with a moment of inertia, I, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as the dashed elliptical region. Here, I is computed from the squared radial (r) distance product, with the mass components dm(r), at r locations, summed over all mass elements, becoming a 2D tensor representation. This creates angular momentum from the aperiodic motion of the inertial mass elements, arising from the twisting spine moving the pelvis, hips, shoulders, head, and combined radial distance changes to mass, by the limb angle changes from the calf and thigh knee-joint angle, and from the forearm and arm elbow-joint angle.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0141">Here, the body is modeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, simply as a twisting and turning, synchronized motion in angular momentum, driving an inverted pendulum swinging the body mass M through gait steps, in a parametric amplifier description (e.g., a parametric amplifier is what a child does to increase the height, while swinging on a swing set). The thigh motion of knee lifting and calf thrusting on/off foot placement, as a compliant component of tendon, muscle, and bone, yields forward locomotion as Track, and the angular momentum is related to Balance.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0142">More specifically, when a child swings on a swing, he/she pulls on the chains/ropes from which the seat is suspended and to lift his/her body up a little bit. This pumps in energy so that the child can swing higher and higher. This is essentially the same concept, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with respect to gyration of a person's limbs. If done synchronously, motions of shoulders, arms, head, etc. and the twisting of spine pump energy into the lower body, which is then translated into foot thrust for moving the person forward. The pumping in of energy in this manner relates to a mental construct that allows all of a person's limbs to be synchronized for a particular purpose (e.g., walking, running, swinging a golf club or tennis racket, etc.). The parametric amplifier schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates that dynamic oscillation parameters of the shoulders, arms, head, spine through the gait phases, can be changed to pump energy into foot thrust. As will be discussed in greater detail below, one of the new features of the systems and methods described herein is including the upper body gyrations into the analysis. Specifically, the systems and methods make measurements using leg bands (e.g., around the calf and thigh) to get full body gyration dynamics.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0143">One can see these two body dynamic Track and Balance functions active in sports, such as in the 2010 Canadian Winter Olympics in BC, where Lindsey Jacobellis, the favored winner for the snowboard cross, followed Maelle Ricker over the first jump in an airborne ballet, where Lindsey made an airborne correction to her Balance in order to avoid a collision with Maelle, which then upset her Track when she returned to the snow, and she wiped out to not even finish the race (Olson 2010). Similar &#x201c;accidents&#x201d; occurred in the downhill slalom race, where racers would lean onto the inside ski to round a gate, and in order to continue into the next gate track, they would shift their weight to the other ski, but because of failure in trying also to bring the previous ski back down to the snow, in time to regain Balance for tracking before the next gate, they also wiped out from the race.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0144">An unusual locomotion process governs these sports actions of shifting between angular momentum and linear momentum, which is not really an engineering miracle of the human body. Rather, it is a combination of the biomechanics of the body muscle locomotion, being driven by a high level of the brain's functional cognition-requests, combined with a low level of local muscle actions, driven by neural oscillator firings, which is self governing. The action is not really reproducible, but is more regular in an aperiodic functionality: i.e., multiple components contribute to the end action, but not in a regular manner, and thus, the Olympian has learned how to train these lower level muscle functions to interact with the sensed actions that align Track and Balance for an end goal. This is similar to the auto mechanic listening to the &#x2018;sound&#x2019; of a car engine, with all of the explosions from sparkplug firings, gear turnings, muffler sounds, and body shakes making an overall humming sound, thus, becoming a global indication of engine &#x2018;health.&#x2019; However, this identification is made not by directly defining &#x2018;correctness&#x2019; as being related to the mechanical details of the periodic crankshaft rotations and the aperiodic engine reactions to the impulsive piston forces, but rather as a symphony of synchronized aperiodic components in phase-locked, synchronized interaction producing acoustic energy.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0145">Hence, the complexity of understanding human locomotion as a collection of many components interacting together, is similar to that of a car engine's interacting components, and identifies a physical mathematical construct of the &#x201c;Many Bodied Problem,&#x201d; i.e., describing many (as in 10-100), simultaneous force-mass interactions. In astrophysics, this can be a collection of planets moving with gravitational forces around the sun, where a complex circular motion pattern exists that is very different in detail from simple ellipses, because each component motion affects all of the other component's motion. Thus, in a similar manner, the locomotion of the limbs is more complex than simple singular muscles causing limb rotation, or as an extension increasing the limb joint angles (and flexion as a decreasing of the joint angles). Automation of understanding complex motion requires an integration of component measurements for simplification.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0146">This locomotion CM/ACM distinction, in changing the Lagrangian and its Equation of Motion (EOM), is defined in the lower section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which can be further linked to the paddleball analogy. Here, one starts hitting the ball <b>202</b> downward, but with some skill, this hitting can be migrated to an upward motion to keep the ball in the air above the paddle <b>204</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. From a simple physics model, one can relate concepts of limb motion dynamics to energy, work, and power, in order to describe muscle expenditure of potential energy as kinetic action (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as a simple 1D Z-axis dynamic of height h):
<ul id="ul0021" list-style="none">

    <ul id="ul0022" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0022-0001" num="0147">1. The kinetic energy (KE) of this ball dynamic is mechanical work (W), as the vector product along a path of spatial integration (W=&#x222b;A&#xb7;dh) of the force (A) over small height lengths (dh), affecting mass inertia dynamics of linear momentum (Mv) or can be mechanical work of torque forces (&#x3c4;) in angular lengths (d&#x3b8;), affecting mass dynamics of rotational inertia I (Energy1 2010).</li>
        <li id="ul0022-0002" num="0148">2. In general, energy (E) is the temporal integration (E=&#x222b;Pdt) of power (P, as the rate of work being performed, e.g., as force times velocity (v=dZ/dt=&#x17b;) or torque times angular velocity (&#x3c9;), here as a function of rotational angles (&#x3c8;, &#x3b8;, &#x3c6;), being made over small time periods (dt), such as expressed by muscle potential energy (PE) action, produced from short bursts of power.</li>
        <li id="ul0022-0003" num="0149">3. The Lagrangian (L) is defined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in terms of energy differences between kinetic and potential energy (L=KE&#x2212;PE). Hence, because action (S) is the dynamic containment of the energy differences in time using the Lagrangian, defined as (S=&#x222b;Ldt), in locomotion one can substitute mechanical work of mass location changes (dh, dr) with temporal mass dynamics (dt).</li>
        <li id="ul0022-0004" num="0150">4. This allows one to use magnetic field vector orientation (BB) changes sensed at the limb masses, as a mass relative position locater in spatiotemporal integrations, and to find an optimization of energy expenditure in &#x2018;correct&#x2019; locomotion using the principle of least action (minimizing S), as a &#x2018;sound&#x2019; of healthy locomotion.</li>

</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0151">Here in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, ball <b>202</b> represents the body mass M, which is moving in a CM linear motion up and down in the gravitational field force G as the rubber band <b>206</b> of the toy (on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and each step of this inverted pendulum is where the body is vaulting over the leg, raising the entire mass center to an increased height (h) above the ground's gravitational vector force acceleration (here, as bolded character notation, g). Thus, changes in height &#x201c;h&#x201d; are increasing the potential energy (PE=M|g|h) of the body motion. The paddle <b>204</b> has to be moved each time, as a linear Track dynamic, to be where the ball <b>202</b> will be landing, and this motion also causes the ball to move away from the previous top position as a sideways motion, requiring a correction to when the paddle hits it again, to return the ball to the same place in the air. The paddle <b>204</b> is providing a thrust force (A), as acceleration (a=A/M) with each strike of the ball <b>202</b>, sending it back up in the gravitational field, only to be brought back down, thus creating a linear momentum sequence of the ball each time it is hit, with heading changed by the direction from the foot (paddle) placement, or from changes in the forward speed (here, as the amplitude value of the up/down velocity along the h length motion). This changes the linear kinetic energy (KE=&#xbd;M|v|<sup>2</sup>, for total body mass M, for the forward speed vector velocity (v) of this momentum (Mv), as a Track of footfalls.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0152">At the same time, the ball <b>202</b> can move from side to side, due to changes in the paddle position when the ball is being brought down by the (&#x2018;gravitational&#x2019;) rubber band <b>206</b>, causing a sideways motion about its center position, thus creating an angular momentum sequence of the ball <b>202</b> before it is hit again, with roll, pitch, or yaw changes in direction due from the paddle-spin (e.g., locomotion shoe-slip), as an ACM angular motion (on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). This creates an angular velocity (&#x3c9;) of a mass inertia I (as an integration of the mass points, dm(r), along the angular radial distance (r), here as the normal to the height motion), which also contributes an angular kinetic KE energy (KE=&#xbd;|&#x3c9;|<sup>2</sup>) for total mass inertia I.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0153">An important concept in this simple, analogous representation of a Lagrangian EOM is that of Euler's definition of action (S), defined as the temporal integration (S=&#x222b;Edt) of the energy (E), and when combined together with the Lagrangian (Sagatum, 1991), thus becoming the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations (EOM). In the example Track and Balance systems and methods described herein, the periodic nature of leg-stance gait cycles, when combined with the aperiodic nature of leg-swing gait cycles, allows for a spatiotemporal force integration approach in a minimized or least action principle (Energy2 2010), which creates a means of estimating Track and Balance metrics from nothing more than integration within defined cycles of the time-varying data that also is measuring spatial dynamics. This physically modeled requirement involves distinguishing periodic from aperiodic cycles in the gait analysis between stance and swing motion, because this is the Track and Balance discrimination. While typically the TD/TO temporal locations are measured in gait analysis, with a force plate or instrumented shoe, they are not specific to the physical model, which treats these impulses only through their contribution to A.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0154">Thus, if the Track motion is perfectly linear, as a periodic cycle shifting between stance leg placements, then the ACM dynamic is also periodic with no loss of energy from aperiodic dynamics, and the ball motion above the paddle is in a symmetric Balance to Track. The Lagrangian formulation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the body dynamics, shows L as the energy difference between the KE and the PE, and it is assumed that energy efficiency in locomotion indicates balance. Thus, in mammal locomotion, ACM angular momentum must be conserved, with the entire, linearly orthogonal, forward and periodic-height motion, contributing to the KE (i.e., step-length integrated, simultaneous two leg-stepped, gait cycle). Because the PE contributions are from the cyclic gravitational motion, it is exactly balanced with the foot thrust forces of takeoff (TO) and touchdown landing (TD, or heel-strike). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows this dynamic EOM as derivatives of a generalized representation for L from the moving mass-point vector coordinates (q, which can be quite different from the original modeled coordinates, when using a function &#x2111;; i.e., q=&#x2111;{X, Y, Z; &#x3b1;, &#x3b2;, &#x3b3;}). Further details explicitly show a dissipative force vector from &#x2018;shoe-slip&#x2019; as the thrust vector &#x3c4; being related to the L EOM, but with the efficient form of the PE term being on average close to a constant (e.g. set to zero; Solinsky U.S. Pat. No. 7,610,166; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and following therein from Eq L3). This physical description of locomotion mechanics can now be related to the energy from spatiotemporal integration of muscle pressure measurements, for use in locomotion descriptions.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Locomotion Using Lower Body Muscles</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0155">Because the human torso uses muscle actuators to &#x201c;rock&#x201d; the upright body to move forward, lower body muscle actions create the body locomotion action, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as a parametric amplifier. During the locomotion stance phase, the muscles perform Track thrusts (extensor and abductor muscles) that sequentially push each foot off of the ground to swing the legs, which create sequential foot placements on a footpath. The lower body muscles are connected to the body at the hip, where body gyration during the swing phase (flexor muscles) maintains Balance during lifting and placing the other leg on the ground as a second footpath placement. The gyration motion of the shoulders and pelvis, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is a form of twisting the spine and muscles extending and contracting as a further form of body dynamics in PE and KE energy transfers, but the upper body dynamics will be ignored for now in this simple model of gait locomotion using mostly the lower body components. An example of categorizing these muscles for the lower body is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (Answers2 2010), which omits certain details (e.g., among other omitted components are the knee and ankle joints). As will be shown, numerous muscle groups are used in biomechanical modeling of locomotion, but which might be linked to a smaller set of pseudo muscle groups, as low in number to possibly being only five, using a principle component analysis (PCA) of the data, as derived from measurements of over 20 individual muscle components (Ivanenko 2004); independent component analysis (ICA) of nonlinear data might be more appropriate, due to nonlinear aperiodic dynamics being nonGaussian (Nuffer 2006).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0156">Because direct measurement of the loads of the spine and contraction forces of contributing muscles are not always possible, nor is it possible to know what specific sensory signals occur between the muscles and the nervous system, it has been shown to be more practical to use a simulation and compare global locomotion models with experimental gait analysis. This motion can be modeled as a human torso motion with 3D muscle actuators, including actual trunk muscle balance and force measurements (Reid 1987). Along these lines, modeled locomotion stability examples have been achieved among pairs of muscles in both open and closed loops, where modeled feedback is tuned by higher centers of the nervous system (Katbab, 1989).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0157">Furthermore, confirming this modeling of body motion can be measured using a force plate for foot placement as 3D thrust forces, along with video and photographic views of body motion planes (Perry 1992). The different types of muscles used for motion are 1) along the limb axis as rotation, and 2) transverse to the limb axis as a) extension and flexion (up/down vertical motion from the body median plane), b) sagittal to the limb axis (medial/lateral left/right sway motion from the body center plane) and c) coronal to the limb axis (frontal plane as fore/aft about the head/spine plane). This motion is made relative to the limb axis as abduction (away from the median plane) and adduction (towards the median plane).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0158">The physical force modeling in gait locomotion uses a weight of the total body mass being supported by the lower body leg forces, which change force from a &#x2018;zero&#x2019; weight at standstill (1 g), to a 110% increase of mass-weight during foot thrusting (2.1 g), being reduced to an 80% of mass-weight during foot-leg swings (1.8 g) and back to a peak of 110% for the last foot placement (2.1 g) during just 62% of the gait cycle of one stride length. There is little lateral and progressional shear force during walking. During a slow walk, these two peaks flatten out to 100% of the body weight (2 g), and during running these peaks become one peak at 220% of the body weight (3.2 g) for just the first part of the gait cycle (e.g., both feet are off the ground at one point during running; see Perry 1992). Clinically, it is important to also separate motion of the thigh from motion of the pelvis, such as when measuring the thigh position from the vertical axis to the horizon.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0159">During this cyclic gait motion of foot placement, the hip moves as the unloaded side of the pelvis swings, in coronal motion as a small arc of adduction and abduction following the swing. During the stride of heel to toe placement, the limb moves through an arc of transverse hip motion, creating a thigh rotation. The angle between the Femur and Tibia limb axes is also useful in the locomotion analysis, and is related to body training and knee injury reduction e.g., it is important in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) analysis to also measure the knee Q-angle. The Q-angle can be defined for a number of locomotion practices, such as being the angle formed by lines representing the pull of the quadriceps muscle and the axis of the patellar tendon (Q-angle1, 2010), or the normal angle of quadriceps relative to the patella and is 10 degrees for males (Q-angle2, 2010), or the angle at which the femur (upper leg bone) meets the tibia (lower leg bone), where it is linked to a greater incidence of sports injuries in woman, caused by a wider pelvis than in men (Q-angle3 2010), and thus can possibly be derived from a calibrated, outer limb relative measurement between the thigh and the calf component location, from ground referenced limb position measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0160">The major muscles involved in lower body locomotion can include 1) Biceps femoris longhead, 2) Semimembranosus, 3) Semitendinosus, 4) Adductor magnus, and 5) Gluteus maximus, as measured with human locomotion muscles using electromyogram (EMG) technology (Chappell 2009). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a more complete set of dominant locomotion muscles (e.g., &#x2018;20&#x2019; muscles for the calf and thigh midpoint cross-sections), and also shows the Achilles tendon element being driven by the Soleus and Gastrocnemius muscles. These muscle groupings are used in simulations and robotics; specific hip abductor and adductor muscles have even been measured in vivo to compute multidimensional-plane moment-contributions, such as in the knee joint stability (Nemeth, 1989). During the late-to mid-swing phase the Hamstring muscles come into play (Semimembranosus, Semitendinosus, and Biceps femoris longhead), with the medial hamstrings (Adductor magnus, Gluteus maximus) also coming into play as a relaxation just before the end of the phase. The hip abductors are the major functioning muscles during the initial stance phase using the &#x2018;Glutes&#x2019; (Gluteus medius/maximus, and Tensor fascia latae).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0161">The mid-thigh and mid-calf cross-section (e.g., Gray432 2010, Gray440 2010) muscles are highlighted in color in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Another important element in this modeling is the actual moment arms present during locomotion phases in abduction or adduction, and estimation of metabolic expenditure on muscle movement (Wang 2006).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0162">Hence, there is a means of measuring a smaller number of muscle forces or after PCA/ICA analysis, to reduce the analysis to pseudo muscles as in a manner that might dominate Track and Balance function computation. This requires understanding what are the easily accessible, noninvasive, and measurable muscles, and then what one can infer from further muscle interaction with the brain requests, for forming metrics of Track and Balance.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Perceptive Brain Control of Muscle Functionality</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0163">In an examination of the neurophysiological basis of adaptive behavior through EEG measurements, Freeman (1975) has shown a mass action model for collections of neural &#x201c;masses,&#x201d; with time-space behavior in a feedback loop control, which includes limit or terminal cycles, from impulse driven oscillations having characteristic frequencies from a periodic driven nature, or an aperiodic behavior at the sub-system levels. On a global scale, these are brain wave frequencies of alpha (8-12 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-100 Hz), which are steady state, self-sustaining activities, but show a very short spectral resolution, as an inverse square frequency roll-off for temporal correlation (see Freeman 2000). Freeman proposes the aperiodic activity as stochastic chaos, which is a &#x201c;ringing&#x201d; of limit cycle attracters. One can extend this model to dynamic locomotion muscle actions as being impulse driven, aperiodic behavior at the local level, which is globally maintained in a more periodic control function based on the cognitive intentions of the brain.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0164">Hence, in gait analysis, one can see stride-to-stride rate variability (SRV, West 2005, Scafetta 2009), representing human walking locomotion as an interaction of the central nervous system in the neural functions of the brain, and the intraspinal nervous system with the mechanical periphery at the bones and muscle levels, as a biomechanical model. This is a proprioception sense of locomotion, because there is a balance feedback from the limb tendons, muscles, and articular joints. However, kinesthesia is distinguished from locomotion by excluding the sense of balance. Proprioception is considered a feed-backward perception by making post-action adjustments of gait with 100 msec delays; however the feed-forward component for balance is also postulated in proprioception, where it is used for more rapid actions based on a pre-action knowledge of the limb locations, such as used in placing the fingers on the nose during a sobriety test requiring a placement accuracy to be within 20 mm. This feed forward/backward activity is one of the complexities in neural functionality in locomotion modeling.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0165">Various training mechanisms can improve this balance sensing, e.g., using enhanced baseballs for proprioceptive pitch training, (Kuhn U.S. Pat. No. 6,663,519), gait analysis using walkers (Lancaster U.S. Pat. No. 5,311,880), and juggling or standing on a wobble board (Dewees U.S. Pat. No. 4,635,932, McShane U.S. Pat. No. 5,613,690), which is enhanced with the eyes closed. Also, a relatively new professional in human locomotion is the MD Physiatrists, which is an MD that has completed a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation residency (also known as PM&#x26;R), who specializes in a wide range of things including neurological issues as well as orthopedic issues, and is mostly dedicated to the care and rehab of elderly patients, i.e., mostly those in rehabilitation. For example, after the acute medical issues are resolved in the hospital, many patients who are not ready to go home are placed under the care of a Physiatrist, such as for post stroke patients. These doctors are responsible for coordinating all of the care for these patients (e.g., non-operative modalities for many chronic conditions). Physiatrists also use motion and EMG analysis in treatment (SOAR 2010). This is a recent recognition of the link in locomotion between the biomechanical modeling and the neural feedback control derived from many perceptual properties.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0166">Thus, locomotion is a combination of sensing footfall placement on a track of footprints after they occur, and a sense of balance used for anticipating the next footfall, thus, creating a feed forward track motion. Gait analysis using IR stroboscopic photometry has shown that elderly subjects had up to 20% reduction in velocity and length of stride (with stooped posture, faster cadence, and increased double limb stance) over young adults, and which also included reductions in toe-floor clearance, arm swing, and hip and knee rotations. This reduced combination of cadence and stride normally reduces the expenditure of energy, under the criteria of energy conservation. This reduced action, defined here as an integration of energy in time, can be considered that of a change in the neurological health of the elderly. This is why the combined determination of Track and Balance, when studying the conservation of energy in gait analysis, is critical to avoid artificial effects from stiff joints or absence of breath in the elderly (i.e., requiring a normalization within a variety of studied gaits; Elble 1991).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0167">There are five basic temporal patterns in locomotion conditions, and when studied with four walking conditions (normal, kicking a ball, stepping over an obstacle, and stooping right and left while grasping an object), when using EMG muscle recordings from between 16 to 31 ipsilateral limb and trunk muscles in a set of 8 subjects, it showed that muscle activation associated with voluntary tasks was either synchronized with the locomotion, or had additional activations supporting a superposition model of compound movements (Ivanenko 2005). This complexity can be modeled with nonlinear mathematics shown in multifractal and chaotic EOM, and exhibit periodic and aperiodic behavior, which also exhibits irregular SRV, leading to falls in young children.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0168">Unsteady locomotion is a sign of poor integration of muscle function with whole body dynamics and neuromuscular voluntary control, where fast-motion (e.g., running) depends more on local control that can be best modeled with spring-mass dynamics, which creates stabilization during unsteady running by animals from changes in terrain, lateral impulsive perturbations, and changes in substrate stiffness (Biewener 2007). These stabilization modes might be based on initial conditions, as seen in chaotic models, where the conditions arise from proximo-digital differences in limb muscle architecture, function, and control strategy. Nonlinear fractal exponent modeling for the data has supported correlation with forced pace gait conditions (i.e., metronome pace) having similar exponent values (&#x2212;0.2) to Parkinson's disease (Scafetta 2007), and similar results were shown on a larger and more accurate measurement of analysis of cadence fluctuations from one stride to the next, which adjusted to provide optimal mechanical output at minimum energy (Terrier 2005).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0169">There is also a feedback that compensates for length dependent neural control, using ground contact sensing from ground reaction forces (GRF), which cause a redistribution of energy by the distal muscles through their tendons. The optimization, of this energy use in locomotion, can allow mammals to achieve stability under a variety of conditions. Comparisons between GRF and kinematic (ultrasound) gait measurements of heel-strike and toe-off identification show high correlation, with slight differences with gait speed (Kiss 2010), implying that force inference does not have to be based on GRF measurements alone. This basic locomotion biomechanics is a vaulting over stiff legs in walking and compliant legs in running, but further analysis of these models with data requires a compliant leg for both, and shows that gait is but one of many legged motion solutions accessed by energy and speed, and is a useful model for representing stable animal and robotic locomotion (Geyer 2006, Altendorfer 2003).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0170">Another element of stability is in the use of a retraction of the swing leg through rotation, just prior to contact with the ground, changing the spring-mass angle-of-attack in responses to disturbances of stance-limb stiffness and forward speed, or a combined stiff, compliant limb, moving as a pendulum, but which is inverted, as an inverted pendulum model. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a classic set of early still photos (Muybridge 1955; see Seyfarth 2003) of a runner leaving the ground without either limb touching. Thus, there is time during running in which the runner is airborne. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows a spring model with retraction of the length of the limb after TO, and followed by right side TD landing after the flight-phase apex of maximum height, with a TD angle &#x3b1;<sub>0 </sub>(Seyfarth 2003, FIG. 1). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the second frame shows the runner's left foot in the thrust mode going into TO and the last frame show the runner's right leg in TD.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0171">Another model detail is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, where the inverted pendulum is modified from walking to having a spring for running to compress the muscle as a deceleration. The GRF is also shown in the figure as a percentage of the stance time, having the double hump for walking and a flatter, single hump for running. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> shows that the compliance models fit the data reasonably well for the running, but less so for walking. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> shows this two spring model (in which both legs have springs), with the single foot support, moving from left stance, to both in stance, to right stance, and during the double support at the center, with the transfer between the right-leg TD and the left-leg TO. The model's agreement with data measurements, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> is quite good, for three parameters: horizontal-axis stance time (%) and vertical-axis for 1) PE changes (J), 2) Height in G (cm), and 3) GRF (in body weight). Here, there are three model parameter sets (parameter value sets A, B, C, including touchdown angle &#x3b1;<sub>0</sub>), being the closest to the data (&#x201c;exp&#x201d;) at &#x3b1;<sub>0</sub>=76&#xb0; (Geyer 2006 FIGS. 1, 2, 3). This similar model by Geyer showed basic dynamics of combined running and walking, and used the swing leg parameters listed above, and the constant system energy in the conserved energy assumption (Geyer 2006 pg 5). The earlier model by Seyfarth also uses parameters of leg angle &#x3b1;<sub>0</sub>, but also leg length l<sub>LEG</sub>, to show swing leg retraction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (Seyfarth 2003 FIG. 7), having a stance phase in this two parameter space that moves on the cycle from TD to TO as being periodic over a half cycle, and then moves into a very nonlinear behavior during the swing phase (TO to TD) that includes retraction, thus changing the angular momentum in an aperiodic part of the cycle (with a reversal nonlinearity shown in the magnified section on the right side of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), with a further example of this distortion, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, being amplified for disturbed running conditions (Seyfarth 2003 FIG. 7). These models are used in robotic studies of four-legged locomotion in simulated and real environments that are optimized to minimize the system energy used in gait locomotion (Brambilla 2006).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a locomotion cycle for a leg in the coordinates of the leg angle &#x3b1; and the leg length. Referring to the left side of the figure, starting at TD, the cycle proceeds in a sinusoidal manner to TO. Thus, in the stance phase, the leg has touched down and is simply swinging forward. After TO, there is an aperiodic phase (i.e., does not proceed in a sinusoidal manner) during which the leg returns to TD. The left side of the figure also shows a situation in which the person has lost balance and there is a very different cycle between TO and TD. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a first &#x201c;stance&#x201d; phase with &#xbd; cycle periodicity and a second &#x201c;swing&#x201d; phase with &#xbd; cycle aperiodicity. The example systems and methods described herein do not require knowledge of leg position. Instead, as explained in greater detail below, these systems and methods determine the change from periodic to aperiodic (or sine to &#x201c;non-sine&#x201d;) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to find TO and TD. For example, a fourth-order detector can be used during data correlation to determine changes from periodic to aperiodic and from aperiodic to periodic. During the periodic &#xbd; cycle, the fourth-order detector will have a zero output. This output will become non-zero during the aperiodic &#xbd; cycle and the transition corresponds to TO. At the end of the aperiodic &#xbd; cycle, the output will again become zero and the transition corresponds to TD. In short, the fourth-order statistics are zero during the periodic stance phase and non-zero during the aperiodic swing phase and the transitions between the phases can be used to determine TO and TD. By finding these two points in the dynamic of a gait cycle, integration can be performed to obtain the energy. This can be used to, among other things, obtain gait metrics as well as Track and Balance. The metrics can show, for example, optimization of the use of energy by being in balance and show that optimization at any different rate at which a person runs, walks, moves, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0173">Finally, complex models (e.g., 54 muscles with 23 DOF in 3D motion) are argued to be required for discerning the functional role of muscles in locomotion that include the centrifugal joint motion and gravitational forces, as well as being used to understand which muscles contribute to the two peaks in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> experimental results. Much has been learned through simulating 3D walking humans, including suggesting that hip muscles contribute to vertical CM motion not present in the double inverted pendulum, 2D model. Here, the second pendulum is the knee angle changing with the thigh motion, as a mass movement from the calf to foot angle as the first pendulum (Pandy 2003). This can also be another parameter in the EL generalized coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0174">Thus, recent brain control research in locomotion functionality has shown that locomotion dynamics might be overly simplified in gait parametric modeling, and a much finer scale of global and local neurobiological nonlinear modeling is required for a detailed representation to develop Track and Balance metrics. A further element in human locomotion and muscle exertion is the modeling of energy expenditure, which is discussed next.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Energy Expenditure in Human Locomotion Models</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0175">Human balance (Shepherd 1988) uses open-loop sensors of changing tilt (statocyst as velocity, v, and also gravitation, g, or as a gravireceptor) and closed loop sensors of rotation from shear force motion (canal as angular acceleration &#x3c9;). Human locomotion (Shepherd 1988) is primarily developed by exertion of thrust forces from external limbs, involving external surface contact, and muscular contractions moving the skeleton structures in the limbs (vertebrates). This locomotion is modeled as being controlled by synchronized nerve firings, to execute muscular contractions, in conjunction with states of motion constraints, using closed-loop sensor feedback (e.g., walking, running, crawling, movements, resulting from the transmission of a limb pressure area in contact with the ground surface that generates the body thrust force). Early computer simulations for primate bipedal walking used biomechanical models of displacements, with data substitutions for acceleration, joint angles, CM to gravity, foot force (e.g., GRF), joint moments, muscular force, power from the leg, and energy expended during walking (Yamazaki 1979).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0176">As previously stated, this motion is in the form of an oscillating pendulum, but that is inverted, and hence has to be kept in balance. This synchronized limb movement is an aperiodic oscillation pattern of contact, which is created to conserve the angular momentum of the body's balance, during the oscillations of the upper torso, and thus the inverted-pendulum (upright human) does not fall over. Three neural components of muscle exertion and sensing feedback achieve this aperiodic, motion balance (i.e., 1) environmental contact of effector organs with reflexive feedback, 2) central pattern organs with spinal twist and turn feedback, and 3) higher levels of control in the brain). The motion of the runner photos in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> emphasize this balance, from only one foot touching the ground in walking, and sometimes for short periods in running, neither leg is touching the ground (or even with four-legged horses; Brill 2003). The complexity of achieving a similar balance in extreme sports is now obvious.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0177">Modeling improvements in bi-pedal walking have become more complex in order to study body evolution; e.g., with ten 2D links, of 26 muscles, and 18 neural oscillators for the local cycles; using an evolutionary genetic algorithm, of the neuromuscular skeletal model under minimized energy locomotion, made the body shape model migrate from a chimp shape to a human shape. This shows the dramatic need for reducing the skeletal loading and increasing the efficiency for human locomotion models (Hase 1999). Complex models for neuromuscular control of human locomotion have suffered from computational inefficiency; however using a min-max strategy in a generalized Newton method, an example of predictive control in a seven segment model with 18 independent muscle groups was found to agree well with EMG experimental data (Kaplan 2001). While there have been many human locomotion models for various applications, body dynamics and power transfer between limbs has been dominate in modeling and simulation of muscle driven dynamics (see Zajac 2002, Zajac 2003), which has provided a better understanding of locomotion data using a synergistic action of other non-energy producing muscles, which produce instantaneous accelerations and redistribution of segmental energy. This is similar to a muscular process of neurologically lighting &#x201c;firecrackers&#x201d; of injected energy at the parts of the limb muscle to effect movement, but without a well-defined biomechanical component.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0178">These models use a multi-segmented ballistic and passive mechanics of walking, yielding clues to healthy and pathological gait. They also can include detailed 3D models of the joints (Abdel-Rahman 1998), and can be complex with knee joint loading and predictive neuromuscular control effects leading to ACL injuries. Model parameters are varied to achieve motion and GRF within a 1-rms error to experimental data results as an optimization of muscle stimulation patterns during a sidestepping task (McLean 2003). Agreement with data is achieved in many cases when the model assumes a minimization of energy per unit distance, and the simulations also show two muscle modules active in that expenditure: Module 1 (gluteus medius, vasti, and rectus femoris), and Module 2 (Soleus and Gastrocnemius), which are similar to thigh and calf cross-section muscle monitoring midpoints (Neptune 2009). A recent spring loaded inverted pendulum model (Allendorfer 2003) uses the form of leg swing as the inverted pendulum, and foot slip for self-stability. One critical assumption in this approach is to show the conservation of torque in the human locomotion by the arms and legs, for a constant linear CM movement (i.e., aperiodic, but still cyclic to a zero point oscillation). This new human locomotion modeling has added features to this component of the simulation, e.g. leg swing and self-stability.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the dominate muscles of the lower body used in this motion simulation (Neptune 2009b), similar to the dynamic simulation example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, where the human locomotion is modeled as a dynamic parametric amplifier. These muscles used in simulation are listed from the hip, to the thigh, calf, ankle, and toes, as being the &#x201c;18&#x201d; muscles in the lower body (e.g., the number of muscles identified in the literature for lower body dynamics is not consistent in detail, and quotes are used here for the numeric value).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0180">Thus, the motion of the runner in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is simplified as &#x201c;rigid body&#x201d; motion of the spine twisting, the arms and legs &#x201c;pumping,&#x201d; and the side-to-side rocking of the body from the changing leg forces from the footfalls. Because this motion is about the vertical gravity vector, as stated earlier and shown as a green arrow in the figure, it is considered as the motion of an inverted pendulum. Also, because it is similar to the cyclic motion of the swing dynamics changing from KE to PE to KE, it can also be considered as a parametric amplifier with the length of the arm or leg being the changing parameter of the nonlinear amplification dynamic and time period (e.g., the swing pumping is in phase with the peak/valley PE points of the cycle). This is similar to children pulling the swing ropes, while swinging on a playground swing set, which increases their swinging to a higher level (e.g. as modifying the rope length parameter in synch with the peak height, thus amplifying the motion). This is a mass movement parametric amplification, only here, the runner in the figure is changing the mass positions in phase with the torso twisting, which is in phase with the footfalls. The locomotion models discussed earlier addressed such concepts, but without the component of the twisting spine and the arm length/angles also being changed in a synchronous manner. Among other things, these models did not simplify this metric for a Track/Balance segmentation of the gait cycle dynamics.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0181">All of this research shows that the locomotion muscle actions are in a much more detailed neural control across many levels of local-global abstraction than simple biomechanical models indicate, and argues for a simplification of this complexity in utilizing automation for enhancing the utility of gait metrics.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Gait Analysis Techniques</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0182">The analysis of gait movement is performed in laboratories measuring the body motion (kinematics) and forces involved to produce this movement (kinetics), such as force plates being stepped on (Roost U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,062, Fuglewicz U.S. Pat. No. 5,299,454), with walkways and treadmills for constrained motion, and strobe lighting of photographic images, video recordings, and multiple cameras for 3D limb location. Also, marker systems are used for reflecting from body placed reflectors (Pugh U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,676) at specific locations using IR lighting and cameras, or these can be beacon emissive illuminators. A trajectory of the motion is derived from computer analysis. All of this motion and force measurement use Newton's Equations to compute joint dynamics and forces, and net moments of force at each joint. The analysis is limited to individual muscle groups, such as extensor or flexors of the limb. Specific muscles can be instrumented with surface electrodes for EMG recordings for activation timing and level, which measures contributions to gait and prosthetic limb control (Wells US 2006/0155386). Analysis of this gait data, as deviations from normality, is used to diagnose specific conditions (e.g., compensation for underlying pathologies, and application of rehabilitation engineering), or in clinical applications for sports training and effects of corrective Orthopedic surgery, and to predict outcome from treatments, or measure the effectiveness of training programs.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0183">Existing gait analysis equipment includes laboratory instrumentation of foot placement position on force plates using treadmills or on sensing cross-wire grid pathways (Trantzas U.S. Pat. No. 5,952,585, Boyd U.S. Pat. No. 4,600,016), and with/without upward looking cameras, and can be instrumented using force plates for detecting heel-strike and toe-off (Nashner U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,087, Nashner U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,944). These measurements are also used for podiatric diagnosis (Anderson U.S. Pat. No. 4,416,293). Simultaneous body motion analysis is made using video recordings of joint markers, positioned on the outer body sides, or 1) using beacons (e.g., visible and RF tags (Au U.S. Pat. No. 4,813,436, Menache U.S. Pat. No. 6,831,603), 2) ultrasonic, 3) RF (Kane U.S. Pat. No. 6,784,826, 4) RF tracking (Polhemus.com) of snowboard ankle location and joint rotation (Delorme 2002), and 5) pulsed EM tracking (Ascension-tech 2010) of foot for building models (Brown 2009), 6) combined RF and ultrasonics (Solinsky U.S. Pat. No. 6,292,106), and 7) IR emitters to locate body parts, when placed on the body for 3D ranging solutions. Most all gait analysis is either in a laboratory environment, or as an embedded system, such as in a testing room or in a hallway using step vibration monitoring (Alwan US 2006/0195050).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0184">Direct placement of MEMS acceleration and rotation sensors on the body is generally on the foot as point measurements (e.g., in the shoe-sole (Hubbard U.S. Pat. No. 6,360,597, Wanderman U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,561), shoe-top, shoe-back, shoe-heel, or multiple shoe positions about the shoe sole (e.g., Confer U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,930, McCarthy U.S. Pat.

Additionally, limb relative position measurements to determine relative joint angle motion can incorporate mechanical ligament testing (Daniel U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,471), wired goniometric sensors strapped to the limbs (McLeod, U.S. Pat. No. 4,834,057) or as rotational, optically coordinated sensing using attached limb locations (Broers U.S. Pat. No. 7,611,520).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0185">These direct sensor measurements placed on the body have allowed for mammal motion analysis of humans in both gait, activity, and navigation applications with/without RF connectivity (Solinsky U.S. Pat. No. 7,610,166 (using Hg Loop sensors on muscles, indicating pressure changes from stressors, see Hokanson (1975), Pretorius (1989), Urso (1990)), Kahn U.S. Pat. No. 7,647,196, Daumer U.S. Pat. No. 7,640,804, Dar U.S. Pat. No. 7,632,239, Hanawaka US 2008/0146968), and for other mammal motion analysis, such as horses in both gait and health applications (as video (Wang, US 2007/0229552), as track placed sensors (Tasch, U.S. Pat. No. 6,699,207) or sensors placed on back and foot (Davies US 2006/0000420, Bushman U.S. Pat. No. 7,552,538) as for heel strike and weight sensing (Vock U.S. Pat. No. 7,627,451, Vock U.S. Pat. No. 7,620,520).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0186">However, these direct sensor approaches involve at least one sensor attached to the foot, and an offline analysis of the data to have utility, because the sensed data from two or more limbs is not being compared in real-time. It is not clear that a Track and Balance approach requires defining the gait cycle with on-foot, TD/TO measurements, or by using GRF force plate measurements.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Gait Analysis Metrics</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0187">The anatomical terms of locomotion are defined as the movement of the body structure by the contraction of the muscles, and are defined by the direction that the muscles move skeleton parts relative to each other (e.g., flexion (bending) and extension (straightening), abduction (pulls away from body midline) and adduction (pulls toward body midline), internal or medial rotation (turn hip, shoulder, toes inward towards midline) and external or lateral rotation (turn hip, shoulder, toes, arms outward towards midline), elevation (as superior direction up) and depression (as inferior direction down); there are also special terms for the hands and feet (as surfaces, forearm rotation, flexion of the entire foot, and movement of the foot sole away/towards the median plane) (Anatomy2 2010).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0188">The study of kinesiology in physical therapy is not limited to gait analysis, and combines human movement with physiology, and began with early descriptions of complex rotary (ACM) and translatory motion (CM). The analysis divides actions as events, being the definition of phases of movement (e.g., descending and ascending with a squat, and the two knee flexions), specification of the joint involved, and of the axis and plane of the movement, and the internal and external involved forces, with identifying contributing muscles. Each plane of motion has a variety of axes and angular directions for specification. This is combined with forces and moments acting around a joint. Hence, much of the body kinesiology involves angular motion creating thrusting (e.g., acceleration, deceleration) forces (Mathiyakom 2010).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0189">The basis of gait analysis lies in the changes during the vertical, lateral sheer, and progressional sheer forces during the GRF pattern, of the stance phase of gait, in terms of body weight or vertical acceleration. With no force, the weight is considered to be the actual weight on a scale. Changes above and below the scale weight are forces of acceleration and deceleration of the body, which change with gait speed. Slower speeds as in walking create the two peaks of the 62% period of the gait cycle for walking, and a reduction in the running phase to half that for slow walk, and a flattening into one wide peak at body weight for running. The moment of torque in the joint movements creating a rotary force that moves the joint occurs when the mass of the body is not vertically aligned over the joint; muscle actions restrain a postural collapse. Sagittal plane angles for thigh and hip joint motion change during the gait cycle (flexion/extension: thigh (20&#xb0;/20&#xb0;) and hip (30&#xb0;/10&#xb0;) for 0% and 50% of the gait cycle, with (25&#xb0;/35&#xb0;) for 85% of the gait cycle), indicating relative changes of the thigh must be separated from the hip motion, which is done from an axis vertical to the horizon. This hip torque changes significantly in amount between flexion and extension motion during the stance phase, accompanied by a change in the body weight vector, which is a change in the constant gravitational acceleration (g) from the thrust force acceleration (a) of the foot as a misalignment of the vectors, which is quickly re-aligned (e.g., 2% of cycle, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Such alignment can only be determined with direct measurements on the limbs of a and g.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0190">Dominant hip muscle groups are the hamstrings (biceps femoris longhead, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and adductor magnus and gluteus maximus) contract in late mid swing (80% of gait cycle) and relax just before contact, but with differences in the overlapping activity. A similar analysis can apply to other muscles groups (Perry 1992). More recent in vivo tomographic analysis has indicated that more muscles might be involved than just the abductor and adductor groups for joint stability, in order to properly represent hip forces, based on 3D analysis of subject data and computed moment arms (Nemeth 1989).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0191">Biomechanics analysis of the gait cycle of a stride, consisting of two steps taken in a stride time (actually the number of steps in the gait cycles are as there are number of legs, thus differing between humans and horses), beginning the cycle with the initial contact of the limb on the ground surface (heel-strike or foot-fall, TD, etc.), where toe-off (TO) begins for walking at 62% of this cycle, dividing the cycle into the stance and swing phases, with a forward normal or natural walking speed at 1.5 m/s. Foot-angle or toe out is the deviation of the foot mid-point muscles from the placement from the forward progression line. The step-length is the distance between the heel-strike of one foot to the following opposite foot, heel-strike, and walking base is the length in perpendicular measurements defining forward motion. The step rate is the cadence in steps/min, defining the stride length as (120*speed)/cadence, which is normally 1.5 m. Various analyses of gait parameters has proven useful, such as data at natural, fast, and slow categories of speed cadence and step length, and in scatter-grams of cadence vs. walking, stride length vs. speed, natural stride length vs. height and leg length, and cadence vs. root-square of leg length. Results show linear and quadratic relationships for regression analysis of these scatter grams (Locomotion 2010). Mean values differ between males and females (M/F) as step-length (cm) 79/66, stride-length (cm) 158/132, cadence (steps/min) 117[60-132]/117[60-132], speed (called velocity in m/s) 1.54/1.31, and walking-base (cm) 8.1/7.1, and foot-angle (degrees) 7/6 (Stride 2010). In addition, an analysis by members of the orthopedic profession showed agreement on rear-foot angle as a means of defining clinical assessment of foot type variances, indicating the utility of this metric in gait analysis (Chuckpaiwong 2009). Thus, current gait analysis metrics are still focused on foot joint angle modeling, with demographic representations of simplified, standardized measurements.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Gait Analysis Applications</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0192">The various techniques described above, for assessing locomotion through gait metrics, are applied for a variety of applications in diagnosis, physical therapy, training, and post operation treatments, such as in sports injuries (including ACL injuries), elderly care, orthopedics and chiropractory, which are among others in the following examples:

        <ul id="ul0025" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0025-0001" num="0194">a. General research has shown a variety of technologies useful in studying sports injury mechanisms, involving video (ACL, lateral ligament (leg side), modeling, interviews, cadaver and dummy analysis, in vivo (strain &#x26; force measurements) and clinical (arthroscopy, radiology, CT, MRI) studies, are required in combination and also with the mechanisms leading up to and at the injury time (e.g., landing with sidestep cutting, unforeseen footpath changes/obstructions) (Krosshaug 2005), (Withrow 2006).</li>
            <li id="ul0025-0002" num="0195">b. Gait transitions in walk run (WR) and run walk (RW) on treadmills suggest they occur over extended times beyond a step up to a stride (Hreljac 2007).</li>
            <li id="ul0025-0003" num="0196">c. ACL injury mechanisms are more dominantly from non-contact injuries (72% vs. 28%), occurring at foot-strike (TD) with the knee close to full extension, such as during deceleration prior to a change of direction or landing motion, where contact was related to a collapse of the valgus, collapsing of the knee. Conjecture is that the extensor mechanism can strain the ACL and maximum, eccentric muscle force conditions, with also the quadriceps playing a disruption role, where the passive protection by the hamstrings has been reduced from an above average flexibility (Boden 2000).
            <ul id="ul0026" list-style="none">
                <li id="ul0026-0001" num="0197">i. There are over 200,000 ACL injuries in the US, with 50% being surgically corrected. The ACL injury is a tearing of the ligament and an injury to the joint surfaces or menisci (articular or footballer's cartilage), which inhibits the normal ACL information about balance to the joint and surrounding muscles, and allows the knee to give way; this can be improved with specific exercise and reconstruction surgery and a proper rehabilitation exercise program. However, full recovery from the injury is never complete, and avoidance of ACL injuries is preferred (McNicholas 2010).</li>
                <li id="ul0026-0002" num="0198">ii. The use of braces in post surgery rehabilitation has not always been beneficial, due to potentially a decrease in neuromuscular activity as measured from coordination tests and EMG in drop jump tests. Analysis showed that improvements were due more to mechanical action, enhanced coordination, and a psychological effect (Rebel 2001).</li>
                <li id="ul0026-0003" num="0199">iii. Risk factor analysis of ACL injuries show a dominance of athletic movements, and a potential for miss identifying risk factors leading to non-optimal injury prevention programs. The injury is based on an excessive tension force loading being applied, which can occur under non-contact conditions. This loading is driven by the interplay of the GRF and the quadriceps muscle contraction force. Biomechanical studies are not always predictive of valgus moment loading, but a vertical drop landing did show predictability. In particular, soccer, basketball, and volleyball players over three seasons showed knee abduction angle at landing was 8&#xb0; greater in ACL injuries, vs. non-injuries (Garrett 2009b). This strain was measured in the anteromedial bundle (AMB) of the ACL using strain gauges, which showed that the anterior tibial force was the primary determinant of AMB strain, when increasing with angle from 0&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;, and when the AMB medial force was combined with anterior forces, it was shown to account for 50% of the strain, being similar to valgus torque and internal axial force combinations. This is an increased strain for injuries being attributed to muscle combinations, not well represented in single muscle actions of simple biomechanical models (Berns 1992, Berns 2005).</li>
                <li id="ul0026-0004" num="0200">iv. Knee angle data and thigh muscle activity EMG measurements in woman showed for squats and step-ups to be dominated by quadriceps activation and hence be an inexpensive exercise for ACL rehabilitation (Beutler 2002).</li>
                <li id="ul0026-0005" num="0201">v. During preparation for landing in vertical stop jump is related to risks for non-contact ACL injury that is greater in females than males. Males exhibited a motor control pattern of increased hip and knee flexion to absorb GRF in preparation for impact and ACL loading, as shown from increased quadriceps and hamstring EMG activity (Chappell (2009).</li>
                <li id="ul0026-0006" num="0202">vi. Approaches studying ACL injuries from the sidestep cutting motion, modeled dynamic skeletal behaviors for 10 males and 10 females from force plate measurements, and examined the external knee anterior force and valgus internal rotation moments. Kinematics came from 3D coordinates of skin marker motion using 6-shuttered video cameras. Modeling used 12 DOF from 5-supporting skeletal segments with 31 muscles. Modeled peak anterior drawer muscle forces were below levels required for ACL injuries. However, valgus loads did reach values high enough to rupture ligaments, and was a more likely injury in females. In disagreement with past publications (Griffin 2000), the new study concluded that modifying the Sagittal plane biomechanics would be unlikely to prevent ACL injuries (McLean 2004); see Griffin article cited by 56 articles from 2000 through 2010; see also (Song 2001), for a similar 3D modeling with less than 10% error between computations and experimental measurements, where the issues of including ACL material properties might improve further injury predictions.</li>
                <li id="ul0026-0007" num="0203">vii. Agility training improved medial hamstrings activity (as measured with EMG in rectus femoris, vastus medialis oblique, medial hamstrings, and lateral hamstrings, and EM kinematic motion analysis) in female basketball players during a sidestep pivot maneuver, which might reduce ACL sprains and injuries, relative to a test group without agility training (Wilderman 2009).</li>
                <li id="ul0026-0008" num="0204">viii. More recent work has identified risk factors between non-contact ACL injuries and mechanisms at work, but asks more questions than answers: do training effects generalize to competitive situations, do they lead to long-term behavior change, do they scale with size, do they deal with stretching and endurance. The study identifies prevention as not only a motor control and technique issue, with repetition and practice, but these are done under very controlled and balanced conditions, and hence they do not get at the heart of the real environment that contributes to the injuries. An effective approach must be done often, and involve strength, neuromuscular control, and monitoring over a larger group with better measurements (Garret 2009).</li>

Professional volleyball sports requires stable joints in order of ankle, knees, hips, and lumbar spine, which come from walking on the balls of the feet for barefoot balance, instead of heel-strike walking, which requires non-shoe instrumentation (Performance_Corps 2010). This is similar to the stable, body-centered walking used in martial arts (e.g., Aikido), and is present in many jumping and sprinting activities.</li>

Using a percentage of body weight being supported during treadmill stimulation in gait training resulted in better walking abilities (Vistintin 1998). In general, treadmill training after stroke has improved recovery with substantially increased walking speeds, and fast walking showed speed related improvements in body and limb kinematics and muscle activations (Lamontagne 2004).</li>
            <li id="ul0028-0002" num="0211">b. Reduced walking abilities in post-stroke patients was observed in spatiotemporal measurements with 3D GRF sensing, quantitatively linking the paretic leg output with this forward propulsion measurement as a possible tool for distinguishing functional compensation from physiological restitution (Bowden 2006).</li>
            <li id="ul0028-0003" num="0212">c. The mechanisms underlying motor recovery after stroke are not fully understood. Using functional MRI (fMRI) analysis of brain activity has only recently been applied to the lower limbs. Partial body supported treadmill training of chronic patients with post-stroke moderate paresis was investigated. Despite strong subcortical contributions to gait control, rehabilitation-associated walking improvements with the distal ankle movements, in analogy with similar studies of hand wrist movements, are associated with cortical activation changes, with the recovery with foot movements being distinct (Enzinger 2009).</li>

Impaired walking performance post stroke may be assessable through analysis of gait variability (e.g., step-lengths, stride-widths; and pre-swing, swing, and stride times), and was shown particularly for between leg differences to be useful as quantifiable markers of impaired walking performance (Balasubramanian 2009).</li>

Whiplash chronic injuries involved trunk sway measurements during clinical stance, and were compared to gait tasking to see if specific patterns emerged between chronic and normal subjects. Greater trunk sway differences were noted for task-specific gaze control, such as walking up/down stairs, for chronic subjects, and less so for head movements. This is a balance disorder in performing gait tasks by chronic subjects (Sjostrom 2003). Other such results identified increased energy expenditure during standing for ankle and hip muscles as trunk-flexed posture (Saha 2007). There is a locomotion skill related to balance strategies in adolescents with scoliosis (Mallau 2007).</li>

Low back pain subjects showed more postural sway and more posterior center of foot force plate stability positioning, and less balance on one foot with eyes closed than normal subjects (N N Byl 1991). Also, chronic low back pain subjects were compared to normal control subjects under postural control strategies of the pelvis and trunk that exhibited increased postural sway; 3D movement strategies were documented with markers and cameras to estimate angular displacement, and showed a higher postural sway was correlated with rotational over more lateral flexion to adjust balance (Van Daele 2009).</li>

Measurements of velocity-dependent changes in stride-length and stride-frequency with a French saddle horse and rider on a track and on a treadmill were made using video gait analysis. Linear relationships between stride-frequencies, increasing on the track relative to the treadmill at higher speeds, and on the walk, stride-length was significantly shorter on the track relative to the treadmill; this indicated a strong linear relationship between length and speed for both conditions, but without effects observed from incline (Barrey 1993).</li>

The subjects were tested on a neuropsychological battery of tests and a motor evaluation (with dual and single tasking). Gait profiles varied between the three cognitive groups and in the dual tasking, the MCI and AD groups were quite similar.

<p id="p-0122" num="0234">Leg intramuscular pressure has been identified as providing useful muscle function during human locomotion (Ballard 1998), but the explicit muscles and their functions that related to dynamic, locomotion has not been identified. Thigh and calf midpoint muscle cross-sections provide a simplification to locomotion metric measurements. An analysis of the accessible regions, used by Solinsky with Hg loop sensors, can provide further insight (Solinsky U.S. Pat. No. 7,610,166). The example of lower body muscles summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (answers.com 2010), can be divided more completely into six muscle group regions (below by number): the Hip (Iliac, Lower Extremity), Thigh, Knee, Leg (here used as calf muscles), Ankle, and Foot, with some muscles operating in multiple regions as measured in cross-sections of the Thigh and Calf limbs. The goal of the measurements is to capture a part of the muscle actions to infer further energy contributions, e.g. to Balance and Track locomotion through the integration of Power (P) as an energy expenditure rate. The muscle groups contributing to the measurements are discussed next (Gray 1918), and identify all of the functionality (sub-grouping by letter) for each numbered muscle groups present, but with a focus on identifying the dominant muscles shown in cross-section drawings for Thigh Gray432 and Calf Gray440 (Gray432, Gray440 2010), which are useful for determining Track and Balance metrics with loop muscle-pressure (P) sensors; here the relationship between pressure and muscle action forces (A) is made with a nonlinear mapping function, &#x2111;. Note that many muscles listed have multiple functions.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0235">The complete muscles present in the lower body are shown below, as a collection of web summaries and reprints, with possibly some overlap in nomenclature. The purpose in the discussion is to show the plausibility of the integrated analysis approach, but has a caveat to not represent the muscle details in connecting one region to another, e.g., knee extender to hip flexor, but more so to define regions of important muscle expenditures of energy. Note, dominant muscle names are highlighted in italics (Gray, Anatomy 2010), with bolded-italics for dominate cross-sectional size in the thigh (Gray432 2010) and calf (Gray440 2010) and also appear in later figures.

<p id="p-0124" num="0272">As described herein, this muscle outline and linking between groups show a strong correlation between the thigh and calf cross-section muscles and the functions of locomotion for TD and TO occurring during the periodic motion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Using Grays Plates 432 (thigh) and 440 (calf) cross sections, one finds the dominant muscles listed above in multiple cross-sectional sizes (Gray432 2010, Gray440 2010). One of the six dominant hip muscles (H1&#x2014;Quadratus femoris) is also present in the thigh region, as well as all of the six dominant knee muscles (K1-K6).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0273">This implies that the thigh muscle cross-section will be of value in knee lifting and hip swing aperiodic locomotion activities, and the calf muscle cross-section region also has a similar connection with muscles in the ankle and foot for up to the toe-off functionality of periodic locomotion, being <u style="single">F1-F3</u>, and <u style="single">F5</u>, <u style="single">F6</u>, and possibly also in heel-strike measurements. This leads to the potential utility of muscle-pressure measurements in inferring locomotion dynamics of body force exertion, being derived from optimal use of energy expenditures. Similar conclusions are possible for arm and forearm muscle cross-section pressure measurement applications.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Summary of Simplified Human Locomotion</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0274">The body locomotion components can exhibit both periodic and aperiodic dynamics, being quite different from the articulated, linear mechanical motions of biomechanical engineering models using bones, tendons and muscle components, such as the motion defined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> respectively as angular and translation motion. Here, Balance refers to the ACM 3D motion, involving mostly upper-body, changing inertia actions in angular coordinates (angular momentum) of roll, pitch, and yaw, where Track refers to a forward CM 3D motion, along a footpath defined by foot placement at each step, involving mostly lower-body, thrusting action translating total body weight inertia in linear coordinates (linear momentum) of forward step-length direction, heading, and height.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0275"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a sleeve method (Solinsky U.S. Pat. No. 7,610,166, FIG. 5 and FIG. 6) of measuring body thrust forces without accessing the full body motion, by using an Hg loop sensor (Solinsky U.S. Pat. No. 7,610,166, FIG. 7) placed on the calf, but in the example systems and methods described herein the translation of the orientation and acceleration forces are now being directly sensed on the muscles of the legs, and not on the small of the back, and sensors on the feet are not required. The thrust/compression leg force A (=M/a) for body mass M, is measured by the acceleration a, being present when the feet are thrusting on the ground (a&#x2260;0). In the '166 patent, the sleeve also has a series of individual, interwoven strip sensors around the calf to determine calf changes in location from sensed Earth's magnetic field vector orientation B (using magneto-resistive materials) and from leg muscle force-exertion as pressure, P, inferring measurements of A (using stress-resistive materials), being formed as electronic signals (Solinsky U.S. Pat. No. 7,610,166, FIG. 8), which potentially can be replaced in the systems and methods described herein with more point like sensors to increase measurement modality.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0276">From the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> description, the upright mammal locomotion of humans moves the complete mass forward in a linear sequence of steps along a footpath that are spaced in time as left (L) and right (R) steps in a stride, with distance between contacts as a gait cycle description of a L/R step set. Walking speed (ambulation) is the distance traveled by each stride, times the cadence or rate of steps per minute, where normal human walking speed averages 1.5 m/sec or 120 steps/min of 1.5 m stride lengths (i.e., 2-steps/stride). Each step creates a linear momentum sequence, with heading changed by the change in direction from the foot placement, or from momentum changes by the forward speed changing.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0277">The periodic gait cycle time ends with the same starting foot re-placement on the ground (62% of a gait cycle is in the stance phase, as a slightly asymmetric cycle). This cyclic motion recovers about 60% of the energy used in the two-leg &#x2018;pendulums&#x2019; and from ground reaction force bounce. Stride length changes slightly with the log of the walking speed (e.g., 0.7 to 2.0 m, for a speed of 0.5 to 2.5 m/sec), and the periodic cadence changes linearly with the speed (80 to 170 steps/min for the same range). The modeled walking as a continual double pendulum is trading off PE of the rising mass for KE of the forward and up/down motion, and is very efficient. Running changes relative to walking, with a lower mass center, when the leg is vertical, because the impact of landing is absorbed by a bending in the leg (i.e., at the thigh-calf knee joint), and storing and dissipating energy in the muscles and tendons as elastic energy, added to the PE and KE terms.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0278">During this periodic Track motion, the limbs, torso, and appendages of the mammal are involved in a complex, aperiodic motion that drives the moving appendages to create contact with the ground with changes in the Track, represented by the angular momentum sequence of the entire body 3D inertia (I), which has a conservation over longer time periods, but with complex deviations over short time periods that allow for the Track changes. The mammal neural control of this linear and angular momentum is based on a pre-trained, primitive brain function for predicting action based on sensory perception. These actions appear in the muscle flexing and appendage motion for footfall placement that are measurable with physical pressure sensors and appendage location sensors, relative to the ground, as determined by a gravitational force direction on the CM. The location of the limbs in extensions and changes of angular momentum, when the swing and stance phases transition, could be measured with an analysis of the limb location using changes in the original magnetic field sensing described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0279">There is little prior work in biomechanical modeling, gait analysis, and lower muscle measurements and analysis to promote a representation of a proprioception locomotion model that includes the periodic and aperiodic cycles of the limb motion and muscle neural firings (i.e., from both brain and local oscillatory directed action), which is the dominant observable needed in current applications solving problems in diagnosis, therapy, and assessment of health conditions and in physical training.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0280">The approach to using a collection of individual sensors on a band placed on the leg is the migration of the use of a mercury loop sensor from previous approaches for muscle pressure measurements of blood flow, indicating muscle action (Solinsky U.S. Pat. No. 7,610,166) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and incorporates the limb properties, as measured when surrounded by a band sleeve that is placed in circumferentially contact with the limb skin for muscle pressure measurements (with or without a thin film membrane for cleanliness or static friction improvement). The approach also replaces the Earth's gravitational and magnetic force field measurements from being measured on the small of the back with a set of 3D vector sensors into a band of multiple 2D (&#x201c;flat&#x201d;) MEMs sensors, also being in circumferential contact with the limb for location measurements relative to the ground or other firm placement that defines the level foot location during calibration and during gait cycle placements for assessment of Balance and Track metrics. This is accomplished using algorithms that sum 2D vector sets with calibration data into a full 3D representation, similar to the already mentioned sensing of the body in the small of the back, but here it is a 3D location of each locomotion limb &#x201c;volume centroid,&#x201d; and in an independent manner, every band is attached around instrumented limbs having muscle pressures being measured.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0281">The important advantage of limb sensing in the systems and methods described herein is that the thrust force acceleration from the pressure sensors is being measured exactly in the same physical component of the body thrusting limb, with a simultaneous measurement of the local gravitational 3D accelerator vector, relative to this field and can distinguish between the gravitational component of the KE element coming from thrust dynamics and from the PE element from gravitational pull. The magnetic field orientation, from the 3D construction of the 2D sensing MSM set, locates the rotational and joint motion dynamics of each limb in 3D dynamic space, such as from the calf, as well as from the translation motion from the hip and thigh, as the two pendulums in the double, inverted pendulum.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0282"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows data collected from loop bands placed on the left and right legs (L/R) shown in the sketch, where the sleeve uses the original Hg loops. The 3D B and G sensors, placed at the back, also show data as a function of time and under motion of calibration, walking, and running.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0283"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a further modification using the portable data recording system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and the specific Hg loops are shown for both L/R calf and thigh locations at the cross-section midpoint. Thus, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> arrangement can be used to make synchronized measurements on both calf and thigh. In this figure, the back strap <b>1102</b> includes sensors for making 3D magnetic and gravitational measurements. The belly pack <b>1104</b> measures the four loops around the calves and thighs, each loop in this example embodiment including liquid mercury.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0284"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the muscle components represented in these cross-section measurements from the encirclement by the Hg loops of the cross-sectional muscles identified in (UL/LL) Grays 440/432 drawings. Clearly many muscles will contribute to the changes in pressure, but no reliable method exists for measurement of force production of individual muscles during locomotion (Ballard 1998). Intramuscular pressure (IMP) is considered to be one approach, whereas EMG is considered to not be an approach. A subset of just the loop data for the left thigh and left calf are shown in the UR/LR sides of the figure, and collected data for the three activities of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shown on the UR, are in a close up of the walking region on the LR side. The UR data has a 60 Hz component being measured from the magnetic &#x201c;antenna&#x201d; nature of the loops, which is filtered out from the digital data on the LR side of the figure. Note that in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> data examples, the relative gait cycles of the walking data has both in and out of phase relationships from the Calf and Thigh, as shown by the vertical lines.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0285"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a typical analog circuit with a small magnetic sensor being attached outside the loop tuned to 60 Hz, in order to accurately remove the 60 Hz contamination.

Thus, the boards each include a magnetometer, a gravitomer (accelerometer) on an outer side and a force (pressure) sensor on the inner side. A buckle tightens the band. The pressure sensor may, for example, be implemented using a ribbon cable including carbon impregnated silicone rubber, for example, which changes resistance as pressure is applied.</p>

The six locations (UR) are referenced to an elliptical positioning foci about the two calf bones, with an angular separation placed with the six FSRs being on average at &#x394;&#x3b8;=59&#xb0;, when the buckle is also counted as a position, but without a pressure sensor, and is placed near the bone as a fiducial to the muscles of interest. The angular exposure of the pressure sensors encompasses the majority of the energy production regions in the muscles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows the same example placement approach for the thigh and a similar elliptical foci location about the bone and ishiadic nerve, with surprisingly the same average angular placement being also on the order of &#x394;&#x3b8;=59&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0288">The complete system of gravitational and magnetic sensors with the loop pressure sensing is also migrated to the two-band system description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, where RF connectivity is used for interband connectivity, and the individual 3D vector sensing for magnetic (B) and gravitational (G) force fields are shown, along with the pressure inferred thrust acceleration (a); note the stance leg and the swing leg are in different sensing locations with relative angular and level changes between the L and R calves (and can also include the thigh band sets for Q angle and further refinement of Track and Balance, but not shown in the figure).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0289">More specifically, in an example implementation, the buckles of the sensor bands contain electronics for, among other things, collecting data from the various sensors corresponding to pressure force (1D) and magnetic (3D) and gravitational (3D) field rotations. The data from the two buckles are combined to bring the sets of leg motion data into the gait motion data.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0290">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> system also includes tracking which is provided, for example, using a GPS sensor incorporated in one or more of the sensor boards and/or in the buckle electronics. Tracking is useful where, for example, it is desired to provide sensing bands to multiple persons such as players playing a game (e.g., soccer, football, etc.). Tracking provides position information so that, for example, when two or more people interact, sensing band data can be properly associated with each of the interacting persons.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0291">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> system can also provide feedback. Thus, one or more of the sensor boards may include a tactile feedback element so that a person feels a vibration, a jolt to a muscle, etc. when he/she gets out of balance, for example. Visual or aural feedback may alternatively or additionally be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0292"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows an example band (UL) with five MSM PCBs, and the pressure muscle locations (UR) similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> locations for six MSMs. Here, the changes in the band length, using statistics on human standard calf and thigh circumferences, allow for slight repositioning of a fixed band length of sensors, with a variable length between the last sensor and the buckle for adjustments (as a CCW MSM counting) to each individual limb. From the muscle locations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, collected data has shown this adjustment feature to not be a problem in computing Track and Balance metrics. Most likely this is because of the larger muscles occupying a relatively large angular portion of the band circumference, relative to the measurement sample.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0293">It is also possible to reduce the sensor count for boards containing the B, G MEMs, possibly to 3 or 4, and increase the pressure sensing board count to 8, for a reduction in system cost, but with an increase in muscle sensitivity and resolution. These embodiments are also being included, with the use of ICA data processing to measure pressure from the &#x2018;five&#x2019; pseudo muscles of the dominant energy contributions. Note that in larger band length embodiment sizes, the 8 sensors can be spaced at lager intra-MSM distances, but at the same circumference angles.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0294"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows in the mid center of the figure, the actual example band MSMs and the buckle components, and a gap spacing indicated in the drawing at the bottom. Here, in the prototype, ribbon cables were used for MSM interconnection, power, and for band data collection, but in another embodiment, a flex circuit is used, and the MSM components are placed on the flex as additional boards with sensors on both sides. This form factor can also have the local and off body RF connectivity components, data digitization, metric computation and battery power enclosed in the buckle, with a second RF connectivity provided for remote, laptop wireless information display and recording of real-time action, as well as providing local band feedback stimulation signals on the leg.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0295"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows the MSM board layout on the band, at similar angles to the locations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref>, <b>16</b>, and <b>18</b>, and also shows an example algorithm summing the weighted 2D vectors of the MSM board placement (see figure inset, for Bx, By, and Gx, Gy as (X0 Y0), and the FSR pressure sensing) for a 3D vector pseudo-sensing at the center of the band. The algorithm shows only the angle weightings for the CW angle positions in &#x3b8;, but there is also a cos(&#x3c6;) weighting from the calibration for the non-vertical alignment of the band to the thighs and legs during calibration. The algorithm could also use other 2D sensors in another embodiment to construct 3D rotational sensing, such as in other embodiments using MEMs gyros (e.g., (e.g., V<sub>x</sub>=&#x3b1;, V<sub>y</sub>=&#x3b2;, V<sub>z</sub>=&#x3b3; for dV/dT=&#x3c9; gyro rates of these angular velocities of angular motion vs. the vector motion of B and G as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). The summed pressure sensors, P<sub>R</sub>, equals the calibration for the Hg loop sensing during the calibration, making the metrics in psi units to translate to force, with the area of the sensor puck and active FSR surface area being included.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0296"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows data similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, with a calibration, walking, and running activity, only here the individual MEMS on the 5-MSM boards have many more channels being digitized with a 32 Channel ADC. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows the magnetic and gravitational sensor scatter plots of data (e.g., for Bx vs. By and Gx vs. Gy, for the MSM #1 and #2 sensors). The data shows clear cyclic location metrics in time as the points sequence with the walking and running motion, yet trace out the same patterns, showing the limb motion in the relative orientation to be quite similar, but different for the two locations of the MSM boards on the band (roughly 2&#x2033; apart). The gravitational data is similar, with the cyclic patterns being overlaid for the same time period data set, but with a very clear separation between the two gravitational orientations of the fields as being the same, for the case of a=g and a=0 (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for the modeled one leg stance), forming the two large elliptical regions of tight, circular looped data, for the stance (UR) and swing (LL) gait cycle motion phases. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a short time segment of the five individual sensor data plotted in time for just the calf-sensing band, during a walking and running activity, as noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. There is a clear distinction between the different muscle regions with time that are superimposed with band MSM number, with the more typical &#x201c;flat-topping&#x201d; cycle of the running activity. The spikes on some of the data are the set/rest pulses used to remove the hysterias of the magnetic sensor, and can be digitally removed as well as can the noise on one of the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0297"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> shows the computation and 3D vector data collected from a pair of bands (m<sup>th </sup>and (m+1)<sup>th</sup>, for the r<sup>th </sup>board on each band), and a fourth order correlation of the leg motions are used to locate the aperiodic and periodic behavior in spatiotemporal dynamics as time locations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Here, the integration of the periodic and aperiodic data is used to compute the Lagrangian energy metrics and action, as the limbs are moved during gait cycles with fourth-order detection of TD and TO points limiting the time periods of the integration. A linear approximation is used between the leg modeled parameters space (&#x3b1;<sub>0</sub>, l<sub>LEG</sub>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and the mapping to q coordinates in the 3-axis angular motion band data space (e.g., B/B and G/G).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0298"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> shows two different bands (e.g., left leg and right leg at calf). Within each of the bands, the respective modules MSM provide acceleration (pressure), magnetic, and gravitational sensor data. These are shown as gravitational data Gx, Gy for the r-th module, magnetic field data Bx, Bx for the r-th module and pressure data for the r-th module. Thus, each module provides five measurements. This data is combined with the calibration data to provide a gravitational measurement in three axes (Gx, Gy, Gz), a magnetic measurement in three axes (Bx, By, Bz) and a pressure measurement including an average and differences about that average (P<sub>R</sub>, &#x394;P<sup>r</sup>) for each band. These two sets of data are then correlated in time to determine the TO and TD transitions, which define the integration points. From these transition points in the time data, Balance and Track, and gait measurements can be determined, along with derived biomechanical and feedback parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0299">These same sensors are capable of measuring the changes of mass about this CM, which characterizes the aperiodic element of Balance, during the short, aperiodic times between the periodic gait sequences of steps and normal rotational cycles of the pumping arms, swinging shoulders, hips, and torso spine and neck, with bobbing head, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Here, these angular rates can also be measured with MEMs gyros, where one might expect that during the swing phase in a similar manner to &#x3b1;<sub>0 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is a change of the angle from 110&#xb0; to 130&#xb0; to 60&#xb0; to 70&#xb0;, or a total of 100&#xb0; in the 38% of the step cycle (0.5 sec), or at an angular rate of greater than 500&#xb0;/sec. As mentioned earlier, differences in band sensors can be used to measure angular rates of rotation, and by integration of the products in the fourth-order excess autocorrelation function, one can isolate the swing and step phases. Now, the Lagrangian contributions of KE=&#xbd;Mv<sup>2 </sup>and PE=Mgh for the stance phase, and KE=&#xbd;I&#x3c9;<sup>2 </sup>and PE=Mgh for the swing legs will alternate during the gait cycle to construct the Track and Balance metrics. A Lagrangian representation of the mammal mass motion, allows for the separation of this CM-Track and ACM-Balance activities, with the proper placement and location monitoring of appendages having local pressure measurements being made to monitor muscle activity, and changes in limb location and gravitational acceleration to monitor footfall and appendage locations.</p>

This physical/functional data processing and RF connectivity has three modes of operation: 1) as a inter-band sets between two L/R limbs, 2) as a single mammal set with calf and thigh L/R inter-band RF connectivity, and 3) as a single or multiple mammal set with RF connectivity that includes a laptop (&#x201c;LT&#x201d;) RF connectivity shown (with an additional RF-bolt in the physical network connectivity above the dashed line), for displaying real-time data metrics of Balance and Track from each ID'd mammal.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0301">These three physical connectivity operational modes are functionally operating in a number of application configurations, such as in a minimal mode of only a calf-set of N=2, without a laptop for metric-data collection, but still saving the results from a single mammal locally that includes gait data from L/R cycles, or with the addition of two more bands, for N=4, again without a laptop, but as a thigh/calf L/R set that allows for Q computation and a better estimate of the aperiodic motion by including the thigh gyration data in addition to the calf thrust data. With a laptop connectivity added into the physical RF network, the individual band computations can be connected from the inter-band computations between 2 or 4 bands that included the mammal ID (shown as a data metric element on the right side of the RF-bolt above each Band Controller box).</p>

<p id="p-0156" num="0315">The systems and methods described herein infer the more detailed modeling aspects of locomotion from inferred energy action within the measured muscles of just the sensor bands, which can be related back to muscle action in the toes and knee. Rotational actions will independently be limb measurements of the band, with the magnetic limb 3D location sensing and gravitational 3D gravity force sensing. Because the chosen muscle sensor is placed around the cross-sectional bandings of the thigh and calf, it is important to determine the number of muscle sensors and band sizes required for a large portion of the population. Here, the maximum circumference cross-section measurements would be made at the midpoint for a band stress measurement product, which uses a variable length for the thigh or calf, similar to the Mercury (Hg) loops used in the previous measurements (Solinsky U.S. Pat. No. 7,610,166).</p>

<p id="p-0201" num="0360">44. A more complex example application of the system (43) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> for a horse and rider, where the Balance and Track is being computed between the rider's bands (shown on the right side calf only), and between the horse's calf bands (also shown on the right side calves only). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows Track and Balance for the rider riding on the stirrups (so the rider's ground is the stirrup) and the horse is running on the running surface (so the horse's ground is the running surface). The sensor bands are only provided on the horse's calves because the horse's thigh is inside the body. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, sensor bands could also be provided around the rider's thighs. The rider is trying to be in balance and the horse is trying to be in balance.

<p id="p-0203" num="0365">The above-described systems and methods use pressure sensors attached circumferentially to lower body muscles, particularly to encircle the thigh and calf regions, to determine muscle functional actions related to locomotion. In alternative implementations, upper body muscle bands may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0366">The disclosed example systems and methods obtain gait analysis information without using a foot sensor, but instead using multiple bands attached to the calves of each mammal's leg near the midpoint, and in the case of requiring biomechanical gait parameters related to knee angle and a double inverted pendulum modeling, an additional band is attached to the upright locomotion's upper limb at the thigh midpoint, where pressure sensors are used to measure locomotion muscle actions.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0367">Gait analysis parameters can be derived from two paired-limb sensor bands, which do online real-time processing to combine both sensor band data sets in a complete step of stance and swing phases and stride gait analysis from two or four legged mammal applications.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0368">Relative limb positions are located in 3D relative to the ground, by attaching flat bands around limbs, which contain multiple measurements from 2D orthogonal vector sensors (e.g., magnetic, gravitation, acceleration) spaced along the band, which are combined in a synchronized manner to integrate the data into a 3D vector solution at the &#x201c;virtual&#x201d; radial center of the limb in the earth's force fields of magnetic and gravitational forces, using initial compass point and jumped gravity data collection for calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0369">Force sensors of equal area are placed to electronically measure muscle pressure changes in the circumference along the band position location of the sensors on specific limb muscle locations as changing spatial locations from limb motion, in order to infer from spatio-temporal integrations of collected data, an energetic action to infer the muscle functionality dynamics related to gait parametric analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0370">Three sensor types are combined on a single multi-module board, or in a distributed format, to sample the 3D space of the band-encompassed limb volume representing temporal muscles actions with dynamic, spatio-temporal 3D limb location changes relative to the ground gravitational and foot thrust forces, and energy expenditures.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0371">Aperiodic dynamics in upper and lower body motion data are detected, with mathematical techniques that include but are not limited to higher-ordered statistics (HOS; including but not being limited to that of fourth-ordered correlation and its zero-lagged value of excess kurtosis), from other periodic dynamics in upper and lower body motion data, with mathematical techniques that include but are not limited to lower-ordered statistics (such as Gaussian; including but not limited to equal or below second-order correlation and its zero-lagged value of variance), from other aperiodic dynamics data in upper and lower body motion data, as a process to define regions for the integration of dynamic limb motion from both linear and angular dynamics resulting from neural-muscular energy action processes.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0372">A Euler-Lagrangian dynamic Equations of Motion (EL EOM) formulation in generalized coordinates (q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>, q<sub>3</sub>, q<sub>4</sub>) is used for the real body coordinates of heading, height, and step for the CM body mass, linear inertial momentum (Mv) as weight (Mg), and the ACM body mass, of angular momentum as inertia weighted angular velocity (I &#x3c9;) whereby the periodic motion of CM locomotion is in made in generalized coordinates relative to the 3D gravitational acceleration vector angle (being measured on the limb-band radial volumetric-center encompassment) as a relative height direction q<sub>1</sub>/q<sub>1</sub>=G/|G|, and relative height-length value (|q<sub>1</sub>|=h), determined from an arbitrary reference of beginning stationary calibration (e.g., CM located at the small of the back). The angular velocity, aperiodic motion of the ACM locomotion is made in generalized coordinates relative to the 3D Earth's magnetic force field vector angle (in degrees being measured on the limb-band radial volumetric-center encompassment) as q<sub>2</sub>=&#x3c9;(=d/dt[B/|B|]). The step alignment on the ground thrusts aligned between step locations in a gait cycle of the periodic footfalls of Track as 3D vector length q<sub>3</sub>/q<sub>3</sub>=s/s) between steps having length (s=|s|), with angular vector components approximated from a heading defined by the compass heading derived from B, from a pitch up-from-the-ground, defined by the relative height differences between two steps (e.g., &#x394;h=s<sub>2</sub>&#x2212;s<sub>1</sub>), and from a roll up-from-the ground on the left side to ground as a change in leg lengths to the ground between stance and swing phases (e.g., &#x394;l=l<sub>2</sub>&#x2212;l<sub>1</sub>). The changes in the point mass density for the inertia representation, I, where here the distance of the mass locations along the angular rotation axis r are varying with the leg length during the swing-phase (ignoring arm and upper body actions); here q<sub>4</sub>=&#x3c;r&#x3e;, is mostly a length value from a table representation of approximate body weights of the l<sup>th </sup>limbs (e.g., M<sub>l</sub>), which is at the approximation length of q<sub>4 </sub>of the knee joint location (on the lower body from the pelvis when standing), but in a more complex embodiment, this could be computed with further limb mass approximations and with analysis at a higher fidelity within the periodic and aperiodic sections of the gait cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0373">Data is collected from sensor bands in a synchronized manner using RF connectivity, such as with a two limb sensor-set, or two mammals, each with a sensor set, that supports spatiotemporal correlation in second-ordered, and higher-ordered statistics (e.g., fourth-order Coelongation) in order to determine integration of periodic and aperiodic locomotion metrics of Track and Balance useful in monitoring diagnostics, therapy, and treatment for disorder, injuries, and recovery of the brain, spine, stroke and lower body muscles, and for elderly brain disorders from dementia, and Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0374">The example systems and methods integrate within and across numerous gait cycles, in a generalized Lagrangian representation for band measurements on dynamic limb motion, using a generalized coordinate system differentiating between components of periodic CM and aperiodic ACM dynamics, which provides metrics Track and Balance and gait parameter information being reported from numerous RF connected band components to estimate group interaction and individual locomotion event identification that is a precursor to potential injury of less optimized performance.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0375">The example systems and methods can self calibrate a locomotion measurement system using sensor bands being notified of being in a calibration mode, either through external RF commands, or for detecting specific data patterns among multiple sensors, where all of the data is collected from simple body actions such as stepping, jumping, twisting etc., while in a position that faces the four compass points, and includes an upright, and sometimes also a sitting position in a chair for including thigh band calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0376">Multiple sensing bands are used on the body limbs to determine features of body locomotion when constrained with clothing, shoes, coats, etc., that indicates an improper fit or sizing when performing typical locomotion under everyday tasks and recreation.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0377">Multiple measurement points on outer body limbs are used to determine discrete muscle action regions relative to the limb motions under locomotion tasks, with a metric of optimization of energy expended under Track and Balance metrics, but which is not limited to the lower body, but can include neck, arms, waist and other torso regions, but without the need for foot (&#x201c;shoe&#x201d;) or hand (&#x201c;glove&#x201d;) instrumentation. Recreational and sports training in group activities, where skills of non-injurious interaction is valued, can be assessed and Track and Balance metrics collected across the teams can be reviewed to show trends of individuals as they approach contact under varying stress and logistics of the game.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0378">The example systems and methods can use the assumption that ACM angular momentum is conserved and assumes the gravitational force has no net effect on ACM dynamics, when forming derived metrics of Track and Balance from band measured data.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0379">Cross-limb correlation analysis of band measured data for Track and Balance metrics, such as L-thigh to L-calf, L-thigh to R-thigh, R-thigh to R-calf, etc., can be used when forming derived metrics of Track and Balance from band measured data.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0380">Combined mammal locomotion metrics of Track and Balance can be used in a system of metrics for more optimized energy expenditure such as in horse racing.</p>
