<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2007-0134143, filed on Dec. 20, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates to a liquid crystal display device being stably driven.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the information society spreads, the requirements for display devices are varied and gradually increasing. In accordance therewith, a variety of display devices such as liquid crystal display (LCD) devices, plasma display panels (PDP), electro-luminescent display (ELD) devices, and so on, have been researched. Some display devices already have been widely produced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">More specifically, LCD devices are rapidly replacing cathode ray tubes (CRTs), because they have features such as superior picture quality, light weight, slimness, low power consumption, and so on. These LCD devices are being developed in a variety of shapes which are applied to notebook computer monitors, television display screens, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such LCD devices include an LCD panel displaying pictures, and drivers driving the LCD panel. The drivers includes a gate driver generating gate scan signals which are applied to gate lines on the LCD panel, and a data driver generating pixel data voltages which are applied to data lines on the LCD panel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The LCD panel includes first and second substrates and a liquid crystal layer interposed between the first and second substrates. The first substrate is defined by the data lines and the gate lines into pixel regions. Also, the first substrate includes thin film transistors formed at respective intersection regions of the gate lines and the data lines, and pixel electrodes connected to the respective thin film transistors. The second substrate includes red, green, and blue color filters formed in respective pixel regions, and a black matrix formed between the color filters. A common electrode can be formed on the color filters.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This LCD panel allows the thin film transistor to be turned on by the gate scan signal which is applied to the gate line, so that the pixel data voltage on the data line is applied to the pixel electrode through the turned-on thin film transistor. At this time, a common voltage is applied to the common electrode. In accordance therewith, an electric field is generated by a voltage difference between the pixel data voltage on the pixel electrode and the common voltage on the common electrode, and controls an alignment direction of liquid crystal molecule included in the liquid crystal layer, thereby adjusting a light transmittance of the liquid crystal layer. As a result, a picture (or an image) can be displayed on the LCD panel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the LCD device in the related art has a disadvantage in that the data driver generating the pixel data voltages is frequently damaged by means of static electricity from the exterior.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">More specifically, the data driver includes a multiplexer alternatively applying positive and negative polarity pixel data voltages to the data lines every one horizontal period. The multiplexer includes a plurality of switches which are connected to the respective data lines in configuration. The plural switches are generally formed in a connection configuration which is adjacent to a power supply terminal (or a power supply source) and a ground terminal (or a ground source). Due to this, when the static electricity is input from the exterior to the switches, the adjacent power supply and the ground terminals can be connected to each other and/or to the internal wirings of the data driver. Accordingly, the input electricity should be applied to other circuits inside the data driver. As a result, elements and wirings on the inside of the data driver can be damaged.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one general aspect of the present embodiment, an LCD device includes: gate lines and data lines crossing each other; a gate driver applying gate scan signals to the gate lines; and a data driver applying pixel data voltages to the data lines, and including a multiplexer which includes first and second switches that allow a power supply terminal and a ground terminal to be alternatively connected, wherein the first and second switches include source electrodes, drain electrodes, and gate electrodes, respectively, and the source electrodes are alternatively connected to the power supply terminal and the ground terminal.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. These embodiments introduced hereinafter are provided as examples in order to convey their spirits to the ordinary skilled person in the art. Therefore, these embodiments might be embodied in a different shape, so are not limited to these embodiments described here. Also, the size and thickness of the device might be expressed to be exaggerated for the sake of convenience in the drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout this disclosure including the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of an LCD device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a detailed block diagram showing the configuration of a data driver in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an LCD device includes: an LCD panel <b>110</b> displaying pictures (or images); a gate driver <b>140</b> driving a plurality of gate lines GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn on the LCD panel <b>110</b>; a dada driver <b>130</b> driving a plurality of data lines DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm on the LCD panel <b>110</b>; a timing controller <b>120</b> generating control signals to be applied to the gate and data drivers <b>140</b> and <b>130</b>; and a backlight unit <b>150</b>, responsive to the control signals from the timing controller <b>120</b>, applying lights to the LCD panel <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The LCD panel <b>110</b> includes pixels which are respectively formed in regions defined by the plural gate lines GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn and the data lines DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm. Each pixel includes a thin film transistor TFT formed in a intersection of the respective data line DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm and the respective gate line GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn, and a liquid crystal cell Clc connected between the thin film transistor TFT and a common electrode. The thin film transistor TFT responds to a gate scan signal on the respective gate line GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn and switches a pixel data voltage which will be applied from the respective data line DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm to the respective liquid crystal cell Clc. The liquid crystal cell Clc includes a pixel electrode and a common electrode opposite each other in the center of a liquid crystal layer. The pixel electrode is connected to the thin film transistor TFT. The voltage charged in the liquid crystal cell Clc is upgraded every time the thin film transistor TFT is turned on. Moreover, each pixel further includes a storage capacitor Cst connected between the thin film transistor TFT and the previous gate line. The storage capacitor Cst minimizes a natural decrease (i.e., leakage) of the voltage charged in the liquid crystal cell Clc.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The timing controller <b>120</b> derives gate control signals GCS and data control signals from a data clock DCLK, horizontal and vertical synchronous signals Hsync and Vsync, and so on which are applied from an external system such as a graphic module of computer or an image demodulation module of television receiving system. The gate control signals GCS are applied to the gate driver <b>140</b>, and the data control signals DCS are applied to the data driver <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The gate driver <b>140</b> responds to the gate control signals GCS from the timing controller <b>120</b> and applies gate scan signals to the respective gate lines GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn. The gate scan signals sequentially enable the plural gate lines GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn by one horizontal synchronous signal period.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The data driver <b>130</b> responds to the data control signals DCS from the timing controller <b>120</b> and generates pixel data voltages which are applied to the respective data lines DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm on the LCD panel <b>110</b>, every time any one of the gate lines GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn is enabled. In detail, the data driver <b>130</b> receives pixel data by one line from the timing controller <b>120</b>, and converts the received pixel data by one line into the pixel data voltages, which each have the shape of an analog signal, using a gamma voltage set (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">To this end, the data driver <b>130</b> includes: a shift register <b>131</b> providing sequential sample signals; a latch portion <b>133</b>, responsive to the sampling signals, latching and outputting a video data R, G, and B; a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) <b>135</b> converting the video data R, G, and B from the latch portion <b>133</b> into analog pixel data voltages; a multiplexer (MUX) <b>137</b> selectively outputting the pixel data voltages; and a buffer portion buffering the pixel data voltages from the multiplexer <b>137</b> and outputting the buffered pixel data voltages to the data lines DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The shift register <b>131</b> sequentially shifts a source start pulse SSP in synchronization with a source sampling clock SSC and outputs a plurality of the sampling signals.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The latch portion includes a plurality of latches which respond to the respective sampling signals from the shift register <b>131</b> and sequentially sample and latch pixel data by constant numbers. The plural latches simultaneously output the latched pixel data by responding to a source output enable signal SOE.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The digital-to-analog converter <b>135</b> uses positive and negative gamma voltages from a gamma voltage portion (not shown), converts the pixel data from the latch portion <b>133</b> into the analog pixel voltages, and outputs the converted pixel voltages. Also, the digital-to-analog converter <b>135</b> replies to a polarity control signal POL and forces the pixel voltages to each have a polarity (i.e., a positive polarity or a negative polarity) in accordance with a previously set drive mode (for example, one of dot inversion, line inversion, and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The multiplexer <b>137</b> responds to a control signal CS from the exterior and alternatively outputs pixel voltages from the digital-to-analog converter <b>135</b> every horizontal synchronous period.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The buffer portion <b>139</b> buffers the pixel voltages from the multiplexer <b>137</b> and outputs the buffered pixel voltages to the data lines DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Herein, the multiplexer <b>137</b> includes a plurality of switch elements (not shown) that each have an output terminal connected to the buffer portion <b>139</b>. These switch elements in the present embodiment will be explained in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the switch elements included in the multiplexer <b>137</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, first and second switch elements <b>160</b> and <b>170</b>, which are included in the data driver <b>130</b> of the LCD device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, are connected to an input terminal of the buffer portion <b>139</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first and second switch elements <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> include p-type transistors. However it will be recognized that, the first and second switch elements can consist of n-type transistors and thus the invention is not limited to the above disclosed embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">These switch elements <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> are formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>190</b> and are separated from each other. The first switch element <b>160</b> includes a first gate electrode <b>161</b>, a first source electrode <b>163</b>, and a first drain electrode <b>165</b>. First dopant regions <b>167</b><i>a </i>and <b>167</b><i>b </i>are formed between the first gate electrode <b>161</b> and the first source and drain electrodes <b>163</b> and <b>165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Similarly, the second switch element <b>170</b> includes a second gate electrode <b>171</b>, a second source electrode <b>173</b>, and a second drain electrode <b>175</b>. A second dopant region <b>177</b> is formed between the second gate electrode <b>171</b> and the second drain electrode <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first source electrode <b>163</b> of the first switch element <b>160</b> is connected to a power supply terminal (or source) VDD, and the first drain electrode <b>165</b> is connected to an output terminal Output which is connected to the buffer portion <b>139</b>. The first gate electrode <b>161</b> is connected to the second drain electrode <b>175</b> of the second switch element <b>170</b>. On the other hand, the second source electrode <b>173</b> of the second switch element <b>170</b> is connected to a ground terminal VSS, and the second gate electrode <b>171</b> of the second switch element <b>170</b> receives a drive signal CS from the exterior.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Consequently, the first and second switch elements <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> are configured such that one is selectively turned on by the control signal CS and then the other one is turned off. Also, it is evident that the first and second switch elements <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> are connected to one buffer that is connected to one of data lines DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm. Furthermore, the first and second source electrodes <b>161</b> and <b>171</b> of the first and second switch elements <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> are selectively connected to the respective power supply and ground terminals VDD and VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this manner, since the first and second source electrodes <b>161</b> and <b>171</b> are alternatively connected to the respective power supply and ground terminals VDD and VSS, the adjacent power supply and ground terminals VDD and VSS can be not connected to each other and simultaneously to the internal wirings of the data driver (i.e., the input terminal of the buffer portion <b>139</b>), due to the static electricity, when the static electricity is input to the first and/or second switch elements <b>160</b> and/or <b>170</b>. Consequently, the distance between the adjacent power supply and ground terminals VDD and VSS is enlarged. Accordingly, the internal elements and wirings of the data driver <b>130</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be damaged by static electricity. As a result, the data driver <b>130</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be protected from the defects and may improve its reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described above, the LCD device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure is alternatively connected to the power supply terminal (or source) and the ground terminal (or source) by means of the switch elements of the multiplexer, so that the distance between the power supply terminal (or source) and the ground terminal (or source) is enlarged in comparison with the one of the related art. The LCD device of the present embodiment can corrects the problem in that the internal elements and wirings included in the data driver are damaged due to static electricity from the exterior. As a result, the LCD device of the present embodiment prevents the defects of the data driver and improves its reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present disclosure. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure cover the modifications and variations of this embodiment provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
