<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a high-frequency signal transmission line and more particularly relates to a high-frequency signal transmission line including a ground conductor and a signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a high-frequency signal transmission line having a stripline structure in which a signal line is sandwiched between ground conductors from above and below, due to the reason described below, the line width of the signal line is increased in order to decrease a high-frequency resistance value of the signal line. More specifically, when a high-frequency signal flows through the signal line, the high-frequency signal flows in a concentrated manner through the vicinity of the surface of the signal line due to a skin effect. In addition, when the high-frequency signal flows through the signal line, a high-frequency signal flows also through the ground conductors in a direction opposite to that of the high-frequency signal due to electromagnetic induction. The high-frequency resistance value of such a high-frequency signal decreases, if the surface area of the signal line and the area of a portion of each ground conductor which the signal line faces increase and conductor loss in the signal line and each ground conductor decreases. Therefore, in the high-frequency signal transmission line, the line width of the signal line is increased in order to decrease the high-frequency resistance value of the signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when the line width of the signal line is increased, the area of a portion where the signal line and each ground conductor face each other increases, and a capacitance occurring between the signal line and the ground conductor increases. Thus, in order to set the high-frequency signal transmission line so as to have a predetermined impedance, the distance between the signal line and each ground conductor is increased and the capacitance is decreased. However, when the distance between the signal line and each ground conductor is increased, the thickness of the high-frequency signal transmission line increases and it becomes difficult to bend and use the high-frequency signal transmission line.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, it is considered that the signal line and each ground conductor are not arranged to face each other. Hereinafter, this will be described in more detail with reference to the drawing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a diagram of a high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> in which a signal line <b>502</b> is exposed from a ground conductor <b>504</b>, as seen in a planar view from a lamination direction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> includes the signal line <b>502</b> and the ground conductors <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>. The signal line <b>502</b> is a line-shaped conductor. The ground conductor <b>506</b> is provided on the lower side of the signal line <b>502</b> in the lamination direction and faces the signal line <b>502</b> through a dielectric layer. The ground conductor <b>504</b> is provided on the upper side of the signal line in the lamination direction and has an opening. The signal line <b>502</b> is located in the opening when being seen in a planar view from the upper side in the lamination direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the signal line <b>502</b> and the ground conductor <b>504</b> do not overlap each other when being seen in a planar view from the lamination direction. Thu, a capacitance occurring between the signal line <b>502</b> and the ground conductor <b>504</b> in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> is smaller than a capacitance occurring between a signal line and a ground conductor in a high-frequency signal transmission line in which the signal line and the ground conductor overlap each other. Due to this, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b>, it is possible to decrease the distance between the signal line <b>502</b> and the ground conductor <b>504</b>. As a result, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b>, the thickness of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> can be decreased, and it becomes possible to bend and use the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> has a problem that unwanted radiation from the signal line <b>502</b> occurs. The signal line <b>502</b> does not overlap the ground conductor <b>504</b>. Thus, an electromagnetic field generated by a current flowing through the signal line <b>502</b> is not absorbed by the ground conductor <b>504</b> and is radiated through the opening to the outside of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b>, and unwanted radiation occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a high-frequency signal transmission line that can solve the above problem, for example, a flexible board described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-123740 is known. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a diagram of a flexible board <b>600</b> described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-123740, as seen in a planar view from a lamination direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The flexible board <b>600</b> includes a signal line <b>602</b> and a ground layer <b>604</b>. The signal line <b>602</b> is a line-shaped conductor. The ground layer <b>604</b> is laminated on the upper side of the signal line <b>602</b> in the lamination direction via a dielectric layer. In addition, although not shown, a ground layer is provided on the lower side of the signal line <b>602</b> in the lamination direction. In the flexible board <b>600</b>, a plurality of openings <b>606</b> is provided in the ground layer <b>604</b>. The openings <b>606</b> have rectangular shapes and are arranged on the signal line <b>602</b> in a line. Thus, the signal line <b>602</b> partially overlaps the ground layer <b>604</b> when seen in a planar view from the upper side in the lamination direction. As a result, in the flexible board <b>600</b>, since the signal line <b>602</b> overlaps a portion of the ground conductor <b>604</b> where no opening is formed, unwanted radiation from the signal line <b>602</b> is reduced in this portion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in the flexible board <b>600</b> described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-123740 as well, unwanted radiation occurs through the openings <b>606</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, preferred embodiments of the present invention significantly reduce and prevent unwanted radiation in a high-frequency signal transmission line that includes a ground conductor provided with an opening that overlaps a signal line.</p>

In addition, gold plating is applied to the front surfaces of the external terminals <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b. </i></p>

Thus, the ground conductor <b>24</b> is provided on a first front surface of the dielectric element assembly <b>12</b>. The ground conductor <b>24</b> extends on the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>c </i>in the x-axis direction and faces the signal line <b>20</b> through the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>c</i>.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, the ground conductor <b>24</b> is composed of a line portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>and terminal portions <b>24</b><i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>c</i>. The line portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>is provided on the front surface of the line portion <b>18</b><i>c</i>-<i>a </i>and extends in the x-axis direction.

The openings <b>30</b> have rectangular shapes when being seen in a planar view from the z-axis direction, and overlap the signal line <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>. Thus, the signal line <b>20</b> alternately overlaps the openings <b>30</b> and the bridge portions <b>60</b> when being seen in a planar view from the z-axis direction. In addition, the openings <b>30</b> are arranged at equal intervals.</p>

Thus, the ground conductor <b>22</b> is provided on a second front surface of the dielectric element assembly <b>12</b>. The ground conductor <b>22</b> extends on the back surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a </i>in the x-axis direction and faces the signal line <b>20</b> through the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b</i>. The ground conductor <b>22</b> faces the ground conductor <b>24</b> through the signal line <b>20</b>. Substantially no opening is provided in a portion of the ground conductor <b>22</b> which faces the signal line <b>20</b>. In other words, the ground conductor <b>22</b> is an electrode continuously extending along the signal line <b>20</b> in the line portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>in the x-axis direction, namely, is a so-called solid electrode. However, the ground conductor <b>22</b> does not need to fully cover the line portion <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and, for example, a micro hole or the like may be provided at a predetermined position in the ground conductor <b>22</b> for releasing gas that occurs when thermoplastic resins of the dielectric sheets <b>18</b> are thermocompression-bonded. The ground conductor <b>22</b> is produced from a metal material containing silver or copper as a principal component and having a low specific resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, the ground conductor <b>22</b> is composed of a line portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>and terminal portions <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c</i>.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, the signal line <b>20</b> is sandwiched between the ground conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> via the dielectric layers <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>c </i>from both sides in the z-axis direction. In other words, the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> form a tri-plate type stripline structure. In addition, the interval between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>22</b> is substantially equal to the total thickness T<b>1</b> of the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and is, for example, 50 &#x3bc;m to 300 &#x3bc;m.

In the present preferred embodiment, the interval between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>24</b> is 50 &#x3bc;m. In other words, the thickness T<b>1</b> is designed so as to be larger than the thickness T<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, when the thickness T<b>1</b> is made larger than the thickness T<b>2</b>, a capacitance occurring between the ground conductor <b>22</b> and the signal line <b>20</b> is reduced, and the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> for setting a predetermined impedance (e.g., 50&#x3a9;) can be increased. Thus, transmission loss can be reduced, and hence the electrical characteristics of the high-frequency signal transmission line can be improved. In the present preferred embodiment, a capacitance occurring between the ground conductor <b>22</b> and the signal line <b>20</b> is a main factor for impedance designing, and the ground conductor <b>24</b> is used as a ground conductor for reducing radiation of a signal, for impedance designing. In other words, with the ground conductor <b>22</b> and the signal line <b>20</b>, a characteristic impedance is set so as to be high (e.g., 70&#x3a9;), and a region having a low impedance (e.g., 30&#x3a9;) is provided in a portion of the high-frequency signal transmission line by adding the ground conductor <b>24</b>. By so doing, the impedance of the entire high-frequency signal transmission line is designed so as to be a predetermined impedance (e.g., 50&#x3a9;).</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Method for Manufacturing High-Frequency Signal Transmission Line)</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Hereinafter, a method for manufacturing the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the following, the case where a single high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is produced will be described as an example. However, in reality, a plurality of high-frequency signal transmission lines <b>10</b> is simultaneously produced by laminating and cutting large dielectric sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">First, the dielectric sheets <b>18</b> that have copper foil formed on the entireties of the surfaces thereof and are formed from thermoplastic resin are prepared. For example, the surfaces of the copper foils of the dielectric sheets <b>18</b> are smoothened by providing zinc plating for corrosion prevention thereon. The dielectric sheets <b>18</b> are liquid crystal polymers having thicknesses of 20 &#x3bc;m to 80 &#x3bc;m. In addition, the thickness of the copper foil is 10 &#x3bc;m to 20 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, the external terminals <b>16</b> and the ground conductor <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are formed on the back surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a </i>by a photolithographic process. Specifically, resists having the same shapes as those of the external terminals <b>16</b> (<b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>) and the ground conductor <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are printed on the copper foil of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a</i>. Then, etching treatment is performed on the copper foil to remove the portion of the copper foil that is not covered with the resists. Then, the resists are removed. By so doing, the external terminals <b>16</b> and the ground conductor <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are formed on the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, the signal line <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is formed on the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>b </i>by a photolithographic process. In addition, the ground conductor <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is formed on the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>c </i>by a photolithographic process. These photolithographic processes are the same as the photolithographic process performed when forming the external terminals <b>16</b> and the ground conductor <b>22</b>, and thus the description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Next, a laser beam is applied to locations on the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>c </i>where the via-hole conductors b<b>1</b> to b<b>4</b> and B<b>1</b> to B<b>3</b> are to be formed, to form through-holes. Then, the through-holes formed in the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>are filled with a conductive paste.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>c </i>are stacked in order from the positive direction side to the negative direction side in the z-axis direction such that the ground conductor <b>22</b>, the signal line <b>20</b>, and the ground conductor <b>24</b> have a stripline structure. Then, heat and pressure are applied to the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>c </i>from the positive direction side and the negative direction side in the z-axis direction, to soften the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>c </i>to compression-bond and integrate the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>c</i>. The conductive paste filled in the through-holes is solidified to form the via-hole conductors b<b>1</b> to b<b>4</b> and B<b>1</b> to B<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Each dielectric sheet <b>18</b> may be integrated to each other by means of an adhesive such as epoxy resin instead of thermocompression bonding. In addition, the via-hole conductors b<b>1</b> to b<b>4</b> and B<b>1</b> to B<b>3</b> may be formed by integrating the dielectric sheets <b>18</b>, then forming through-holes, and filling the through-holes with a conductive paste or forming a plating film in the through-holes.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, a paste obtained by mixing a filler with polyimide is applied to the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>c </i>to form the high dielectric constant layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Lastly, a resin (resist) paste is applied to the back surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a </i>to form the protective layer <b>14</b>. Thus, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Advantages)</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> configured as described above, unwanted radiation can be reduced. More specifically, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, the high dielectric constant layer <b>15</b> has a relative dielectric constant &#x2208;<b>2</b> higher than the relative dielectric constant &#x2208;<b>1</b> of the dielectric element assembly <b>12</b> and is provided on the first principal surface of the dielectric element assembly <b>12</b> so as to overlap the openings <b>30</b> in the ground conductor <b>24</b>. Thus, as described below, more electromagnetic fields radiated from the signal line <b>20</b> are reflected at the interface between the high dielectric constant layer <b>15</b> and an air layer into the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In a high-frequency signal transmission line according to a comparative example in which a dielectric sheet formed from the same material as that of the dielectric element assembly is laminated on the ground conductor <b>24</b>, the difference in relative dielectric constant at the interface between the dielectric sheet and an air layer is &#x2208;<b>1</b>-<b>1</b>. Meanwhile, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, the difference in relative dielectric constant at the interface between the high dielectric constant layer <b>15</b> and the air layer is &#x2208;<b>2</b>-<b>1</b>. Since the relative dielectric constant &#x2208;<b>2</b> is higher than the relative dielectric constant &#x2208;<b>1</b>, &#x2208;<b>2</b>-<b>1</b> is higher than &#x2208;<b>1</b>-<b>1</b>. Here, when the difference in the relative dielectric constant at the interface increases, an amount of an electromagnetic field reflected at the interface increases. Thus, an amount of an electromagnetic field reflected at the interface of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is larger than an amount of an electromagnetic field at the interface of the high-frequency signal transmission line according to the comparative example. In other words, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, more electromagnetic fields are reflected at the interface between the high dielectric constant layer <b>15</b> and the air layer into the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, as indicated by an electromagnetic field F<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and thus leakage of an electromagnetic field as unwanted radiation to the outside of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is suppressed. Further, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, the same phenomenon as that at the interface between the high dielectric constant layer <b>15</b> and the air layer occurs also at the interface between the high dielectric constant layer <b>15</b> and the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>c</i>, as indicated by an electromagnetic field F<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, unwanted radiation is more effectively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In addition, according to the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, a plurality of the openings <b>30</b> is provided in the ground conductor <b>24</b>, and thus the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> can easily be bent.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In addition, according to the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, deviation of the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> from a predetermined characteristic impedance (e.g., 50&#x3a9;) can be suppressed. More specifically, in the flexible board described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-123740, there is the possibility that an electromagnetic field will leak through the opening to the outside of the flexible board. Thus, when a dielectric body, a metal body, or the like is provided on the periphery of the flexible board, electromagnetic coupling occurs between the signal line of the flexible board and the dielectric body, the metal body, or the like. As a result, there is the possibility that the characteristic impedance of the signal line of the flexible board will deviate from a predetermined characteristic impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Meanwhile, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, the back surface of the dielectric element assembly <b>12</b> which is located on the ground conductor <b>22</b> side with respect to the signal line <b>20</b> is in contact with the battery pack <b>206</b>. In other words, the ground conductor <b>22</b> in which substantially no opening is formed is provided between the signal line <b>20</b> and the battery pack <b>206</b>, and the ground conductor <b>24</b> in which the openings <b>30</b> are formed is not provided therebetween. Thus, occurrence of electromagnetic coupling between the signal line <b>20</b> and the battery pack <b>206</b> is suppressed. As a result, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, deviation of the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> from a predetermined characteristic impedance is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In addition, according to the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, it is possible to easily bend the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> due to the following reason as well. The characteristic impedance Z of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is represented by &#x221a;(L/C). L is an inductance value of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> per unit length. C is a capacitance value of the high-frequency signal transmission line per unit length. The high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is designed such that Z becomes a predetermined characteristic impedance (e.g., 50&#x3a9;).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Here, in order to enable the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> to be easily bent, decreasing the thickness in the z-axis direction (hereinafter, referred to merely as thickness) of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is considered. However, when the thickness of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is decreased, the distances between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> decrease, and the capacitance value C increases. As a result, the characteristic impedance Z becomes less than the predetermined characteristic impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thus, it is considered that the line width in the y-axis direction (hereinafter, referred to merely as line width) of the signal line <b>20</b> is decreased to increase an inductance value L of the signal line <b>20</b> and the facing area of the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> is decreased to decrease the capacitance value C.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">However, it is difficult to accurately form the signal line <b>20</b> having a narrow line width.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Thus, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, the openings <b>30</b> are provided in the ground conductor <b>24</b>. Due to this, the facing area of the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>24</b> decreases and the capacitance value C decreases. As a result, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> can easily be bent while the characteristic impedance Z is maintained at the predetermined characteristic impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In addition, according to the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, the high dielectric constant layer <b>15</b> is provided on the ground conductor <b>24</b>. Due to this, the ground conductor <b>24</b> is not exposed to the outside on the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>. Thus, even when another component is disposed on the front surface of the dielectric element assembly <b>12</b>, the ground conductor <b>24</b> does not directly face the other component, and hence variation of the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> is suppressed.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The ground conductor <b>24</b> has a ladder shape by alternately providing a plurality of the openings <b>30</b> and a plurality of the bridge portions <b>60</b> along the signal line <b>20</b>. The openings <b>30</b> overlap the signal line <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when being seen in a planar view from the z-axis direction, and each have a shape that is line-symmetrical about the signal line <b>20</b>. In other words, the signal line <b>20</b> extends across the centers of the openings <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, the openings <b>30</b> each have a shape that is line-symmetrical about a straight line A that passes through the centers of the openings <b>30</b> in the direction in which the signal line <b>20</b> extends (in the x-axis direction) and that is orthogonal to the signal line <b>20</b> (namely, extends in the y-axis direction). A detailed description will be given below.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">A region including the center of each opening <b>30</b> in the x-axis direction is defined as a region A<b>1</b>. In addition, a region corresponding to each bridge portion <b>60</b> is defined as a region A<b>2</b>. Further, a region located between the region A<b>1</b> and the region A<b>2</b> is referred to as a region A<b>3</b>. The regions A<b>3</b> are located on both sides of each region A<b>1</b> in the x-axis direction and are each adjacent to the region A<b>1</b> and the region A<b>2</b>. The length of each region A<b>2</b> in the x-axis direction (i.e., the length of each bridge portion <b>60</b>) is, for example, 25 to 200 &#x3bc;m. In the present preferred embodiment, the length of each region A<b>2</b> in the x-axis direction is 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The straight line A passes through the center of the region A<b>1</b> in the x-axis direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The width W<b>1</b> of the opening <b>30</b> in the region A<b>1</b> in a direction orthogonal to the signal line <b>20</b> (in the y-axis direction) is larger than the width W<b>2</b> of the opening <b>30</b> in each region A<b>3</b> in the y-axis direction. In other words, each opening <b>30</b> has a shape in which a central portion of the opening <b>30</b> in the x-axis direction is wider than any other portions of the opening <b>30</b>, and has a shape that is line-symmetrical about the straight line A. In each opening <b>30</b>, a region in which the width in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>1</b> is the region A<b>1</b>, and regions in which the width in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>2</b> are the regions A<b>3</b>. Thus, steps are present at the boundaries between the regions A<b>1</b> and A<b>3</b> of the opening <b>30</b>. The width W<b>1</b> is, for example, 500 to 1500 &#x3bc;m. In the present preferred embodiment, the width W<b>1</b> is 900 &#x3bc;m. In addition, the width W<b>2</b> is, for example, 250 to 750 &#x3bc;m. In the present preferred embodiment, the width W<b>2</b> is 480 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In addition, the length G<b>1</b> of each opening <b>30</b> in the x-axis direction is, for example, 1 to 5 mm. In the present preferred embodiment, the length G<b>1</b> is 3 mm. Here, the length G<b>1</b> is longer than the width W<b>1</b> that is the maximum width of each opening <b>30</b>. The length G<b>1</b> is preferably equal to or larger than twice that of the width W<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition, in the ground conductor <b>24</b>, no opening is provided between the adjacent openings <b>30</b>.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>configured as described above, between the adjacent two bridge portions <b>60</b>, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> varies so as to increase to a minimum value Z<b>2</b>, an intermediate value Z<b>3</b>, and a maximum value Z<b>1</b> in order and then decrease to the maximum value Z<b>1</b>, the intermediate value Z<b>3</b>, and the minimum value Z<b>2</b> in order as distance from one bridge portion <b>60</b> increases toward the other bridge portion <b>60</b>. More specifically, each opening <b>30</b> has a width W<b>1</b> in the region A<b>1</b>, and has, in each region A<b>3</b>, a width W<b>2</b> smaller than the width W<b>1</b>. Thus, the distance between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>24</b> in the region A<b>1</b> is larger than the distance between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>24</b> in each region A<b>3</b>. Due to this, the intensity of a magnetic field occurring in the signal line <b>20</b> in the region A<b>1</b> is greater than the intensity of a magnetic field occurring in the signal line <b>20</b> in each region A<b>3</b>, and an inductance component in the region A<b>1</b> increases. In other words, the L factor is dominant in the region A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Further, the bridge portion <b>60</b> is provided in each region A<b>2</b>. Thus, the distance between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>24</b> in each region A<b>3</b> is larger than the distance between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>24</b> in each region A<b>2</b>. Due to this, a capacitance occurring in the signal line <b>20</b> in each region A<b>2</b> is greater than a capacitance occurring in the signal line <b>20</b> in each region A<b>3</b>, and the intensity of a magnetic field in each region A<b>2</b> is less than the intensity of the magnetic field in each region A<b>3</b>. In other words, the C factor is dominant in each region A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Due to the above, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> is the maximum value Z<b>1</b> in the region A<b>1</b>. In other words, each opening <b>30</b> has a width W<b>1</b> at a position where the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> is the maximum value Z<b>1</b>. In addition, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> is the intermediate value Z<b>3</b> in each region A<b>3</b>. In other words, each opening <b>30</b> has a width W<b>2</b> at positions where the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> is the intermediate value Z<b>3</b>. Moreover, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> is the minimum value Z<b>2</b> in each region A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Thus, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>has a circuit configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. More specifically, in the region A<b>1</b>, almost no capacitance occurs between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>24</b>, and thus the characteristic impedance Z<b>1</b> mainly occurs by an inductance L<b>1</b> of the signal line <b>20</b>. In addition, in each region A<b>2</b>, a large capacitance C<b>3</b> occurs between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>24</b>, and thus the characteristic impedance Z<b>2</b> mainly occurs by the capacitance C<b>3</b>. Further, in each region A<b>3</b>, a capacitance C<b>2</b> smaller than the capacitance C<b>3</b> occurs between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>24</b>, and thus the characteristic impedance Z<b>3</b> occurs by an inductance L<b>2</b> of the signal line <b>20</b> and the capacitance C<b>2</b>. Moreover, the characteristic impedance Z<b>3</b> is, for example, 55&#x3a9;. The characteristic impedance Z<b>1</b> is higher than the characteristic impedance Z<b>3</b>, and is, for example, 70&#x3a9;. The characteristic impedance Z<b>2</b> is lower than the characteristic impedance Z<b>3</b>, and is, for example, 30&#x3a9;. In addition, the characteristic impedance of the entire high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>is 50&#x3a9;.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">According to the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, between the adjacent two bridge portions <b>60</b>, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> varies so as to increase to the minimum value Z<b>2</b>, the intermediate value Z<b>3</b>, and the maximum value Z<b>1</b> in order and then decrease to the maximum value Z<b>1</b>, the intermediate value Z<b>3</b>, and the minimum value Z<b>2</b> in order as distance from one bridge portion <b>60</b> increases toward the other bridge portion <b>60</b>. Thus, decrease in thickness of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>can be achieved, and even though the thickness is small, the electrode width of the signal line <b>20</b> can be increased. Thus, the surface areas of electrode portions in the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> where a high-frequency current flows can be increased, and the transmission loss of a high-frequency signal is decreased. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the length AL of one cycle (a region A<b>1</b>, two regions A<b>2</b>, and a region A<b>3</b>) is 1 to 5 mm and is small. Thus, even in a higher frequency range, unwanted radiation can be suppressed and the transmission loss can be improved. Further, since the regions A<b>3</b> are located on both ends of the region A<b>1</b>, an intense magnetic field occurring due to a current flowing through the signal line <b>20</b> is not transmitted directly to each region A<b>2</b>. Thus, a ground potential in each region A<b>2</b> is stabilized and the shielding effect of the ground conductor <b>24</b> is maintained. Due to this, occurrence of unwanted radiation can be suppressed. As a result, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, even when the distances between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are decreased, the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> can be increased, and it is possible to decrease the thickness of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>having decreased transmission loss and reduced unwanted radiation with the characteristic impedance maintained. Thus, it is possible to easily bend the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, and it is possible to bend and use the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In addition, according to the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the transmission loss can be reduced with stabilization of the ground potential in the ground conductor <b>24</b>, and further shielding characteristics can be improved. More specifically, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the width W<b>1</b> of each opening <b>30</b> in the region A<b>1</b> is larger than the width W<b>2</b> of the opening <b>30</b> in each region A<b>3</b>. Thus, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the magnetic field energy of the signal line <b>20</b> located in the region A<b>1</b> is higher than the magnetic field energy of the signal line <b>20</b> located in each region A<b>3</b>. In addition, the magnetic field energy of the signal line <b>20</b> located in each region A<b>2</b> is lower than the magnetic field energy of the signal line <b>20</b> located in each region A<b>3</b>. Thus, the characteristic impedance of the signal line repeatedly varies to Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>1</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>2</b>, . . . in order. Therefore, in the signal line <b>20</b>, the variation of the magnetic field energy in portions adjacent to each other in the x-axis direction becomes gentle. As a result, the magnetic field energy becomes small in the boundary between the unit structures (the regions A<b>1</b> to A<b>3</b>), the variation of the ground potential in the ground conductor is suppressed, and occurrence of unwanted radiation and the transmission loss of a high-frequency signal are suppressed. In other words, occurrence of an unwanted inductance component in each bridge portion <b>60</b> can be suppressed by each region A<b>3</b>. As a result, a mutual inductance component between each bridge portion <b>60</b> and the signal line <b>20</b> can be decreased, and the ground potential can also be stabilized. Thus, even though the high-frequency signal transmission line is small in thickness and has the relatively large openings <b>30</b> in the ground conductor, unwanted radiation can be reduced and the transmission loss of a high-frequency signal can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In addition, since the via-hole conductors B<b>1</b> to B<b>3</b> are arranged in the extending direction of each bridge portion <b>60</b>, occurrence of an unwanted inductance component in each bridge portion <b>60</b> can be further suppressed. Particularly, since the length G<b>1</b> of each opening <b>30</b> in the x-axis direction (i.e., the length between the bridge portions <b>60</b>) is longer than the width W<b>1</b> of the opening portion in the region A<b>1</b>, occurrence of unwanted radiation can be suppressed even while the area of each opening <b>30</b> is increased as much as possible and a predetermined characteristic impedance is accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In addition, the openings <b>30</b> have unit structures that are periodically arranged in the direction in which the signal line <b>20</b> extends (in the x-axis direction). Thus, the frequency characteristics of the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> in each opening <b>30</b> can be determined by the length of the opening <b>30</b> in the x-axis direction. In other words, the frequency characteristics of the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> can expand to a higher frequency range as the length G<b>1</b> of each opening <b>30</b> decreases. As the length G<b>1</b> of each opening <b>30</b> increases, the width W<b>1</b> of the region A<b>1</b> can be decreased and each opening <b>30</b> can be narrowed. Thus, unwanted radiation can be reduced and the transmission loss can be decreased, and hence expansion of the band of and stabilization of the impedance characteristics of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, due to the following reason as well, it is possible to bend and use the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>. In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the region A<b>1</b> is the easiest to bend since the width of the opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction is the largest. Meanwhile, each region A<b>2</b> is the most difficult to bend since no opening <b>30</b> is provided therein. Thus, when the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>is bent and used, the region A<b>1</b> is bent, and each region A<b>2</b> is hardly bent. Therefore, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the via-hole conductors B<b>1</b> to B<b>3</b> which are more difficult to deform than the dielectric sheets <b>18</b> are provided in each region A<b>2</b>. Thus, it is possible to easily bend the region A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">It is noted that in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, a predetermined characteristic impedance can be obtained even by adjusting the magnitude of the distance T<b>1</b> between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>22</b> and the magnitude of the distance T<b>2</b> between the signal line <b>20</b> and the ground conductor <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In addition, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, due to the reason described below, the length G<b>1</b> of each opening <b>30</b> in the direction in which the signal line <b>20</b> extends is larger than the width W<b>1</b>. More specifically, a transmission mode of a high-frequency signal in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is a TEM mode. In the TEM mode, an electric field and a magnetic field are formed so as to be orthogonal to a direction in which a high-frequency signal is transmitted (the x-axis direction). In other words, a magnetic field occurs so as to draw a circle having a center at the signal line <b>20</b>, and an electric field occurs radially from the signal line <b>20</b> toward the ground conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Here, when the openings <b>30</b> are provided in the ground conductor <b>22</b>, a magnetic field draws a circle, and thus, merely expands such that the radius thereof increases in each opening <b>30</b> and does not greatly leak to the outside of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Meanwhile, a portion of an electric field is radiated to the outside of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Thus, in unwanted radiation of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, electric field radiation occupies a large proportion.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Here, since the electric field is orthogonal to the direction in which a high-frequency signal is transmitted (the x-axis direction), when the width W<b>1</b> of each opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction increases, an amount of an electric field radiated from each opening <b>30</b> increases (unwanted radiation increases). Meanwhile, the characteristic impedance of the high-frequency transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>can be increased as the width W<b>1</b> is increased. However, in the high-frequency transmission line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the electric field almost disappears at a distance that is about three times that of the line width of the signal line <b>20</b>, from the signal line <b>20</b> in the direction orthogonal to the direction in which a high-frequency signal is transmitted (the x-axis direction). Thus, even when the width W<b>1</b> is increased further, the characteristic impedance cannot be increased further. Therefore, when it is considered that unwanted radiation increases as the width W<b>1</b> increases, it is not preferable to increase the width W<b>1</b> more than necessary. Further, when the width W<b>1</b> nearly reaches &#xbd; of the wavelength of a high-frequency signal, electromagnetic waves are radiated as a slot antenna, and unwanted radiation is increased further.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Meanwhile, the area of the signal line <b>20</b> that faces the ground conductor <b>22</b> can be decreased as the length G<b>1</b> of each opening <b>30</b> in the x-axis direction is increased. Thus, it is possible to increase the line width of the signal line <b>20</b>. Due to this, an advantage that the high-frequency resistance value in the signal line <b>20</b> can be decreased is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In addition, when the length G<b>1</b> is larger than the width W<b>1</b>, the high-frequency resistance value of a reverse current (eddy current) in the ground conductor <b>22</b> is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Due to the above, the length G<b>1</b> is preferably larger than the width W<b>1</b>, and is preferably equal to or larger than twice that of the width W<b>1</b>. However, when the length G<b>1</b> of each opening <b>30</b> in the x-axis direction is close to &#xbd; of the wavelength of a high-frequency signal, electromagnetic waves are radiated from the opening <b>30</b> as a slot antenna. Thus, it should be taken into consideration that the length G<b>1</b> needs to be sufficiently short with respect to the wavelength.</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The difference between the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>is the shape of each opening <b>30</b>.

In contrast, in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the width of each opening in the y-axis direction changes continuously.

Thus, the magnetic field energy and the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> change continuously.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">It is noted that in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a region A<b>1</b> is provided so as to have a center at the straight line A and is a region including a portion where the width of the opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A first difference between the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>e </i>and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>is that the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> in each bridge portion <b>60</b> is smaller than the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> in a position where the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> is the maximum value Z<b>1</b>. A second difference between the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>e </i>and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>is that each opening is formed in a tapered shape between a position where the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> is the intermediate value Z<b>3</b> (i.e., a position where the width of the opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>2</b>) and a position where the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> is the maximum value Z<b>1</b> (i.e., a position where the width of the opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>1</b>). A third difference between the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>e </i>and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>a </i>is that each opening <b>30</b> is formed in a tapered shape between a position where the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> is the intermediate value Z<b>3</b> (i.e., a position where the width of the opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>2</b>) and the bridge portion <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">First, the definition of the regions A<b>1</b> to A<b>3</b> in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>e </i>will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The region A<b>1</b> is a region where the width of the opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>1</b>. The region A<b>2</b> is a region corresponding to the bridge portion <b>60</b>. The region A<b>3</b> is a region that is sandwiched between the region A<b>1</b> and the region A<b>2</b> and includes a region where the width of the opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The first difference will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> in the region A<b>2</b> is a line width Wb. Meanwhile, the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> in the region A<b>1</b> is a line width Wa larger than the line width Wb. The line width Wa is, for example, 100 to 500 &#x3bc;m. In the present preferred embodiment, the line width Wa is 350 &#x3bc;m. The line width Wb is, for example, 25 to 250 &#x3bc;m. In the present preferred embodiment, the line width Wb is 100 &#x3bc;m. Since the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> in the region A<b>2</b> is smaller than the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> in the region A<b>1</b> as described above, the area where the signal line <b>20</b> and the bridge portion <b>60</b> overlap each other is decreased. As a result, a stray capacitance occurring between the signal line <b>20</b> and the bridge portion <b>60</b> is reduced. Further, since the line width of a portion of the signal line <b>20</b> which overlaps the opening <b>30</b> is the line width Wa, an increase in the inductance value of the portion of the signal line <b>20</b> is suppressed. Moreover, since the line width of the entirety of the signal line <b>20</b> is not decreased but the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> is partially decreased, an increase in the resistance value of the signal line <b>20</b> is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In addition, the signal line <b>20</b> is formed in a tapered shape in a portion where the line width thereof changes. Thus, variation of the resistance value in the portion where the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> changes becomes gentle, and occurrence of reflection of a high-frequency signal in the portion where the line width of the signal line <b>20</b> changes is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The second difference will be described. Each opening <b>30</b> is formed in a tapered shape between the position where the width of the opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>2</b> and the position where the width of the opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>1</b>. In other words, the end portion of the opening <b>30</b> in the x-axis direction in the region A<b>3</b> is formed in a tapered shape. Thus, the loss of a current flowing through the ground conductor <b>24</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The third difference will be described. Each opening <b>30</b> is formed in a tapered shape between the position where the width of the opening <b>30</b> in the y-axis direction is the width W<b>2</b> and the bridge portion <b>60</b>. Thus, both end portions of the bridge portion <b>60</b> in the y-axis direction are formed in tapered shapes. Therefore, the line width of the bridge portion <b>60</b> in the x-axis direction is smaller in a portion overlapping the signal line <b>20</b> than in the other portions. As a result, a stray capacitance occurring between the bridge portion <b>60</b> and the signal line <b>20</b> is reduced. In addition, since the line width of the entirety of the bridge portion <b>60</b> is not decreased but the line width of the bridge portion <b>60</b> is partially decreased, increases in the resistance value and the inductance value of the bridge portion <b>60</b> are suppressed.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The difference between the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>h </i>and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is that a dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>d </i>is laminated on the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>c</i>.
