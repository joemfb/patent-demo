<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed is a method suitable for large-scale producing silver nanostructures including nanoparticles and nanowires with high crystallization and purity in a short period of time. In this method, silver particles with mean diameter less than 200 nm and silver nanowires with length in micrometers are produced through a microwave-assisted wet chemistry method. Tens to hundreds grams of silver nanoparticles and nanowires are obtained in minutes by microwave irradiation treatment to a precursor pre-made by highly concentrated silver salt solution and other additives. These silver nanoparticles and nanowires have good dispersibility and are ideal for forming conductive adhesives.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to silver nanostructures and a method for producing the same. The invention relates to synthesis of silver nanoparticles and nanowires suitable for large-scale production and use in interconnects of fine circuit pattern, more specifically, and forming conductive adhesives for use in electronic parts, such as electrode of light emitted diode, electrode packing on PCB substrate and packaging materials for integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For fundamental research, when the size of solid reaches nanometer order, the solid's property will be vastly changed due to the small size effect and quantum effect. For metal, especially the noble metal (here we refer to silver (Ag) and gold (Au)), their optical (surface plasma effect) and catalytic properties are mostly dominated by their morphology. Many research works at present are aiming at exploring and utilizing these unique characters<sup>[Ref. 1-5]</sup>, which promotes the manufacturing of silver or gold nanostructures in large scale.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">From technique and industrial point of view, silver powders are widely used in electronic industry, especially used to fabricate conductive adhesives. The conductive adhesive is used in electronic parts, such as electrode of light emitted diode, electrode packing on PCB substrate and packaging materials for integrated circuits. The conventional conductive adhesive is produced by mixing conventional adhesive and a conductive power such as carbon, copper, aluminum or silver powder. Silver is known to have higher electronic and thermal conductivity, but be much lower in price than that of other noble metals like gold and platinum. These characters make silver powder a competitive candidate as a filler filled in conductive adhesive. In most cases, high concentration (about 75&#x2dc;85% in weight) of silver particles or flake like silver plates in size from micrometer to sub-micrometer are used to form a conductive pattern in the adhesive to have a low resistivity at the order of 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>ohm-cm. A problem coming with this technique is that such a high concentration of filler will dramatically degrade the properties of adhesive itself, eg. its shear strength, impact strength. To lower the filler concentration meanwhile without compromising its conductivity, therefore, is always a challenge. Dr. Wu.HP<sup>[Ref. 6]</sup> (in paper &#x201c;High conductivity of isotropic conductive adhesives filled with silver nanowires&#x201d; <i>International Journal of Adhesion </i>&#x26; <i>Adhesives </i>26 (2006), 617&#x2dc;621) demonstrated a combination of silver particles and nanowires would drastically lower the threshold of filling concentration to reach a high conductivity. An even lower filling concentration could be expected reasonably if only nanowires are used in the adhesives. This brings a challenge on how to produce silver nanowires selectively in a scalable fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Known methods of manufacturing silver nanowire are broadly divided into template-assistant and template-free methods. For template-assistant methods, porous AAO (Anodic Alumina Oxide), carbon nanotube and some &#x201c;soft-template&#x201d; like porous TiO<sub>2 </sub>are widely used as a template that will induce silver to grow into nanowires. The morphology of the nanowires such as diameter and wire length can be controlled when choosing different templates. For template-free methods, silver particles or silver nanowires are produced by reducing it from silver salt at temperature 80&#x2dc;150&#xb0; C.; morphology of which can be tailored by tuning the amount of surfactant, or adding different reducing agent<sup>[Ref. 7-21]</sup>.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0029">Silver nanowires obtained by template-assisted method are always impure, since it is hard to retrieve silver from its templates. For example, the silver covered Ag-carbon-nanotube (CNY) composite nanowires, the carbon nanotube functioned as substrate is difficult to remove; and the coverage of silver is incomplete and imperfect at most of times. In addition, the template itself such as AAO has its drawback, which is fragile, small in size and difficult to produce.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0030">On the other hand, template-free method is the widest used method to synthesis silver particles and nanowires in laboratory, where Prof. Xia. YN in the University of Washington had developed it a lot since 1990s, who used a double-inject apparatus that allowed silver salt to be reduced to silver and grow into nanowire simultaneously. Nevertheless, disadvantages of this wet-chemistry method are still obvious, due to its low manufacturing efficiency. Usually, hours to days of time are needed, but only milligrams of outputs will get from the manufacturing procedure. This is also the problem for template-assistant method.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0031">Coprecipitation of silver salt and precipitator is another method to get large volume of silver particle which is a commonly used method in industry. The outputs are plate-like or particle like silver ranging from micrometer to sub-micrometer in size; no nanowire or nanoparticle could be got.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0032">Recently, a microwave-assisted solution method is used as a rapid synthesis to get silver nanowire [21], however, the efficiency is still at a low level, which yields mixture of nanoparticle and wires with only 0.04 kg silver per litre volume of solvent per reaction time in hour.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0033">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to overcome such problems by promoting a method which could produce silver nanowires and nanoparticles with high efficiency. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a comparison between this patent results and previous reports, in terms of kilograms silver produced per unit of liter*hour. We demonstrate that the disclosed method can produce silver nanostructures selectively and the processing efficiency (Kg/(L*h)) to produce silver is at least one order of magnitude higher than the best published results. Another object is to fabricate a prototype of conductive adhesive utilizing selectively synthesized silver nanowires.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0015" num="0035">In order to accomplish the aforementioned objects, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for producing a silver nanoparticle and silver nanowire, the method comprising the steps of: producing a precursor containing silver ions, surfactant, additive and reducing agent; treat this precursor under microwave irradiation for minutes to get silver nanoparticle or nanowire products when washed under water for several times.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0036">In this method, the precursor is made following the steps of: resolving silver salts and surfactant into reducing agent to get transparent solution; adding some soluble chloride to the solution and stirring it to form a precursor suspension. To get silver nanoparticle or nanowire outputs, it needs to put the suspension under microwave irradiation for minutes; then washing these outputs by water or ethanol for several times; re-dispersing in ethanol or drying them to get the final products. As mentioned, silver salts refer to silver nitrate or silver acetate; surfactant refers to polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), preferable the degree of polymerization K&#x3e;30; reducing agent refers to glycol, glycerol or their mixture; soluble chloride refers to sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), magnesium chloride (MgCl<sub>2</sub>), Calcium Chloride (GaCl<sub>2</sub>), zinc chloride (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>).</p>

Washing the outputs by water or ethanol can remove additional unnecessary additives and reducing agent, resulting to purified nano silver, which can be well re-dispersed in most organic solvents or dried to powders.</p>

After then, addictive of soluble chloride is added to the solution in order to control the morphology of silver nanoparticles and nanowires. This is the end of procedure to prepare silver ions contained precursor which is a yellow-white colored suspension. Specifically, ratio between AgNO<sub>3 </sub>and PVP is critical to control the final morphology of Ag nanostructure, either nanoparticle or nanowire; AgNO<sub>3</sub>: PVP greater than 1:1 is essential to get pure silver nanoparticle or nanowire, especially in a high concentration reaction system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0046">This prepared precursor is then transferred to a commercial micro oven, undergoing microwave irradiation at power of 240 W&#x2dc;1200 W for only 5 minutes more or less. Solution's color will change from yellow-white to dark brown to final yellow-gray, standing for the stages changing from Ag+ in precursor to initial Ag crystallized seeds to final Ag nanoparticles or nanowires. The silver containing slurry thus obtained is washed with water, centrifugaled to remove unnecessary solvent and surfactant and finally re-dispersed in organic or water solution or dried to powders.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0047">As examples of silver salt, there are silver nitrate, silver acetate.</p>
