<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to communication networks and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for providing information about hyperlinked images embedded in a video session in communication networks, e.g., packet networks such as Service over Internet Protocol (SoIP) networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As extremely high bandwidth access networks become more accessible to residential subscribers, they enable service providers of these networks to integrate voice, video, and data, thereby providing more convenience for end customers and creating new service opportunities. Due to the multi-service nature of these new services, networks can provide additional functionalities to end customers to support multiple simultaneous application sessions to a single subscriber. For instance, a subscriber watching a streaming video session, such as a football match, may want to obtain more information related to the video contents being shown, e.g., recent performance of one of the sport teams playing in the match. There needs to be a way for the subscriber to easily and conveniently obtain desired information related to the contents being shown.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus for providing information about images displayed in a video session in a packet network, e.g., a SoIP network.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, the present invention enables a network provider to embed hyperlinks within streaming video contents that will enable users to click on an embedded hyperlinked image to obtain more information related to the streaming video contents. For example, someone watching a tennis match can click on the hyperlinked image of one of the players and receive a frame of data about his or her recent performance, or someone watching the world news can click on a hyperlinked image of a segment of a world map and receive a frame of data about current events occurring in a particular region. A hyperlink is an icon, a graphic image, or a text string, e.g., within a web page that, when activated, automatically links a user to another web page addressed by a Universal Resource Locator (URL) associated with said icon, graphic image, or text string. A URL is the standard way to express the location of a resource on the Internet and provides a unique address which identifies a resource on the Internet for routing purposes.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To better understand the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a communication architecture <b>100</b> having an example network, e.g., a packet network such as a VoIP network related to the present invention. Exemplary packet networks include internet protocol (IP) networks, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks, frame-relay networks, and the like. An IP network is broadly defined as a network that uses Internet Protocol to exchange data packets. Thus, a VoIP network or a SoIP (Service over Internet Protocol) network is considered an IP network.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the VoIP network may comprise various types of customer endpoint devices connected via various types of access networks to a carrier (a service provider) VoIP core infrastructure over an Internet Protocol/Multi-Protocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) based core backbone network. Broadly defined, a VoIP network is a network that is capable of carrying voice signals as packetized data over an IP network. The present invention is described below in the context of an illustrative VoIP network. Thus, the present invention should not be interpreted to be limited by this particular illustrative architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The customer endpoint devices can be either Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) based or IP based. TDM based customer endpoint devices <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>134</b>, and <b>135</b> typically comprise of TDM phones or Private Branch Exchange (PBX). IP based customer endpoint devices <b>144</b> and <b>145</b> typically comprise IP phones or IP PBX. The Terminal Adaptors (TA) <b>132</b> and <b>133</b> are used to provide necessary interworking functions between TDM customer endpoint devices, such as analog phones, and packet based access network technologies, such as Digital Subscriber Loop (DSL) or Cable broadband access networks. TDM based customer endpoint devices access VoIP services by using either a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> or a broadband access network via a TA <b>132</b> or <b>133</b>. IP based customer endpoint devices access VoIP services by using a Local Area Network (LAN) <b>140</b> and <b>141</b> with a VoIP gateway or router <b>142</b> and <b>143</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The access networks can be either TDM or packet based. A TDM PSTN <b>120</b> or <b>121</b> is used to support TDM customer endpoint devices connected via traditional phone lines. A packet based access network, such as Frame Relay, ATM, Ethernet or IP, is used to support IP based customer endpoint devices via a customer LAN, e.g., <b>140</b> with a VoIP gateway and router <b>142</b>. A packet based access network <b>130</b> or <b>131</b>, such as DSL or Cable, when used together with a TA <b>132</b> or <b>133</b>, is used to support TDM based customer endpoint devices.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The core VoIP infrastructure comprises of several key VoIP components, such the Border Element (BE) <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>, the Call Control Element (CCE) <b>111</b>, VoIP related Application Servers (AS) <b>114</b>, and Media Server (MS) <b>115</b>. The BE resides at the edge of the VoIP core infrastructure and interfaces with customers endpoints over various types of access networks. A BE is typically implemented as a Media Gateway and performs signaling, media control, security, and call admission control and related functions. The CCE resides within the VoIP infrastructure and is connected to the BEs using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over the underlying IP/MPLS based core backbone network <b>110</b>. The CCE is typically implemented as a Media Gateway Controller or a softswitch and performs network wide call control related functions as well as interacts with the appropriate VoIP service related servers when necessary. The CCE functions as a SIP back-to-back user agent and is a signaling endpoint for all call legs between all BEs and the CCE. The CCE may need to interact with various VoIP related Application Servers (AS) in order to complete a call that require certain service specific features, e.g. translation of an E.164 voice network address into an IP address.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For calls that originate or terminate in a different carrier, they can be handled through the PSTN <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> or the Partner IP Carrier <b>160</b> interconnections. For originating or terminating TDM calls, they can be handled via existing PSTN interconnections to the other carrier. For originating or terminating VoIP calls, they can be handled via the Partner IP carrier interface <b>160</b> to the other carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to illustrate how the different components operate to support a VoIP call, the following call scenario is used to illustrate how a VoIP call is setup between two customer endpoints. A customer using IP device <b>144</b> at location A places a call to another customer at location Z using TDM device <b>135</b>. During the call setup, a setup signaling message is sent from IP device <b>144</b>, through the LAN <b>140</b>, the VoIP Gateway/Router <b>142</b>, and the associated packet based access network, to BE <b>112</b>. BE <b>112</b> will then send a setup signaling message, such as a SIP-INVITE message if SIP is used, to CCE <b>111</b>. CCE <b>111</b> looks at the called party information and queries the necessary VoIP service related application server <b>114</b> to obtain the information to complete this call. In one embodiment, the Application Server (AS) functions as a SIP back-to-back user agent. If BE <b>113</b> needs to be involved in completing the call; CCE <b>111</b> sends another call setup message, such as a SIP-INVITE message if SIP is used, to BE <b>113</b>. Upon receiving the call setup message, BE <b>113</b> forwards the call setup message, via broadband network <b>131</b>, to TA <b>133</b>. TA <b>133</b> then identifies the appropriate TDM device <b>135</b> and rings that device. Once the call is accepted at location Z by the called party, a call acknowledgement signaling message, such as a SIP <b>200</b> OK response message if SIP is used, is sent in the reverse direction back to the CCE <b>111</b>. After the CCE <b>111</b> receives the call acknowledgement message, it will then send a call acknowledgement signaling message, such as a SIP <b>200</b> OK response message if SIP is used, toward the calling party. In addition, the CCE <b>111</b> also provides the necessary information of the call to both BE <b>112</b> and BE <b>113</b> so that the call data exchange can proceed directly between BE <b>112</b> and BE <b>113</b>. The call signaling path <b>150</b> and the call media path <b>151</b> are illustratively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Note that the call signaling path and the call media path are different because once a call has been setup up between two endpoints, the CCE <b>111</b> does not need to be in the data path for actual direct data exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Media Servers (MS) <b>115</b> are special servers that typically handle and terminate media streams, and to provide services such as announcements, bridges, transcoding, and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) messages for VoIP service applications.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Note that a customer in location A using any endpoint device type with its associated access network type can communicate with another customer in location Z using any endpoint device type with its associated network type as well. For instance, a customer at location A using IP customer endpoint device <b>144</b> with packet based access network <b>140</b> can call another customer at location Z using TDM endpoint device <b>123</b> with PSTN access network <b>121</b>. The BEs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> are responsible for the necessary signaling protocol translation, e.g., SS7 to and from SIP, and media format conversion, such as TDM voice format to and from IP based packet voice format.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The network shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be extended to become a SoIP network that supports multi-service applications including, but not limited to, video services. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a communication architecture <b>200</b> having an example network, e.g., a packet network such as a SoIP network related to the present invention. A SoIP network supports multi-service applications including voice, data, and video services. In one embodiment, a SoIP network that supports video services is described below. In this SoIP network, voice services supported include, but are not limited to, VoIP services; data services supported include, but are not limited to, Instant Messaging (IM), electronic mail (email), internet access services, or any other IP based applications; and video services include, but are not limited to, Video on Demand (VoD), broadcast video, and video conferencing services.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A SoIP network that supports video services comprises an intelligent multi-service endpoint device connected via packet access networks to a service provider's SoIP core infrastructure employing Internet Protocol (IP) and/or Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Protocols. Broadly defined, a SoIP network is a network that is capable of carrying voice, video, and data signals as packetized data over an IP network. The present invention is described below in the context of an illustrative SoIP network that supports video services. Thus, the present invention should not be interpreted to be limited by this particular illustrative architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Video endpoint device <b>232</b> and <b>233</b> are IP based intelligent multi-service endpoint device supporting voice, video, and data applications. Video endpoint device <b>232</b> and <b>233</b> are signaling endpoints of application sessions, e.g. a VoIP session endpoint, an instant messaging endpoint, or a video session endpoint. In one embodiment, a video endpoint device is a standalone device that can be connected to home electronic appliances such as, but is not limited to, telephone <b>234</b> and <b>235</b>, TV <b>236</b> and <b>237</b>, or Personal Computer (PC) <b>238</b> and <b>239</b>. In another embodiment, a video endpoint device can be integrated with a TV, a PC, or any home appliances with a display.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The access networks are packet based. Packet based access networks <b>230</b> and <b>231</b> use, but are not limited to, Frame Relay, ATM, Ethernet, IP, DSL or Cable broadband access network technologies to interconnect a video endpoint device to a SoIP network that supports video services.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The core SoIP infrastructure that supports video services comprises of several key components, such the Border Element (BE) <b>212</b> and <b>213</b>, the Call Control Element (CCE) <b>211</b>, SoIP related Application Servers (AS) <b>214</b>, Media Servers (MS) <b>215</b>, Session Controller (SC) <b>241</b>, Video of Demand (VoD) Servers <b>242</b>, Broadcast Servers (<b>242</b>), and Instant Messaging (IM) Servers <b>243</b>. A BE resides at the edge of the SoIP core infrastructure and interfaces with customers endpoints over various types of access networks. The functions supported by a BE include those supported by a BE as previously described in network <b>100</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In addition, in a SoIP network that supports video services, a BE also serves as a gateway between a video endpoint device used by a subscriber and the SoIP core network that supports video services. All application sessions initiated by a SoIP subscriber must gain entry to the SoIP core network via a BE. The functions supported by a CCE and a MS are the same as those previously described in network <b>100</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A Session Controller (SC) resides within the SoIP infrastructure and is connected to the BEs using an IP based signaling protocol such as, but is not limited to, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). A SC is responsible for setting up all application session requests, such as VoIP call requests, video session requests, or data session requests, originated by a customer within the network and interacts with, if necessary, the appropriate SoIP related AS in order to complete an application session that requires certain service specific features originated by a customer. A SC also keeps track of all sessions initiated by a customer for session management and billing purposes as well. The functions supported by a SoIP related AS include those supported by a VoIP AS as previously described in network <b>100</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In addition, a SoIP AS also supports all video specific application features. A VoD Server is responsible for supporting video on demand video session requests originated by a customer and sends the requested streaming video contents, such as a movie, to the customer. A Broadcast Server is responsible for supporting broadcast video session requested originated by a customer and sends streaming broadcast video contents, such as TV channels, to the customer. The VoD Server and the Broadcast Server sends streaming video contents to video endpoint devices using compression technologies including, but are not limited to, Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) 2, MPEG 4, MPEG 7, MPEG 21. An IM Server is responsible for supporting IM applications involving multiple users. Instant Messaging is a form of electronic communication that involves immediate typed text correspondence between two or more users over the Internet who are online simultaneously. IM is a text-based computer conference over the Internet between two or more people who are online at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In order to illustrate how the different components in a SoIP network operate to support video services, the following scenarios are used to illustrate how voice, data, and video sessions are setup between the SoIP network and a video endpoint. In one embodiment, a customer using video endpoint device <b>232</b> at location A places a VoD session request to the SoIP network that supports video services using TV <b>236</b>. During the session initiation, a setup signaling message is sent from video endpoint device <b>232</b> to BE <b>212</b> using signaling path segment <b>250</b>. BE <b>212</b> will then send a setup signaling message, such as a SIP-INVITE message if SIP is used, to SC <b>241</b> using signaling path segment <b>251</b>. SC <b>241</b> processes the session requests and forwards the request to the appropriate server for further processing. In this case, the request is a VoD session; therefore, the request will be forwarded to VoD Server <b>242</b> using signaling path segment <b>252</b>. SC <b>241</b> may interact with AS <b>214</b> using signaling path segment <b>259</b> to verify customer's subscription information or to retrieve video specific applications or data in order to complete the session request. Once the VoD session is verified, VoD Server <b>242</b> sends the requested VoD streaming contents to BE <b>212</b> using data path segment <b>262</b>. BE <b>212</b> then forwards the requested VoD streaming contents to video endpoint <b>232</b> using data path segment <b>260</b>. Similarly, a customer at location Z using TV <b>237</b> connected to video endpoint <b>233</b> can request a VoD session via SC <b>241</b> with streaming VoD contents sent by VoD Server <b>242</b>. Note that a VoD server may be placed closer to end users in a packet access network to serve video endpoints in an alternative embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment, a customer using video endpoint device <b>232</b> at location A places a broadcast video session request to the SoIP network that supports video services using TV <b>236</b>.

SC <b>241</b> processes the session requests and forwards the request to the appropriate server for further processing. In this case, the request is a broadcast video session for a particular premium TV channel; therefore, the request will be forwarded to Broadcast Server <b>243</b> using signaling path segment <b>253</b>. SC <b>241</b> may interact with AS <b>214</b> using signaling path segment <b>259</b> to verify customer's subscription information or to retrieve video specific applications or data in order to complete the session request. Once the broadcast session is verified, Broadcast Server <b>243</b> sends the requested broadcast video streaming contents to BE <b>212</b> using data path segment <b>263</b>. BE <b>212</b> then forwards the requested broadcast video streaming contents to video endpoint <b>232</b> using data path segment <b>260</b>. Similarly, a customer at location Z using TV <b>237</b> connected to video endpoint <b>233</b> can request a broadcast video session via SC <b>241</b> with streaming broadcast video contents sent by Broadcast Server <b>243</b>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, a customer using video endpoint device <b>232</b> at location A places an IM session request to the video network using PC <b>238</b>. During the session initiation, a setup signaling message is sent from video endpoint device <b>232</b> to BE <b>212</b> using signaling path segment <b>250</b>. BE <b>212</b> will then send a setup signaling message, including login and password information of the user, to SC <b>241</b> using signaling path segment <b>251</b>.

In this case, the request to sign on an IM session; therefore, the request will be forwarded to IM Server <b>244</b> using signaling path segment <b>254</b>. SC <b>241</b> may interact with AS <b>214</b> using signaling path segment <b>259</b> to verify customer's subscription information or to retrieve IM specific applications or data in order to complete the session request. Once the IM session is verified, IM Server <b>244</b> establishes the requested IM data path to video endpoint <b>232</b> via BE <b>212</b> using data path comprising data path segment <b>260</b> and <b>264</b>. Similarly, a customer at location A using TV <b>236</b> connected to video endpoint <b>232</b> or a customer at location Z using PC <b>239</b> or TV <b>237</b> connected to video endpoint <b>233</b> can request an IM session via SC <b>241</b> with IM functions provided by IM Server <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment, a customer using video endpoint device <b>232</b> at location A places a VoIP session request destined to video endpoint device <b>233</b> via the SoIP network that supports video services using telephone <b>234</b>. During the session initiation, a setup signaling message is sent from video endpoint device <b>232</b> to BE <b>212</b> using signaling path segment <b>250</b>. BE <b>212</b> will then send a setup signaling message, such as a SIP-INVITE message if SIP is used, to SC <b>241</b> using signaling path segment <b>251</b>. SC <b>241</b> processes the session requests and forwards the request to the appropriate server for further processing. In this case, the request is a VoIP session for a call destined to a called party at location Z; therefore, the request will be forwarded to CCE <b>211</b> using signaling path segment <b>255</b>. CCE may interact with AS <b>214</b> using signaling path segment <b>259</b> to verify customer's subscription information or to retrieve VoIP specific applications or data in order to complete the session request. The signaling flows to establish a VoIP call between video endpoint device <b>232</b> and <b>233</b> is similar to those described previously in network <b>100</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In one embodiment, the Application Server (AS) functions as a SIP back-to-back user agent. Since BE <b>213</b> needs to be involved in completing the call; CCE <b>211</b> sends another call setup message, such as a SIP-INVITE message if SIP is used, to BE <b>213</b> using signaling path segment <b>257</b>.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As extremely high bandwidth access networks become more accessible to residential subscribers, they enable service providers of these networks to integrate voice, video, and data, thereby providing more convenience for end customers and creating new service opportunities. Due to the multi-service nature of these new services, networks can provide additional functionalities to end customers to support multiple simultaneous application sessions to a single subscriber. For instance, a subscriber watching a streaming video session, such as a football match, may want to obtain more information related to the video contents being shown, e.g., recent performance of one of the sport teams playing in the match. There needs to be a way for the subscriber to easily and conveniently obtain desired information related to the contents being shown.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To address this need, the present invention enables a network provider to embed hyperlinks within streaming video contents that will enable users to click on an embedded hyperlinked image to obtain more information related to the streaming video contents. For example, someone watching a tennis match can click on the hyperlinked image of one of the players and receive a frame of data about his or her recent performance, or someone watching the world news can click on a hyperlinked image of a segment of a world map and receive a frame of data about current events occurring in a particular region. A hyperlink is an icon, a graphic image, or a text string, e.g., within a web page that, when activated, automatically links a user to another web page addressed by a Universal Resource Locator (URL) associated with said icon, graphic image, or text string. For example, a hyperlink can be detected on a webpage when a pointer icon is placed near the hyperlink, where the pointer icon suddenly changes to an icon having a &#x201c;hand with a pointing finger&#x201d;. A URL is the standard way to express the location of a resource on the Internet and provides a unique address which identifies a resource on the Internet for routing purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example <b>300</b> of providing information about hyperlinked images embedded in a video session in a packet network, e.g., a SoIP network, of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, subscriber <b>371</b> is watching broadcast television contents on TV <b>339</b>. The streaming broadcast TV contents are sent by Broadcast Server <b>343</b> to TV <b>339</b> via video endpoint device <b>332</b> using flow <b>360</b>. The broadcast TV contents are being displayed in an independent display frame on TV <b>339</b>. During a tennis match, two embedded hyperlinked images (e.g., icons or pictures that represent two players) corresponding to the two tennis players playing are displayed in the display frame (e.g., in the upper or lower corner of the display frame) in which the tennis match is being shown. In other words, one or more icons that correspond to one or more objects (broadly defined to cover humans, animals, and inanimate objects) that are currently displayed on a video session can be displayed at the periphery of the display frame. Subscriber <b>371</b> decides to use a pointer device, such as a computer mouse, to select and click on an icon corresponding to one of the displayed tennis players to obtain more information related to that tennis player. It should be noted that it is the icon that is being clicked on and not the actual tennis player's images that are being displayed. Alternatively, subscriber <b>371</b> can also use a remote control or a keyboard to activate the embedded hyperlinked image. Once the selection is made, video endpoint device <b>332</b> sends the associated information request to SC <b>341</b> using flow <b>350</b>. SC <b>341</b>, in turn, forwards the request to Image Information Application Server <b>342</b> using flow <b>351</b> to fulfill the request from subscriber <b>371</b>. Once the requested information on one of the tennis player has been retrieved, Image Information Application Server <b>342</b> creates a new data session and sends the retrieved tennis player data requested to TV <b>339</b> via endpoint device <b>332</b> using flow <b>361</b>. The requested tennis player information such as, but not limited to, recent performance data, is then displayed in another independent display frame on TV <b>339</b> being viewed by subscriber <b>371</b>. Note that different hyperlinked icons or images that link to different data sets can be embedded during a program to allow subscriber <b>371</b> to retrieve additional information relevant to that particular segment of the program.</p>
