<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The given invention relates to getter materials for sorbing residual gases, and in particular, to barium containing granules for sorbing residual gases in vacuum devices and for purification of gases from active gas impurities.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The use of getter materials for removing residual gas molecules from a vacuum and for purification of gases from active gas impurities is well known. These materials can, for example, absorb or react with the residual gases and gas impurities when they are placed inside a vacuum device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are applications of getter materials, where they have to show maximum high sorption capacity at room or close to room temperature. Such can, for example, be the case of sealed-off chambers in micro- or optoelectronics, portable analytical devices, e.g., gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detectors, gas purifiers used in the production of high purity gases, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is known that transitional metals, which are the basis of commonly used getters, can capture most active gases at room temperature only by adsorption. Accordingly, their effectiveness or, in other words, their relative sorption capacity C<sub>r</sub>, (which is proportional to the value r<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, where r is a typical size of a getter body, e.g., the radius of a continuous particle, the thickness of continuous film, etc.) is extremely small, which creates significant difficulties, when such getter materials are used.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, many different alloys of barium and/or lithium with stable in the air metals, belong to substances, which can sorb oxygen, nitrogen and other gases with the sufficient for practical needs rate without heating. In contrast to transition metals, such barium and/or lithium alloys can react with gases to completion, (i.e., C<sub>r</sub>&#x2dc;1), thereby forming a layer of products on the surface of the getter material. Such a layer can further grow in accordance with the diffusional kinetics. However, the employment scale of barium and lithium in getter technologies is hitherto very limited.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,312,606 and 5,312,607 to Boffito and Schiabel describe the processes for the sorption of residual gas in a vessel by means of a non-activated, non-evaporated barium getter. These processes comprise the steps of reducing alloys of barium as well as barium and lithium to a particle size of less than 5 mm, under vacuum or an inert gas atmosphere and then placing the particulate alloy in the vessel. Upon exposing the particulate alloy to the residual gas in the vessel at room temperature the gas is sorbed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It should be understood that the material described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,312,606 and 5,312,607 has a continuous cast structure and widespread in the particle size distribution. Accordingly, such a material is not able to provide reproducibility and stability of the sorption process over time.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2006/0225817 to Chuntonov describes a method for obtaining of skeleton-type granules of an alloy A<sub>n</sub>Me<sub>m </sub>with high concentration of alkaline-earth metal A by evaporation of its excess from cast shot under vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">International Patent Appl. WO2009/053969 to Chuntonov describes a lithium based getter material with high surface area. The material is manufactured in the form of granules of 0.2 mm to 2.5 mm in diameter with the structure of a dendritic carcass. This material has a relatively high sorption capacity and resistance to chemical shocks.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It should be noted that although the getter materials described in US2006/0225817 and WO2009/053969 provide a relatively constant sorption rate over almost the entire operating time of the material, the technology of dispersion of chemically active melts containing a volatile component is quite complex and requires special skills and knowledge from an operator.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Despite the known techniques in the area of getter materials operating at ambient temperatures, there is a need in the art for, and it would be useful to have a novel getter material with enhanced sorption capacity produced by a relatively easy and reliable method.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The Applicants found that a number of barium (Ba) based intermetallic compounds of the composition BaMe<sub>2 </sub>and BaMe (or some other compounds which are close to Ba intermetallic compounds in the stoichiometry), which crystallize into the structures of Laves phases type or into structures similar to the structures of AlB<sub>2</sub>, CrB type, behave similarly to lithium (Li) solid solutions in sorbing gases. In particular, both (Ba based getter materials and Li based getter materials) have a moderate reactivity, when compared to pure Ba and Li. When these getter materials react with gases, they form on their surface a layer of products reducing the sorption kinetics and protecting the material from fast chemical destruction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, the Applicants found that all these getter materials can react with gases until the entire active component is consumed. However, a mechanism for the reactions (in which the entire active component is consumed) for the Ba based getter materials is different from the mechanism of reaction for Li based getter materials. In particular, the materials based on barium alloys react in this manner due to the peculiarities of their crystal structure, whereas the materials based on lithium alloys react due to the high mobility of lithium atoms in the lattice of the metal-dissolvent.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fact that BaMe<sub>2 </sub>and BaMe alloys possess moderate reactivity is important for the purpose of the present application, as it provides these alloys with considerable advantages over pure barium for practical usage. However, for the process in which the entire active component is consumed to develop, two conditions have to be fulfilled. One of them requires that the intermetallic compounds BaMe<sub>2 </sub>or BaMe should belong to the structural type of Laves phases or the structural type of AlB<sub>2</sub>, CrB. The second requirement defines dimensional restriction. Thus, in accordance with this requirement, to make the sorption process occur over reasonable and desirable time periods, the dispersity of the getter material should satisfy the ratio of 10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>&#x3bc;m&#x2266;r&#x2266;10<sup>2 </sup>&#x3bc;m, where r is the characteristic size of the getter body (i.e., r can, for example, be the film thickness on a substrate, the radius of the isolated particle of a getter material, and/or a dimension of voids in a getter body, etc.)</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present application partially eliminates disadvantages of conventional getter materials and provides novel gas permeable getter materials based on intermetallic compounds BaMe<sub>2 </sub>and/or BaMe having the microstructure meeting the aforementioned dispersity requirement. Examples of metals (Me), which form intermetallic compounds with Ba (with the structure favorable for the sorption applications) include, but are not limited to, Ag, Al, Ga, In, Mg, Pb, Si. Taking into account the price of metal, its toxicity, as well as the character of the phase equilibriums in the corresponding systems Ba-Me, the following alloys for the production of the initial alloys were selected:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0017">(Al<sub>1-x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>)<sub>1-y</sub>Na<sub>y</sub>, where 0.37&#x2266;x&#x2266;0.40, 0.05&#x2266;y&#x2266;0.15; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0018">(Ba<sub>x</sub>Mg<sub>1-x</sub>)<sub>1-y</sub>Na<sub>y</sub>, where 0.27&#x2266;x&#x2266;0.33, 0.05&#x2266;y&#x2266;0.15.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">The preparation of the getter materials of the present application uses vertical directional solidification of the melt of a ternary mixture containing barium, metal and sodium in a crucible for obtaining a textured ingot. The growth texture of the ingot is characterized by a solid getter body having a primary crystal intermetallic phase, and an eutectic filling with a volatile metallic phase of the spaces between the crystals of the primary phase. One of these phase constituents of the mentioned eutectics is sodium.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">The directional solidification can, for example, be carried out in a two-zone vertical apparatus of Stockbarger's type in a dedicated growth device. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the growth device comprises a crucible tube having a metallic or graphitic thin wall, and a mould including a pile of disks tightly adjacent to one another. Each disk of the mould comprises one or more through holes having a predetermined shape and arranged coaxially of the through holes of the adjacent disks. The disks are fixed in the crucible tube in the position when all the through holes are coaxially aligned, and thereby they form a serially ordered set of vertical channels, which are filled with the alloy melt.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">Further, the preparation method includes the step of granulating the ingot in a glove box in argon atmosphere for obtaining granules having open-ended voids extending therethrough. The granules can have cylindrical, semispherical and/or cone shape with pronounced growth texture, which appears at multiphase solidification under conditions of directional heat removal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the granules have a getter body made of intermetallic compounds of barium (BaMe<sub>2 </sub>and/or BaMe) and open-ended voids within the getter body filled with sodium. As a result of the directional solidification, the open-ended voids extend along a longitudinal axis of the textured ingot.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">At the finishing stage these granules are subjected to thermovacuum treatment for evaporating the sodium therefrom. The sodium can, for example, be evaporated under pressure of about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>mbar and at temperature of less than 250&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">After the vacuum evaporation of the volatile sodium phase, these granules obtain the final structure having open-ended voids, which provides the structural dispersion of the getter material of the present application allowing gas molecules to penetrate inside the granulated getter material for sorption therein.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">The principles of the getter material and method according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and the accompanying description, wherein like reference numerals have been used throughout to designate identical elements. It being understood that these drawings which are not necessarily to scale and proportions, are given for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Examples of constructions, materials, dimensions, and manufacturing processes are provided for selected elements. Those versed in the art should appreciate that many of the examples provided have suitable alternatives which may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">According to one general aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for preparation of a getter material on the basis of intermetallic compounds of barium. The method includes the step of preparing a melt of a ternary mixture containing barium, metal and sodium and fabricating granules from this melt by directional solidification of Ba alloys in a special growth device. The growth device is designed in such a manner that granules obtained by the method of the application have substantially regular shapes and uniform dimensions. These granules are afterwards subjected to heat treatment in a vacuum to make them permeable for gases.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">The alloy used for the purpose of the present invention contains sodium as an obligatory component in the amount exceeding its maximum solubility in the products of solidification. During the directional solidification of the melt, excess sodium is pushed by the solidification front into spaces between the growing crystals of the primary intermetallic phase and solidifies there as one of the phase constituents of a binary or ternary eutectic. After the evaporation of this volatile phase, end-to-end channels are formed in the body of the granule. These channels extend parallel to the ingot axis throughout the entire volume and allow access to the inside areas of the material for the gas molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">In other words, as a result of directional solidification of the melt, a textured ingot is produced. The textured ingot comprises a getter body made of intermetallic compounds of barium, and open-ended voids within the getter body. The open-ended voids extend along a longitudinal axis of the textured ingot and are filled with sodium.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a growth device <b>10</b> for preparation of a getter material is shown, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The growth device <b>10</b> includes a mould <b>11</b> having a mould cavity <b>12</b> of a predetermined shape.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the mould (<b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) includes a vertically stacked array <b>20</b> of disks <b>21</b>. The material for the disks is chosen to be compatible with the melt. Examples of materials suitable for the discs <b>21</b> include, but are not limited to molybdenum, stainless steels, graphite, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">Each disk comprises one or more through holes <b>22</b> having a predetermined shape. Although seven through holes are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the number of the through holes in the disks can be different, depending on the diameter of the disk and on the diameter of the holes.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">Three shapes of the through holes are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> for the disks <b>21</b>; however, other shapes are also contemplated. According to an embodiment, the diameter of the through holes changes along the hole's length. Specifically, the through hole <b>22</b><i>a </i>has a tapered shape, the through hole <b>22</b><i>b </i>has a cylindrical shape with a tapered neck, whereas the through hole <b>22</b><i>c </i>has a semispherical shape with a cylindrical neck.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">The holes <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>are arranged in the vertically stacked array <b>20</b> coaxially with one another. In particular, each through hole is coaxial with the corresponding through hole of the adjacent disks. All the holes <b>22</b>, <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>together define the mould cavity (<b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the mould (<b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">According to an embodiment of the invention, the vertically stacked array <b>20</b> is arranged in a crucible tube (<b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The crucible tube has a relatively thin wall and can, for example, be made from graphite, stainless steel, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">The production of granules begins by (i) providing a melt of a ternary mixture containing barium, metal and sodium in a glove box (not shown) in an argon (Ar) atmosphere, and (ii) directionally solidifying the melt in the cavity <b>12</b> of the mould <b>11</b> to produce a textured ingot. According to one embodiment, the ternary mixture is selected from (BaMe)<sub>1-y</sub>Na<sub>y</sub>, where 0.05&#x2266;y&#x2266;0.15. For example, the ternary mixture is selected from (Al<sub>1-x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>)<sub>1-y</sub>Na<sub>y</sub>, where 0.37&#x2266;x&#x2266;0.40, 0.05&#x2266;y&#x2266;0.15. According to another embodiment, the ternary mixture is selected from (BaMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>1-y</sub>Na<sub>y</sub>, where 0.05&#x2266;y&#x2266;0.15. For example, (Ba<sub>x</sub>Mg<sub>1-x</sub>)<sub>1-y</sub>Na<sub>y</sub>, where 0.27&#x2266;x&#x2266;0.33, 0.05&#x2266;y&#x2266;0.15.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an alloy of a ternary mixture containing barium, metal and sodium in the form of one or more pieces <b>31</b> is placed above the mould in the crucible tube <b>13</b>. The mould <b>11</b> comprises the vertically stacked array <b>20</b> of the disks <b>21</b> having through holes of a predetermined shape.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">Generally, many variants of vertical directional solidification are suitable for producing a textured ingot made of a ternary mixture containing barium, metal and sodium. Two particular cases are described hereinbelow, which take into consideration the peculiarities of handling chemically active and volatile materials.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">According to one embodiment of the invention, the melting of the ternary mixture, and vertical directional solidification of the melt, is carried out in vacuum. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a schematic view of an apparatus <b>40</b> for directional solidification of melts of a ternary mixture containing barium, metal and sodium in vacuum is shown, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus <b>40</b> comprises a high temperature zone T<sub>1 </sub>and a low temperature zone T<sub>2 </sub>separated from the high temperature zone T<sub>1 </sub>by a partition <b>41</b> made of a thermal insulation material. The high temperature zone T<sub>1 </sub>contains an electric furnace <b>42</b>. The low temperature zone T<sub>2 </sub>contains a pipe coil <b>43</b> with a cooling agent (e.g., flowing water), and a filler <b>44</b> made of a high thermal conductivity material filling the low temperature zone T<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a mold <b>11</b> is arranged in a metallic ampoule <b>45</b>, and an alloy of the ternary mixture is placed above the mould cavity. Thereafter, the metallic ampoule <b>45</b> is sealed in a vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">According to another embodiment, the crucible tube (<b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is sealed in a metallic ampoule <b>45</b> in a vacuum. The sealing can, for example, be carried out in accordance with the technique described by K. A. Chuntonov et al., J. Less-Common Metals, 1982, V. 83, P. 143-153.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">After sealing, the metallic ampoule <b>45</b> is placed vertically in the tubular furnace <b>42</b> of the high temperature zone T<sub>1</sub>, where the ampoule is maintained at a first temperature having a value exceeding the liquidus point of the melt. The first temperature can, for example, be higher than the liquidus point of the melt by 40-60 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">The ampoule <b>45</b> is maintained at the first temperature as long as required for obtaining the alloy of the ternary mixture in a liquid state. A neutral atmosphere in the furnace is desirable and it can be provided by feeding Ar into a channel <b>46</b> of the furnace through a valve <b>47</b>. As a result of the heating, the alloy melts, and thereby flows by gravity into the mould cavity to fills up the through holes (<b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the disks (<b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">Thereafter, the ampoule <b>45</b> is moved down into the low temperature zone T<sub>2 </sub>to directionally solidify the melt. Solidification of the alloy starts after the bottom end of the ampoule <b>45</b> passes through an orifice <b>48</b> in the partition <b>41</b>. The ampoule <b>45</b> with the melt is subjected to a second temperature gradually along its length at a predetermined rate as long as required for obtaining the textured ingot. The second temperature can, for example, be less than the solidus point of the melt by 10-20 degrees Celsius. The textured ingot has a getter body of an intermetallic phase and the open-ended voids are filled with sodium.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">According to another embodiment of the invention, the vertical directional solidification is carried out in an argon atmosphere. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a schematic view of an apparatus <b>50</b> for directional solidification of melts of a ternary mixture containing barium, metal and sodium in an argon atmosphere is shown, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus <b>50</b> differs mainly from the apparatus <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in the fact that it includes a heatproof crucible <b>51</b> in which melting and directional solidifying of the melt of the ternary mixture are carried out in an argon atmosphere. For this purpose, the heatproof crucible <b>51</b> can be coupled to an argon source (not shown) and to a vacuum system (not shown) through a 4-way cross <b>52</b>. In operation, the crucible tube <b>13</b> with the alloy pieces <b>41</b> is placed into the heatproof crucible <b>51</b> in argon atmosphere in a glove box (not shown). The heatproof crucible <b>51</b> is taken out from glove box with Ar inside the heatproof crucible <b>51</b>. Then, the crucible <b>51</b> is connected to the vacuum system through the 4-way cross <b>52</b> for pumping Ar down. Further, the crucible <b>51</b> is placed in the furnace <b>42</b> for outgassing of the entire growth system at a temperature of about 200&#xb0; C. Further, the heatproof crucible <b>51</b> is filled with Ar and the first temperature is set to the value mentioned above. The crucible-tube is maintained in the argon atmosphere at the first temperature as long as required for re-melting the alloy (i.e., obtaining the alloy of the ternary mixture in a liquid state), thereby allowing the melt to flow by gravity into the mould cavity. The complete melting of the alloy and flowing into the holes (<b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the disks (<b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can, for example, be monitored through a window <b>53</b> arranged at the top opening of the 4-way cross <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">Thereafter, the crucible tube <b>13</b> is moved down into the low temperature zone T<sub>2 </sub>to directionally solidify the melt. The directional solidifying of the melt includes subjecting the crucible-tube with the melt in the argon atmosphere to a second temperature gradually along its length at a predetermined rate as long as required for obtaining the ingot having the getter body of an intermetallic phase and the open-ended voids filled with sodium.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095">It should be noted that even using very simple means, such as a turbo molecular pump, a glove box, laboratory tube furnaces, and stainless steel tubes with a diameter between 14 mm and 20 mm, it is possible to grow textured ingots of getter material with a mass in the range of about 25 grams to about 200 grams during one production cycle that can be just several hours long. The average cooling rate of the directional solidifying material in the described method can be in the range of about 10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>K/s.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a schematic illustration of a micro structure <b>60</b> of the ingot obtained by the directional solidification of the melt, as described above. The crystals of the intermetallic phase are indicated by a reference numeral <b>62</b>. The open-ended voids are indicated by a reference numeral <b>61</b>. The intermetallic phase <b>62</b> is made of intermetallic compounds of barium. The open-ended voids <b>61</b> within the intermetallic phase <b>62</b> extend along a longitudinal axis of the textured ingot and are filled with sodium, which is evaporated by heat treatment, as described herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">In the Ba based alloys of the present application, the characteristic length of the sorption process r is equal to approximately d/2 for bodies with the open-ended voids <b>61</b>, where d is the width of the continuous solid parts of the carcass <b>62</b> of intermetallic compounds of barium between the voids <b>61</b>. It should be noted that the distance between the &#x201c;primary or between the secondary dendrite arms&#x201d; in the material obtained by the solidification of the melt has an order of several micrometers, as a lower dimensional border, which is quite acceptable for the sorption requirements of the invention. In other words, the method of normal directional solidification can satisfy the demand in the art for material with a desired dispersion structure for the desired scale range, namely, it allows the production of materials with a characteristic length of the sorption process r of 1 &#x3bc;m&#x2266;r&#x2266;100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">After the solidification is completed, the heatproof crucible <b>51</b> with the crucible tube (<b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or a metallic ampoule (<b>45</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is taken into a glove box, where all further operations are performed in an argon atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">After obtaining the textured ingot, the method for preparation of a getter material includes the step of granulating the textured ingot, thereby obtaining granules having open-ended voids extending therethrough. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the granulating of the textured ingot includes separating the disks <b>21</b> from each other, and disengaging parts <b>71</b> of the textured ingot located within the through holes of the adjacent disks from the disks <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100">In operation, the vertically stacked array of disks <b>21</b> is released from the crucible tube or metallic ampoule (not shown), and then the disks are separated from each other. The separation of the disks <b>21</b>, can for example, be carried out by using a wedge <b>72</b> or any other suitable tool inserted into a crevice <b>73</b> and splitting the ingot by applying a force F. It should be understood that the parts <b>71</b> of the textured ingot which are disengaged from the through holes of the disks <b>21</b> have a shape of granules that &#x201c;positively&#x201d; repeat the shape of the through holes of the disks <b>21</b>. The granules obtained by the method have substantially regular shapes and uniform dimensions. A value of the overall diameter D can, for example, be in the range of about 3 mm to 12 mm, and be approximately equal to the length H of the granules. A radial dimension of at least a portion of the granules can change along its length for obtaining a narrow neck. A dimension d of the neck of the granule can, for example, be in the range of 1 mm&#x2266;d&#x2266;3 mm. This dimension d with respect to the maximal diameter D can, for example be in the range of 0.25D&#x2266;d&#x2266;0.35D. Such provisions can facilitate splitting of the textured material and separation of the disks <b>21</b> from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">According to an embodiment, the preparation of granules of the getter material of the present invention may include the step of providing a metal gauze and arranging the metal gauze along the walls of the through holes of the disks. For this purpose, a piece of the metal gauze can, for example, be rolled into a tube and placed within the through holes of the disks. Then, the disks assembled into an array can be placed into a crucible tube, and an alloy of the ternary mixture containing barium, metal and sodium can be arranged within the crucible tube above the mould cavity that is defined by the holes of the disks.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102">A further preparation of the granules is carried out in accordance with the scenario described above. Specifically, the crucible-tube is maintained (either in vacuum or in an argon atmosphere) at a first temperature having a value exceeding the liquidus point of the melt as long as required for obtaining the alloy in a liquid state, thereby allowing the melt to flow by gravity into the through holes of the disks covered with the metal gauze. As a result, the melt is enveloped with the metal gauze.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0103">Further, the textured ingot can be granulated, as described above, for obtaining granules <b>81</b> having the walls enveloped with metal gauze <b>82</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. It should be understood that the granules enveloped with the metal gauze can have an enhanced strength and hardness. Moreover, the gauze can facilitate the disengagement of the granules from the holes of the disks.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104">Further, the method for preparation of a getter material of the present invention includes the step of evaporating the sodium located in the open-ended voids from the granules. For this purpose, the granules can, for example, be placed into a sorption pump and thermovacuum treatment is carried out also in the pump. Alternatively, the volatile phase of sodium can be evaporated from the granules in a special evaporation chamber, which can, for example, be located in the same glove box which was used in the earlier method steps. The evaporating of the sodium can, for example, be carried out at a pressure of about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>mbar and at a temperature in the range of 200&#xb0; C.-250&#xb0; C. The evaporation procedure suitable for the purpose of the application is known per se, (see, for example, International Pat. Application WO 2009053969 to Chuntonov), therefore it is not elaborated herein in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0105">It can be summarized that final granules of the getter material represent a getter body made of intermetallic compounds of barium, and open-ended empty voids extending within the getter body. The intermetallic compounds of barium (BaMe<sub>2 </sub>and BaMe) have a moderate reactivity due to the specific character of the close neighborhood of Ba atoms in the crystal structure of these compounds. This specific character is in fact that the crystal lattice of the mentioned intermetallic compounds contains continuous chains of Ba atoms which directly contact with each other. The type of the structure is, for example, described by M. Fornasini, Acta Cryst., 1975, V. B31, P. 2551-2552. The granules are characterized by a high gas permeability, owing to a plenty of sorption micro channels passing therethrough. The characteristic length between the sorption micro channels r is in the range of 1 &#x3bc;m&#x2266;r&#x2266;100 &#x3bc;m. A mass of one granule can, for example, be in the range of 50 mg to 2.0 g each.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0106">It is important to note that contrary to most prior art, getter materials operating at high temperatures, sorption of gases by the intermetallic porous granules of the present application, can be carried out at a room temperature spontaneously and irreversibly with almost a constant rate until the major mass of the getter material is reacted. Such kinetics are desirable for most vacuum applications, and, as noted above, are associated with the plurality of micro channels passing through the granules.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0107">The advantages of the new material over conventional material can, for example, be appreciated in the following two applications.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0108">The first example is related to the case in which a long operation time of a getter device is required, whereas the second example deals with a case, in which a small weight of the getter device is most important. The dimensions and designs of the getter devices in these two cases are different. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the getter granules obtained in accordance with the method of the present application can be used with equal success in these different applications, independent of size and type of the device, such as a sorption pump, a gas purifier, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0109">Specifically, the use of the getter material of the present invention is illustrated in getter pumps, although approaches to solutions of sorption problems can also be applied, mutatis mutandis, to other devices, such as gas purifiers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0110">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a schematic view of an exemplary sorption pump <b>90</b> is shown that can utilize the getter material of the present application continuously for several years. The sorption pump <b>90</b> includes a housing <b>91</b>, an outlet pipe <b>92</b> containing a filter <b>93</b> and is equipped with a pump flange <b>94</b> equipped with a valve <b>95</b>. The housing <b>91</b> includes cage <b>96</b> arranged in the middle of the housing <b>91</b>, and granules <b>97</b> of the getter material of the present application placed between the inner wall of the housing <b>91</b> and the outer wall of the cage <b>96</b>. The cage <b>96</b> defines a free space <b>98</b> within the cage <b>96</b> and is formed of a metal mesh configured for keeping the free space <b>98</b> from getting the granules <b>97</b> into the free space <b>98</b>. The free space is required for the uniform distribution of gas molecules through the volume occupied by the granules <b>97</b>. In operation, the gas molecules flow into the free space <b>98</b> from the vacuum chamber through the filter <b>93</b>. The sorption pump <b>90</b> also includes an inlet tube <b>99</b> configured for filling the sorption pump <b>90</b> with the granules <b>97</b> of the getter material.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0111">The sorption pump <b>90</b> can, for example, be filled with the getter material through the tube <b>99</b> in a glove box in an argon atmosphere, while the outlet pipe <b>92</b> is closed. After filling the pump with the getter material, the tube <b>99</b> is connected to the vacuum line for evacuation of Ar and is then sealed. The sealing can, for example, be carried out by pinching the pipe and cutting it out from the vacuum line, as described by K. Chuntonov et al., J. Less-Common Metals, 1982, V. 83, P. 143-153. The pump is thereby ready for being connected to a vacuum chamber or for its conservation after a secondary filling with argon.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0112">It should be noted that the filter <b>93</b> can serve not only for interception of small particles, but can also function as a dryer, trapping the water vapor on its way into the granules <b>97</b>. In this case, the pump is filled with the granules before the evaporation step, so that the evaporation of the volatile phase (i.e., Na) is carried out directly in the housing <b>91</b>. Specifically, the pump is connected to a vacuum system, and during the pumping out, the housing is heated to about 250&#xb0; C., while the outlet pipe <b>92</b> of the pump with the filter <b>93</b> is cooled down to room temperature. Accordingly, Na vapor condenses on the inner surface of the channels (not shown) of the filter <b>93</b>, and then this condensate is oxidized to create Na<sub>2</sub>O, by feeding oxygen under vacuum at the partial pressure from about 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>mbar to about 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>mbar (see, for example International Pat. Application WO 2009053969 to Chuntonov).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0113">It should be noted that the pumps described above can pump down active gases (including the air) at room temperature to the amount of about 320 Vatm (i.e., 320 volumes of gas at the pressure of one atmosphere), where V is the total inner volume of the pump. After exhausting its resource, the pump can be repeatedly reloaded, since the granules of the getter material can be easily washed with a water solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0114">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a schematic view of an exemplary sorption pump <b>100</b> of a finger type is shown. The finger sorption pump <b>100</b> is aimed to work for a period of several tens to several hundreds of hours and is convenient for fast replacement under field conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0115">The finger sorption pump <b>100</b> includes a cylindrical housing <b>101</b> sealed at one end <b>102</b>, and a pump flange <b>103</b> arranged at the other end to the blank <b>104</b> of the cylindrical housing <b>101</b>. The cylindrical housing <b>101</b> includes a getter column <b>105</b> containing several granules of the getter material with a total mass of about 0.5 g to about 2.0 g. The finger sorption pump <b>100</b> further includes a porous filter <b>106</b>, arranged at the sealed end <b>102</b> and a separation member <b>107</b> configured to create a space between the inner wall of the housing <b>101</b> and the getter column <b>105</b> for passing gas molecules therethrough. According to an embodiment, the separation member <b>107</b> includes a few needles, for example, 3-5 needles can be used for creating the suitable space.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0116">The pump <b>100</b> can be assembled in an argon atmosphere. After assembling, the housing <b>101</b> is sealed in a vacuum, for example, in the same manner as a bonding machine, used for manufacturing of vacuum package MEMS. The housing filled with granules is evacuated in the presence of a small gap between the pump flange <b>103</b> and the blank <b>104</b>. Then, the blank <b>104</b> is pressed against the flange <b>103</b> to form a vacuum tight connection <b>106</b>. If the housing is made of plastic, the regions of seaming the material should be heated. On the other hand, if the housing is metallic, the hermiticity of the connection between the flange and the bottom can be achieved by various methods, including brazing, cold pressing, using chargers with an elastic gasket and even by gluing at room temperature. Ready to be used mini pumps should be stored in vacuum cabinets.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a schematic view of connecting of the getter pump <b>100</b> to a portable vacuum device <b>110</b> is illustrated. Replacement of a used finger sorption pump with a new one is carried out in the following way. A valve <b>111</b>, which is arranged between a vacuum chamber of the device <b>110</b>, and a getter container <b>112</b> is closed. A knife <b>113</b> is moved to the starting position to provide space for removing the used getter pump <b>100</b> and replacing it with a new one. A seal nut <b>115</b> is unscrewed and the used getter pump <b>100</b> is taken out. Further, the actions follow in a reverse order. A new getter pump is placed into the getter container <b>112</b>, and the seal nut <b>115</b> is tightly screwed again providing hermeticity of the getter container <b>112</b>. A part of the spherical top of sealed end of the housing <b>101</b> is cut and simultaneously bended up with the knife <b>113</b>. Finally, after a short exposure time, during which the getter material pumps a small amount of the air which entered the housing out, the valve <b>111</b> is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">As such, those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains, can appreciate that while the present invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, the concept upon which this disclosure is based may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures and processes for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0119">The described above method of production of gas permeable granules can be used with other getter alloys as well. Examples of such alloys include, but are not limited to, intermetallic compounds of Ca, Sr, solid solutions of Li, etc. Inherent to each of the mentioned alloys sorption selectivity along with their high gettering effectiveness at room temperature, provide new challenges for the technology of producing super pure gases.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0120">Thus, if the intermetallic granules of BaMe and BaMe<sub>2 </sub>represent a good tool purification of flows of noble gases from active impurities (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>), then the granules based on Li, Ca, Mg, etc. provide the possibility to purify certain active gases, e.g., H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, etc (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> shows a purification scheme of Ar by using Ba-based granules. The gas mixture reacts with atoms of Ba, forming a layer of nonvolatile compounds on the surface of Ba material at room temperature. As a result, a high purity Ar gas is collected at the outlet of a sorption column <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> schematically illustrates a purification scheme through a sorption column <b>122</b>, which is filled with porous granules of Li<sub>1-x</sub>Pd<sub>x</sub>, where 0.15&#x2266;x&#x2266;0.5. In this case, all the components of the gas mixture (except H<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>) are absorbed by Li and form a layer of chemical compounds on the surface of the granules. In turn, sorption of H<sub>2 </sub>is carried out in the two following ways: (i) partially by dissolving in the crystallic lattice of the intermetallic components of the alloy (see, for example, Sakamoto Y., Nakamura R., Ura M., J. Alloys Compd., 1995, V. 231, P. 553), and (ii) partially by dissolving in metallic &#x201c;islands&#x201d; of Pd which appear after withdrawal of atoms of Li into the layer of products. Accordingly, for a sufficiently slow flow rate, a nitrogen of very high purity can be obtained at the outlet of the sorption column <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0122">The mentioned method is also suitable for the production of granulated catalysts having a high specific surface area or for the production of hydrogen storage materials, e.g. for the production of composition of CuMg<sub>2 </sub>and Mg<sub>2</sub>Ni, etc. These compositions can, for example, be produced by using the method of quenching the droplets with the further sublimation of the excess Mg, as described in US Pat. Appl. Publication No. 2006/0225817 to K. Chuntonov. Likewise, these compositions can be produced by the method of vertical directional solidification and the further vacuum evaporation of the earlier introduced into the alloy sodium, as described in the present application.</p>
