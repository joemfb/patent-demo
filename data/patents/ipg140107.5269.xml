<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to batteries and, more particularly, to means for minimizing the flammability risks associated with metal-air cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A metal-air cell is a type of electro-chemical battery that utilizes the same energy storage principles as a more conventional cell such as a lithium ion, nickel metal hydride, nickel cadmium, or other cell type. Unlike such conventional cells, however, a metal-air cell utilizes oxygen as one of the electrodes, typically passing the oxygen through a porous metal electrode. Due to the use of oxygen as one of the reactants, such cells have some rather unique properties. For example, since the oxygen does not need to be packaged within the cell, a metal-air cell typically exhibits a much higher capacity-to-volume, or capacity-to-weight, ratio than other cell types making them an ideal candidate for weight sensitive applications or those requiring high energy densities.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The exact nature of the reaction that occurs in a metal-air battery depends upon the metal used in the anode and the composition of the electrolyte. Exemplary metals used in the construction of the anode include zinc, aluminum, magnesium, iron, lithium and vanadium. The cathode in such cells is typically fabricated from a porous structure with the necessary catalytic properties for the oxygen reaction. A suitable electrolyte, such as potassium hydroxide in the case of a zinc-air battery, provides the necessary ionic conductivity between the electrodes while a separator prevents short circuits between the battery electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Regardless of the composition and mechanical nature of the elements used in a metal-air battery, oxygen is required for the reaction to take place. Therefore during the discharge cycle, the reaction rate of the cell may be varied by controlling the flow of oxygen into the cell. During the charging cycle, the metal oxides or ions are reduced to form the metal comprising the anode and oxygen is emitted by the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While metal-air cells offer a number of advantages over a conventional rechargeable battery, most notably their extremely high energy density, such cells also have a number of drawbacks. For example, care must be taken to avoid undesired electrolyte water loss, especially in high temperature, low humidity environments. More importantly, care must be taken to insure a sufficient supply of air to the cells during discharge cycles, and means for handling the oxygen emitted from the cells during the charge cycles, both of these issues becoming increasingly important as the number of metal-air cells and/or the size of the cells increase to meet the demands of larger applications. The present invention provides a method and apparatus for meeting some of these demands.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a system and method for charging a metal-air battery pack at the maximum possible rate while maintaining an ambient oxygen concentration below a preset concentration, thereby minimizing the risks associated with generating oxygen during the charging cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In at least one embodiment of the invention, an electric vehicle battery charging system is provided that includes at least one oxygen sensor and a charging system controller that sets the battery pack charging conditions used by the charging system based on the monitored oxygen concentration level, one of the conditions being suspension of charging system operation when the oxygen concentration level exceeds a first preset level and resumption of charging system operation when the oxygen concentration level falls below a second preset level. The at least one oxygen sensor may be mounted at one or more locations including (i) proximate to the oxygen outlet of the battery pack; (ii) proximate to the oxygen inlet of the battery pack; (iii) within the vehicle's passenger compartment; (iv) mounted to the vehicle such that external vehicle environmental conditions may be monitored; and (v) within an electric vehicle charging bay and external to the vehicle, wherein the sensor is detachably coupleable to the charging system controller. The battery pack charging conditions may further include multiple charge rates, wherein the charging system controller selects the particular charge rate to be used based on the monitored oxygen concentration level. In addition to suspending operation of the charging system when the oxygen concentration level exceeds the preset level, the charging system controller may also activate a warning system, for example a visual warning system (e.g., indicator light, flashing headlights, etc.), an auditory warning system (e.g., honking horn, buzzer, etc.), an automated text messaging system, or an automated telephone calling system. The system may also include a state-of-charge (SOC) detection system, wherein the charging system controller terminates operation of the charging system when the monitored SOC reaches a target SOC. The charging system controller and charging system may be mounted within the electric vehicle, or external to the electric vehicle. The system may also include means for determining initial charging conditions (e.g., battery pack temperature, ambient temperature, SOC, etc.), means for determining charging location (e.g., user input interface, GPS, etc.), and a memory for storing at least one charging profile, wherein the charging system controller may apply one of said charging profiles, preferably based on said initial charging conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In at least one other embodiment of the invention, a method of charging a metal-air battery pack is provided, the method comprising the steps of coupling the metal-air battery pack to an external charging source; determining the oxygen concentration level within a first region; comparing the oxygen concentration level to a first preset level; initiating charging if the oxygen concentration is less than the first preset level; and suspending charging if the oxygen concentration exceeds the first preset level and then resuming charging when the oxygen concentration falls below a second preset level. The method may further comprise the steps of determining the present battery pack state-of-charge (SOC); comparing the present SOC to a target SOC; and terminating charging when the present SOC reaches or exceeds the target SOC. The method may further comprise the step of activating a warning system (e.g., auditory, visual, notification system, etc.) if the oxygen concentration level exceeds the preset level. The method may further comprise the steps of determining a second oxygen concentration level corresponding to a second region, where the first region corresponds to the battery pack oxygen outlet and the second region corresponds to an external vehicle sensing location; comparing the second oxygen concentration level to the first preset level; and suspending charging if the second oxygen concentration level exceeds the first preset level and then resuming charging when the second oxygen concentration falls below the second preset level. The method may further comprise the steps of determining a second oxygen concentration level corresponding to a second region, where the first region corresponds to the battery pack oxygen outlet and the second region corresponds to an external vehicle sensing location; comparing the second oxygen concentration level to a third preset level, where the second concentration level may be less than the first preset level; and suspending charging if the second oxygen concentration level exceeds the third preset level and then resuming charging when the second oxygen concentration falls below the second preset level. The method may further comprise the steps of monitoring a plurality of oxygen concentration levels at a plurality of locations, and averaging the plurality of oxygen concentration levels to obtain the oxygen concentration level used in the methodology of the invention. The step of initiating charging may further comprise the step of applying a charging profile, preferably where the charging profile is selected from a plurality of stored charging profiles based on a set of initial charging conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Given the high energy density and the large capacity-to-weight ratio offered by metal-air cells, they are well suited for use in electric vehicles, either as a stand-alone electrical power source or in conjunction with one or more other power sources, for example, a lithium ion battery pack. Regardless of whether a vehicle uses a metal-air battery pack alone or in combination with another battery pack, the size of the metal-air battery pack in either configuration is likely to be quite large. As a result, during battery charging a large amount of oxygen is expected to be generated. For example, assuming a 100 kWh metal-air battery pack, during charging such a pack will release approximately 19 cubic meters of oxygen. As a consequence, in a relatively small confined region such as a single car garage, the charging of such a battery pack can easily double the oxygen concentration from the normal concentration of 20.95% to over 40%, both concentrations being expressed relative to other compounds within the air. Accordingly, charging a large metal-air battery pack in a confined area can increase the oxygen concentration dramatically, thereby decreasing the lower explosive limit or lower flammable limit (LEL/LFL) of vapors within the confined region (e.g., gasoline used in a lawn mower stored in the garage), decreasing the autoignition temperature (AIT) of combustible materials contained within the same confined region (e.g., garage construction materials as well as various items/materials possibly stored within the garage), and similarly decreasing the flash point of liquids stored within the same confined region (e.g., cleaning supplies stored within the garage). As such it will be appreciated that care must be taken during charging to avoid reaching unsafe oxygen concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The system disclosed herein is used to insure that charging the metal-air battery pack does not cause the oxygen concentration in the surrounding environment to increase beyond a preset limit. The limit used herein is a maximum oxygen concentration of 25% in air. It should be appreciated, however, that the invention may be used with other maximum oxygen concentrations, as such concentration limits may be set by regional, state or federal governments or other parties tasked with setting various safety regulations.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate the basic elements of a metal-air charge control system in accordance with the invention. In vehicle <b>100</b>, the drive system uses a single electric motor <b>101</b> coupled, for example via a transmission/differential assembly <b>103</b>, to axle <b>105</b>. It will be appreciated that the invention is equally applicable to vehicles using multiple motors coupled to one or both axles. Similarly, the invention is not limited to a specific type/configuration of transmission (e.g., single speed, multi-speed) or a specific type/configuration of differential (e.g., open, locked or limited slip).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Battery pack <b>107</b>, comprised of metal-air cells, provides electrical power to motor <b>101</b>. While the invention may be used with vehicles that utilize both a metal-air battery pack and at least one other battery pack, e.g., a lithium-ion battery pack, secondary battery packs are not shown in the illustrations. Additionally it should be understood that a vehicle may utilize multiple metal-air battery packs, for example to distribute the weight throughout the vehicle. The present invention is equally applicable to such configurations. Battery pack <b>107</b> is coupled to motor <b>101</b> via a power control module <b>109</b>, module typically including a DC to AC converter. Power control module <b>109</b> insures that the power delivered to motor <b>101</b> has the desired voltage, current, waveform, etc. As such, power control module <b>109</b> may be comprised of passive power devices (e.g., transient filtering capacitors and/or inductors), active power devices (e.g., semiconductor and/or electromechanical switching devices, circuit protection devices, etc.), sensing devices (e.g., voltage, current, and/or power flow sensors, etc.), logic control devices, communication devices, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">During battery pack charging, battery pack <b>107</b> is coupled to an external power source <b>111</b> (e.g., wall socket, dedicated charging station, etc.) via charging circuit <b>113</b>. A controller <b>115</b>, coupled to charger <b>113</b>, controls operation of the charger, preferably controlling not only its status (on/off), but also its charge rate. Preferably controller <b>115</b> is built-in to charger <b>113</b>, although it can be separate. Note that charger <b>113</b> can be mounted within the vehicle as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or external to the vehicle as shown relative to vehicle <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, controller <b>115</b> may be external to the vehicle, although it is preferably internal to the vehicle as shown, thus allowing the vehicle to be charged in a variety of situations with various chargers while still retaining the benefits of the invention as described more fully below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Controller <b>115</b> is coupled to one or more oxygen sensors, controller <b>115</b> receiving data signals from the sensors that correspond to oxygen concentration levels. In at least one embodiment, controller <b>115</b> is coupled to an oxygen sensor <b>117</b> that is mounted in close proximity to battery pack <b>107</b>, and preferably mounted in close proximity to the channel or channels where the oxygen generated during the charging cycle is emitted, or mounted in close proximity to the battery pack inlet channel or channels. Note that in some configurations, the same channel or channels may be used to receive oxygen, for example from the ambient atmosphere, during discharge cycling, as well as for oxygen emission during the charging cycles. In at least one embodiment, instead of an oxygen sensor <b>117</b> which is mounted proximate to the battery pack, or in combination with sensor <b>117</b>, controller <b>115</b> is coupled to an oxygen sensor <b>118</b> that is mounted at some distance from the battery pack. The purpose of sensor <b>118</b> is to provide a value for the oxygen concentration that is more representative of the ambient environment, rather than the environment immediately surrounding the battery pack. Sensor <b>118</b> may be mounted within the passenger compartment, under the vehicle and exposed to the underside environment, or mounted to some other location (e.g., within a bumper, within the grill, near a body panel juncture to allow the sensor to be hidden, etc.). In addition to sensors <b>117</b> and <b>118</b>, or as a replacement for one or both sensors <b>117</b> and <b>118</b>, the vehicle may be coupled to an externally mounted sensor <b>119</b>, sensor <b>119</b> being mounted within the garage or other charging location (e.g., a charging bay). Preferably the electrical interconnect to couple sensor <b>119</b> to controller <b>115</b> is contained within the same plug/jack arrangement that is used to couple the vehicle to the external charging station, thus simplifying coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the basic methodology of the invention. As illustrated, once the battery pack/vehicle is coupled to an external power source (step <b>301</b>), the oxygen concentration is determined, for example using one or more sensors <b>117</b>-<b>119</b> (step <b>303</b>). If the oxygen concentration is greater than the preset value (step <b>305</b>), charging is not initiated. If the oxygen concentration is less than the preset maximum allowed oxygen value (step <b>307</b>), charging is initiated (step <b>309</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">After charging has been initiated and throughout the charging cycle, controller <b>115</b> preferably monitors the state-of charge (SOC) of the battery pack via SOC detection system <b>121</b>, and compares the monitored SOC with a target SOC (step <b>311</b>). Once the target SOC is reached (step <b>313</b>), charging is terminated (step <b>315</b>). If the target SOC has not been reached (step <b>317</b>), controller <b>115</b> continues to monitor oxygen concentration (step <b>319</b>) using one or more sensors <b>117</b>-<b>119</b>, comparing the monitored level to the preset maximum level (step <b>321</b>). Charging continues (step <b>323</b>) as long as the oxygen concentration remains below the allowed limit (step <b>325</b>). If the oxygen concentration increases beyond the allowed maximum (step <b>327</b>), charging is suspended (step <b>329</b>). Once suspended, controller <b>115</b> continues to monitor the oxygen concentration. Once the oxygen concentration falls below the preset level, charging resumes.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a minor variation of this methodology, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the charging rate, and thus the rate of oxygen generation, is controlled by controller <b>115</b>, rather than simply determining whether or not to charge the battery pack based on oxygen levels. As in the previous process, once the battery pack is coupled to the external source (step <b>401</b>), oxygen concentration is determined via one or more sensors <b>117</b>-<b>119</b> (step <b>403</b>). If the oxygen level is below the preset value (step <b>405</b>), charging is initiated (step <b>407</b>). If the oxygen level is above the preset value (step <b>409</b>), charging is not initiated and oxygen concentration continues to be monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Throughout the charging cycle, preferably controller <b>115</b> compares the SOC of the battery pack with a target SOC (step <b>411</b>). Once the target SOC is reached (step <b>413</b>), charging is terminated (step <b>415</b>). If the target SOC has not yet been reached (step <b>417</b>), oxygen concentration continues to be monitored (step <b>419</b>). The monitored oxygen concentration level is compared to an oxygen concentration range (step <b>421</b>). If the monitored oxygen concentration increases beyond the preset range (step <b>423</b>), charging is suspended (step <b>425</b>) and the system continues to monitor oxygen levels to determine when charging may be resumed. If the monitored oxygen level is below the preset range (step <b>427</b>), charging continues at a first charging rate (step <b>429</b>). For example, the first charging rate may be the maximum charge rate. If the monitored oxygen level is within the preset range (step <b>431</b>), charging continues at a second charging rate (step <b>433</b>). Typically the second charging rate is a reduced rate.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and discussed above includes only two charge rates, it will be appreciated that the system of the invention may be used with more than two rates. In this case, the charging system/controller selects the appropriate charging rate based on the monitored oxygen concentration. This aspect of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As in the previously described processes, once the battery pack is coupled to the external source (step <b>501</b>), oxygen concentration is determined via one or more sensors <b>117</b>-<b>119</b> (step <b>503</b>). If the oxygen concentration level is less than the preset maximum allowed concentration (step <b>505</b>), the process is allowed to continue. An exemplary preset maximum oxygen concentration is 25%, although it should be understood that this value is only meant to illustrate the invention and that the inventors envision the use of other maximum oxygen concentrations. If the oxygen level is above the preset value (step <b>507</b>), charging is not initiated and oxygen concentration continues to be monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably prior to initiating charging, controller <b>115</b> compares the SOC of the battery pack with a target SOC (step <b>509</b>). If the current SOC is equal to or greater than the target SOC (step <b>511</b>), charging is not initiated (step <b>513</b>). Similarly, if at any time during the charging cycle the target SOC is reached (step <b>515</b>), charging is terminated (step <b>517</b>). It will be appreciated that the SOC measuring and comparison steps may occur at other locations within the process, for example after charging initiation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If the target SOC has not yet been reached (step <b>519</b>), the monitored oxygen concentration is compared to a first target oxygen concentration level, O<sub>1</sub>(step <b>521</b>). If the monitored oxygen concentration level is between the preset maximum and level O<sub>1 </sub>(step <b>523</b>), controller <b>115</b> applies a first charging rate (step <b>525</b>). If the monitored oxygen concentration level is less than level O<sub>1 </sub>(step <b>527</b>), the monitored oxygen concentration is compared to a second target oxygen concentration level, O<sub>2 </sub>(step <b>529</b>). If the monitored oxygen concentration level is between level O<sub>1 </sub>and level O<sub>2 </sub>(step <b>531</b>), controller <b>115</b> applies a second charging rate (step <b>533</b>). Preferably the second charge rate is greater than the first charge rate. If the monitored oxygen concentration level is less than level O<sub>2 </sub>(step <b>535</b>), the monitored oxygen concentration is compared to a third target oxygen concentration level, O<sub>3 </sub>(step <b>537</b>). If the monitored oxygen concentration level is between level O<sub>2 </sub>and level O<sub>3 </sub>(step <b>539</b>), controller <b>115</b> applies a third charging rate (step <b>541</b>). Preferably the third charge rate is greater than the second charge rate. If the monitored oxygen concentration level is less than level O<sub>3 </sub>(step <b>543</b>), the monitored oxygen concentration is compared to a fourth target oxygen concentration level, O<sub>4 </sub>(step <b>545</b>). If the monitored oxygen concentration level is between level O<sub>3 </sub>and level O<sub>4 </sub>(step <b>547</b>), controller <b>115</b> applies a fourth charging rate (step <b>549</b>). Preferably the fourth charge rate is greater than the third charge rate. If the monitored oxygen concentration level is less than level O<sub>4 </sub>(step <b>551</b>), controller <b>115</b> applies a fifth charging rate (step <b>553</b>). Preferably the fifth charge rate is the maximum charge rate. For purposes of this exemplary configuration, oxygen concentrations of 25%, 24%, 23%, 22% and 21% may be used for levels O<sub>max</sub>, O<sub>1</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>4</sub>, respectively. Clearly other oxygen concentration levels are envisioned by the inventors. It will be appreciated that this methodology, and the invention, may be used with a fewer number, or a greater number, of charge rates.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Throughout the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the oxygen concentration levels continue to be monitored (step <b>503</b>), for example using one or more sensors <b>117</b>-<b>119</b>. This allows the charge rate to be varied, either to a higher charge rate or a lower charge rate, depending upon oxygen concentration. If at any time the monitored oxygen concentration level exceeds the preset maximum level, O<sub>max</sub>, charging is suspended (step <b>555</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In at least one embodiment of the invention, controller <b>115</b> learns from past charging cycles, thus allowing further optimization of the charging rate. This approach is best suited when a user repeatedly charges their vehicle at the same location (e.g., home garage), thus encountering the same, or similar, charging conditions during each charging cycle. In order to determine if the charging location is the same, the user may be required to activate a &#x2018;HOME&#x2019; button, thus allowing controller <b>115</b> to recognize that the charging location is a routine location. Alternately, controller <b>115</b> may be coupled to the vehicle's GPS system, thus allowing controller <b>115</b> to determine the charging location, and whether the current charging location is the same as a previous charging location. The advantage of this approach is that it eliminates the need for user interaction, i.e., no need to identify the charging location. Additionally, this approach allows the system to recognize multiple charging locations (e.g., work, home, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">While any of the embodiments described above may be used with a learning system, the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is based on vehicle <b>100</b>. The exemplary methodology described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is based on the embodiment described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, controller <b>115</b> is coupled to one or both of (i) a user location input interface <b>601</b> and (ii) a GPS system <b>603</b>. Preferably input interface <b>601</b> is part of the vehicle's user interface. Alternately, it may be a button or other input means located on the dash, keyfob, etc. A memory <b>605</b>, coupled to controller <b>115</b>, stores past charging profiles. Memory <b>605</b> may be comprised of EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory, RAM, a solid state disk drive, a hard disk drive, or any other memory type or combination of memory types.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably each time the vehicle is charged, or at least each time the vehicle is charged in a routine charging location (e.g., home garage), controller <b>115</b> stores the charging profile in memory <b>605</b> (step <b>701</b>). Typically the charging profile includes initial SOC, final SOC, total charge time, charge time at each charge rate, and the specifics associated with each time that charging was suspended due to the oxygen concentration exceeding the preset maximum. Then the next time that charging is attempted at the same location, controller <b>115</b> applies a modified charging profile based on the previous profile for this location (step <b>703</b>). Typically the modified profile applied in step <b>703</b> is designed to lower the charge rate immediately before the occurrence of a charging suspension as indicated by the prior charging profile, thereby allowing charging to continue without disruption.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, preferably controller <b>115</b> only applies the modified charging profile in step <b>703</b> if the initial vehicle conditions match, or match within a specified tolerance, the initial vehicle conditions from the stored profile. For example, if the initial SOC was 35%, the initial oxygen concentration was 21%, the battery temperature was 65&#xb0; C., and the ambient temperature was 20&#xb0; C., preferably controller <b>115</b> only applies a pre-defined charging profile based on the stored profile if the current conditions match, or match within a preset tolerance range (e.g., the variable in question plus/minus 3%). Accordingly, preferably one of the first steps in the process is to determine the initial conditions (step <b>705</b>), conditions such as current SOC, battery temperature, ambient temperature, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As the preferred embodiment of this system only applies a pre-defined charging profile if the current conditions closely match the initial conditions of the pre-defined profile, preferably in addition to SOC sensor <b>121</b>, controller <b>115</b> is also coupled to, and obtains data from, at least one battery temperature sensor <b>607</b> and at least one ambient temperature sensor <b>609</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should be understood that the system described above may also be used to store multiple charging profiles, not only for multiple locations, but also for the same location but with different initial conditions. As a result, preferably in step <b>703</b> controller <b>115</b> determines if any of the charging profiles stored in memory <b>605</b> may be applied during the current charging cycles, based on the initial conditions, and applies the best profile based on the closest fit of conditions. Once applied, preferably controller <b>115</b> continues to monitor oxygen concentration, comparing the monitored concentration to one or more preset levels, thus insuring that the applied profile still maintains the oxygen concentration within the preset levels. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, based on the methodology described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the monitored oxygen concentration level is compared to a range of levels (step <b>421</b>). The same approach may be used with fewer (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or greater (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) oxygen level presets.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an alternate methodology, based on the methodology described above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As described earlier, once the battery pack is coupled to the external source (step <b>801</b>), oxygen concentration is determined via one or more sensors <b>117</b>-<b>119</b> (step <b>803</b>). If the oxygen level is below the preset value (step <b>805</b>), charging is initiated (step <b>807</b>). If the oxygen level is above the preset value (step <b>809</b>), charging is not initiated and oxygen concentration continues to be monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After charging has been initiated and throughout the charging cycle, controller <b>115</b> preferably monitors the battery pack SOC, comparing the monitored SOC to a target SOC (step <b>811</b>). Once the target SOC is reached (step <b>813</b>), charging is terminated (step <b>815</b>). If the target SOC has not been reached (step <b>817</b>), controller <b>115</b> continues to monitor oxygen concentration (step <b>819</b>) using one or more sensors <b>117</b>-<b>119</b>, comparing the monitored level to the preset maximum level (step <b>821</b>). Charging continues (step <b>823</b>) as long as the oxygen concentration remains below the allowed limit (step <b>825</b>) and the SOC target has not been reached. If the oxygen concentration increases beyond the allowed maximum (step <b>827</b>), charging is suspended (step <b>829</b>). Once suspended, controller <b>115</b> continues to monitor the oxygen concentration (step <b>831</b>), comparing the monitored oxygen concentration level with a second preset oxygen concentration level (step <b>833</b>). The second preset oxygen concentration level is lower than the preset maximum allowed level applied in step <b>821</b>. For example, if the first preset value (i.e., the preset maximum oxygen concentration level) is 25%, a suitable second preset value (i.e., the preset lower oxygen concentration level) may be 23% or 24%. It will be appreciated that these values are only provided as examples, and the inventors clearly envision applying other values. As long as the monitored oxygen concentration remains higher than the second preset value (step <b>835</b>), charging remains suspended. Once the oxygen concentration falls below the second preset level (step <b>837</b>), charging resumes (step <b>839</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As previously described, controller <b>115</b> may be coupled to one or more oxygen concentration sensors, the sensors being located at various locations, thus insuring that the oxygen concentration within all areas remain within the desired safety range. It will be appreciated that the oxygen concentration during charging will typically be greatest at the battery pack oxygen outlet, and will decrease with distance from the oxygen outlet. Additionally, the oxygen concentration decreases based on the volume of air into which the oxygen outlet is coupled, and based on the level of mixing that occurs with the ambient environment. Thus oxygen concentration will exceed the acceptable level quicker in a single garage of 3,750 cubic feet then in a double garage of 7,500 cubic feet. Similarly, the oxygen concentration will exceed the acceptable level quicker in a closed garage than in an open garage.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above with respect to sensors <b>117</b>-<b>119</b>, the system may monitor the oxygen concentration with multiple sensors, thus taking into account the expected oxygen concentration variations based on proximity to the battery pack oxygen outlet and the conditions of the ambient environment. In at least one embodiment of the invention, associated with each sensor is a corresponding maximum concentration level, this maximum level used in determining whether or not to proceed with charging (e.g., step <b>321</b> of the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). This allows the acceptable concentration level to be preset for each particular sensor, thus taking into account the sensors location. Thus, for example, the acceptable oxygen concentration level at sensor <b>117</b>, monitoring the battery pack outlet, may be set at a relative concentration level of 28% while the concentration level outside of the vehicle, for example monitored by a sensor <b>118</b>, may be set at a relative concentration level of 25%. Clearly this approach may be used with more than two sensors, for example a sensor <b>117</b> mounted near the battery pack oxygen outlet, a sensor <b>118</b> mounted on an external vehicle surface, and a sensor <b>119</b> mounted within the charging bay (e.g., garage). Additionally, it will be appreciated that multiple sensors may be mounted at approximately the same relative position, thus allowing oxygen concentration values to be averaged for a particular location. Alternately, the highest monitored value may be used when multiple sensors are co-located.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an alternate embodiment utilizing multiple sensors, e.g., sensors <b>117</b>-<b>119</b>, an algorithm is used to weight the oxygen concentration level determined for each sensor. The weighted concentration value is then used in determining whether to continue or suspend charging, or in determining the charging rate to be applied. For example, the oxygen concentration level near the battery pack may be given twice the weighting as the output from a sensor <b>118</b> monitoring external vehicle concentration levels, thus insuring that even if the concentration level in the charging bay is kept to an acceptable level (for example by leaving the garage door open), the charging levels near the vehicle, which may not be subject to the same level of ambient air mixing, do not reach a dangerous level.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a modification of the previously described embodiments, controller <b>115</b> is also coupled to a user notification system such as a warning light, warning alarm, or other notification means. While it will be understood that this modification may be added to any of the previously described embodiments, an exemplary embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is based on the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but modified to include a warning system <b>901</b>. It will be appreciated that warning system <b>901</b> may be comprised of a visual warning (e.g., warning light on the dash, warning light on a keyfob, flashing headlights, etc.), an auditory warning (e.g., in-dash beeper, honking horn, etc.), automated text message, automated cell phone call, or other warning system. Although warning system <b>901</b> may be activated at any desired oxygen concentration, based on the oxygen concentration monitored by one or more of sensors <b>117</b>-<b>119</b>, preferably it is activated whenever the oxygen concentration is high enough to cause controller <b>115</b> to suspend battery pack charging. For example, in the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, based on the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, whenever the oxygen concentration is greater than the preset maximum value as determined in step <b>321</b>, charging is suspended (step <b>329</b>) and the warning system is activated (step <b>1001</b>). Controller <b>115</b> may be configured to activate the warning system for a preset time period (e.g., 1 minute), or to continue operation of the warning system until the oxygen concentration falls below the preset maximum allowed value.</p>
