<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a hands free dog walker.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Dog walking is a common activity practiced by many people every day. Leashes allow individuals to control their dog during walking. In addition, various laws and regulations may require that dogs being walked are on leashes. Alternatively, these laws or regulations may place limitations on the length of the leash or otherwise place restrictions on dog walking. Generally a chain, strap, cord, etc., is used for controlling or leading a dog or other animal while walking or running. Generally a leash or lead will have a loop on one end and a clasp on the other of a fixed chain, strap or cord. The loop is held by a person with their hand and the clasp is attached to a dog collar. When walking, jogging or running with a dog a person's movements are limited by holding the leash within their hand. The dog is also limited to being on either the person's left or right side during the walk, as allowing the dog freedom to travel around the person would result in entangling the leash around the person.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, because a person's hand is needed on the leash, the person may not be able to perform other activities such as operating a cell phone, adjusting settings on a music player, or other activities while walking the dog.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">What is needed is an apparatus and method for a hands free dog walker having the advantage of freedom of movement for the person and dog without sacrificing the person's ability to control the dog.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention provides for a hands free dog walker system. Although various embodiments are described, it is to be understood that the present invention contemplates numerous variations, options, and alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The hands free dog walker system may include a belt to be worn by a person. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one embodiment of such a belt. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the hands free dog walker <b>10</b> includes a belt <b>12</b> with a first end <b>30</b> and a second end <b>32</b>. In this system, the belt <b>12</b> is preferably formed from a plastic material. The plastic material can be of any number of colors. A bright color, a neon color, or even a glow-in-the-dark material may be used. Although plastic is preferred, other materials may be used. It is also preferred that the belt <b>12</b> is formed from a rigid or semi-rigid material. On the inside surface of the belt <b>12</b> there are a plurality of spacers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> on stands <b>20</b> which may be in the form of plastic screws or pins. Spacers <b>14</b>, <b>18</b> may fit generally against the hips of a person and spacer <b>16</b> against the back of a person. The belt <b>12</b> may be wrapped around the waist of a person and pulled tight. The ends <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> overlap and may be connected to the belt with a fastener of various types. One example of a fastener is a clip which may be removably attached through one or more of the holes <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A traveler in the form of a slotted D-ring <b>40</b> is also shown which travels freely around the belt <b>12</b>. The slot in the D-ring <b>40</b> allows it to travel past the stands <b>20</b> of the spacers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. Although the traveler is shown in the form of a slotted D-ring <b>40</b>, the present invention contemplates that other forms of travelers may be used including other types of slotted rings. The first end <b>30</b> and the second end <b>32</b> of the belt <b>12</b> may be tapered so that they do not impede travel of the D-ring <b>40</b>. A leash may be attached to the D-ring <b>40</b> so that a dog can move completely around a person wearing the belt <b>12</b> without entanglement. Note that the D-ring <b>40</b> would travel around the belt <b>12</b> on the inside of the belt <b>12</b> and not the outside of the belt <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides a top view of the hands free dog walker of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the stands <b>20</b> and spacers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and <b>18</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides a view of the D-ring <b>40</b> with a slot <b>42</b> sufficiently large enough to pass by the standoffs <b>30</b> of the spacer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the hands free dog walker <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an inset guide track <b>44</b> is shown which extends around the belt <b>12</b> to assist in guiding the traveler in the form of a slotted D-ring <b>40</b>. In addition, there are various keyhole slots <b>34</b> in the belt <b>12</b> for matingly connecting with fasteners <b>46</b> which may in the form of pins. Other examples of fasteners include clips which may be inserted into holes in the belt to secure the ends <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the belt. Instead of pins or clips, any number of fasteners may be used. For example, hook and loop type fasteners (such as VELCRO) may be used. Where VELCRO is used, it may be adhered to the belt with an adhesive or alternatively it may be secured to the belt <b>12</b> with rivets.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> further illustrate the inset guide track <b>55</b> of the belt <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> provides a cross-sectional view of the belt <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates another view of the belt <b>12</b> with keyhole slots <b>34</b> and fasteners <b>46</b>. Each of the keyhole slots <b>34</b> is an aperture having a circular portion <b>48</b> and a slot <b>50</b> extending from the circular portion towards a nearest end of the belt. Note that each of the slots <b>50</b> points outwardly towards a nearest end of the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates another view of the belt <b>12</b> with stands <b>20</b> and a spacer <b>16</b> with a pad <b>17</b>. The pad <b>17</b> may be formed of foam or other padding to increase the comfort of a user of the belt <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also illustrates different positions of a traveler <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B, <b>40</b>C as it passes by one of the stands <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the belt <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a plurality of pads <b>17</b> placed around the inside of the belt <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a leash <b>100</b> which may be a part of the hands free dog walker system. The leash <b>100</b> has a cord <b>106</b> which may be made from any material and it is preferred that the material be a durable and weather resistant material such as nylon, cotton, or leather. The leash <b>100</b> incorporates a distal rigid body <b>102</b> and a proximal rigid body <b>104</b> which encompass the cord <b>106</b>. The rigid bodies <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may be made from any durable and weather resistant material such as PVC or any similar material. The distal rigid body <b>102</b> and the proximal rigid body <b>104</b> give the person walking the dog the ability to rapidly bring the dog to them whenever the need arises, e.g., approaching another dog, crossing an intersection, etc. The person merely grabs the proximal rigid body <b>104</b> and pulls it towards them. The leash <b>100</b> also has a distal clasp <b>114</b> for attaching to the dogs collar and a proximal clasp <b>112</b> for attaching to a portion of the belt (where used). Although two rigid bodies <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are shown, the present invention contemplates that other numbers of rigid bodies may be used as may be desirable in a particular application or appropriate for a particular leash length. For example, three rigid bodies each being two feet in length may be used to form a six foot leash. Alternatively, two rigid bodies each being three feet in length may be used to form a six foot leash. It should also be understood that the rigid bodies do not necessarily need to be of the same length. It should further be understood that the leash <b>100</b> may be used with or without one of the embodiments of the belt system described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Another embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the belt <b>200</b> has a top and lower rail <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> respectively. The top rail <b>202</b> and lower rail <b>204</b> can made of any material such as plastic or metal which is flat. The rails <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> are preferably durable, weather resistant and are resilient. The top rail <b>202</b> and lower rail <b>304</b> have a length which allows for a universal fit for the majority of dog walkers (not shown). The top rail <b>202</b> may have a hook and loop fastener affixed at one end on the outside surface and on the other end the inside surface. The lower rail <b>204</b> may also have a hook and loop fastener affixed at one end on the outside surface and on the other end the inside surface. The hook and loop fastener strips provide the adjustability necessary for various sized individuals to wear the belt comfortably. The hook and loop fastener strips may be attached in various ways such as through adhesive, rivets, or otherwise. The top rail <b>202</b> and lower rail <b>204</b> are separated by a plurality of spanning brackets <b>206</b>. The spanning brackets <b>206</b> are attached via a connector such as a rivet or screw or any suitable fastening device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The spanning brackets <b>16</b> are positioned to allow a carriage free movement around belt <b>200</b>. The top rail <b>202</b> and lower rail <b>204</b> are spaced apart to assist in allowing free movement of a traveler in the form of a carriage or glider around the belt <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> illustrate one embodiment of this carriage or glider which has a body <b>222</b>. At one end of the body <b>222</b> is a ring <b>224</b> which may attach to clasp <b>226</b> of a leash. The opposite end of the body <b>222</b> has a through hole (not shown). As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the through hole allows a bolt <b>230</b> and a nut <b>234</b> to affix rollers <b>220</b>, <b>232</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A person preparing to take a dog on a walk will place the carriage or glider on the inside surfaces of the top and lower rails. The person will then adjust the belt to fit their waist size and secure this circumference by introducing the hook and loop fastener strips to each other thereby creating an endless loop. The proximal clasp of the leash is attached to the ring of the carriage/glider and the distal clasp of the leash is attached to the dog collar. The person may now walk their dog in a hands free manner.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">During the walk, the dog can travel fully around the person without entangling the dog leash. During the walk, the person can bring the dog closer to them by pulling the dog towards them by grabbing hold of the proximal rigid body and/or the distal rigid body.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16-17</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a belt system <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a traveler in the form of a carriage <b>302</b> may be used which includes sides <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> which are operatively connected together. A plurality of rollers <b>304</b> are a part of the carriage <b>302</b>. A ring <b>306</b> is shown which is securely attached to the carriage and which is suitable for accepting the clasp of a dog leash. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a belt <b>308</b> with a plurality of spacers <b>310</b> and the carriage <b>302</b>. The carriage is free to rotate fully around the belt <b>308</b> without impediment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the belt may be formed from metal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates one example of a hands free dog walking system of the present invention in use. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> a person <b>400</b> is shown with the hands free dog walking system <b>10</b> including a belt <b>12</b>. A dog <b>402</b> being walked by the person <b>400</b> is also shown. The dog <b>402</b> is wearing a collar <b>40</b>. The collar <b>40</b> is operatively connected to a leash assembly <b>100</b>. The dog <b>402</b> and its leash assembly <b>100</b> may rotate completely around the person <b>400</b> as indicated by line <b>408</b>. In addition, the person <b>400</b> may control the dog <b>402</b> using the leash assembly <b>100</b> such as by bringing the rigid body <b>102</b> closest to the dog <b>402</b> closer to the person as indicated by line <b>410</b>. Thus, the hands free dog walking system of the present invention provides multiple ways for improving control over a dog.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although various embodiments of the belt system of the hands free dog walker have been shown and described, it is to be understood that the present invention contemplates numerous other variations and alternatives. It should also be understood that the present invention contemplates combining elements from different embodiments. For example, the present invention contemplates that any number of types of travelers may be used, the component parts may be formed of any number of different types of materials, any number of different types of fasteners or connectors may be used. In addition, the belt may be modified to improve aesthetics such as by using materials of varying colors or designs. Use of bright colors, neon colors, glow-in-the-dark material, or decoration such as with stripes may also enhance safety by making the belt and thus the person wearing the belt easier to see at night.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be further understood that although examples of fasteners have been provided, the present invention contemplates numerous other types of fasteners that may be appropriate in a particular design.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should further be noted that although described in the context of dog walking, the present invention may be used for walking other types of animals, including children.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although various types of fasteners, various geometries of structures, and various types of materials are shown or described herein, the present invention is not to be limited to that which is shown or described. The invention has been shown and described above with the preferred embodiments, and it is understood that many modifications, substitutions, and additions may be made which are within the intended spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
