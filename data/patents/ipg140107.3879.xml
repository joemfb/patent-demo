<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a thermal head, a method of manufacturing the thermal head, and a printer equipped with the thermal head.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There has been conventionally known a thermal head for use in thermal printers, which performs printing on a thermal recording medium such as paper by selectively driving a plurality of heating elements based on printing data (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2009-119850).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the thermal head disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2009-119850, an upper substrate is bonded to a support substrate having a concave portion formed therein and heating resistors are provided on the upper substrate so that a cavity portion is formed in a region between the upper substrate and the support substrate so as to correspond to the heating resistors. This thermal head allows the cavity portion to function as a heat-insulating layer having low thermal conductivity so as to reduce an amount of heat transferring from the heating resistors to the support substrate, to thereby increase thermal efficiency to reduce power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A printer having the above-mentioned thermal head installed therein has a pressure mechanism for pressing thermal paper against a platen roller in a sandwiched manner. In order that heat of the surface of the thermal head be effectively transferred to the thermal paper, the thermal head is pressed against the thermal paper with an appropriate pressing force. Accordingly, the thermal head is required to have strength high enough to withstand the pressing force applied by the pressure mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, when the thermal paper is pressed against the surface of the thermal head by the platen roller, an air layer is formed between the thermal paper and the surface of the thermal head because of steps defined between the heating resistors and electrodes provided on both sides of the heating resistors. The heat generated by the heating resistors is hindered by the air layer from transferring to the thermal paper, which is inconvenient because thermal efficiency of the thermal head may decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, the heat generated by the heating resistors diffuses also in the planar direction of the upper substrate via the electrodes. In particular, when the electrodes are thickened, the electrical resistance value of the electrodes can be reduced, but the amount of heat that diffuses via the electrodes is increased. Therefore, the conventional thermal head has a problem that high heat insulating performance exerted by the cavity portion cannot be fully utilized because the heat dissipates from the heating resistors in the planar direction of the upper substrate via the electrodes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned circumstances, and it is an object thereof to provide a thermal head capable of improving thermal efficiency while ensuring strength high enough to withstand a pressing force applied by a pressure mechanism, and also provide a method of manufacturing the thermal head, and a printer equipped with the thermal head.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the present invention provides the following techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a thermal head, including: a support substrate including a concave portion formed in a front surface thereof; an upper substrate, which is bonded in a stacked state to the front surface of the support substrate and includes a convex portion formed at a position corresponding to the concave portion; a heating resistor provided on a front surface of the upper substrate at a position straddling the convex portion; and a pair of electrodes provided on both sides of the heating resistor, in which at least one of the pair of electrodes includes: a thin portion, which is connected to the heating resistor at one of a side surface and a top surface of the convex portion in a region corresponding to the concave portion; and a thick portion, which is connected to the heating resistor and is formed thicker than the thin portion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the first aspect of the present invention, the upper substrate provided with the heating resistor functions as a heat storage layer that stores heat generated from the heating resistor. Further, the support substrate including the concave portion formed in its front surface and the upper substrate are bonded to each other in the stacked state, to thereby form a cavity portion between the support substrate and the upper substrate. The cavity portion is formed in a region corresponding to the heating resistor and functions as a heat-insulating layer that blocks the heat generated from the heating resistor. Therefore, according to the first aspect of the present invention, the heat generated from the heating resistor may be prevented from transferring and dissipating to the support substrate via the upper substrate. As a result, use efficiency of the heat generated from the heating resistor, that is, thermal efficiency of the thermal head may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, in the front surface of the upper substrate on the electrode side, the convex portion is formed between the pair of electrodes provided on both sides of the heating resistor so that smaller steps may be defined between the heating resistor formed on a surface of the convex portion and the electrodes provided at both ends of the heating resistor. Accordingly, an air layer to be formed between a front surface of the heating resistor and thermal paper may be reduced in size. Therefore, according to the first aspect of the present invention, the heat generated by the heating resistor may transfer to the thermal paper efficiently, to thereby increase the thermal efficiency of the thermal head to reduce an amount of energy required for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this case, the heat generated by the heating resistor diffuses also in the planar direction of the upper substrate via the electrodes. In the thermal head according to the present invention, the thin portion of at least one of the electrodes, which is disposed above the cavity portion, has thermal conductivity lower than other regions (thick portion) of the electrode. Therefore, by providing the thin portion in the region corresponding to the cavity portion (concave portion), the heat generated from the heating resistor may be prevented from easily transferring to the outside of the region corresponding to the cavity portion. This suppresses the diffusion of the heat, which is prevented by the cavity portion from transferring toward the support substrate, in the planar direction of the upper substrate via the electrode. Therefore, the heat may be transferred to an opposite side of the support substrate to increase printing efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the thin portion of the electrode is connected to the heating resistor at the side surface or the top surface of the convex portion, and hence only the region between the pair of electrodes (thin portions), that is, only the top surface of the convex portion (and a part of the side surface) may be used as a heating portion. A portion to be brought into contact with the thermal paper is only the top surface of the convex portion. Therefore, with the use of only the top surface of the convex portion as the heating portion, a major part of the heat generated by the heating resistor may be transferred to the thermal paper, to thereby increase the thermal efficiency of the thermal head.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When a load is applied to the upper substrate during printing, the upper substrate is deformed in a region corresponding to the concave portion, and accordingly a tensile stress occurs at a rear surface of the upper substrate in the above-mentioned region. On this occasion, the convex portion formed in the upper substrate in the region corresponding to the concave portion contributes to enhanced strength of the upper substrate, unlike an upper substrate having a uniform thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the above-mentioned thermal head, the convex portion may be formed within a region corresponding to the concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With such a structure, in the region of the front surface of the upper substrate corresponding to the cavity portion (concave portion), a region in which the convex portion is not formed, that is, a region in which the thickness of the upper substrate is thin, may be provided. This reduces the diffusion of the heat in the planar direction of the upper substrate. Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the thermal head may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the above-mentioned thermal head, the convex portion may be formed so as to extend to an outside of the region corresponding to the concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The convex portion is formed so as to extend to the outside of the region corresponding to the concave portion (cavity portion), and hence the strength of the upper substrate above the cavity portion may be increased, to thereby obtain both the high printing efficiency and the strength. Further, the convex portion may be formed to be larger, and hence, at the time of patterning of the electrodes, it is possible to easily align the heating portion (region between the thin portions of the electrodes on the heating resistor) and the convex portion with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the above-mentioned thermal head, the convex portion may include: a flat distal end surface; and side surfaces formed extending and inclining from both ends of the distal end surface so that the convex portion is gradually narrower toward the distal end surface.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Because the convex portion has the flat distal end surface, a load of a platen roller may be imposed over the distal end surface of the convex portion, to thereby prevent a concentrated load from being imposed on a part of the convex portion. Further, the convex portion has the flat distal end surface, and hence it is possible to easily form the heating resistor on the distal end surface of the convex portion.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the above-mentioned thermal head, the thin portion may be formed so as to extend to an outside of the region corresponding to the concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With such a structure, the region of low thermal conductivity (thin portion) of the electrode extends to the outside of the region corresponding to the cavity portion. Accordingly, the diffusion of heat from the heating resistor in the planar direction of the upper substrate via the electrodes may be suppressed more. Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the thermal head may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the above-mentioned thermal head, both of the pair of electrodes may include the thin portion.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With such a structure, in any of the electrodes, the heat generated from the heating resistor may be prevented from easily transferring to the outside of the region corresponding to the cavity portion. Therefore, the diffusion of heat in the planar direction of the upper substrate via the electrodes may be suppressed more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a printer, including: the above-mentioned thermal head; and a pressure mechanism for feeding a thermal recording medium while pressing the thermal recording medium against a heating resistor of the thermal head.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The printer described above includes the above-mentioned thermal head, and hence, while ensuring the strength of the upper substrate, the thermal efficiency of the thermal head may be increased to reduce the amount of energy required for printing. Therefore, printing on the thermal recording medium may be performed with low power to prolong battery duration. Besides, a failure due to the breakage of the upper substrate may be prevented to enhance the device reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a thermal head, including: forming an opening portion in a front surface of a support substrate; bonding a rear surface of an upper substrate in a stacked state to the front surface of the support substrate, which has the opening portion formed therein in the forming an opening portion; thinning the upper substrate, which is bonded to the support substrate in the bonding; forming a convex portion in a front surface of the upper substrate, which is bonded to the support substrate in the bonding; forming a heating resistor on the front surface of the upper substrate in a region corresponding to the opening portion; and forming electrode layers at both ends of the heating resistor, which is formed in the forming a heating resistor, the electrode layers each including a thin portion, which is connected to the heating resistor at one of a side surface and a top surface of the convex portion in a region corresponding to the opening portion, and a thick portion, which is connected to the heating resistor and is formed thicker than the thin portion.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the method of manufacturing a thermal head described above, a thermal head may be manufactured in which the cavity portion is formed between the support substrate and the upper substrate, and the convex portion is formed between the electrode layers formed at both ends of the heating resistor. Further, at both the ends of the heating resistor, the electrode layers each including the thin portion which is connected to the heating resistor at the one of the side surface and the top surface of the convex portion in the region corresponding to the concave portion and the thick portion which is connected to the heating resistor and is formed thicker than the thin portion may be formed. Accordingly, as described above, while ensuring the strength of the upper substrate, the thermal efficiency of the thermal head may be increased to reduce the amount of energy required for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention provides the effect that the thermal efficiency can be improved while ensuring the strength high enough to withstand a pressing force applied by a pressure mechanism.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A thermal head <b>1</b> and a thermal printer <b>10</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The thermal head <b>1</b> according to this embodiment is used for, for example, in the thermal printer <b>10</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and performs printing on an object to be printed, such as thermal paper <b>12</b>, by selectively driving a plurality of heating elements based on printing data.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The thermal printer <b>10</b> includes a main body frame <b>11</b>, a platen roller <b>13</b> disposed with its central axis being horizontal, the thermal head <b>1</b> disposed opposite to an outer peripheral surface of the platen roller <b>13</b>, a heat dissipation plate (not shown) supporting the thermal head <b>1</b>, a paper feeding mechanism <b>17</b> for feeding the thermal paper <b>12</b> between the platen roller <b>13</b> and the thermal head <b>1</b>, and a pressure mechanism <b>19</b> for pressing the thermal head <b>1</b> against the thermal paper <b>12</b> with a predetermined pressing force.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Against the platen roller <b>13</b>, the thermal paper <b>12</b> is pressed via the thermal head <b>1</b> by the operation of the pressure mechanism <b>19</b>. Accordingly, a reaction force of the platen roller <b>13</b> is applied to the thermal head <b>1</b> via the thermal paper <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The heat dissipation plate is a plate-shaped member made of a metal such as aluminum, a resin, ceramics, glass, or the like, and serves for fixation and heat dissipation of the thermal head <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the thermal head <b>1</b>, a plurality of heating resistors <b>7</b> and a plurality of electrodes <b>8</b> are arrayed in a longitudinal direction of a rectangular support substrate <b>3</b>. The arrow Y represents a feeding direction of the thermal paper <b>12</b> by the paper feeding mechanism <b>17</b>. Further, in a front surface of the support substrate <b>3</b>, a rectangular concave portion <b>2</b> is formed extending in the longitudinal direction of the support substrate <b>3</b>. Herein, symbols Lr, Lm, Lc, and Le represent a width dimension of each heating portion <b>7</b>A, a width dimension of a convex portion <b>20</b>, a width dimension of a distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b>, a width dimension of the concave portion <b>2</b>, and a longitudinal dimension of a thin portion <b>18</b>, respectively, which are described later.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a cross-section taken along the arrow A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the thermal head <b>1</b> includes the support substrate <b>3</b>, an upper substrate <b>5</b> bonded to an upper end surface (front surface) of the support substrate <b>3</b>, the heating resistors <b>7</b> provided on the upper substrate <b>5</b>, the pairs of electrodes <b>8</b> provided on both sides of the heating resistors <b>7</b>, and a protective film <b>9</b> for covering the heating resistors <b>7</b> and the electrodes <b>8</b> to protect the heating resistors <b>7</b> and the electrodes <b>8</b> from abrasion and corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The support substrate <b>3</b> is, for example, an insulating substrate such as a glass substrate or a silicon substrate having a thickness approximately ranging from 300 &#x3bc;m to 1 mm. In the upper end surface (front surface) of the support substrate <b>3</b>, that is, at an interface between the support substrate <b>3</b> and the upper substrate <b>5</b>, the rectangular concave portion <b>2</b> extending in the longitudinal direction of the support substrate <b>3</b> is formed. The concave portion <b>2</b> is, for example, a groove with a depth approximately ranging from 1 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m and a width approximately ranging from 50 &#x3bc;m to 300 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The upper substrate <b>5</b> is formed of, for example, a glass material with a thickness approximately ranging from 10 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m&#xb1;5 &#x3bc;m, and functions as a heat storage layer for storing heat generated from the heating resistors <b>7</b>. The upper substrate <b>5</b> is bonded in a stacked state to the front surface of the support substrate <b>3</b> so as to hermetically seal the concave portion <b>2</b>. The concave portion <b>2</b> is covered with the upper substrate <b>5</b>, to thereby form a cavity portion <b>4</b> between the upper substrate <b>5</b> and the support substrate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The cavity portion <b>4</b> has a communication structure opposed to all the heating resistors <b>7</b>. The cavity portion <b>4</b> functions as a hollow heat-insulating layer for preventing the heat, which is generated from the heating resistors <b>7</b>, from transferring from the upper substrate <b>5</b> to the support substrate <b>3</b>. Because the cavity portion <b>4</b> functions as the hollow heat-insulating layer, an amount of heat, which transfers to the above of the heating resistors <b>7</b> and is used for printing and the like, may be increased to be more than an amount of heat, which transfers to the support substrate <b>3</b> via the upper substrate <b>5</b> located under the heating resistors <b>7</b>. As a result, thermal efficiency of the thermal head <b>1</b> may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The heating resistors <b>7</b> are each provided on the upper end surface of the upper substrate <b>5</b> so as to straddle the concave portion <b>2</b> in its width direction, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality of the heating resistors <b>7</b> are arrayed at predetermined intervals in a longitudinal direction of the concave portion <b>2</b>. In other words, each of the heating resistors <b>7</b> is provided opposite to the cavity portion <b>4</b> through the intermediation of the upper substrate <b>5</b> so as to be situated above the cavity portion <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The pair of electrodes <b>8</b> supply the heating resistors <b>7</b> with current to allow the heating resistors <b>7</b> to generate heat. The electrodes <b>8</b> include a common electrode <b>8</b>A connected to one end of each of the heating resistors <b>7</b> in a direction orthogonal to the array direction of the heating resistors <b>7</b>, and individual electrodes <b>8</b>B connected to another end of each of the heating resistors <b>7</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the common electrode <b>8</b>A is integrally connected to all the heating resistors <b>7</b>, and the respective individual electrodes <b>8</b>B are connected to each of the heating resistors <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When voltage is selectively applied to the individual electrodes <b>8</b>B, current flows through the heating resistors <b>7</b> which are connected to the selected individual electrodes <b>8</b>B and the common electrode <b>8</b>A opposed thereto, to thereby allow the heating resistors <b>7</b> to generate heat. In this state, the pressure mechanism <b>19</b> operates to press the thermal paper <b>12</b> against a surface portion (printing portion) of the protective film <b>9</b> covering the heating portions of the heating resistors <b>7</b>, and then color is developed on the thermal paper <b>12</b> to be printed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Note that, of each of the heating resistors <b>7</b>, an actually heating portion (heating portion <b>7</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is a portion of each of the heating resistors <b>7</b> that the electrode <b>8</b>A or <b>8</b>B does not overlap, that is, a region of each of the heating resistors <b>7</b> between the connecting surface of the common electrode <b>8</b>A and the connecting surface of each of the individual electrodes <b>8</b>B, which is situated substantially directly above the cavity portion <b>4</b>. Specifically, the heating portion <b>7</b>A is, as described later, a region on a distal end surface (top surface) of the convex portion <b>20</b> between the thin portion <b>18</b> of the common electrode <b>8</b>A and the thin portion <b>18</b> of the individual electrode <b>8</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, it is desired that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pair of electrodes <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B be disposed so that the length (heater length) Lr of the heating portion <b>7</b>A extending in the longitudinal direction of the heating resistor <b>7</b> may be smaller than a distance (inter-dot distance or dot pitch) Wd between the center positions of adjacent heating resistors <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the electrodes <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B includes the thin portion <b>18</b> at a connection portion disposed on the surface of the heating resistor <b>7</b>. The thin portion <b>18</b> is thinner than other regions (thick portion <b>16</b> to be described later). In other words, each of the electrodes <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B is formed so as to be thick at the portion disposed on the upper substrate <b>5</b> and a part of the connection portion disposed on the heating resistor <b>7</b> and so as to be thin at the remaining part of the connection portion disposed on the heating resistor <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The thick portion <b>16</b> has a thickness te<b>1</b> of 1 &#x3bc;m to 3 &#x3bc;m, for example. It is desired to set the thickness te<b>1</b> of the thick portion <b>16</b> to fall in such a range as to secure a sufficient electrical resistance value so that the electrical resistance value of the thick portion <b>16</b> may be, for example, approximately 1/10 of the electrical resistance value of the heating resistor <b>7</b> or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The thin portion <b>18</b> is formed from the outside to the inside of the region on the heating resistor <b>7</b> corresponding to the concave portion <b>2</b>, and its end portion extends to the distal end surface (top surface) of the convex portion <b>20</b> to be described later. A thickness te<b>2</b> of the thin portion <b>18</b> is, for example, approximately 50 nm to approximately 300 nm and is designed in consideration of the thickness te<b>1</b> and the thermal conductivity of the thick portion <b>16</b> (the thermal conductivity of Al is approximately 200 W/(m&#xb7;&#xb0; C.)) and the thickness and the thermal conductivity of the upper substrate <b>5</b> (the thermal conductivity of commonly-used glass is approximately 1 W/(m&#xb7;&#xb0; C.)).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the thickness te<b>2</b> of the thin portion <b>18</b> is set smaller than the thickness te<b>1</b> of the thick portion <b>16</b>, the thermal conductivity of the electrodes <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B is reduced in part and heat insulating efficiency is increased. However, when the thickness te<b>2</b> of the thin portion <b>18</b> is set too small (for example, when the thickness te<b>2</b> of the thin portion <b>18</b> is set smaller than 10 nm), the electrical resistance values of the electrodes <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B are increased in part, with the result that a power loss at the thin portion <b>18</b> exceeds the amount of power obtained by increasing the heat insulating efficiency. In addition, the thickness te<b>2</b> of the thin portion <b>18</b> needs to be set considering such a thickness as to be obtained by sputtering as a thin film. Therefore, it is desired to set the thickness te<b>2</b> of the thin portion <b>18</b> to, for example, approximately 50 nm to approximately 300 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, when the length Le of each of the thin portions <b>18</b> extending in the longitudinal direction of the heating resistors <b>7</b> is set larger, the thermal conductivity of the electrodes <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B is reduced in part and the heat insulating efficiency is increased. However, when the length Le of the thin portion <b>18</b> is set too large, the electrical resistance values of the electrodes <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B are increased in part, with the result that a power loss at the thin portion <b>18</b> exceeds the amount of power obtained by increasing the heat insulating efficiency. Therefore, it is desired to determine the length Le of the thin portion <b>18</b> so that the electrical resistance value of each of the thin portions <b>18</b> may be 1/10 of the electrical resistance value of the heating portion <b>7</b>A or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, it is desired that the thin portion <b>18</b> be disposed within the width (nip width) in a range in which the platen roller <b>13</b> and a head portion <b>9</b>A are brought into contact with each other through the thermal paper <b>12</b>. Although the nip width is varied depending on the diameter and material of the platen roller <b>13</b>, it is considered that the nip width generally corresponds to a length L of the heating resistor <b>7</b> in the longitudinal direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For example, a width dimension (Lr+2Le) from the thin portion <b>18</b> of the electrode <b>8</b>A to the thin portion <b>18</b> of the electrode <b>8</b>B is set within approximately 2 mm (within approximately 1 mm from the center position of the heating portion <b>7</b>A). Further, the thick portion <b>16</b> provided on the heating resistor <b>7</b> is also disposed within the nip width.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Each of the electrodes <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B having the above-mentioned shapes has a two-stage structure in which a part of the thick portion <b>16</b> and the entire thin portion <b>18</b> are disposed on the heating resistor <b>7</b>. In each of the electrodes <b>8</b>A and <b>813</b>, the region disposed at a step portion between the heating resistor <b>7</b> and the upper substrate <b>5</b> is formed thick (as the thick portion <b>16</b>). In this manner, disconnection of the electrodes <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B and an abnormal increase in electrical resistance value caused by the step may be prevented to increase the heat insulating efficiency and increase the reliability of the thermal head <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the upper substrate <b>5</b> has the convex portion <b>20</b> formed in the upper surface (front surface) on which the heating resistors <b>7</b> are provided, in a region between the common electrode <b>8</b>A and the individual electrodes <b>8</b>B. The convex portion <b>20</b> has a flat distal end surface <b>21</b>, and side surfaces <b>22</b> formed extending and inclining from both ends of the distal end surface <b>21</b> so that the convex portion <b>20</b> becomes gradually narrower toward the distal end surface <b>21</b>. In other words, the convex portion <b>20</b> is formed so that the width dimension of the distal end surface <b>21</b> is smaller than the width dimension Lm of the convex portion <b>20</b>. This way, the convex portion <b>20</b> has a trapezoidal shape in longitudinal cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, the convex portion <b>20</b> is formed so that the width dimension Lm thereof is smaller than the width dimension Lc of the concave portion <b>2</b>. In other words, the convex portion <b>20</b> is formed on the upper end side (front surface) of the upper substrate <b>5</b> within a region corresponding to the concave portion <b>2</b> formed in the support substrate <b>3</b>. Note that, the convex portion <b>20</b> is formed to have a height hm approximately ranging from, for example, 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 3 &#x3bc;m, which is larger than a thickness of the electrodes <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Now, as a comparative example, a structure of a conventional thermal head <b>100</b> is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in the conventional thermal head <b>100</b>, no convex portion is provided on an upper end side (front surface) of an upper substrate <b>50</b>, and hence steps are defined between the heating resistors <b>7</b> and the electrodes <b>8</b> correspondingly to the thickness of the electrodes <b>8</b>. Accordingly, also in the front surface of the protective film <b>9</b> formed over the heating resistors <b>7</b> and the electrodes <b>8</b>, steps are defined at positions corresponding to the above-mentioned steps (in a region A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As a result, when the thermal paper <b>12</b> is pressed against a surface of the thermal head <b>100</b> by the platen roller <b>13</b>, an air layer <b>101</b> is formed between the thermal paper <b>12</b> and the surface of the thermal head <b>100</b> because of the steps between the heating resistors <b>7</b> and the electrodes <b>8</b>. The heat generated by the heating resistors <b>7</b> is hindered by the air layer <b>101</b> from transferring to the thermal paper <b>12</b>, which is disadvantageous because thermal efficiency of the thermal head <b>100</b> may be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In contrast, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the support substrate <b>3</b> including the concave portion <b>2</b> formed in its front surface and the upper substrate <b>5</b> are bonded to each other in the stacked state, to thereby form the cavity portion <b>4</b> between the support substrate <b>3</b> and the upper substrate <b>5</b>. The cavity portion <b>4</b> is formed in the region corresponding to the heating resistors <b>7</b> and functions as a heat-insulating layer that blocks the heat generated from the heating resistors <b>7</b>. Therefore, according to the thermal head <b>1</b> of this embodiment, the heat generated from the heating resistors <b>7</b> may be prevented from transferring and dissipating to the support substrate <b>3</b> via the upper substrate <b>5</b>. As a result, use efficiency of the heat generated from the heating resistors <b>7</b>, that is, thermal efficiency of the thermal head <b>1</b> may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, on the surface of the upper substrate <b>5</b> on the electrode <b>8</b> side, the convex portion <b>20</b> is formed between the pair of electrodes <b>8</b> provided on both sides of the heating resistor <b>7</b>. Accordingly, the steps between the heating resistor <b>7</b> formed on the surface of the convex portion <b>20</b> and the electrodes <b>8</b> provided on both sides of the heating resistor <b>7</b> may be reduced, to thereby reduce an air layer to be formed between the surface of the heating resistor <b>7</b> (protective film <b>9</b>) and the thermal paper. Therefore, according to the thermal head <b>1</b> of this embodiment, the heat generated by the heating resistors <b>7</b> may transfer to the thermal paper <b>12</b> efficiently, to thereby increase the thermal efficiency of the thermal head <b>1</b> to reduce the amount of energy required for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In particular, when the height of the convex portion <b>20</b> is equal to or larger than the height of the electrodes <b>8</b>, an air layer to be formed between the surface of the thermal head <b>1</b> and the thermal paper <b>12</b> may be reduced to the size corresponding to the thickness of the thin portion <b>18</b> of the electrodes <b>8</b>, to thereby further reduce the air layer to be formed between the surface of the heating resistors <b>7</b> (protective film <b>9</b>) and the thermal paper. Accordingly, the heat generated by the heating resistors <b>7</b> may transfer to the thermal paper <b>12</b> efficiently, to thereby increase the thermal efficiency of the thermal head <b>1</b> to reduce the amount of energy required for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this case, the heat generated by the heating resistors <b>7</b> diffuses also in the planar direction of the upper substrate <b>5</b> via the electrodes <b>8</b>. In the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the thin portion <b>18</b> of the electrode <b>8</b>, which is disposed above the cavity portion <b>4</b>, has thermal conductivity lower than other regions (thick portion <b>16</b>) of the electrode <b>8</b>. Therefore, by providing the thin portion <b>18</b> in the region corresponding to the cavity portion <b>4</b> (concave portion <b>2</b>), the heat generated from the heating resistors <b>7</b> may be prevented from easily transferring to the outside of the region corresponding to the cavity portion <b>4</b>. This suppresses the diffusion of the heat, which is prevented by the cavity portion <b>4</b> from transferring toward the support substrate <b>3</b>, in the planar direction of the upper substrate <b>5</b> via the electrode <b>8</b>. Therefore, the heat may be transferred to an opposite side of the support substrate <b>3</b> to increase printing efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, the thin portion <b>18</b> of the electrode <b>8</b> is connected to the heating resistor <b>7</b> at the distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b>, and hence only the region between the pair of electrodes <b>8</b> (thin portions <b>18</b>), that is, only the distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b> may be used as the heating portion <b>7</b>A. A portion to be brought into contact with the thermal paper <b>12</b> is only the distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b>. Therefore, with the use of only the distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b> as the heating portion <b>7</b>A, a major part of the heat generated by the heating portion <b>7</b>A may be transferred to the thermal paper <b>12</b>, to thereby increase the thermal efficiency of the thermal head <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, description is given below of how the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this embodiment is different in strength from the conventional thermal head <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Aimed at describing the difference in strength, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10C</figref> are simplified to illustrate only the upper substrate and the support substrate of the thermal head. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref> illustrate the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10C</figref> illustrate the conventional thermal head <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, in the conventional thermal head <b>100</b>, the upper end side (front surface) of the upper substrate <b>50</b> has a flat shape. In the conventional thermal head <b>100</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, when a concentrated load (arrow <b>51</b>) is applied onto the upper substrate <b>50</b> above the cavity portion <b>4</b>, the portion of the upper substrate <b>50</b> opposed to the cavity portion <b>4</b> is deformed and sinks downward. Accordingly, as indicated by an arrow <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, a large tensile stress occurs at a lower end surface (rear surface) of the upper substrate <b>50</b>, especially at a central position of the applied load. In this case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, a load position S substantially coincides with a maximum stress position T, with the result that the upper substrate <b>50</b> is likely to be broken.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In contrast, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this embodiment has the convex portion <b>20</b> formed on the upper end side (in the front surface) of the upper substrate <b>5</b>. Because of such a structure, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, when the concentrated load (arrow <b>51</b>) is applied to the upper substrate <b>5</b> above the cavity portion <b>4</b>, large tensile stresses (arrows <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>33</b>) occur at the lower end surface (rear surface) of the upper substrate <b>5</b> at a central position of the applied load and the base portions of the convex portion <b>20</b>, respectively. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the positions applied with the large stresses are dispersed into regions T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, and T<b>3</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As described above, unlike the upper substrate <b>50</b> with a uniform thickness as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, the upper substrate <b>5</b> of the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this embodiment is thick (as the convex portion <b>20</b>) at the position corresponding to the cavity portion <b>4</b> (concave portion <b>2</b>). Accordingly, the strength of the upper substrate <b>5</b> may be enhanced. Besides, when a concentrated load is applied to the front surface of the upper substrate <b>5</b>, tensile stresses applied to the front surface of the upper substrate <b>5</b> may be dispersed. As a result, the thermal head <b>1</b> may be provided as the reliable one being less likely to crack even if a minute foreign matter of several to tens of &#x3bc;m is trapped between the platen roller <b>13</b> and the thermal paper <b>12</b> to apply a concentrated load to the upper substrate <b>5</b>, or in other similar cases.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Here, a material used for the protective film <b>9</b> of the thermal head <b>1</b> has a significantly large internal stress. For example, a SiAlON film formed by sputtering has an internal stress of 500 to 2,000 MPa. Accordingly, directly above the cavity portion <b>4</b> (concave portion <b>2</b>), the convex portion <b>20</b> is provided in the front surface of the upper substrate <b>5</b> to increase the plate thickness of the upper substrate <b>5</b> so that the strength of the upper substrate <b>5</b> is enhanced to prevent the upper substrate <b>5</b> from being deformed or broken due to the internal stress of the protective film <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, the convex portion <b>20</b> has the distal end surface <b>21</b> that is substantially parallel to the front surface of the upper substrate <b>5</b>, and hence a load of the platen roller <b>13</b> may be imposed over the distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b>, to thereby prevent a concentrated load from being imposed on a part of the convex portion <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Therefore, according to the thermal printer <b>10</b> including the above-mentioned thermal head <b>1</b>, while ensuring the strength of the upper substrate <b>5</b>, the thermal efficiency of the thermal head <b>1</b> may be increased to reduce the amount of energy required for printing. As a result, printing on the thermal paper <b>12</b> may be performed with low power to prolong battery duration. Besides, a failure due to the breakage of the upper substrate <b>5</b> may be prevented to enhance device reliability.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Modified Example</heading>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A modified example of the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this embodiment is described below. Note that, the description common to the above-mentioned thermal head <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment is omitted below, and hence the following description is mainly directed to differences.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the thermal head <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the convex portion <b>20</b> is formed within the region corresponding to the concave portion <b>2</b> (cavity portion <b>4</b>). In contrast, in the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this modified example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the convex portion <b>20</b> is formed so as to extend to the outside of the region corresponding to the concave portion <b>2</b> (cavity portion <b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The convex portion <b>20</b> is formed so as to extend to the outside of the region corresponding to the concave portion <b>2</b> (cavity portion <b>4</b>), and hence the strength of the upper substrate <b>5</b> above the cavity portion <b>4</b> may be increased, to thereby obtain both the high printing efficiency and the strength. Further, the convex portion <b>20</b> may be formed to be larger, and hence, at the time of patterning of the electrodes <b>8</b>, it is possible to easily align the heating portion <b>7</b>A (region between the thin portions <b>18</b> of the electrodes <b>8</b> on the heating resistor <b>7</b>) and the convex portion <b>20</b> with each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Now, as a second embodiment of the present invention, a method of manufacturing the above-mentioned thermal head <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7H</figref>, the method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this embodiment includes an opening portion forming step of forming an opening portion (concave portion <b>2</b>) in the front surface of the support substrate <b>3</b>, a bonding step of bonding the rear surface of the upper substrate <b>5</b> in a stacked state to the front surface of the support substrate <b>3</b> having the concave portion <b>2</b> formed therein, a thinning step of thinning the upper substrate <b>5</b> bonded to the support substrate <b>3</b>, a convex portion forming step of forming the convex portion <b>20</b> in the front surface of the upper substrate <b>5</b> bonded to the support substrate <b>3</b>, a resistor forming step of forming the heating resistors <b>7</b> on the front surface of the upper substrate <b>5</b> in a region corresponding to the cavity portion <b>4</b>, an electrode layer forming step of forming the electrodes <b>8</b> at both ends of the heating resistors <b>7</b>, and a protective film forming step of forming the protective film <b>9</b> over the electrodes <b>8</b>. Hereinafter, the above-mentioned steps are specifically described.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the opening portion forming step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, in the upper end surface (front surface) of the support substrate <b>3</b>, the concave portion <b>2</b> is formed at a position corresponding to a region of the upper substrate <b>5</b>, in which the heating resistors <b>7</b> are to be provided. The concave portion <b>2</b> is formed in the front surface of the support substrate <b>3</b> by performing, for example, sandblasting, dry etching, wet etching, or laser machining.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the case where sandblasting is performed on the support substrate <b>3</b>, the front surface of the support substrate <b>3</b> is covered with a photoresist material, and the photoresist material is exposed to light using a photomask of a predetermined pattern so as to be cured in part other than the region for forming the concave portion <b>2</b>. After that, the front surface of the support substrate <b>3</b> is cleaned and the uncured photoresist material is removed to obtain etching masks (not shown) having etching windows formed in the region for forming the concave portion <b>2</b>. In this state, sandblasting is performed on the front surface of the support substrate <b>3</b> to form the concave portion <b>2</b> at a depth ranging from 1 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m. It is preferred that the depth of the concave portion <b>2</b> be, for example, 10 &#x3bc;m or more and half or less of the thickness of the support substrate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the case where etching such as dry etching and wet etching is performed, as in the case of sandblasting, the etching masks having the etching windows formed in the region for forming the concave portion <b>2</b> are formed on the front surface of the support substrate <b>3</b>. In this state, etching is performed on the front surface of the support substrate <b>3</b> to form the concave portion <b>2</b> at a depth ranging from 1 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As such an etching process, for example, wet etching using hydrofluoric acid-based etchant or the like is available as well as dry etching such as reactive ion etching (RIE) and plasma etching. Note that, as a reference example, in a case of a single-crystal silicon support substrate, wet etching is performed using an etchant such as a tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution, a KOH solution, or a mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Next, in the bonding step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the lower end surface (rear surface) of the upper substrate <b>5</b>, which is a glass substrate or the like having a thickness approximately ranging from 500 &#x3bc;m to 700 &#x3bc;m, for example, and the upper end surface (front surface) of the support substrate <b>3</b> having the concave portion <b>2</b> formed therein are bonded to each other by high temperature fusing or anodic bonding. At this time, the support substrate <b>3</b> and the upper substrate <b>5</b> are bonded to each other in a dry state, and the substrates thus bonded to each other are subjected to heat treatment at a temperature equal to or higher than 200&#xb0; C. and equal to or lower than softening points thereof, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">After the support substrate <b>3</b> and the upper substrate <b>5</b> are bonded to each other, the concave portion <b>2</b> formed in the support substrate <b>3</b> is covered with the upper substrate <b>5</b> to form the cavity portion <b>4</b> between the support substrate <b>3</b> and the upper substrate <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Here, it is difficult to manufacture and handle an upper substrate having a thickness of 100 &#x3bc;m or less, and such a substrate is expensive. Thus, instead of directly bonding an originally thin upper substrate <b>5</b> onto the support substrate <b>3</b>, the upper substrate <b>5</b> thick enough to be easily manufactured and handled in the bonding step is bonded onto the support substrate <b>3</b>, and then the upper substrate <b>5</b> is processed in the thinning step so as to have a desired thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, in the thinning step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, mechanical polishing is performed on the upper end surface (front surface) of the upper substrate <b>5</b> to process the upper substrate <b>5</b> to be thinned to, for example, about 1 to 100 &#x3bc;m. Note that, the thinning process may be performed by dry etching, wet etching, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, in the convex portion forming step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, dry etching, wet etching, or the like is performed to form the convex portion <b>20</b> in the upper end surface (front surface) of the upper substrate <b>5</b> in the region corresponding to the concave portion <b>2</b> formed in the support substrate <b>3</b>. Note that, the convex portion forming step may be performed simultaneously with the thinning step. In other words, in the above-mentioned thinning step, with the region for forming the convex portion <b>20</b> covered with a resist material, dry etching, wet etching, or the like may be performed to form the convex portion <b>20</b> simultaneously with the thinning of the upper substrate <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Next, the heating resistors <b>7</b>, the common electrode <b>7</b>A, the individual electrodes <b>7</b>B, and the protective film <b>9</b> are successively formed on the upper substrate <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Specifically, in the resistor forming step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, a thin film forming method such as sputtering, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), or vapor deposition is used to form a thin film of a heating resistor material on the upper substrate <b>5</b>, such as a Ta-based thin film or a silicide-based thin film. The thin film of the heating resistor material is molded by lift-off, etching, or the like to form the heating resistors <b>7</b> having a desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, the electrode layer forming step is performed. The electrode layer forming step includes a first layer forming step of forming an underlayer (hereinafter, referred to as first layer <b>16</b><i>a</i>) of the thick portion <b>16</b> of the electrode <b>8</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>, and a second layer forming step of forming a second layer <b>16</b><i>b </i>on the first layer <b>16</b><i>a </i>as illustrated in FIG. <b>7</b>G.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the first layer forming step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>, the first layers <b>16</b><i>a </i>are formed at both end portions of the heating resistor <b>7</b> on the outer side of the region corresponding to the cavity portion <b>4</b>. The first layer <b>16</b><i>a </i>is formed in a manner that a film of a wiring material such as Al, Al&#x2014;Si, Au, Ag, Cu, or Pt is deposited by sputtering, vapor deposition, or the like. Then, the film thus obtained is formed by lift-off or etching, or alternatively the wiring material is baked after screen-printing, to thereby form the first layer <b>16</b><i>a </i>having a desired shape. The thickness of the first layer <b>16</b><i>a </i>is, for example, approximately 1 &#x3bc;m to 3 &#x3bc;m in consideration of a power loss in the wiring of the electrode <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Subsequently, in the second layer forming step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7G</figref> the second layers <b>16</b><i>b </i>are formed in a range from the inside of the region at both end portions of the heating resistor <b>7</b> corresponding to the cavity portion <b>4</b> to the outside of the region at a substantially uniform thickness so that an end portion of each of the second layers <b>16</b><i>b </i>is disposed on the distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b>. The second layer <b>16</b><i>b </i>is formed in a manner that a film of the same material as that of the first layer <b>16</b><i>a </i>is deposited by sputtering, vapor deposition, or the like. Then, the film thus obtained is formed by lift-off or etching, or alternatively the wiring material is baked after screen-printing, to thereby form the second layer <b>16</b><i>b </i>having a desired pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The second layer <b>16</b><i>b </i>having a uniform thickness is formed on each of the surface of the first layer <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the surface of the heating resistor <b>7</b>, and hence the electrode <b>8</b> having a two-stage structure including the thin portion <b>18</b> formed of the second layer <b>16</b><i>h </i>and the thick portion <b>16</b>, which is thicker than the thin portion <b>18</b> by the first layer <b>16</b><i>a</i>, may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">It is desired to set the thickness of the thin portion <b>18</b> (second layer <b>16</b><i>b</i>) formed as described above to, for example, approximately 50 nm to approximately 300 nm in consideration of the thickness and the thermal conductivity of the thick portion <b>16</b> (the thermal conductivity of Al is approximately 200 W/(m&#xb7;&#xb0; C.)) and the thickness and the thermal conductivity of the upper substrate <b>5</b> (the thermal conductivity of commonly-used glass is approximately 1 W/(m&#xb7;&#xb0; C.)).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Next, in the protective film forming step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7H</figref>, a film of a protective film material such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, SiAlON, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, or diamond-like carbon is deposited on the upper substrate <b>5</b> by sputtering, ion plating, CVD, or the like to form the protective film <b>9</b>. This way, the thermal head <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to the method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> described above, the thermal head <b>1</b> may be manufactured, in which the cavity portion <b>4</b> is formed between the support substrate <b>3</b> and the upper substrate <b>5</b>, and the convex portion <b>20</b> is formed between the electrode layers formed at both ends of the heating resistors <b>7</b>. Further, at both the ends of the heating resistor, the electrode layers each including the thin portion <b>18</b> which is connected to the heating resistor <b>7</b> at the distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b> in the region corresponding to the concave portion <b>2</b> and the thick portion <b>16</b> which is connected to the heating resistor <b>7</b> and is formed thicker than the thin portion <b>18</b> may be formed. This way, as described above, while ensuring the strength of the upper substrate <b>5</b>, the thermal efficiency of the thermal head <b>1</b> may be increased to reduce the amount of energy required for printing.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Modified Example</heading>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">A modified example of the method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this embodiment is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this modified example is different from the method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> according to the above-mentioned second embodiment in a method involving forming the thin portion <b>18</b> and the thick portion <b>16</b> of the electrode <b>8</b>. Hereinafter, the description common to the method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> according to the second embodiment is omitted, and the following description is mainly directed to the difference.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> according to the above-mentioned second embodiment, the electrode <b>8</b> is formed so as to have a two-stage structure through the first layer forming step and the second layer forming step. On the other hand, in the method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this modified example, the electrode <b>8</b> is formed so as to have a two-stage structure by etching.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Specifically, in the method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> according to this modified example, the electrode layer forming step includes a thick electrode layer forming step of forming a thick electrode layer <b>26</b> at a thickness equal to or larger than that of the thick portion <b>16</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>, and an electrode layer removing step of removing a part of the thick electrode layer <b>26</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the thick electrode layer forming step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>, the thick electrode layers <b>26</b> are formed in a range from the inside of the region at both end portions of the heating resistor <b>7</b> corresponding to the cavity portion <b>4</b> to the outside of the region at a substantially uniform thickness equal to or larger than that of the thick portion <b>16</b> so that an end portion of each of the second layers <b>16</b><i>b </i>is disposed on the distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b>. The thick electrode layer <b>26</b> is formed in a manner that a film of a wiring material such as Al, Al&#x2014;Si, Au, Ag, Cu, or Pt is deposited by sputtering, vapor deposition, or the like. Then, the film thus obtained is formed by lift-off or etching, or alternatively the wiring material is baked after screen-printing, to thereby form a pattern of the electrodes <b>8</b> having a desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the electrode layer removing step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8G</figref>, the inside of a region of the thick electrode layer <b>26</b> corresponding to the cavity portion <b>4</b> and a part of the outside of the region (i.e., a region in which the thin portion <b>18</b> is to be formed) are removed by etching. With this, the electrode <b>8</b> having a two-stage structure including the thick portion <b>16</b> and the thin portion <b>18</b>, which is thinner than the thick portion <b>16</b> by the amount removed by etching, may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As described above, according to the method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> of this modified example, in addition to the same effect as in the method of manufacturing the thermal head <b>1</b> according to the above-mentioned second embodiment, an interface between the first layer <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second layer <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the electrode <b>8</b> may be eliminated to improve the strength and the electrical conductivity of the electrode <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Hereinabove, the embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, although the description has been given of the convex portion <b>20</b> having a trapezoidal shape in longitudinal cross-section, the convex portion <b>20</b> may be formed into any other shape in longitudinal cross-section, such as a rectangular shape or curved shape, as long as the heating resistors <b>7</b> may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Further, although the description has been given of the thick portion <b>18</b> of the electrode <b>8</b>, which is connected to the heating resistor <b>7</b> at the distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b>, the thick portion <b>18</b> of the electrode <b>8</b> may be connected to the heating resistor <b>7</b> at the side surface <b>22</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b>. Note that, in this case, in order to reduce the area of the heating portion <b>7</b>A at the side surface <b>22</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b>, it is desired to connect the thick portion <b>18</b> of the electrode <b>8</b> to the heating resistor <b>7</b> at the side surface <b>22</b> as closer as possible to the distal end surface <b>21</b> of the convex portion <b>20</b>.</p>
