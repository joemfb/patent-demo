<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to vibration isolators. Particularly, the present invention relates to grommet-type vibration isolators.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">All walkways, platforms, panel connection points, and the like that are subject to vibration have problems with the junctions of these structures and their supporting components/structures. The junctions are typically fastened together using bolts and the like. Vibration, however, is an insidious, external influence that over time causes the supported structure to fail structurally (i.e. to break requiring replacement) at the bolted junction and the supporting structure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Attempts have been made to alleviate premature breaking at the bolted junction by incorporating one piece isolators, grommets and the like. Unfortunately, these attempted fixes did not solve the breaking problems since these one piece isolators, grommets and the like were also breaking down due to the vibration moving between the supporting components/structures and the walkways, platforms and/or panels. In addition, the typical one piece isolators or grommets were relatively small compared to the bolt size and the hole in the walkway, platform or panel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To overcome these issues, two piece isolators or grommets were designed. Although these seemed to work by extending the time between repairs, the two piece isolators or grommets also failed over time. In addition, two piece isolators or grommets required two hands to install. Sometimes the walkways, platforms, panels, etc. are hard to access and/or they are on the sides of tanks and rail cars, which pose a hazard to workmen.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, electronic circuit boards in automotive aftermarket pumping systems also have vibration problems. Many of these boards are stacked one on top of another without the use of any vibration isolators to isolate the vibration caused by the pumping system. The pumping vibration gives rise to premature electronic circuit board failures.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, what is needed is vibration isolator that overcomes the shortcomings of previous vibration isolators.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide a vibration isolator for supported structures such as walkways, platforms, panels, electronic circuit boards, and any panel-like assembly that is subject of premature failure at their mounting junctions with their support structures caused by vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For a vibration isolator to really work, the vibration isolator needs to &#x201c;float&#x201d; the supported structure or keep it from grounding to the supporting structure such as a bracket from which the main vibration emanates. For example, the vibration in tanks emanates from the pumps used to pump the fluids in the tanks. Many times, the wind can make a supported structure vibrate, which causes vibrations to move back into the supporting structure, which also causes similar failure problems at the junctions between the supporting structure and the supported structure.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention achieves these and other objectives by providing a vibration isolator having either a one-piece or multi-piece body with an opening therethrough, a first body end and a second body end where the first body end has a perimeter that is larger than the second body end. In one embodiment, a vibration isolator for insertion into a support structure opening includes a first isolator body having a first body portion at a first body end and a first isolator wall extending from the first body portion toward a second body end. The first body portion has a larger perimeter than the second body end and defines a first fastener opening. The second body end defines a second fastener opening having a perimeter greater than the perimeter of the first fastener opening. The first body portion has a perimeter that is at least three times greater than the perimeter of the first fastener opening and at least two times greater than the perimeter of the support structure opening.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The isolator body is made of a material selected from the group consisting of a thermoplastic and a thermoset. The material has an elongation in the range of about 200% to about 800%, a tear strength in the range of about 2000 N/mm to about 20,000 N/mm, a compression property of less than 50%, and a hardness of Shore 40A to Shore 90D. When the material is a foamed material, the material preferably has a density of about 350 Kg/m<sup>3 </sup>to about 800 Kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment of the present invention, the first isolator wall has a plurality of slits that extend from the second body end a predefined distance toward the first body portion defining a plurality of isolator wall portions enabling deflection of each of the plurality of isolator wall portions laterally from the second fastener opening.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further embodiment of the present invention, there is included a second isolator wall that extends from the periphery of the first body portion toward the second body end and being shorter than the first isolator wall.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In still another embodiment of the present invention, the first isolator wall further includes a plurality of concentric wall portions wherein each of the plurality of concentric wall portions are spaced a predefined distance from adjacent concentric wall portions.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, there is included a second isolator body having a second body portion wherein the second isolator body has an identical structure to the first isolator body and a flexible interconnector connecting the first body portion to the second body portion.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Any of the embodiments of the present invention may be formed to have any cross-sectional shape to fit the opening of the support structure such as, for example, circular, square, rectangular, triangular, octagonal, and the like and still provide all the advantages of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The preferred embodiment(s) of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-13</figref>. In one embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a vibration isolator <b>10</b> includes a one-piece, first isolator body <b>20</b> having a first body portion <b>21</b> at a first body end <b>30</b> and a first isolator wall <b>44</b> that extends from the first body portion <b>21</b> toward a second body end <b>40</b>. First body portion <b>21</b> has a larger perimeter than second body end <b>40</b>. First body portion <b>21</b> defines a first fastener opening <b>22</b> therethrough and the second body end <b>40</b> defines a second fastener opening <b>45</b> that communicates with first fastener opening <b>22</b> forming a continuous passageway through first isolator body <b>20</b> for receiving a fastener such as, for example, a bolt, rivet and the like. The perimeter of second fastener opening <b>45</b> is greater than the perimeter of first fastener opening <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">First body portion <b>21</b> forms a first body end surface <b>32</b> that extends laterally from an outside surface <b>26</b> of first isolator wall <b>44</b>. Second body end <b>40</b> has with a plurality of slits <b>46</b> that extend from second body end <b>40</b> toward first body portion <b>21</b> a predefined distance forming a plurality of isolator wall portions <b>47</b>.

The plurality of slits <b>46</b> extend from second body end <b>40</b> towards first body end <b>30</b> a predefined distance and allows the isolator wall portions <b>47</b> defined by the plurality of slits <b>46</b> to fold outward and away from the longitudinal axis <b>5</b> of first fastener opening <b>22</b>. This is better illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Second body end <b>40</b> is sized to fit through an opening such as a bolt opening in a supported structure where first body end surface <b>32</b> contacts the surface of the supported structure that surrounds the bolt opening. First body end <b>30</b> contacts the surface of the supporting structure surrounding the bolt opening in the supporting structure. The plurality of isolator wall portions <b>47</b> are folded outwardly against the opposite surface of the supported structure that surrounds the bolt opening. This is accomplished by either physically folding the plurality of isolator wall portions <b>47</b> prior to insertion of the fastening hardware or are forcibly folded by the supported structure when the hardware is attached and tightened.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, a vibration isolator <b>110</b> includes a one piece, first isolator body <b>120</b> having a first body portion <b>121</b> at a first body end <b>130</b> and a first isolator wall <b>144</b> that extends from the first body portion <b>121</b> toward a second body end <b>140</b>. First body portion <b>121</b> has a larger perimeter than second body end <b>140</b>. First body portion <b>121</b> defines a first fastener opening <b>122</b> therethrough and the second body end <b>140</b> defines a second fastener opening <b>145</b> that communicates with first fastener opening <b>122</b> forming a continuous passageway through first isolator body <b>120</b> for receiving a fastener such as, for example, a bolt, rivet and the like. The perimeter of second fastener opening <b>145</b>, like the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> is greater than the perimeter of first fastener opening <b>122</b>. First body end <b>130</b> includes a second isolator wall <b>134</b> that extends from the periphery of first body portion <b>121</b> concentrically along the longitudinal axis <b>5</b> of first fastener opening <b>122</b> a predefined distance defining a first body end surface <b>132</b>. First isolator wall <b>144</b> extends concentrically along the longitudinal axis <b>5</b> of first fastener opening <b>122</b> a predefined distance from first body portion <b>121</b> in the same direction as and spaced a predefined distance from second isolator wall <b>134</b> between first fastener opening <b>122</b> and second isolator wall <b>134</b>. First isolator wall <b>144</b> spatially extends a predefined distance beyond first body end surface <b>132</b> and includes a plurality of slits <b>146</b> forming a plurality of isolator wall portions <b>147</b>. The plurality of isolator wall portions <b>147</b> appear like a plurality of &#x201c;petals&#x201d; or &#x201c;leaves&#x201d; that are laterally deflected outwardly from the longitudinal axis <b>5</b> of first fastener opening <b>122</b> when in use. The plurality of slits <b>146</b> extend from second body end <b>140</b> towards first body end <b>130</b> a predefined distance and allows the isolator wall portions <b>147</b> defined by the plurality of slits <b>146</b> to fold outward and away from the longitudinal axis <b>5</b> of first fastener opening <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Second body end <b>140</b> is sized to fit through a bolt opening in a supported structure where first body end surface <b>132</b> contacts the surface of the supported structure that surrounds the bolt opening. First fastener opening <b>122</b> is aligned with a bolt opening in a supporting structure (not shown) where first body end <b>130</b> contacts the surface of the supporting structure surrounding the bolt opening in the supporting structure. First body end has a surface <b>131</b> that is substantially perpendicular to longitudinal axis <b>5</b> and contacts the base support structure to which the supported structure is being connected. The plurality of isolator wall portions <b>147</b> of second body end <b>140</b> are folded outwardly against the opposite surface of the supported structure that surrounds the bolt opening. As disclosed for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, this is accomplished by either physically folding each of the plurality of isolator wall portions <b>147</b> prior to insertion of the fastening hardware or the plurality of isolator wall portions <b>147</b> are forcibly folded by the supported structure when the hardware is attached and tightened. Additionally, when the fastening hardware is tightened, second isolator wall <b>134</b> of first body end <b>130</b> is squeezed and flattened between the supported structure and the base supporting structure providing a larger vibration isolation area supporting the supported structure than provided by previous vibration isolators.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref>, there is illustrated another embodiment of the one-piece vibration isolator of the present invention for isolating a plurality of layered supported structures connected to a base supporting structure (not shown). A vibration isolator <b>210</b> includes a one piece, unitary, isolator body <b>220</b> having a first body portion <b>221</b> at a first body end <b>230</b> and a first isolator wall <b>244</b> that extends from first body portion <b>221</b> toward a second body end <b>240</b> a predefined distance. As with prior disclosed embodiments, first body portion <b>221</b> has a larger perimeter than second body end <b>240</b>. First body portion <b>221</b> defines a first fastener opening <b>222</b> therethrough and the second body end <b>240</b> defines a second fastener opening <b>245</b> that communicates with first fastener opening <b>222</b> forming a continuous passageway through first isolator body <b>220</b> for receiving a fastener such as, for example, a bolt, rivet and the like. The perimeter of second fastener opening <b>245</b>, like the previously disclosed embodiments, is greater than the perimeter of first fastener opening <b>222</b>. First body end <b>230</b> includes a second isolator wall <b>234</b> that extends from the periphery of first body portion <b>221</b> concentrically along the longitudinal axis <b>5</b> of first fastener opening <b>222</b> a predefined distance defining a first body end surface <b>232</b>. First isolator wall <b>244</b> extends concentrically along the longitudinal axis <b>5</b> of first fastener opening <b>222</b> a predefined distance from first body portion <b>221</b> in the same direction as and spaced from second isolator wall <b>234</b> between first fastener opening <b>222</b> and second isolator wall <b>234</b>. First isolator wall <b>244</b> extends beyond first body end surface <b>232</b> and includes a plurality of concentric wall portions <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>244</b><i>b </i>and <b>244</b><i>c</i>. Each of the plurality of concentric wall portions <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>244</b><i>b </i>and <b>244</b><i>c </i>include a plurality of slits <b>246</b> that defines a plurality of isolator wall portions <b>247</b>. This is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. First isolator wall <b>244</b> has a second fastener opening <b>245</b> that has perimeter greater than the perimeter of first fastener opening <b>222</b> and communicates with first fastener opening <b>222</b>. The plurality of slits <b>246</b> of each of the concentric wall portions <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>244</b><i>b </i>and <b>244</b><i>c </i>allows the isolator wall portions <b>247</b> of isolator wall <b>244</b> defined by the plurality of slits <b>246</b> to fold outward and away from the longitudinal axis <b>5</b> of first fastener opening <b>222</b>. Each of the plurality of concentric isolator wall portions <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>244</b><i>b </i>and <b>244</b><i>c </i>are used with first, second and third panels <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>, respectively, as clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Second body end <b>240</b> is sized to fit through a bolt opening in a supported structure where first body end surface <b>232</b> contacts the surface of the first supported structure <b>1</b> that surrounds the bolt opening. First body end <b>230</b> contacts the surface of the supporting structure (not shown) surrounding the bolt opening in the supporting structure. Isolator wall portions <b>247</b> of concentric wall portion <b>244</b><i>a </i>of second body end <b>240</b> are folded outwardly against the opposite surface of the first supported structure <b>1</b> that surrounds the bolt opening. This is accomplished by either physically folding each of the associated plurality of isolator wall portions <b>247</b> prior to insertion of the fastening hardware or the plurality of isolator wall portions <b>247</b> are forcibly folded when the hardware is attached and tightened. The bolt opening of the second supported structure <b>2</b> is then assembled to second body end <b>240</b> such that concentric wall portions <b>244</b><i>b </i>and <b>244</b><i>c </i>are inserted through the bolt opening of the second supported structure <b>2</b>. In a similar fashion as the assembly of the first supported structure <b>1</b>, the second wall portions <b>247</b> of concentric wall portion <b>244</b><i>b </i>of second body end <b>240</b> are folded outwardly against the opposite surface of second supported structure <b>2</b> that surrounds the bolt opening. If a third supported structure <b>3</b> is to be attached, the bolt opening of the third supported structure <b>3</b> is then assembled to second body end <b>240</b> such that concentric wall portion <b>244</b><i>c </i>is inserted through the bolt opening of the third supported structure <b>3</b>. Isolator wall portions <b>247</b> of concentric wall portion <b>244</b><i>c </i>are folded outwardly against the opposite surface of third supported structure <b>3</b> that surrounds the bolt opening. Additionally, when the fastening hardware is tightened, first body end surface <b>232</b> is squeezed and flattened between the first supported structure <b>1</b> and the base supporting structure (not shown) providing a larger vibration isolation area than provided by previous vibration isolators. Simultaneously, concentric wall portions <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>244</b><i>b </i>and <b>244</b><i>c </i>are likewise squeezed and flattened between first supported structure <b>1</b>, second supported structure <b>2</b>, and third supported structure <b>3</b>, which is flatted between the opposite surfaces of second and third supported structures <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, respectively, by the fastening hardware. This provides the advantage of a larger isolation footprint between each supported structure, thus, enhancing the vibration isolation characteristics of the vibration isolator <b>210</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of vibration isolator <b>210</b> mounting first supported structure <b>1</b>, second supported structure <b>2</b> and third supported structure <b>3</b> to a base supporting structure (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The slits are important to form the &#x201c;petals&#x201d; or &#x201c;leaves&#x201d; that provide the advantage of allowing the tubular material to bend instead of stretch, which occurs when the slits are not included. Without the slits, the vibration isolator of the present invention was useful on fastener openings that had smaller diameters but would begin to fail as the fastener openings became larger. In fact, the tubular shape of the folding end actually ripped. By segmenting the tubular shape with the slits, the tubular wall segments would simply bend providing additional advantages where the material maintained the proper thickness by not being stretched.</p>
