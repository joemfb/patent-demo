<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from China Patent Application No. 200910189715.5, filed on Aug. 21, 2009, in the China Intellectual Property Office.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to hoppers and reduction devices using the same, and particularly, to a hopper and a reduction device convenient for loading or unloading articles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Presently, in industrial production, a material is usually needed to be refined using thermal reduction in a reduction device. The Pidgeon method is usually adopted for refining metal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the Pidgeon method, a mixture of a finely ground mineral containing certain metal elements and a finely ground reductant is usually provided. The mixture is formed into small dense briquettes. The briquettes are disposed into a vacuum reduction pot. The vacuum reduction pot is heated to a high temperature, and a metal steam is generated by a reduction reaction of the mineral and the reductant in the small dense briquettes. Then, the metal steam is conducted to a crystallizer disposed at the opening of the reduction pot to be condensed. In known art, the reduction pot is usually cylindrical, and heat is usually transmitted to the briquettes through walls of the reduction pot, when the briquettes are loaded into the reduction pot and heated. Though the briquettes contacting the walls of the reduction pot can be heated quickly, it is relatively hard to heat the briquettes in the center of the reduction pot to the reduction temperature. The reason may be that the thermal conductivity between the briquettes is relatively low, and it is difficult for the heat to be conducted from one briquette to other adjacent briquettes. In the art, it usually takes about 8 hours to 12 hours between loading the briquettes and completing the reduction. Thus, the reduction pot has low efficiency. Furthermore, after the reduction reaction, some residue is left in the reduction pot. The present reduction pot is heavy in weight, and it is difficult to move the reduction pot, remove residue, and load the briquettes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed, therefore, is to provide a hopper and a reduction device using the same, into which it is convenient to load raw material and from which it is easy to remove residue.</p>

It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;one&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, one embodiment of a reduction device <b>10</b> includes a reduction pot <b>12</b> and a hopper <b>14</b> received in the reduction pot <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The reduction pot <b>12</b> includes a hollow cylindrical body <b>127</b>, a fireproof device <b>122</b>, a collector <b>123</b>, a cooling device <b>124</b>, and a cover plate <b>126</b>. The hollow body <b>127</b> has an opening at one end (not labeled). The fireproof device <b>122</b> is disposed in the body <b>127</b> and adjacent to the opening. The collector <b>123</b> is disposed in the body <b>127</b> and located on the fireproof device <b>122</b>. The cooling device <b>124</b> is attached to an outer wall of the reduction pot <b>12</b> and surrounds the collector <b>123</b>. The cover plate <b>126</b> covers the opening of the body <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The hollow body <b>127</b> includes a bottom wall <b>128</b> and a sidewall <b>121</b> connected to the bottom wall <b>128</b>. The bottom wall <b>128</b> and the sidewall <b>121</b> cooperatively define a hollow space to receive the fireproof device <b>122</b> and the collector <b>123</b>.

The side plate <b>144</b> is connected to the clapboard <b>142</b> and extends along a direction perpendicular to the clapboard <b>142</b> from an edge of the clapboard <b>142</b>. The clapboard <b>142</b> can rest upon the bottom wall <b>128</b> of the reduction pot <b>12</b>. The side plate <b>144</b> can be in contact with the side wall <b>121</b> of the reduction pot <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the heat conductive structure <b>146</b> is disposed on the side plate <b>144</b> and extends from the side plate <b>144</b> to the containing space <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The shape and volume of the hopper <b>14</b> are designed according to the shape and volume of the cavity of the body <b>127</b>. The reduction pot <b>12</b> can contain one or a plurality of hoppers <b>14</b>. When the reduction pot <b>12</b> contains a plurality of hoppers <b>14</b>, the total length of the plurality of hoppers <b>14</b> should be less than the effective length of the body <b>127</b>. The effective length of the body <b>127</b> is the total length of the body <b>127</b> subtracted by the length of the portion held by the fireproof device <b>122</b>, the collector <b>123</b>, the cooling device <b>124</b>, and the cover plate <b>126</b>.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the clapboard <b>142</b> of the hopper <b>14</b> is a segment of a circular plate. The clapboard <b>142</b> has a circular arc and a straight side connected with two ends of the circular arc. The side plate <b>144</b> extends from the circular arc edge along a direction perpendicular to the clapboard <b>142</b>, thereby forming the containing space <b>143</b>. The hopper <b>14</b> is comprised of a material having good thermal conductivity, high strength, and high rigidity. The melting point of the material of the hopper <b>14</b> is higher than the temperature of the reduction reaction. The material of the hopper <b>14</b> can be heat resistant steel, carborundum, or silicon nitride. The material of the hopper can be the same as the material of the reduction pot <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the material of the hopper is the same as the material of the reduction pot <b>12</b>, namely, the material of the hopper is thermal resistant steel.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The thickness of the clapboard <b>142</b> and the side plate <b>144</b> can be set as desired. For saving money, the thickness of the clapboard <b>142</b> and the side plate <b>144</b> can be decreased under a condition that the hopper <b>12</b> cannot be distorted or broken when the articles are loaded in the hopper <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the thickness of the clapboard <b>142</b> and the side plate <b>144</b> is in a range from about 2 millimeters (mm) to about 10 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The central angle of the circle arc of the clapboard <b>142</b> is not limited. The central angle can range from about 270 degrees to about 300 degrees. The central angle is related to the quantity of articles loaded in the hopper <b>14</b>. The larger the central angle, the larger the containing space <b>143</b>, thereby more articles can be loaded. An opening (not labeled) can be defined by the clapboard <b>142</b> and the side plate <b>144</b>. The articles can be loaded in the containing space <b>143</b> through the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, the clapboard <b>142</b> or the side plate <b>144</b> can have a plurality of apertures <b>145</b>. The apertures <b>145</b> are uniformly distributed in the clapboard <b>142</b> or the side plate <b>144</b>. The diameter of the apertures <b>145</b> can be designed according to the diameter of individual articles, in which case the diameters of the apertures <b>145</b> should be less than the diameter of the individual articles, thereby avoiding leakage of the articles from the apertures <b>145</b>. The shape of the apertures <b>145</b> is not limited. The aperture ratio of the clapboard <b>142</b> or the side plate <b>144</b> can range from about 30% to about 70%, namely, the total area of the apertures <b>145</b> can range from about 0.3 square meter to about 0.7 square meter per square meter of the surface area of the clapboard <b>142</b> or the side plate <b>144</b>. In one embodiment, the shape of the apertures <b>145</b> is circular, the diameter of the apertures <b>145</b> ranges from 15 mm to 25 mm, and the aperture ratio of the side plate <b>144</b> is 50%, namely, the total area of the apertures <b>145</b> is 0.5 per square meter of side plate <b>144</b>. The apertures <b>145</b> can save material that is needed for the clapboard <b>142</b> or the side plate <b>144</b>, decrease costs, and decrease the weight of the hopper <b>14</b>. In addition, the steam generated during the process of the reduction reaction can pass through the apertures <b>145</b>, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of the steam.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The heat conductive structure <b>146</b> includes a plurality of heat conductive elements <b>1460</b>. The heat conductive elements <b>1460</b> are uniformly distributed on the side plate <b>144</b> and extend towards the containing space <b>143</b>. The shape of the heat conductive elements <b>1460</b> can be arbitrary, such as plate shaped, or pole shaped. The cross section of the heat conductive elements <b>1460</b> having the plate shape can be arbitrary, such as rectangular, triangular, or pentagonal. The cross section of the pole shaped heat conductive elements <b>1460</b> can be arbitrarily shaped, such as rectangular, triangular, or pentagonal. The heat conductive element <b>1460</b> and the side plate <b>144</b> can be integratedly formed, or the heat conductive element <b>1460</b> can be disposed on the inside wall of the side plate <b>144</b> by welding. The total volume of the heat conductive structure <b>146</b> can be in a range from about 0.5% to about 20% of the volume of the cavity <b>127</b>. In some embodiments, the total volume of the heat conductive structure <b>146</b> is in a range from 1% to 10%. In one embodiment, the shape of the heat conductivity element <b>1460</b> is columnar, the diameter of the cross section of the heat conductivity element <b>1460</b> ranges from about 10 mm to about 35 mm. The heat conductivity elements <b>1460</b> are uniformly distributed on the side plate <b>144</b>. Specifically, the side plate <b>144</b> extends from the circular edge of the clapboard <b>142</b> along a direction approximately perpendicular to the clapboard <b>142</b>, thus, the surface of the side plate <b>144</b> is a portion of a column surface. The heat conductive elements <b>1460</b> can be uniformly disposed on the side plate <b>144</b>, and approximately perpendicular to a helix on the column surface of the side plate <b>144</b>. Additionally, the heat conductive elements <b>1460</b> can also be disposed on the clapboard <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the process of the reduction reaction of the articles, the heat of the reduction pot <b>12</b> can be rapidly transferred from the bottom wall <b>128</b> and the side wall <b>121</b> to the articles contacted with the bottom wall <b>128</b> and the side wall <b>121</b>. The articles which are not contacting the bottom wall <b>128</b> and the side wall <b>121</b>, will still be rapidly heated because the heat conductive elements <b>1460</b> have good thermal conductivity. Thus, the heat conductive structure <b>146</b> can increase the heat conductive area of the entire reduction device <b>10</b>, and decrease the heat conductive distance between the reduction pot <b>12</b> and the articles, whereby the articles can be rapidly and uniformly heated to the reaction temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, the hopper <b>14</b> can include a baffle plate <b>147</b>. The baffle plate <b>147</b> is disposed on an end of the side plate <b>144</b>, away from the clapboard <b>142</b>. The baffle plate <b>147</b> is opposite to and spaced from the collector <b>123</b> and the clapboard <b>142</b>. The shape of the baffle plate <b>147</b> can be set as desired. In one embodiment, the shape of the baffle plate <b>147</b> is the same as that of the clapboard <b>142</b>, namely, the shape of the baffle plate <b>147</b> is a segment of a circular plate. The baffle plate <b>147</b> is approximately parallel to the clapboard <b>142</b>. The thickness of the clapboard <b>142</b> is not limited. In some embodiments, the thickness of the clapboard <b>142</b> ranges from 3 mm to 6 mm. The baffle plate <b>147</b> can prevent the articles from leaking from the hopper <b>14</b>. Additionally, the baffle plate <b>147</b> can define a plurality of apertures (not shown). The diameter of the apertures is less than the diameter of the articles particles, to avoid articles leaking from the apertures. The area ratio of the apertures per unit area of the baffle plate <b>147</b> is in a range from 30% to 70%. The baffle plate <b>147</b> is located below the collector <b>123</b>, thus, the steam generated during the process of the reduction reaction can pass through the apertures and arrive at the collector <b>123</b>, thereby increasing the reaction speed. Furthermore, the hopper <b>14</b> can include a towing loop <b>148</b> disposed on the top surface of the baffle plate <b>147</b>. The towing loop <b>148</b> can be integrally fabricated with the baffle plate <b>147</b>, or fixed to the baffle plate <b>147</b> by welding. The towing loop <b>148</b> is used for drawing out the hopper <b>14</b> from the reduction pot <b>12</b> conveniently. The shape of the towing loop <b>148</b> can be set as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In use, the articles are loaded in the hopper <b>14</b>, then the hopper <b>14</b> is pushed into the reduction pot <b>12</b>. The fireproof device <b>122</b> and the collector <b>123</b> are disposed in the cavity of the body <b>127</b> in that order, then, the cooling device <b>124</b> corresponding to the collector <b>123</b> is installed on the outer wall of the body <b>127</b>. The reduction pot <b>12</b> is sealed by the cover plate <b>126</b>. The reduction pot <b>12</b> is evacuated by the pipe <b>125</b>. The reduction device <b>10</b> is heated to a desired temperature by a heating device, whereby a reduction reaction of the articles is started. When the reduction reaction is over, the cover plate <b>126</b> of the reduction pot <b>12</b> is opened, and the collector <b>123</b>, the fireproof device <b>122</b>, and the hopper <b>14</b> are successively taken out from the reduction pot <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When loading the articles, the articles are loaded in the hopper <b>14</b>, and the hopper <b>14</b> is directly loaded in the reduction pot <b>12</b>. The hopper <b>14</b> does not need to be taken out from the reduction pot <b>12</b> during the process of the reaction. When the reaction is over, there may be residue left in the hopper <b>14</b>. To remove the residue, the collector <b>123</b>, the fireproof device <b>122</b>, the cover plate <b>126</b>, and the hopper <b>14</b> can be successively taken out from the reduction device <b>10</b>, and the residue can then be removed. Thus, labor and time is saved over using a heavy reduction pot of the prior art to load the articles in and remove residue from. The hopper <b>14</b> is small and lightweight, thus it can be moved easily. Loading and unloading can be done automatically outside the reduction pot <b>12</b>. Therefore, time and labor is saved by using the hopper <b>14</b> in the reduction device <b>10</b>. Additionally, the hopper <b>14</b> can eliminate direct contact between the articles and the sidewall <b>121</b> of the reduction pot <b>12</b>, thereby preventing residue from adhering to the sidewall <b>121</b>. Accordingly, the lifetime of the reduction pot <b>12</b> can be prolonged. The residue adhered elsewhere in the hopper <b>14</b> can be easily cleaned out.</p>
