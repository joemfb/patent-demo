<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to optical networks. More particularly, the present invention provides a directionless reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM) system which is fully non-blocking and which can be upgraded in a flexible and incremental manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are a number of different ROADM systems on the market today. Some use wavelength blockers, some use wavelength-selective switches (WSS) and others are based on Planar Lightwave Circuit (PLC) technology. Earlier ROADM configurations were limited to 2-degree nodes, but today wavelength-selective switches have made it possible to design cost-effective, multi-degree ROADM nodes. Multi-degree ROADM's provide a lot of flexibility in a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) network by allowing arbitrary wavelengths to be added or dropped at a particular node or to be switched from one degree to another. One limitation typically shared by current ROADM products is that they are not &#x201c;directionless&#x201d;, i.e. a local add/drop transceiver can only be physically connected to one particular degree (i.e., direction) of the node. If a user wants to switch a particular transceiver to a different degree, the user must manually disconnect the transceiver and reconnect it to a different physical port associated with the new degree.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Directionless ROADMs make it possible for operators to dynamically provision local transceivers to different degrees as they reconfigure their networks. Additionally, directionless ROADMs lay the foundation for network architectures supporting all-optical mesh restoration. One exemplary implementation of a directionless ROADM includes the addition of a photonic cross-connect (PXC) to enable routing of the local add/drop channels to arbitrary degrees on the ROADM.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary 4-degree ROADM <b>10</b> is constructed with two add/drop clients, i.e. an Internet Protocol (IP) router/switch <b>12</b> and an Optical Transport Network (OTN) switch <b>14</b>. In a first configuration <b>20</b>, the ROADM <b>10</b> is constrained, in that each add/drop client signal <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> can only route through one degree <b>30</b> (i.e., direction). Note that express waves <b>32</b> can still pass from any-to-any network fiber, so long as these are not dropped locally. In a second configuration <b>40</b>, a directionless PXC <b>42</b> adds a &#x201c;switch matrix&#x201d; to the Add/Drop signal bank, which allows add/drop clients truly to be switched to any degree dynamically. Again, express waves can pass from any-to-any degree.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Directionless ROADMs have been disclosed using large N&#xd7;N cross-connects. For example, these are disclosed by V. Kaman et al., &#x201c;Multi-Degree ROADM's with Agile Add-Drop Access,&#x201d; (available at www.calient.net/_docs/PhotonicSwtConf_MultiDegreeROADMs<sub>&#x2014;</sub>07.pdf) and by Sashisekaran Thiagarajan et al., &#x201c;Direction-Independent Add/Drop Access for Multi-Degree ROADMs&#x201d;, OFC 2008 Proceedings, OThA7, Optical Society of America, February 2008. Disadvantageously, the problem with large N&#xd7;N cross-connects is that N scales as the number of degrees multiplied by the number of wavelengths in each degree. For example, a degree 8-node with 80 wavelengths per fiber requires a 640&#xd7;640 cross-connect which is beyond the current state-of-the art and involves a very high up-front cost even if only a few channels are needed initially, and this would increase to 1280&#xd7;1280 for 100% add/drop capability. The very large number of interconnects also make it very difficult to install or service the switch fabric and the problem gets worse if a redundant switch fabric is needed for network availability reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Two other approaches to ROADMs are disclosed by Ghelfi et al., &#x201c;Optical Cross Connects Architecture with per-Node Add &#x26; Drop Functionality&#x201d;, Ghelfi et al., OFC 2007 Proceedings, NTuC3, Optical Society of America, February 2007. First, Ghelfi et al. disclose an optical cross-connect with per-port Add &#x26; Drop (OXC-PAD) using a 1&#xd7;N WSS in each degree to route drop channels to N local transceivers. Add channels are collected using N&#xd7;1 combiners. Each transceiver is connected to a pair of 1&#xd7;N switches that direct the Tx/Rx signals to the WSS/combiner module associated with the selected degree. This approach could make sense for a small degree (e.g., less than degree 5) node with a few (e.g., less than 10) add/drop channels, but it becomes prohibitively expensive for larger nodes, as the minimum number of WSS ports required is given by the number of degrees multiplied by the number of add/drop channels. For example, a degree 8-node with 40 add/drop channels requires on the order of forty 1&#xd7;8 WSSs, for a total of 320 WSS ports. Eighty 1&#xd7;8 switches are also required.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a second approach, Ghelfi et al. add an additional degree to the ROADM and connect add/drop local traffic using that degree. Although this is a low-cost approach, it introduces severe blocking issues since it only allows a single add/drop channel to be provisioned at a given wavelength. To enable efficient use of bandwidth in the network, a directionless ROADM needs to be non-blocking, which means that different add/drop channels can be provisioned at the same wavelength if they are connected to different degrees.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various exemplary embodiments, the present invention provides a directionless reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM) system. The present invention provides a scalable all-optical switching element that includes a combination of 1&#xd7;N wavelength selective switches (WSS), 1&#xd7;N splitters/combiners, optical amplifiers, and tunable filters to provide a fully non-blocking solution which can be deployed in a scalable manner. The 1&#xd7;N splitters are configured to split multiples copies of a plurality of drop wavelengths which can be amplified and sent to a tunable filter which selects out a particular wavelength for drop. The 1&#xd7;N combiners are configured to combine multiple add wavelengths for egress transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention provides a cost-effective, scalable, and flexible solution to directionless ROADMs. The present invention can provide a lower cost networking solution than one that relies on electronic switching for high speed optical networks with transmission rates of 40 Gb/s, 100 Gb/s, and higher. Advantageously, the present invention is compatible with existing ROADM solutions, uses existing component technology, and has a low up front cost (i.e., the most expensive elements (tunable filters and transceivers) can be added in a &#x201c;pay-as-you-grow&#x201d; manner), is a true directionless system with non-blocking functionality for relatively high channel counts. Additionally, the directionless ROADM can have reduced fiber interconnects by combining 1&#xd7;N splitter/combiners and their subtending PXC in a single module. For example, integrating an array of 1&#xd7;8 splitters with a 128&#xd7;128 PXC reduces the number of inputs from 128 to 16.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a directionless ROADM <b>50</b> is illustrated for N degrees according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. For illustration purposes, the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> is shown as unprotected, and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> can also be deployed in a protected configuration. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> is shown with a top section with a multi-degree ROADM configuration <b>52</b> and a bottom section with a directionless add/drop configuration <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The multi-degree ROADM configuration <b>52</b> includes an array of 1&#xd7;N WSS modules <b>56</b> on a drop side (i.e., from degrees 1, 2, . . . , N <b>58</b>), and a similar array of 1&#xd7;N combiners <b>60</b> on an add side (i.e., to degrees 1, 2, . . . , N <b>62</b>), where N represents the degree of the ROADM <b>50</b>. The 1&#xd7;N WSS modules <b>56</b> and the 1&#xd7;N combiners <b>60</b> can be realized by a variety of techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The directionless add/drop configuration <b>54</b> is configured to provide directionless add/drop capabilities to multiple transceivers <b>64</b>. As described herein, transceivers <b>64</b>) can be routed to any device or degree. The directionless add/drop configuration <b>54</b> includes splitter and combiner modules <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> with 1&#xd7;A ports <b>66</b> and 1&#xd7;B ports <b>68</b>, optical amplifiers <b>70</b>, photonic cross-connects (PXC) <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and tunable filters (TF) <b>76</b>. The splitter and combiner modules <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> can be realized with PLC, fused fiber components, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The optical amplifiers <b>70</b> are utilized to compensate for coupler/switch losses. Different amplifier designs can be used on the add and drop sides depending on the gain and output power needed. The PXCs <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are configured to switch wavelengths between a plurality of ports. Each PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> is configured with S network-facing ports (i.e., connected to the 1&#xd7;B ports <b>68</b>) and T client facing ports (i.e., connected to the TFs <b>76</b>) to provide an S&#xd7;T sized PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. The PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> can be realizing with micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors, actuated collimators, and the like. The TFs <b>76</b> are configured to be wavelength-tunable to select one of any of the available WDM wavelengths available. The TFs <b>76</b> can be realized with thin-film filters, PLC, MEMS, electric-domain filtering after an optical coherent receiver and the like. The TFs <b>76</b> can be designed to include specific channel spacings, e.g. 50 GHz, 100 GHz, etc., which are fully arbitrarily selected without intermediate dead zones. For example, the selection of the TFs <b>76</b> can be done remotely through software.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With regards to signal flow through the directionless ROADM <b>50</b>, WDM channels originating from any one of the degrees 1, 2, . . . , N <b>58</b> are arbitrarily routed by the WSS <b>56</b> associated with the degree 1, 2, . . . , N <b>58</b> to N possible output ports. If N is the actual degree of the node, then (N&#x2212;1) of these ports are used as express ports and connected to the N&#xd7;1 combiners <b>60</b> to form the multi-degree wavelength routing fabric, i.e. the multi-degree ROADM configuration <b>52</b>. At least one WSS <b>56</b> port can be used for local drop channels, connected to one of the 1&#xd7;A splitters <b>66</b>, which feeds into one or more of the 1&#xd7;B splitters <b>68</b>. Note, the 1&#xd7;A splitters <b>66</b> and 1&#xd7;B splitters <b>68</b> can also function as 1&#xd7;A couplers <b>66</b> and 1&#xd7;B couplers <b>68</b> in the opposite (i.e., add) direction. The optical amplifier <b>70</b> can be required between the splitter <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> stages to compensate for their loss. The splitters <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> are configured to broadcast the drop channels from one degree <b>58</b> to up to (A*B) output ports, i.e. every splitter port contains all the drop channels from that particular degree <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The S&#xd7;T PXC <b>72</b> is then connected to at least one 1&#xd7;B coupler <b>68</b> from each degree <b>58</b>. Additionally, in the add direction, the S&#xd7;T PXC <b>74</b> is also connected to at least one 1&#xd7;B couplers <b>68</b> to each degree <b>62</b> through the amplifiers <b>70</b> and the 1&#xd7;A couplers <b>66</b>. Depending on the value of S and B and the number of degrees, there could be multiple 1&#xd7;B splitters <b>68</b> on the same PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> associated with the same degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>. There could also be multiple PXCs <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> connected in parallel using different ports of the 1&#xd7;A splitters <b>66</b> in order to scale to higher channel counts or to provision redundant switch fabrics.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The role of the PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> is to select the appropriate degree for each transceiver <b>64</b> that is connected to one of the T output ports of the PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. The Rx portion of the transceiver <b>64</b> must be preceded by the TF <b>76</b> to select one particular channel from that degree since every splitter port contains all the drop channels from that particular degree <b>58</b>. This configuration therefore allows the transceiver <b>64</b> to receive any channel from any degree <b>58</b>. For the Tx (Add) side, the signal flow is reversed and the only significant difference is that no TF is required since the channels are being combined rather than demultiplexed, i.e. there is only one channel on the connection from the Tx to the PXC <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Scaling Rules for the ROADM Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The required number of ports for the 1&#xd7;N WSS modules <b>56</b> (N), the combiners/splitters <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> (N, A, B), and the PXCs <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> (S,T) depend on the number of degrees <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> and the number of add/drop channels per degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> (D) that need to be supported. The basic scaling rules include: (1) to support degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> N nodes, the WSS modules <b>56</b> require at least 1&#xd7;N ports and the combiners/splitters <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> require at least 1&#xd7;N ports (i.e., A and B are each equal to or greater than N); and (2) to support D drop channels per degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> requires A*B&#x2267;D.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If the input ports of the PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are divided evenly among the different degrees <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, then the number of 1&#xd7;B splitters <b>68</b> associated with each degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> within the PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> is equal to truncation of (S/(N*B)), and the number of PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> input ports associated with each degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> is m*B, where m=trunc(S/(N*B)), i.e. the number of 1&#xd7;B splitters <b>68</b> associated with each degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> within the PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. In an ideal implementation, m*B should be greater or equal to D, i.e. there should be at least as many PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> input ports as there are drop channels for each degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>. In that case, the required number of PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> output ports is T&#x2267;N*D. This case is always non-blocking, i.e. any transceiver <b>64</b> connected to the PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> can access any channel on any degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, regardless of how the other transceivers <b>64</b> connected to the same PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are configured.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the case where the maximum number of drop channels exceeds the number of inputs available on a single PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> (i.e., D&#x3e;m*B), then additional PXCs <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> need to be provisioned using available ports in the 1&#xd7;A splitters <b>66</b>. This allows more transceivers <b>64</b> to be provisioned, but can also create blocking situations, i.e. cases where a transceiver <b>64</b> cannot access a particular degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> because all input PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> ports associated with that degree are already in use by other transceiver <b>64</b>. The only way to achieve a fully non-blocking configuration is to limit the number of transceivers <b>64</b> connected to each PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> to T&#x2266;m*B, which would typically leave a lot of PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> ports unused.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, assume a degree-4 directionless ROADM <b>50</b> is designed using a 128&#xd7;128 PXC as a building block. The splitter stages are chosen to be A=12 and B=8. Since S=128 and N=4, there could be up to 32 drop ports connected to a PXC from each degree, which would require a total of sixteen 1&#xd7;8 splitters (four per degree, m=4), occupying 4 of the 12 available ports in each 1&#xd7;A splitter/combiner. This configuration is fully non-blocking for a maximum of 32 Add/Drop channels per degree (D=32) and the maximum number of transceivers could be 128.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To scale the node to higher channel counts, two more 128&#xd7;128 PXCs can be added to both the Add and Drop directions using the available 1&#xd7;A splitter/combiner ports connected to 64 additional 1&#xd7;8 splitter/combiners. This allows up to 384 transceivers to be connected to the node or D=96 channels per degree. However, to achieve a fully non-blocking configuration, a maximum of 32 transceivers could be connected to each PXC, for a maximum of 96 transceivers at the node; in this case, the 96 transceivers can be assigned to the different degrees arbitrarily, including sending all 96 transceivers to the same degree.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to provide better scalability while avoiding blocking situations, a second PXC layer <b>80</b> can be added to the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The second PXC layer <b>80</b> includes a U&#xd7;V PXC which makes it possible to dynamically assign the S&#xd7;T PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> ports to different degrees <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>. This way, if one of the PXCs <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> runs out of available ports for a particular degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, unused ports can be reassigned to that degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> so that additional transceiver <b>64</b> can be connected to it. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the U&#xd7;V PXC <b>80</b> is shown as a bidirectional device, i.e. a single device shared by the Add and Drop directions. It could also be realized with two separate modules (one for Add and one for Drop) or even by using some of the unused ports of the S&#xd7;T PXCs <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> can include different configurations with regard to the 1&#xd7;N WSS modules <b>56</b> and the 1&#xd7;N combiners <b>60</b> according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the 1&#xd7;N combiners <b>60</b> used on the drop side, i.e. degrees <b>58</b>, and the 1&#xd7;N WSS modules <b>56</b> on the add side, i.e. degrees <b>62</b>. Here, the 1&#xd7;N combiners <b>60</b> are used as 1&#xd7;N splitters. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates using the 1&#xd7;N WSS modules <b>56</b> on both sides, i.e. both degrees <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">All three configurations, i.e. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>, of the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> provide the same directionless ROADM functionality, but using a 1&#xd7;N WSS module <b>56</b> instead of a 1&#xd7;N splitter/combiner <b>60</b> offers advantages. On the drop side, i.e. degrees <b>58</b>, the 1&#xd7;N WSS module <b>56</b> limits the number of channels going into the drop amplifier <b>70</b>, which means that a higher power per channel can be achieved at the output of the amplifier <b>70</b>. On the add side, i.e. degrees <b>62</b>, the 1&#xd7;N WSS module <b>56</b> can be used to filter out some of the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) coming from the add amplifiers <b>70</b>, which otherwise degrade the optical signal to-noise ratio (OSNR) of the express channels. Accordingly, the directionless ROADM in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> offers the best of both worlds but is significantly more expensive since the cost of the 1&#xd7;N WSS module <b>56</b> is much higher than that of the 1&#xd7;N splitter/combiner <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for reduced add/drop requirements, it is possible to build a directionless ROADM <b>100</b> with a smaller number of elements. The directionless ROADM <b>100</b> includes a single layer of 1&#xd7;B splitter/combiners <b>68</b>, which reduces add/drop insertion loss, but limits the number of channels per degree <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> to a total of B instead of A*B. The reduction in insertion loss could make it possible in some cases to eliminate amplifiers <b>70</b>, such as on the add side, i.e. degree <b>62</b>. Also, the same PXC <b>72</b> can be shared by both add and drop channels. This reduces the maximum number of add/drop channels by a factor of two, but also reduces the cost of the node significantly. The directionless ROADM <b>100</b> can be deployed at nodes with reduced requirements for add/drop to provide cost savings.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Adjustable Filter Bandwidth:</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some systems, different WDM channels may be transmitting data at significantly different bit rates (e.g. 10 Gb/s, 40 Gb/s, 100 Gb/s, etc.) or different modulation formats (e.g., on-off Keying, phase-shift keying, etc.). For optimized system performance, the optical bandwidth of the tunable filter <b>76</b> should ideally be tailored to the bit rate and modulation format of each channel type. This can be realized simply by provisioning each transceiver <b>64</b> type with a tunable filter <b>76</b> of the appropriate bandwidth, i.e. integration of the TF <b>76</b> into the transceiver <b>64</b>. A more flexible solution can include TFs <b>76</b> with adjustable optical bandwidth. Such filters are available on the market today and could be provisioned via software to match any given channel type. Alternately, TFs <b>76</b> can be implemented as electric domain filters following an optical coherent receiver. Advantageously, the TFs <b>76</b> enable the directionless ROADM of the present invention to overcome static channel spacing, e.g. 50 GHz, 100 GHz, etc., and the TFs <b>76</b> avoid any dead zones, i.e. guard bands, etc., between active passbands as are common on static filters.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the broadcast nature of the directionless ROADMs <b>50</b>, <b>100</b> described herein makes it straightforward to add redundancy and optical protection to the node, simply by provisioning parallel (work and protect) PXCs <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> in the Add and Drop directions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a protected configuration <b>110</b> of the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> including the parallel PXCs <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> along with the other components of the directionless ROADM <b>50</b>. In the protected configuration <b>110</b>, a local client has the ability to select one of two (work and protect) transceivers <b>64</b><i>w</i>, <b>64</b><i>p </i>to access the node via the redundant PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> fabrics. The client normally connects through the work path through PXCs <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, but in the case of an equipment failure in any of the elements in the work path (transceiver <b>64</b><i>w</i>, PXC <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, amplifier <b>70</b>, combiner/splitter <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>), the client switches to the protect path through PXCs <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. In this example, the protection switch can occur on the client side of the transceivers <b>64</b><i>w</i>, <b>64</b><i>p </i>via a conventional optical or electrical switch (not shown). Additionally, the directionless ROADM <b>100</b> can also be configured in the protected configuration <b>110</b> to provide redundancy and optical protection for a reduced add/drop configuration. Also, the protected configuration <b>110</b> is illustrated with the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the protected configuration <b>110</b> can also be implemented with the configurations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the directionless ROADMs <b>50</b>, <b>100</b> described herein can also be configured to provide protection for unprotected (e.g., 0:1) transceivers <b>64</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an optically protected configuration <b>120</b> of the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> including the parallel PXCs <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, a 1&#xd7;2 switch <b>122</b>, a 1&#xd7;2 coupler <b>124</b>, and the other components of the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> for providing protection of an unprotected transceiver <b>64</b>. In the optically protected configuration <b>120</b>, only one transceiver <b>64</b> is connected to each client but redundancy and protection is still being provided for the directionless ROADM <b>50</b> modules. Following a failure of the PXC <b>72</b>, splitter/combiner <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, or amplifier <b>70</b> in the drop path (i.e., degrees <b>58</b>), the 1&#xd7;2 switch <b>122</b> actuates to connect the Rx of the transceiver <b>64</b> to the protect path through the PXC <b>102</b>. On the add side (i.e., degrees <b>62</b>), the 1&#xd7;2 coupler <b>124</b> is typically used to send two copies of the Tx signal down redundant paths, i.e. through both PXCs <b>74</b>, <b>104</b>. A corresponding 1&#xd7;2 switch <b>122</b> is used at a drop side of another node associated with the degrees <b>62</b> to provide the optical protection switching. If an application requires that the Tx and Rx signal simultaneously switch to the protect path in case of an equipment failure, then the 1&#xd7;2 switch <b>122</b> could be used instead of the 1&#xd7;2 coupler <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a directionless ROADM <b>200</b> can be configured with separate unprotected PXCs <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> to provide a lower cost directionless solution with a requirement for some additional traffic engineering complexity. The directionless ROADM <b>200</b> is illustrated in a degree-4 configuration, i.e. North, South, East, and West, and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the directionless ROADM <b>200</b> could be deployed in any arbitrary degree configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Each PXC <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> includes a photonic switch matrix <b>206</b> and multiple splitters/combiners <b>208</b>.

On a drop side <b>210</b>, the directionless ROADM <b>200</b> includes a WSS <b>212</b> for each of the four degrees. On an add side <b>214</b>, the directionless ROADM <b>200</b> includes an N&#xd7;1 coupler <b>216</b> for each of the four degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The directionless ROADM <b>200</b> requires the use of two drop ports from each of the incoming WSSs <b>212</b> for channel drop function and the use of two add ports to each of the outgoing N&#xd7;1 couplers <b>216</b> for the channel add function. Wavelengths dropping from the different WSS <b>210</b> ports are connected to the different PXCs <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>. The directionless ROADM <b>200</b> can support end-to-end service protection by steering work and protect lightpaths (i.e., a wave, channel, etc.) through separate unprotected switch fabrics, e.g. PXCs <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>. When protection is required, the directionless ROADM <b>200</b> can be configured to steer separate lightpaths across independent pieces of equipment and to different degrees <b>210</b>, <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates connectivity of an exemplary &#x2018;protected&#x2019; lightpath <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> at a single ROADM location using optical 1+1/tail end protection. The lightpath is launched 1+1 (illustrated as the lightpaths <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>) into two separate PXC fabrics and directed to the East and North directions (lightpath <b>220</b> is sent East, and lightpath <b>222</b> is sent North). Accordingly, from the light source, i.e. the transceiver <b>64</b>, the lightpaths are kept separate.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the receiving side, the lightpaths <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> are shown to arrive from the East and North directions (lightpath <b>224</b> arrives from the East, and lightpath <b>226</b> arrives from the North). The signal arriving from the East (i.e., lightpath <b>224</b>) is dropped from a WSS drop port to the PXC <b>204</b>. Because of the blocking nature of the WSS, this means that the wavelength associated with the lightpath <b>224</b> from the East is no longer available to drop at any further WSS port. Similarly, the signal arriving from the North (i.e., lightpath <b>226</b>) direction is dropped using a WSS drop port to the PXC <b>202</b>. Each of the lightpaths <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> is connected to a local 1&#xd7;2 protection switch <b>230</b> located at the transceiver <b>64</b> where the best signal is chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this implementation, the 1+1 lightpaths <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> are kept separate on both transmit and receive ends of a protected connection. No &#x2018;secondary&#x2019; duplication of the signals needs to take place (e.g., through the PXC switches) because each switch forms part of the chain associated with each arm (or leg) of the two diverse paths. One PXC switches a subset of the wavelengths (X) and the other switches the remaining wavelengths (1&#x2212;X).</p>
