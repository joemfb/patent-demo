<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to semiconductor devices, and specifically to a structure for detecting defects that may occur while forming back-end-of-the-line structures.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the manufacture of semiconductor devices, process-induced physical defects in back-end manufacturing processes may cause electrical defects, such as shorts and opens that interfere with device performance and therefore decrease yield. One such process-induced defect is residual material which arises when excess material deposited in back-end structures is not completely removed by a planarization process such as chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). For example, process-induced defects can occur due to a non-uniform pattern density which leads to a non-uniform polish.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the dimensions of semiconductor devices have steadily decreased, it has become increasingly difficult to monitor the presence of defects on the devices directly. One approach for addressing these defects has been the fabrication of test structures during the relevant manufacturing process that may be easily examined, either electrically or optically, for defects. The test structures are manufactured at the same time and by the same manufacturing processes, so that by determining defect concentrations on the test structures, it may be possible to approximate the defect concentration of the actual semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, these test structures are located in the space between the chips (referred to as the kerf) and are not located in the chip area (i.e. not within the chip die) itself. However, defect concentration may not be uniform across a chip. Moreover, some test structures rely on their proximity to the defect source to be able to detect certain kinds of defects. Therefore, it may be advantageous to construct test structure consisting of a potential defect-generating region, a defect-dispersing region and a defect-sensing region that may be located throughout the chip area.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a test structure that may be used to detect defects formed in back-end structures of semiconductor devices and methods of forming said test structures. According to at least one exemplary embodiment, a test structure may include a first metallization layer, a second metallization layer formed above the first metallization layer, a defect-generating region formed in a first metallization layer, a defect-dispersing region formed in the second metallization layer above the defect-generating region; and a defect-detecting region formed in the second metallization layer adjacent to the defect-dispersing region. The defect-generating region of the exemplary embodiment may have zero pattern density, uniform non-zero pattern density, or non-uniform non-zero pattern density.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Exemplary embodiments may further include methods of forming test structures including a defect-generating region, a defect-dispersing region and a defect-detecting region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Exemplary embodiments may further include methods of using test structures including a defect-generating region, a defect-dispersing region and a defect-detecting region to determine the uniformity of back-end processes such as chemical-mechanical planarization.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1G</figref>, one mechanism of generating process-induced defects is described, where non-uniform planarization of a first metallization layer causes defects in a second metallization layer formed above the first metallization layer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, first metallization layer <b>110</b> may be formed by depositing a first dielectric layer <b>111</b> and a second dielectric layer <b>112</b> on the surface of preceding structure <b>101</b> (for example, a preceding metallization layer or microelectronic device), etching first dielectric layer <b>111</b> and second dielectric layer <b>112</b> to form recess regions (not shown), and depositing a liner <b>113</b> and metal fill <b>114</b> in the recess regions to form back-end features (such backend features may include, for example, via or line <b>115</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The details of structure <b>101</b> have been omitted for illustrative simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> may then be planarized, for example by CMP, to remove the excess material of liner <b>113</b> and metal fill <b>114</b>. However, the planarization process sometimes results in non-uniform polishing, where some excess material of liner <b>113</b> and/or metal fill <b>114</b>, such as residue sheet <b>120</b>, remains on the top surface of second dielectric layer <b>112</b>. Due to the nature of the planarization polish, defects such as residue sheet <b>120</b> are more likely to occur in areas where first metallization layer <b>110</b> has a low pattern density. Pattern density of the first metallization layer <b>110</b> may be defined as the top-down area of back-end features such as via <b>115</b> in a given area of first metallization layer <b>110</b> divided by the overall top-down area of the given area. As will be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C-1G</figref>, the presence of residue sheet <b>120</b> may result in physical and/or electrical defects when a second metallization layer <b>130</b> is then formed on first metallization layer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, second metallization layer <b>130</b> may be formed by first depositing a third dielectric layer <b>131</b> and a fourth dielectric layer <b>132</b> on the surface of the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, residue sheet <b>120</b> may be exposed when third dielectric layer <b>131</b> and a fourth dielectric layer <b>132</b> are etched to form recess regions <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>for back-end features of the second metallization layer <b>130</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, residue sheet <b>120</b> can then be lifted from the surface of first metallization layer <b>110</b> and relocated across the surface of the structure by processes such as a wet clean. When residue sheet <b>120</b> is relocated to the area of recess region <b>140</b><i>a</i>, defects may occur that may reduce device performance and yield. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, residue sheet <b>120</b> may block recess region <b>140</b><i>a </i>while liner <b>141</b> and metal fill <b>142</b> are deposited on the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, when excess material of liner <b>141</b> and/or metal fill <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>) is polished away, recess region <b>140</b><i>a </i>may remain empty or partially filled. This empty recess region would represent an open in the metal structure of second metallization layer <b>130</b>. Residues such as residue sheet <b>120</b> may also cause defects through other mechanisms, such as causing shorts by bridging two unconnected back-end features of the same or different metallization layers. Accordingly, a test structure may be provided to detect process-induced physical defects such as residue metal, which may lead to electrical defects, such as shorts and opens. As used in this application, the term generic &#x201c;defect&#x201d; pertains to both electrical defects, such as shorts and opens, and/or to physical defects such as residual material. The physical defects may or may not lead to an electrical defect.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention include a test structure including a first metallization layer and a second metallization layer capable of detecting the defects resulting from non-uniform planarization of the first metallization layer, as detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A-1G</figref>. Embodiments may include, as part of the first metallization layer, a defect-generating region, and, as part of the second metallization layer, a defect-dispersing region and a defect-detecting region. The defect-generating region is designed to accurately simulate the process conditions used to form actual back-end structures of the same metallization layer, such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>. Defect-detecting region is a structure formed in the second metallization layer capable of detecting the defects formed by the defect-generating region in the first metallization layer. Defect-dispersing region is a structure formed in the second metallization capable of transporting the defects formed by the defect-generating region from the defect-generating region to the defect-detecting region. By incorporating a defect-dispersing region near the defect-detecting region as part of the test structure, the test structure is no longer required to be located near structures that independently generate physical defects, such as the kerf, in order to function reliably. Therefore, test structures according to embodiments of the present invention may be capable of being located wherever necessary to monitor relevant manufacturing processes throughout the chip area.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2I</figref> depict a process of manufacturing an exemplary embodiment of the test structure of the present invention, including a defect-generating region <b>213</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), a defect-dispersing region <b>230</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>), and a defect-detecting region <b>240</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a first metallization layer <b>210</b>, including a first dielectric layer <b>211</b> and a second dielectric layer <b>212</b>, is formed above a preceding structure <b>201</b>, such as a preceding metallization layer or microelectronic device. The details of preceding structure <b>201</b> have been omitted for illustrative simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B-2E</figref> illustrate a process by which defect-generating region <b>213</b> may be formed as part of first metallization layer <b>210</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, defect-generating region <b>213</b> may be formed by etching first metallization layer <b>210</b> to form recess regions <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>214</b><i>c</i>. The top-down area of recess regions <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>214</b><i>c </i>divided by the top-down area of defect-generating region <b>213</b> defines the pattern density of defect-generating region <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, recess regions <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>214</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) of defect-generating region <b>213</b> are filled with metal by depositing metal layers <b>214</b> and <b>215</b> on the top surface of the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is planarized, using, for example, CMP, to remove excess material from metal layers <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C) and 215</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) to form metal features <b>216</b><i>a</i>-<b>216</b><i>c </i>as part of defect-generating region <b>213</b>. If the planarization is not uniform, residue sheets <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>may remain on the surface of first metallization layer <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E-2I</figref> illustrate a process by which defect-dispersing region <b>230</b> and defect-detecting region <b>240</b> may be formed as part of a second metallization layer <b>220</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, second metallization layer <b>220</b>, including a third dielectric layer <b>221</b> and a fourth dielectric layer <b>222</b>, may be formed above first metallization layer <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, second metallization layer <b>220</b> may be etched to form recess regions <b>231</b> and <b>241</b><i>a</i>-<b>241</b><i>f</i>. Recess regions <b>241</b><i>a</i>-<b>241</b><i>f </i>are formed as part of defect-detecting region <b>240</b> and, once filled with metal, may form the test pattern of defect-detecting region <b>240</b> (discussed later in more detail in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). Recess region <b>231</b> may be formed as part of defect-dispersing region <b>230</b>, above defect-generating region <b>213</b>. While forming recess region <b>231</b> as part of defect-dispersing region <b>230</b>, physical defects, such as residue sheets <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b</i>, resulting from uneven polishing of first metallization layer <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, may be exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, residue sheets <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b</i>, now exposed during the formation of defect-dispersing region <b>230</b>, may be dispersed across the surface of the structure by processes such as a wet clean, and land in a manner that blocks off some recess regions <b>241</b><i>a</i>-<b>241</b><i>f </i>in defect-detecting region <b>240</b>, such as recess regions <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>c </i>in the depicted embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, metal layers <b>251</b> and <b>252</b> are then deposited on the top surface of the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> to fill recess regions <b>231</b> and <b>241</b><i>a</i>-<b>241</b><i>f</i>. Because recess regions <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>c </i>are blocked by residue sheets <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b</i>, recess regions <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>c </i>remain empty.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>, excess metal from layers <b>251</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H) and 252</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>) is removed, for example, by CMP, to form metal features <b>232</b> and <b>242</b><i>a</i>-<b>242</b><i>d</i>. Subsequently, defect-detecting region <b>240</b> may be tested for defects. Because recess regions <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>c </i>remain empty, electrical tests will reveal resistances different than expected along paths passing through recess regions <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>c</i>, such that an unexpected resistance indicates the presence of one or more defects in defect-detecting region <b>240</b>. Further, optical inspection may also reveal defects present in defect-detecting region <b>240</b> caused by residue sheets resulting from uneven polishing defect-generating region <b>213</b> of first metallization layer <b>210</b> and exposed by the formation of defect-dispersing region <b>230</b>. Therefore, by determining the defect concentration of defect-detecting region <b>240</b>, it is possible to determine information regarding the uniformity of the planarization process in defect-generating region <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">By using the combination of a defect-generating region, a defect-dispersing region, and a defect-detecting region as discussed above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2I</figref>, a test structure according to one embodiment of the invention may be capable of being located throughout the chip area.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref> illustrate in more detail how the defect-generating region, the defect-dispersing region, and the defect-detecting region may be configured. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref>, test structure <b>300</b> includes a defect-detecting region <b>323</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and a defect-dispersing region <b>324</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) in a second metallization layer <b>320</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), and a defect-generating region <b>325</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C-3E</figref>) in a first metallization layer <b>310</b> formed below second metallization layer <b>320</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C-3E</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, according to one embodiment, defect-dispersing region <b>324</b> may consist of a metal line (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) formed in second metallization layer <b>320</b> surrounding defect-detecting region <b>323</b>. Preferably the metal line is wide, more preferably, about 1 micron. Defect-detecting region <b>323</b> may be adjacent to defect-dispersing region <b>324</b>, meaning there are no other features present in second metallization layer <b>324</b> between defect-detecting region <b>323</b> and defect-dispersing region <b>324</b>. Defect-detecting region <b>323</b> may or may not abut defect-dispersing region <b>324</b>. Defect-detecting region <b>323</b> may include a test pattern such as the comb-serpentine structure <b>301</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, where two interlocking comb structures <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> are separated by a serpentine structure <b>304</b>. The various lines of comb structures <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> and serpentine structure <b>304</b> may correspond to metal features <b>242</b><i>a</i>-<b>242</b><i>d </i>of defect-detecting region <b>240</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> (as well as recess regions <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>c</i>, where defects interfere with the formation of the test pattern. By forming electrical connections to various contacts (not shown) along comb structures <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> and serpentine structure <b>304</b>, it is possible to determine the presence of defects by comparing the expected resistance between two contacts to the measured resistance. For example, a higher than expected resistance may indicate the presence of an open (such as recess regions <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>c</i>, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>) along a continuous path. The presence of defects in defect-detecting region <b>323</b> may also be determined by other methods such as optically with a microscope, either manually or by an automated process. Other embodiments may include other test patterns, such as a via chain. Other embodiments of test structures with various defect-dispersing region <b>324</b> and defect-detecting region <b>323</b> configurations are described later in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>. The further description of test structure <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C-3E</figref> may also apply to the alternate embodiments explained later in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C-3E</figref> are various cross sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> along line A-A&#x2032;, which depict the defect-generating region <b>325</b> underneath defect-dispersing region <b>324</b>. As illustrated, according to some embodiments, defect-generating region <b>325</b> may have, for example, a zero pattern density (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), a uniform non-zero pattern density (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>), or a non-uniform non-zero pattern density (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>). The various pattern densities associated with a particular defect-generating region may reflect the pattern density of a region of the circuit monitored by the corresponding test structure. For example, a low pattern density region of a circuit being tested may include a test structure including a defect-generating region having a zero pattern density (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). Alternatively, higher pattern density regions of a circuit being tested may include a test structure including defect-generating regions having non-zero pattern density (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, an embodiment of the test structure at a cross-section along line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is shown. the exemplary test structure <b>300</b> may include the defect-dispersing region <b>324</b> and the defect-detecting region <b>323</b> (not shown in this cross-section) formed in a second metallization layer <b>320</b> (further including third dielectric layer <b>321</b> and fourth dielectric layer <b>322</b>, equivalent to second metallization layer <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2I</figref>). Second metallization layer <b>320</b> is above a first metallization layer <b>310</b> (further including first dielectric layer <b>311</b> and second dielectric layer <b>312</b>, equivalent to a first metallization layer <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2I</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, first metallization layer <b>310</b> includes defect-generating region <b>325</b>, which has a zero pattern density (i.e., there are no metal features present) directly under the defect-dispersing region <b>324</b>. Because defect density may increase as pattern density decreases, the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> may be used to determine the maximum defect density of a given planarization process.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, another embodiment of the test structure at a cross-section along line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is shown. Here, the features are as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, with the exception that first metallization layer <b>310</b> now includes defect generating region <b>325</b> with a uniform non-zero pattern density in the region under defect-dispersing region <b>234</b>, as indicated by the metal features <b>340</b>. The metal features <b>340</b> may be lines, vias, or any other feature known in the art and correspond to metal features <b>216</b><i>a</i>-<b>216</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. The pattern density as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> is uniform, meaning the spacing between the metal features <b>240</b> are the same and the width of each metal feature <b>240</b> is the same. The pattern density may be minimum pitch or greater. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the numerical value of the minimum pitch will vary with technology node and device level. The width of the metal feature may be minimum CD (critical dimension) or larger. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the numerical value of the CD will vary with technology node and device level. By having a uniform pattern density underneath the defect-dispersing region, a test structure may be used to determine the expected defect concentration for that given pattern density. A field of test structures may then be employed, each with different but uniform pattern densities, to determine a correlation between pattern density and defect concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, another embodiment of the test structure at a cross-section along line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is shown. Here, the features are as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>, with the exception that the first metallization layer <b>310</b> now includes defect generating region <b>325</b> with non-uniform non-zero pattern density in the region under defect-dispersing region <b>324</b> as indicated by the metal features <b>340</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the spacing between each metal feature <b>340</b> is different while the width of each metal feature <b>340</b> is the same. Alternatively, pattern density may vary due to varying width of the metal features <b>340</b> while the spacing between metal features <b>340</b> stayed the same or varied (not shown). In addition, when viewing top down, there may be rows of metal features which may have the same or different metal widths and/or lengths, as well as different spacing between rows (not shown). A non-uniform pattern density underneath the defect-dispersing region may allow a single test structure to monitor a planarization process at different pattern densities by determining where on the defect-detecting region defects are found and correlating that location to the pattern density of the surrounding defect-dispersing region.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">By using the test structures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-3E</figref>, a planarization process, such as the process depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> may be monitored according to the operational flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The monitoring process begins at step <b>410</b> by forming a first metallization layer having a defect-generating region with a predetermined pattern density, for example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref>. In step <b>420</b>, a second metallization layer containing a at least one defect-detecting region and at least one defect-dispersing region is formed on top of the first metallization layer, as depicted, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E-2I</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step <b>430</b>, the defect-detecting region is then tested or inspected for defects, for example optically or by measuring the electrical resistance between different points of the defect-detecting region. In step <b>440</b>, the number of defects identified in step <b>430</b> is correlated to the uniformity of the planarization process for the predetermined pattern density. The graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> depicts a possible relationship between the number of defects detected and the non-uniformity of the CMP process, where an increase in defect concentration correlates to an exponentially greater non-uniformity.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step <b>450</b>, the number of defects is compared to a predetermined number of acceptable defects to determine if the planarization process is within specification limits. The graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> depicts the number of defects for a given pattern density of an acceptable and an unacceptable CMP process. By comparing the number of defects identified in step <b>430</b> to the acceptable defect levels of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, it can be determined if the CMP process is within specification limits (i.e., defect levels of the test structure do not exceed a predetermined maximum value).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, it may be determined that, for a given CMP process, a test structure may produce an acceptable level of defects for each pattern density, graphically depicted as curve E of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. For example, a test structure with a pattern density A may produce a maximum number of defects B while remaining within specification limits. If the number of defects determined in step <b>430</b> for a test structure with a pattern density A is less than B, then the CMP process is within specification limits. If, however, the number of defects is greater than B, then the CMP process is outside the pre-determined specification limits.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>, several other embodiments of the present invention including alternate configurations of the defect-dispersing region and/or defect-detecting region are depicted. In these alternate embodiments, the features are as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref>, with the exception that the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> include multiple defect-dispersing regions and/or defect-detecting regions.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in other embodiments, the defect-dispersing region may include several smaller, non-contiguous regions. Further, the defect-dispersing region or regions may not fully surround the defect-detecting region. For example, the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A-3E</figref> includes two defect-dispersing subregions <b>620</b><i>a </i>and <b>620</b><i>b </i>surrounding a single defect-detecting region <b>610</b>. Each defect-dispersing region may have may be formed above the same defect-generating region, or separate defect-generating regions, which may or may not have similar pattern densities (not shown). Each defect-dispersing may be of the same approximate dimensions, as are defect-dispersing regions <b>620</b><i>a </i>and <b>620</b><i>b </i>of the depicted embodiments, or may be different dimensions with one defect-dispersing region being longer and/or wider than the other.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the defect-detecting region may further include several discrete defect-detecting subregions <b>710</b><i>a </i>and <b>710</b><i>b</i>. By varying the pattern density underneath defect-dispersing region <b>720</b>, defect-detecting-subregions <b>710</b><i>a </i>and <b>710</b><i>b </i>may independently test defect concentration resulting from different pattern densities. Further, defect-detecting-subregions <b>710</b><i>a </i>and <b>710</b><i>b </i>may include the same or different test patterns, in the same or different orientations.</p>
