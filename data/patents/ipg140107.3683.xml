<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Flammable liquids such as gasoline, oil, and alcohol can be stored in floating roof tanks. Floating roof tanks are usually installed for environmental or economical reasons to limit product loss and reduce the emission of volatile organic compounds. Additionally, floating roof tanks sometimes are used to store flammable liquids because fumes of such materials can pose extreme risks of fire and/or explosion. Floating roof tanks therefore may be used to reduce the exposed surface area and reduce the vapor space of the flammable liquids, thereby reducing the risk of fires and/or explosions.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Lightning and/or other electrical discharges at or near the floating roof tanks, however, pose a serious risk of fire and/or explosion if the discharge ignites the fumes of the flammable liquids. This risk is particularly high at or near the rim of the floating roof of floating roof tanks, as an air gap typically exists between the floating roof and the shell of the floating roof tank. In fact, rim seal fires are the most common type of fire in floating roof tanks, particularly external floating roof tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To mitigate the risk of rim seal fires, it is common to equip floating roof tanks with shunts around the rim of the floating roof. The shunts are spring loaded wiping contacts that engage the shell, thereby creating an electrical connection between the floating roof and the shell. The shell typically is connected to a grounding system, and therefore the floating roof can be grounded using shunts or other electrical connections between the floating roof and the shell. Thus, the threat of rim seal fires caused by electrical arcing or other electrical discharges between the floating roof and the shell can be reduced if the shunts and shells are maintained in working order.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The shunts, however, tend to wear out over time. Similarly, sludge and/or other materials can accumulate along the wall of the shell, preventing or degrading electrical connections between the shunts and the shell. As such, maintenance of floating roof tanks often includes inspection and/or repair of shunts, if the shunts are visible. Because shunts sometimes are submerged in the flammable liquids held by the floating roof tanks, such an inspection may be difficult if not impossible without first draining the floating roof tanks. Thus, data indicates that proper inspections of shunts and/or other floating roof tank structures may be properly performed as rarely as once every ten years. As such, these and other maintenance procedures may be inadequate for detecting degrading shunts and/or other structures, and therefore may fail to reduce the risk of rim seal fires.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure made herein is presented.</p>

Similarly, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can be configured to comply with ATEX Zone 1 requirements, if desired, to allow use of the monitoring device <b>102</b> within various distances of the floating roof tank <b>104</b>. It should be understood that the remote I/O device <b>116</b> and/or the monitoring device <b>102</b> can be built according to other requirements and/or guidelines. Thus, these embodiments should be understood as being illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As will be described in more detail herein, the remote I/O device <b>116</b> can be used to provide a remote connection point for input and output connections to and from the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, and to provide a remote connection point for input and output connections to and from the monitoring device <b>102</b>. Thus, the remote I/O device <b>116</b> can be used to route an intrinsically safe current from the monitoring device <b>102</b> to the floating roof tank <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the intrinsically safe current has a maximum amperage of about 0.410 Amps (410 milliAmps). In other embodiments, the intrinsically safe current has a maximum Amperage of about 500 milliamps, 1 Amp, more than 1 Amp, or less than 1 Amp. It should be understood that these embodiments are illustrative, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As will be explained in more detail herein, the intrinsically safe current is routed to the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, to the floating roof of the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, and from the floating roof into the wall or shell of the floating roof tank <b>104</b>. The intrinsically safe current can be routed from the shell to a ground bus bar or other grounded structure, from the grounded structure back to the remote I/O device <b>116</b>, and from the remote I/O device back to the monitoring device <b>102</b>. Thus, according to various embodiments a complete circuit referred to herein as a ground loop or monitoring loop can be created between and including the monitoring device <b>102</b> and the floating roof tank <b>104</b> via the remote I/O device <b>116</b>. As mentioned above, the remote I/O device <b>116</b> can be omitted or incorporated into the monitoring device <b>102</b>, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to various embodiments the routed current has known attributes, and therefore a resistance can be accurately measured at a suitable measurement location. In some implementations, the resistance is measured at the shell of the floating roof tank <b>104</b>. An expected resistance value can be known or can be calculated for the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, and the actual resistance measured at any time can be compared to the expected resistance value. The resistance at the measurement location (&#x201c;measured resistance&#x201d;) can be determined or received by the monitoring device <b>102</b>. Any difference between the measured resistance value and the expected resistance value can be compared to one or more threshold resistance values set, maintained, and/or determined by the monitoring device <b>102</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, a resistance deviation rate can be monitored and compared to a threshold resistance deviation rate set, maintained and/or determined by the monitoring device <b>102</b>. If a measured resistance value deviates or begins to diverge from an expected resistance value, the deviation and/or the rate at which the two values are diverging or deviating from one another can be compared to a threshold value and/or threshold rate. In some embodiments, the monitoring device <b>102</b> compares the measured resistance value to the expected resistance value, and determines a deviation and deviation rate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">More particularly, the monitoring device <b>102</b> and/or the remote I/O device <b>116</b> can be configured with a threshold resistance deviation value or a threshold resistance deviation rate. The threshold resistance deviation value can be a number of Ohms, or numbers of portions thereof, above some base resistance measure determined or set as the expected resistance value associated with the floating roof tank <b>104</b>. The base resistance measure can correspond to a historical or trend value associated with the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, a value determined at installation of the monitoring device <b>102</b> or at another time, and/or another value. It should be understood that the base resistance measure can vary among floating roof tanks <b>104</b>, and that therefore reference to any specific value set as a default threshold may be substituted or supplemented with a value determined for a particular floating roof tank <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The threshold resistance deviation value can be set by users, manufacturers, installers, and/or other authorized entities, or can be determined by the monitoring device <b>102</b> or other devices, based upon current and/or historical environmental, weather, and/or equipment conditions. For example, the threshold resistance deviation value may change over time due to degrading shunts on the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, buildup of sludge or other intervening materials between the shunts and the shell of the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, and the like. Similarly, the threshold resistance deviation value can be changed based upon weather and/or environmental conditions at a particular time, or activities occurring at the floating roof tank <b>104</b>. For example, if a thunderstorm occurs near the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, the threshold resistance deviation value may be reduced relative to the normal value of the threshold resistance deviation value, as the threat of a lightning discharge at or near the floating roof tank <b>104</b> may be elevated relative to a threat of lightning discharge under normal operating conditions. Similarly, during pumping of liquids into or out of the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, the threat may be deemed to be elevated. Thus, a threshold resistance deviation value may be reduced or otherwise modified such that remedial steps can more quickly be taken in the event that the measured resistance value begins to increase or otherwise change. It should be understood that these embodiments are illustrative, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the threshold resistance deviation value is set to 10 ohms above a base resistance value. In other embodiments, the threshold resistance deviation value is set to a value in a range of 1 to 10 Ohms above a base resistance value, a value in a range of 10 to 20 Ohms above a base resistance value, or various values below 1 Ohm above a base resistance value or above 20 Ohms over a base resistance value. The threshold resistance deviation value can be set to any value determined to be suitable by the manufacturers, installers, and/or maintenance, security, or engineering personnel, or determined by various devices or software including, but not limited to, the monitoring device <b>102</b>. Thus, it should be understood that the above-mentioned threshold resistance deviation values are illustrative, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The threshold resistance deviation rate also can be set by users, manufacturers, installers, and/or other authorized entities, and/or can be determined by the monitoring device <b>102</b> or other devices, based upon current or historical environmental, weather, and/or equipment conditions, as well as trends in measured resistance values. More particularly, in the event of an actual or predicted electrical storm, the value of the threshold resistance deviation rate may be changed with respect to the value of the threshold resistance deviation rate in other weather or environmental conditions. Similarly, the threshold resistance deviation rate can be modified based upon an elapsed time since maintenance of equipment associated with the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, as equipment associated with the floating roof tank <b>104</b> ages, during or before anticipated activity occurring at the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, and/or based upon other considerations. It should be understood that this embodiment is illustrative, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the threshold resistance deviation rate is set to a value of 1 Ohm per second. Thus, if the difference between the measured resistance value and the expected resistance value diverges from one another at a rate of 1 Ohm per second or faster, the threshold can be deemed to be satisfied irrespective of whether the threshold resistance deviation value is satisfied. In other embodiments, the threshold resistance deviation rate is set to a value in a range of 0.1 Ohms per millisecond to 1 Ohm per second, or various values below 0.1 Ohm per millisecond or above 1 Ohm per second. The threshold resistance deviation rate can be set to any value determined to be suitable by the manufacturers, installers, and/or maintenance, security, or engineering personnel, or determined by various devices or software including, but not limited to, the monitoring device <b>102</b>. Thus, it should be understood that the above-mentioned threshold resistance deviation rates are illustrative, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way. Additional aspects of the floating roof monitoring system <b>100</b>, as well as details of the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, will be described in additional detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be understood that in some embodiments, failure to meet or exceed a threshold value or threshold rate can trigger various actions. For example, if a difference between the measured resistance value and the expected resistance value differs by less than a particular threshold value, or if a rate at which the two values converge, actions may be triggered as well. In particular, such a convergence or a failure to meet or exceed a threshold value may indicate that the base resistance value is or was incorrectly determined, or that a short circuit has occurred somewhere along the monitoring loop. Thus, for example, the monitoring system <b>102</b> may determine such a situation if the base resistance value is 5 Ohms, and a measured resistance value is 3.5 Ohms. Similarly, such a situation may indicate that an intervening insulator or other substance exists between a floating roof and a shell of the floating roof tank <b>104</b>, thereby allowing measured resistance values to dip below expected resistance values as the floating roof travels up or down within the shell. These examples are illustrative, and should not be construed as being limiting, in any way, of situations in which failure to meet or exceed a threshold or other value may be used to trigger remedial action.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some situations, a measured resistance value may meet, exceed, or fail to meet or exceed a threshold resistance value at a first time, and at a second time, the measured resistance value could drop below the threshold value or meet or exceed the threshold value. In these and other embodiments, time and/or date information can be recorded for the measured resistance value and recorded in a memory or other suitable data storage device. A count of such occurrences can be maintained by the monitoring device <b>102</b>, and when a threshold number of such occurrences are counted, or when a threshold number of such occurrences within a defined time period are counted, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can determine that an alarm or report state exists and take an action as explained herein. In some embodiments, the monitoring system <b>102</b> determines that an alarm or report state exists based upon ten such occurrences within a twenty-four hour period, five such occurrences within a twenty-four hour period, ten such occurrences in a ten second period, and/or any other desired values. For the sake of clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one monitoring device <b>102</b>, one floating roof tank <b>104</b>, one network <b>110</b>, one remote system <b>112</b>, and one remote I/O device <b>116</b>. It should be understood, however, that some implementations of the floating roof monitoring system <b>100</b> may include multiple monitoring devices <b>102</b>, multiple floating roof tanks <b>104</b>, multiple networks <b>110</b>, multiple remote systems <b>112</b>, and/or multiple remote I/O devices <b>116</b>. Therefore, the illustrated embodiment should be understood as being exemplary, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, additional aspects of the floating roof monitoring system <b>100</b> will be described in detail. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a line diagram illustrating an example implementation of a floating roof monitoring system <b>100</b>, according to some embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the floating roof tank <b>104</b> can include a wall structure or shell (&#x201c;shell&#x201d;) <b>200</b> and a floating roof <b>202</b>. The shell <b>200</b> can contain a fluid such as gasoline, oil, and the like (&#x201c;fluid&#x201d;) <b>204</b>, and the floating roof <b>202</b> can be disposed on top of the fluid <b>204</b> to cover the fluid <b>204</b> from the elements, to help reduce evaporation of the fluid <b>204</b>, and for other purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The shell <b>200</b> can be electrically connected or coupled to a grounding bar <b>206</b>, which can be used to ground the floating roof tank <b>104</b> in an attempt to reduce vulnerability of the floating roof tank <b>104</b> to rim seal fires, to allow movement of an electrical charge from the floating roof tank <b>104</b> to the grounding bar <b>206</b>, and/or for other purposes. In some embodiments, the shell <b>200</b> is grounded via electrical connections between the shell <b>200</b> and the grounding bar <b>206</b>, and the floating roof <b>202</b> can be conductively connected to the shell <b>200</b> via one or more shunts, or the like. Because the functionality and structure of various types of shunts are known, the shunts are not illustrated or described herein in additional detail. Thus, although not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the shunts can be disposed about the perimeter of the floating roof <b>202</b> at the interface point <b>208</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, along with a foam band and/or other structures or devices. It should be understood that the floating roof tank <b>104</b> and/or the shell <b>200</b> can be considered to be inherently grounded because of the size of the floating roof tank <b>104</b> and/or the type of material the floating roof tank <b>104</b> rests on. As such, some embodiments of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein can omit the grounding bar <b>206</b> and instead rely upon the shell <b>200</b> or other structures of the floating roof tank <b>104</b> for grounding. As such, it should be understood that the illustrated embodiments are illustrative, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Over time, the shunts or other structures of the floating roof <b>202</b> and/or the shell <b>200</b> can break down, oxidize, and/or degrade. Thus, an electrical connection between the floating roof <b>202</b> and the shell <b>200</b> can be lost or degraded due to various conditions. According to embodiments of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein, the floating roof tank <b>104</b> is configured to allow monitoring of the electrical connection between the floating roof <b>202</b> and the shell <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the illustrated embodiment, an intrinsically safe current is routed from the monitoring device <b>102</b> to a monitoring reel <b>210</b> located at or near the shell <b>200</b>. According to various embodiments, the intrinsically safe current can be routed to the monitoring reel <b>210</b> via a cable or wire <b>212</b> originating at the monitoring device <b>102</b> or the remote I/O device <b>116</b>. The cable or wire <b>212</b> can be electrically connected to the monitoring reel <b>210</b> and/or a wire or cable located within the monitoring reel <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Similarly, the connections between the monitoring device <b>102</b> and the remote I/O device <b>116</b>, between the monitoring reel <b>210</b> and the floating roof <b>202</b>, between the floating roof tank <b>104</b> and the grounding bar <b>206</b>, and between the grounding bar <b>206</b> and the remote I/O device <b>116</b> or the monitoring device <b>102</b> can be provided by a cable or wire similar to the cable or wire <b>212</b>. According to some implementations, the cable or wire <b>212</b> is a stainless steel wire with an insulating plastic, ceramic, or other material coating. In some embodiments, a steel wire or cable coated with HYTREL or another suitable insulating material is used. According to various implementations, the size or diameter of the cable or wire <b>212</b> is selected based, at least partially, upon anticipated requirements for mechanical integrity of the cable, and not based upon electrical properties, though this is not necessarily the case. It should be understood that this embodiment is illustrative, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way. In particular, the cable or wire <b>212</b> and/or other cables or wires used in the various embodiments disclosed herein can be made from any suitable conductive material, and the cable or wire <b>212</b> and or other cables or wires used in the various embodiments of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein can be coated, insulated, and/or otherwise treated with any suitable insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the illustrated embodiment, the monitoring reel <b>210</b> is attached to the shell <b>200</b> via a mounting bracket <b>214</b> that is bolted, riveted, and/or otherwise attached to the shell <b>200</b>. Structures or devices other than the mounting bracket <b>214</b> can be used to locate the monitoring reel <b>210</b> at or near the shell <b>200</b>. According to various implementations of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein, the monitoring reel <b>210</b> is insulated or otherwise electrically isolated from the shell <b>200</b>. For example, an insulation pad <b>216</b> or other insulating materials or structures can be disposed between the monitoring reel <b>210</b> or the mounting bracket <b>214</b> and the shell <b>200</b>. Thus, it should be understood that the illustrated embodiment is illustrative, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The monitoring reel <b>210</b> can be spring loaded or otherwise configured such that a monitoring wire <b>218</b> is retractably disposed at the monitoring reel <b>210</b>. The monitoring wire <b>218</b> can be electrically connected to the monitoring reel <b>210</b> and/or the cable <b>212</b> such that the intrinsically safe current from the monitoring device <b>102</b> and/or the remote I/O device <b>116</b> can be provided to the monitoring wire <b>218</b>. The monitoring wire <b>218</b> can be connected to a mounting bracket <b>220</b> or other structures or devices of, on, or at the floating roof <b>202</b>. As explained above with reference to the cable or wire <b>212</b>, the monitoring wire <b>218</b> can be an insulated cable or wire made from any suitable materials, and the size or diameter of the monitoring wire <b>218</b> can be, but is not necessarily, selected based, at least partially, upon anticipated requirements for mechanical integrity of the monitoring wire <b>218</b> as opposed to merely being based upon required electrical properties, though this is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The mounting bracket <b>220</b> can be attached or connected to the floating roof <b>202</b> via various means. In some embodiments, the mounting bracket <b>220</b> is welded to the floating roof <b>202</b> before the floating roof <b>202</b> is disposed on the fluid <b>204</b> and/or when the floating roof tank <b>104</b> is empty or filled with non-flammable materials. In other embodiments, a hydraulic punch or other suitable device is used to form connection apertures in the floating roof <b>202</b> into or through which various structures may be passed or connected. In other embodiments, holes are drilled into or through the floating roof <b>202</b>. In yet other embodiments, conductive adhesives are used to attach the mounting bracket <b>220</b> to the floating roof <b>202</b>. It should be understood that in various implementations, paint or oxidation may be removed from the roof <b>202</b> to provide a metal-to-metal connection between the mounting bracket <b>220</b> and the floating roof <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As mentioned above, the intrinsically safe current can be routed to the shell <b>200</b> via various structures of the floating roof tank <b>104</b> including, but not limited to, shunts or other sliding contacts, wires or cables, and/or other structures or devices. The intrinsically safe current can be routed into the grounding bar <b>206</b> or another earthing or grounding device via a ground wire <b>222</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, the intrinsically safe current can be routed from the shell <b>200</b> to the grounding bar <b>206</b> via an attachment mechanism or attachment point <b>224</b> corresponding to a conductive coupling or connection between the shell <b>200</b> and the grounding bar <b>206</b>. It should be understood that these embodiments are illustrative, as the intrinsically safe current can be routed into the grounding bar <b>206</b> via any suitable structures and/or devices.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The grounding bar <b>206</b> can be conductively coupled or connected to the remote I/O device <b>116</b> and/or the monitoring device <b>102</b> via a return path <b>226</b>. Thus, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can send an intrinsically safe current to the floating roof tank <b>104</b> and monitor the current via the return path <b>226</b>. It therefore can be appreciated that the floating roof monitoring system <b>100</b> can be used to create a monitoring loop or ground loop that includes the monitoring device <b>102</b> and the floating roof tank <b>104</b>. According to various embodiments, the monitoring reel <b>210</b>, the cable or wire <b>212</b>, and the monitoring wire <b>218</b> are insulated from the shell <b>200</b>. As such, various embodiments of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein ensure that the intrinsically safe current is routed to the shell <b>200</b> via the floating roof <b>202</b>, and not via the monitoring reel <b>210</b>, the cable or wire <b>212</b>, and/or the monitoring wire <b>218</b>. Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it should be understood that the floating roof monitoring system <b>100</b> can include one or more network connections and/or other devices or connections used to report operating state information to one or more devices, networks, and/or other entities. An illustrative method for using the floating roof monitoring system <b>100</b> to monitor the floating roof tank <b>104</b> will be described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, aspects of a method <b>300</b> for monitoring a floating roof tank <b>104</b> will be described in detail. It should be understood that the operations of the method <b>300</b> are not necessarily presented in any particular order and that performance of some or all of the operations in an alternative order(s) is possible and is contemplated. The operations have been presented in the demonstrated order for ease of description and illustration. Operations may be added, omitted, and/or performed simultaneously, without departing from the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It also should be understood that the illustrated method <b>300</b> may be ended after each operation and may not be performed to completion of every operation. Some or all operations of the methods disclosed herein, and/or substantially equivalent operations, can be performed by execution of computer-readable instructions included on a computer-storage media, as defined herein, and/or via execution of logic via various hardware incorporated into one or more logic circuits or other devices. The term &#x201c;computer-readable instructions,&#x201d; and variants thereof, as used in the description and claims, is used expansively herein to include routines, applications, application modules, program modules, programs, components, data structures, algorithms, and the like. Computer-readable instructions can be implemented on various system configurations, including single-processor or multiprocessor systems, minicomputers, mainframe computers, personal computers, hand-held computing devices, microprocessor-based, programmable consumer electronics, combinations thereof, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, it should be appreciated that the logical operations described herein are implemented (1) as a sequence of computer implemented acts or program modules running on a computing system and/or (2) as interconnected machine logic circuits or circuit modules within a computing system or another device. The implementation is a matter of choice dependent on the performance and other requirements of the computing system or other device. Accordingly, the logical operations described herein are referred to variously as states, operations, structural devices, acts, or modules. These operations, structural devices, acts, and modules may be implemented in software, in firmware, in special purpose digital logic, in special purpose analog logic or other hardware, and/or in any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For purposes of illustrating and describing the concepts of the present disclosure, the method <b>300</b> is described as being performed by the monitoring device <b>102</b>. As noted above, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can include and/or can be configured to execute one or more hardware or software modules including, but not limited to, a monitoring module <b>106</b> and/or a reporting module <b>108</b>. Other devices can provide the functionality described herein via inclusion of hardware modules and/or execution of one or more software modules instead of, or in addition to, the monitoring device <b>102</b>. Thus, the illustrated embodiments should be understood as being illustrative, and not limiting in any way of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The method <b>300</b> begins at operation <b>302</b>, wherein the monitoring device <b>102</b> generates a current. According to some embodiments, the monitoring device <b>102</b> generates an intrinsically safe current. An intrinsically safe current is a current that does not pose a risk of fire or explosion in the event of a short circuit or other breakdown at or near flammable or explosive materials. As explained above, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can generate a current for testing a monitoring loop or ground loop that includes the monitoring device <b>102</b> and a floating roof tank <b>104</b>. Thus, the current generated at operation <b>302</b> can be generated for the monitoring loop or ground loop, and therefore can be used as a test current routed into and through the monitoring loop or ground loop.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">From operation <b>302</b>, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to operation <b>304</b>, wherein the monitoring device <b>102</b> monitors a resistance value associated with the monitoring loop or ground loop. As explained above, the resistance value monitored by the monitoring device <b>102</b> can correspond to a resistance between a floating roof <b>202</b> and a shell <b>200</b> of the floating roof tank <b>104</b>. Thus, the resistance value can correspond to a resistance measured at or near the interface point <b>208</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Additionally, or alternatively, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can measure a divergence between the measured resistance value and a base or expected resistance value. Thus, the resistance measured at operation <b>304</b> can correspond to a value such as a number of Ohms or portions thereof, and/or a rate of divergence such as, for example, a number of Ohms per a measure of time. In some embodiments, the divergence rate is calculated in units of Ohms per second or other units.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">From operation <b>304</b>, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to operation <b>306</b>, wherein the monitoring device <b>102</b> compares a measure resistance value to an expected or base resistance value. Additionally, or alternatively, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can track measured resistance values. Thus, at operation <b>306</b>, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can calculate a divergence rate between the measured resistance value(s) and an expected or base resistance value. Thus, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can be configured to recognize a trending measured resistance value, wherein the trend indicates that the measured resistance value moves away or toward the expected or base resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">From operation <b>306</b>, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to operation <b>308</b>, wherein the monitoring device <b>102</b> determines if one or more of the measured resistance value and/or the calculated divergence value meets or exceeds and/or fails to meet or exceed one or more threshold values. Thus, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can compare a difference between the measured resistance value and the expected or base resistance value, and compare the difference to a threshold value. Similarly, a calculated divergence rate can be compared to a threshold value for the divergence rate, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If the monitoring device <b>102</b> determines at operation <b>308</b> that a threshold is not met, exceeds, or failed to be met or exceeded, the method <b>300</b> returns to operation <b>304</b>, wherein the monitoring device <b>102</b> can again monitor a resistance value associated with the monitoring loop or the ground loop. Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the measured resistance value and/or the calculated divergence rate can be stored in a data storage device or other structure for use by the monitoring device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">If the monitoring device <b>102</b> determines, at operation <b>308</b>, that a threshold is met, exceeded, or failed to be met or exceeded, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to operation <b>310</b>. At operation <b>310</b>, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can generate a remedial action. In some embodiments, the remedial action can include generating the alarm <b>114</b> and/or reporting an operation state or other information to one or more devices or entities. In some embodiments, one or more visual, sound, or tactile indicators associated with the monitoring device <b>102</b> can be activated or modified to inform one or more entities of the detected condition. In one embodiment, for example, a green LED is activated or maintained as activated at the monitoring device <b>102</b> if the monitoring device <b>102</b> determines at operation <b>308</b> that a threshold is not met. If the monitoring device <b>102</b> determines, at operation <b>308</b>, that the threshold is met, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can deactivate the green LED and activate one or more red LEDs. It should be understood that this embodiment is illustrative, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In yet other embodiments, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can include various relays and/or other devices that can be triggered via determination at operation <b>308</b> that a threshold value is met. Thus, for example, an interlock or pump associated with the floating roof tank <b>104</b> can be activated or deactivated by the monitoring device <b>102</b> in response to determining that a threshold value is met. In yet other embodiments, the monitoring device <b>102</b> can generate messages and/or can be used to trigger message generation such as wired and/or wireless data communications. These and other actions can be triggered by the monitoring device <b>102</b>. Thus, it should be understood that the monitoring device <b>102</b> can be used to trigger various types of actions, and that these actions can be triggered by analog and/or digital logic. From operation <b>310</b>, the method <b>300</b> can return to operation <b>304</b>. The method <b>300</b> can be repeated continuously and/or terminated at any time.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although not described herein in detail, it should be understood that the monitoring device <b>102</b> can be configured to monitor more than one floating roof tank <b>104</b>.

In some embodiments, for example, the monitoring device <b>102</b> pulses current to one or more monitored floating roof tanks <b>104</b>, and analyzes each resistance value generated via the pulsed current. The monitoring device <b>102</b> can pulse currents alternatively to two or more floating roof tanks <b>104</b>, and thereby monitor two or more floating roof tanks <b>104</b>. It should be understood that the monitoring device <b>102</b> or other devices can make use of time, code, or frequency division technologies to enable monitoring of two or more floating roof tanks <b>104</b>, if desired.</p>
