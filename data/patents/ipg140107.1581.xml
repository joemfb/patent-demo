<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A land-grid array die package socket is configured for low- or zero insertion-force assembly with a land-grid array die package. For zero insertion-force assembly, a motion plate applies a force on a land-grid array contact that causes a contact tip to move into protective cover while the die package is inserted into the socket. After zero insertion-force assembly, the motion plate applies a force on the land-grid array contact that causes the contact tip to deflect in a positive-Z direction until a useful contact is made at the contact tip with a land-grid array pad.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Land-grid array (LGA) sockets and LGA die packages are configured in assemblies that allow a low or a zero insertion-force (ZIF) methods of coupling the sockets to the chip packages. In an embodiment, a translational motion is achieved on a portion of the socket that causes positive-Z displacement of at least a portion of the LGA contact such that it achieves a sufficient normal force on the LGA pad that is on the LGA chip package. Before insertion of the LGA chip package, the LGA contact tip is protected from incidental damage such as bent contacts. The contact tip is deflected in a negative-Z displacement into protective cover, followed by ZIF insertion of the LGA chip package.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective elevation of an LGA contact <b>800</b> used in a translational land-grid array connector according to an example embodiment. The LGA contact <b>800</b> is manufactured from a metal strip by stamping and bending according to an embodiment. The LGA contact <b>800</b> may be made from copper or a copper alloy. Other metals may be used for the LGA contact <b>800</b>. The LGA contact <b>800</b> includes three main portions including a carrier attach <b>850</b>, a contact paddle <b>852</b>, and a contact body <b>854</b>. Additionally, the LGA contact <b>800</b> has a contact tip at a first end <b>801</b> and a contact paddle <b>852</b> at a second end <b>802</b>. Other features are delineated below. The contact paddle <b>852</b> may also be referred to as a lead portion as it makes contact with an electrical bump. The contact paddle is also compliantly integral to the plate <b>856</b> portion of the carrier attach <b>850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The carrier attach <b>850</b> occupies a major dimension in the Z-direction, a medium dimension in the X-direction, and a minimum dimension <b>803</b><i>y </i>in the Y-direction. It can be seen, however, that the contact tip <b>801</b> has a medium dimension that is similar to the minimum dimension <b>803</b> since the ribbon shape may be narrowed according to useful embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The carrier attach <b>850</b> generally has a carrier-attach surface <b>851</b> that lies in an X-Z plane as depicted. The carrier attach <b>850</b> has a socket-body plate <b>856</b> that is used to secure the LGA contact <b>800</b> to a socket body such as the socket body <b>110</b> depicted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The contact paddle <b>852</b> has been bent out of the plane of the carrier attach <b>850</b> and it occupies a minimum dimension <b>803</b><i>z </i>in the Z-direction. The contact paddle is connected to- and integral with the carrier attach <b>850</b>. The contact paddle <b>852</b> generally has a contact-paddle surface <b>853</b> that lies in an X-Y plane. In an embodiment, the contact paddle <b>852</b> is assembled to a solder ball such as the solder ball <b>244</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>that is in electrical contact with the motherboard <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The contact body <b>854</b> has been bent out of the plane of the carrier attach <b>850</b> and has a ribbon shape with several other bends that are employed for achieving useful contact with an LGA pad on an LGA-die package such as the LGA die package <b>114</b>. The contact body <b>854</b> has a primary bend <b>858</b> where it connects to and is integral with the carrier attach <b>850</b>. The contact body <b>856</b> begins at the primary bend <b>858</b> with a base surface <b>855</b> that occupies a Y-Z plane. The &#x201c;ribbon shape&#x201d; of the contact body <b>854</b> may be understood to be a structure that has a major dimension, a medium dimension, and a minimum dimension <b>803</b> where the major dimension is several times greater than that of the medium dimension. For the contact body <b>854</b>, the major dimension begins at the base surface <b>855</b> and ends at the contact tip <b>801</b>. The medium dimension is seen in the Y-direction, and the minimum dimension <b>803</b> is indicated near the contact tip <b>801</b> but it occupies the length of the major dimension. The minimum dimension <b>803</b> can be seen along the length of the LGA contact body <b>854</b>, but the medium dimension near the contact tip <b>801</b> has been tapered. The contact body <b>854</b> may also be referred to as a tine <b>854</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">During LGA-contact operation, the LGA contact <b>800</b> primarily pivots at a primary pivot area <b>804</b> in the contact body <b>854</b>. To make contact of the contact tip <b>801</b> with a pad of an LGA, a first displacement input <b>860</b> is applied at a first-displacement surface <b>861</b> that is adjacent the contact tip <b>801</b> to cause a positive-Z displacement of the contact tip <b>801</b>. The first-displacement surface <b>861</b> is substantially planar, but it may be otherwise depending upon a given useful application. During ZIF mounting of an LGA-die package, the contact body <b>854</b> receives a pre-ZIF displacement input <b>862</b> at a secondary pivot area <b>805</b> that includes a curvilinear surface <b>859</b> according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Other shapes and structures are seen in the contact body <b>854</b> including a U-bend <b>864</b> that adds useful overall flexibility thereto as well as compact size.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a detail of translational land-grid array contacts that are arrayed in a cam plate according to an example embodiment. A plurality of LGA contacts are depicted in an LGA contact array that has both an X dimension <b>917</b><i>x </i>and a Y dimension <b>917</b><i>y</i>. One LGA contact <b>954</b> is depicted along with portions of six other LGA contacts. The LGA contact that is labeled is shown in part including being labeled at a carrier attach <b>950</b> and a contact body <b>954</b>. The carrier attach <b>950</b> has a carrier-attach surface <b>951</b> that lies in an X-Z plane as depicted. The contact body <b>954</b> includes a contact tip <b>901</b> and it is pitched away from the carrier attach <b>950</b>. The contact body <b>954</b> also includes a first-displacement surface <b>961</b> that is adjacent the contact tip <b>901</b> to facilitate both negative- and positive-Z displacement of the contact tip <b>901</b> depending upon the method being used. Layout of the LGA contacts is done in a 1 mm diagonal pitch <b>906</b> and an X-direction spacing <b>907</b> of 1.41 mm. The pitch and the spacing may be driven by actual translation embodiment achieved by rotating the cam screw or other methods of translating the motion plate. As depicted, seven contact tips are configured with one LGA contact in the middle of the pattern. In an embodiment, a square-pitch array is used. In an embodiment, an hex-pitch array is used.</p>

The LGA contact has been stitched though a contact slot <b>1030</b> in the cam plate <b>1016</b> and further into the socket body <b>1010</b>. In an embodiment, each individual contact slot <b>1030</b> can be tailored in width such that the normal force for each LGA contact tip may be customized for a given application. In an embodiment, the contact slot is widened as contact slot <b>1030</b><i>w </i>to allow for a lower normal force than a contact slot otherwise not widened. In an embodiment, the contact slot is narrowed as contact slot <b>1030</b><i>n </i>to allow for a higher normal force than a contact slot otherwise not narrowed.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The lead portion <b>1052</b> and the LGA contact body <b>1054</b> are illustrated. The LGA contact body <b>1054</b> includes a primary pivot area <b>1004</b> and a secondary pivot area <b>1005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Also, the contact paddle <b>1052</b> is seen, but the carrier attach has been removed for illustrative clarity. The socket body <b>1010</b> is depicted into which the carrier-attach has been inserted. The socket body <b>1010</b> has an urging seat <b>1066</b> that generally is useful for clearance of the LGA contact body <b>1054</b> at the secondary pivot area <b>1005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The LGA contact body <b>1054</b> is depicted in repose (a natural position) such that it is in a minimal-stress state and the contact tip <b>1001</b> is slightly above a top surface <b>1068</b> of the motion plate <b>1016</b>. The motion plate <b>1016</b> also has an urging wall <b>1070</b> that engages the LGA contact body <b>1054</b> during an operation to lower the Z-height of the contact tip <b>1001</b>. Similarly, the cam plate <b>1016</b> has an urging shoulder <b>1072</b> that is part of a structure that engages the LGA contact body <b>1054</b> by using a first displacement input that is applied at a first-displacement surface <b>1061</b> that is adjacent the contact tip <b>1001</b> to cause a positive-Z displacement of the contact tip <b>1001</b>. The top surface <b>1068</b> is also referred to as an array prominence such that each contact slot (e.g. contact slot <b>130</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>) is found within a plurality of array prominences each of which defines a boundary between two adjacent rows of LGA contact slots. As such, the contact tip <b>1001</b> is allowed to be deflected below the array prominence <b>1068</b>.</p>

The enumerated LGA contact body <b>1054</b> exhibits a lower Z-height at the contact tip <b>1001</b> because the cam plate <b>1016</b> has shifted left as indicated by the directional arrow. The distance <b>1074</b> of the shift is sufficient such that the urging wall <b>1070</b> has engaged the LGA contact body <b>1054</b> at the secondary pivot area <b>1005</b>. The LGA contact body <b>1054</b> has hinged by torsion at the primary pivot area <b>1004</b> and the contact tip <b>1001</b> has moved in the negative-Z direction such that it is in protective cover below the top surface <b>1068</b> of the cam plate <b>1016</b>.</p>

During a ZIF operation, such as the zero-insertion-force assembly of the LGA-die package <b>400</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the contact tip <b>1001</b> is lowered into protective cover below the top surface <b>1068</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the die package <b>414</b> is being inserted onto the LGA-contact array <b>117</b> with &#x201c;zero insertion force&#x201d; as the contact tips have been retracted below cover of the motion plate <b>116</b>. Similarly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>c</i>, an LGA-die package <b>1014</b> is matched to the footprint on the cam plate <b>1016</b> and the plurality of LGA contacts are first configured into a negative-Z displacement into protective cover below prominences (top surfaces <b>1068</b>) on the surface of the cam plate <b>1016</b>. The LGA-die package <b>1014</b> supports a bare die <b>1012</b> and the LGA-die package <b>1014</b> includes a primary side <b>1014</b><i>p</i>, which supports the bare die <b>1012</b>, and a secondary side <b>1014</b><i>s</i>, which deploys an LGA. Four LGA pads <b>1076</b> are depicted in phantom lines upon the secondary side <b>1014</b><i>s</i>. The number of LGA pads <b>1076</b> is depicted as four for simplicity, but in an embodiment the number may be on the order of one thousand such as total of about 960 to match a given number of perforations in a socket body as well as an equal number of LGA contacts that have been stitched into the socket body <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It can be seen that by lowering the Z-height of each contact tip <b>1001</b>, the likelihood of bending any given contact tip <b>1001</b> has been reduced. By the same token, because the contact tips <b>1001</b> are protected, ZIF assembly of a die package to a motion plate is more standardized with a reduced likelihood of contact tips being exposed to damage by each insertion and extraction of an LGA die package <b>1014</b> onto a socket such as the cam plate <b>1016</b> and the socket body <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>d </i>is a side cut-away elevation of the array of land-grid array contacts depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>c </i>after further activity according to an example embodiment. After the LGA-die package <b>1014</b> has been seated upon or near the top surface <b>1068</b> of the cam plate <b>1015</b>, the cam plate <b>1016</b> may be shifted to the right by a distance <b>1078</b> such that the tip <b>1001</b> of the LGA contact body <b>1054</b> has engaged the LGA pad <b>1076</b> with a normal force that is sufficient to operate the bare die <b>1012</b> under useful field conditions of power and signal transmission. A transfer function has accomplished lifting of the contact tip <b>1001</b> by converting a lateral-motion force into a vertical-motion force. For example, a lateral displacement of 0.1 mm may achieve a vertical load of about 5 gf. In another example, a lateral displacement of about 0.25 mm may achieve a vertical load of about 15 gf. In an embodiment, the normal force is in a range from 0.5 gram force (gf) to 20 gf for each contact tip. In an embodiment, the normal force is 15 gf.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As a consequence of the shifting cam plate <b>1016</b>, a lateral-displacement (X-direction) input has resulted in a vertical-load (Y-direction) output to the contact tip <b>1001</b> and the resulting normal force on the LGA pad <b>1076</b>. The overall package illustrated is static including the contact paddle <b>1052</b> and the LGA die package <b>1014</b>. A normal force is therefore generated in an embodiment by rotation of a rigid body such as a cam screw although other mechanical contrivances may be used to achieve lateral motion of the motion plate <b>1016</b>. The LGA die package <b>1014</b> may have incidental miniscule amounts of bowing in the Z-direction, but it is countered by the primary stiffener and optionally from a secondary stiffener (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>e</i>). The positive Z displacement contact also minimizes overdeflection shorting risk with the assembly as the contacts are pushed away from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It may now be understood that the LGA die package socket <b>1000</b> is a translational LGA die-package socket, but other methods of achieving a useful positive-Z elevation of the contact tip <b>1001</b> may be done to obtain a sufficient normal force with the LGA pads <b>1076</b>. For example, a worm drive may be used in the place of a cam to obtain translational motion. In an embodiment, the LGA contacts are in maximum torsional stress when in protective cover where the motion plate has an urging shoulder that is on the upper surface of the contact body. The motion plate may be lifted instead of laterally shifted and the contact tip allowed to free-flex toward the LGA pad. In an embodiment, the LGA plate urging shoulder is similarly situated as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>, but a lifting motion of the LGA plate is used such that the urging shoulder moves vertically to drive the contact tip into the LGA pad. It may now be seen that a combination of lifting and shifting the motion plate may be done to lift the contact tip into the LGA pad.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The LGA-die socket <b>1000</b> is also depicted mounted on a board <b>1034</b> such as a motherboard. Mounting is accomplished by seating the contact paddle <b>1052</b> onto a bump <b>1044</b> such as a solder ball <b>1044</b>.</p>

In an embodiment, the LGA-die package <b>1014</b> is thinner as depicted here, compared to the LGA-die package <b>1014</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>d</i>. In an embodiment, the LGA die package has a nominal substrate Z-height in a range from 0.8 mm to 1.4 mm. In an embodiment, an 8-layer LGA die package <b>1014</b> is used with a nominal substrate Z-height to 1.077 mm. In an embodiment, a 10-layer LGA die package <b>1014</b> is used with a nominal substrate Z-height to 1.167 mm. In an embodiment, a 10-layer LGA die package <b>1014</b> is used with a nominal substrate Z-height to 0.45 mm. Stiffness of the LGA die package <b>1014</b> may be in a range from 1 N (Newton)/mm to 6 N/mm. In an embodiment, the LGA die package <b>1014</b> is 2.33 N/mm.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Where the socket body <b>1010</b> and the cam plate <b>1016</b> have standardized dimensions, different thicknesses of LGA-die packages are accommodated by these embodiments. For example, the cam plate <b>1016</b> is moved even farther such that the LGA contact body <b>1052</b> moves the contact tip <b>1001</b> even higher in a positive-Z displacement such that the LGA pad <b>1076</b> of a thinner LGA-die package <b>1014</b> is contacted with sufficient normal force by the contact tip <b>1001</b> that useful field conditions of power and signal management transmission is achieved. In this embodiment, the cam plate <b>1072</b> has been shifted sufficiently to the right that both the urging shoulder <b>1072</b> and the clearance <b>1066</b> have engaged the contact body <b>1054</b> to drive the contact tip <b>1001</b> into a sufficient positive-Z height to engage the LGA pad <b>1076</b>. In this embodiment, both the primary pivot area <b>1004</b> and the secondary pivot area <b>1005</b> experience torsional deflections.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It may now be appreciated that a first LGA-die package of a first thickness may be ZIF assembled to an LGA-die package socket embodiment, followed by field use or testing, and further followed by inserting a second LGA-die package of a second thickness that is different from the first thickness. This embodiment may be useful for upgrading an LGA-die package such as a newer processor that can be used with the existing electronic system. It may now also be understood that two LGA-die packages may be inserted seriatim into an LGA-die package socket embodiment where the first and the second LGA-die packages are the same thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">It may now be appreciated that the LGA-die package <b>1014</b> may be supported from below solely by the array of LGA contacts at the contact tips.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A secondary stiffener <b>1021</b> complements the primary stiffener <b>1020</b> and a heat slug <b>1023</b> is used both for heat management of the bare die <b>1012</b> as well as to facilitate stiffening the LGA-die package <b>1014</b> according to an embodiment.</p>

The motion plate <b>1516</b> has been translated to the left such that the urging shoulders <b>1572</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>a</i>) have engaged the LGA contacts <b>1554</b> and a positive-Z displacement has been achieved on the LGA contact tips <b>1501</b>. As depicted, the LGA contact tips <b>1501</b> have engaged a plurality of LGA pads <b>1576</b> that are part of an LGA die package <b>1514</b>. The contact tips <b>1501</b> engage the LGA pads <b>1576</b> with a normal force that is sufficient to operate the bare die <b>1512</b> under useful field conditions of power and signal transmission. A transfer function has accomplished lifting of the contact tip <b>1501</b> by converting a lateral-motion force into a vertical-motion force. For example, a lateral displacement of 0.1 mm may achieve a vertical load of about 5 gf. In another example, a lateral displacement of about 0.25 mm may achieve a vertical load of about 15 gf. In an embodiment, the normal force is in a range from 0.5 gf to 20 gf for each contact tip. In an embodiment, the normal force is 15 gf.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As a consequence of the shifting motion plate <b>1516</b>, a lateral-displacement (X-direction) input has resulted in a vertical-load (Y-direction) output to the contact tip <b>1501</b> and the resulting normal force on the LGA pad <b>1576</b>. The overall package illustrated is static including the contact paddle <b>1552</b> and the LGA die package <b>1514</b>. A normal force is therefore generated in an embodiment by rotation of a rigid body such as a cam screw although other mechanical contrivances may be used to achieve lateral motion of the motion plate <b>1516</b>. The LGA die package <b>1514</b> may have incidental miniscule amounts of bowing in the Z-direction, but it is countered by a primary stiffener and optionally from a secondary stiffener (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>e</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">It may now be understood that the LGA die package socket <b>1500</b> is a translational LGA die-package socket, but other methods of achieving a useful positive-Z elevation of the contact tip <b>1001</b> may be done to obtain a sufficient normal force with the LGA pads <b>1576</b>. For example, a worm drive may be used in the place of a cam to obtain translational motion. In an embodiment, the LGA contacts are in maximum torsional stress when in protective cover where the motion plate has an urging shoulder that is on the upper surface of the contact body. The motion plate may be lifted instead of laterally shifted and the contact tip allowed to free-flex toward the LGA pad. In an embodiment, the LGA plate urging shoulder is similarly situated as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>, but a lifting motion of the LGA plate is used such that the urging shoulder moves vertically to drive the contact tip into the LGA pad. It may now be seen that a combination of lifting and shifting the motion plate may be done to lift the contact tip into the LGA pad.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The LGA-die socket <b>1500</b> is also depicted mounted on a board <b>1534</b> such as a motherboard. Mounting is accomplished by seating the contact paddle <b>1552</b> onto a bump <b>1544</b> such as a solder ball <b>1544</b>.</p>
