<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present invention relate to the fields of communications, in particular, to methods and apparatuses associated with presence and/or capability based telephony.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Advances in integrated circuit, processor, telecommunication, networking and other related technologies have led to the proliferation of a wide variety of communication devices having a wide range of communication capabilities. Today, it is not uncommon for conference room and/or office communication devices to be capable of video conferencing, office desk sets to be capable of wideband Voice Over IP (VOIP) telephony, and mobile communication devices to be capable of cellular communication like GSM, 3G and/or wireless communication like WiFi (802.11x) and WiMax. And yet, it is still not uncommon for a user to employ a traditional (cordless) handset, when a user is home. Thus, today, a user typically has at least two options in initiating a communication session with another user, the other user's mobile communication handset, and the communication device located at the current venue the user is located, which may be the user's office, home, and so forth. However, under the prior art, the initiating user typically has no information as to the current presence and capability of the other user. As a result, communication often may not be conducted over the most optimal or capable devices.</p>

For example, as will be described in more detail below, in various embodiments, the present invention may be practiced without identification devices <b>101</b> and/or server <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in various embodiments, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> are equipped to detect the presence and/or determine the capabilities of the subscribers, and provide the detected presence and/or determined capability data to other subscribers, to enable the other subscribers to initiate communications with the subscribers, based at least in part on the current presence and/or capabilities of the subscribers, as earlier described.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In various embodiments, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> are equipped to detect presence of subscribers through detection, receipt of identifications of the subscribers and/or identifications of devices known to be associated with the subscribers. In various embodiments, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> receive the identifications of the subscribers from identification devices <b>101</b>. Examples of identification devices include but are not limited RFIDs, magnetic cards, and so forth. In other words, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may be equipped to read a RFID, a magnetic card, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other embodiments, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> are alternatively or additionally equipped to detect presence of subscribers through detection, receipt of identifications of the subscribers and/or the mobile communications devices <b>102</b> known to be associated with the subscribers, through mobile communication devices <b>102</b>. Detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may be pre-provided with the associated communication devices of the subscribers, or may be equipped to dynamically retrieve the information from one or more communication servers (not shown). Except for the incorporated teachings of the present invention, mobile communication devices <b>102</b> may be any mobile communication devices known in the art, including but not limited to mobile communication devices equipped for CDMA, GSM, GPRS, 3G, WiFi and/or WiMax communication.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In various embodiments, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may determine the current capabilities of the various subscribers by inferring the current capabilities of the various subscribers based on their current presence, i.e. whether the subscribers are located in a public venue, in the office or at home. For example, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may infer the communication capabilities of the subscribers to be cellular when the subscriber's presence is unknown or in a public venue, VOIP when the subscribers are in the office, and traditional POTS when the subscribers are at home. Detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may be pre-provided with the communication capabilities of the subscribers at the various venues, or dynamically retrieve the information from one or more communication servers (not shown). (POTS=Plain Old Telephone Service.)</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In various embodiments, e.g. embodiments where detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> receive the identifications of the subscribers from the mobile communication devices <b>102</b>, detectors may receive the current communication capabilities of the subscribers from the mobile communication devices <b>102</b> instead.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various embodiments, communications between detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> and identification devices <b>103</b> and/or mobile communication devices <b>102</b> may be conducted over a WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network), in accordance with an appropriate communicate protocol, such as Bluetooth&#x2122;. The communications may be performed in accordance with either a pull or push model. That is, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may be equipped to transmit discovery packets from time to time to enable mobile communication devices <b>102</b> entering their domains to discern their presence, and provide the identification and/or capability information in response to the requests of detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> (pull model). In other embodiments, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may be equipped to respond to the discovery packets of the mobile communication devices <b>102</b> and accept the identification and/or capability information transmitted by mobile communication devices <b>102</b> on detection of being proximally situated with detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> (push model).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In various embodiments, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> are equipped to distribute the collected presence and/or capability data collected for the various subscribers. Detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may distribute the collected data directly to the subscribers (more specifically, communication devices associated with the subscribers) or indirectly through other detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> and/or server <b>132</b>. In various embodiments, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may alternatively or additionally distribute the collected data to communication service providers (not shown), e.g. providers of cellular and/or conventional telephone services.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may report the collected data to the subscribers, other detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b>, server <b>132</b>, or communication service providers in accordance with a push and/or pull model. For the push model, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may report the collected data to the applicable subscriber, other detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b>, server <b>132</b>, or communication service providers in real time, as the data are collected, or in batch, periodically, for a group of subscribers at a time. For the pull model, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may report the collected data to the subscribers, other detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b>, server <b>132</b> or communication service providers in response to the periodic polling by the individual subscriber, server <b>132</b> and communication provider.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Likewise, for the embodiments, where the collected data are distributed to other detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> through server <b>132</b>, the distribution from server <b>132</b> to the other detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may be through a push and/or pull model.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Communication among the detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b>, between the detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> and the subscriber devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> and <b>112</b>-<b>116</b>, server <b>132</b> and communication service providers, and between the subscriber devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> and <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> and server <b>132</b> may be over a Wide Area Network (WAN), in accordance with any one of a number of communication protocols, such as TCP/IP (TCP/IP=Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.). Communications among the detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b>, between the detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> and the subscriber devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> and <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> may be peer-to-peer connections.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As a result, with the presence and/or capability data of various subscribers of interest available at either the mobile communication devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b>, handsets <b>112</b>-<b>116</b>, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b>, server <b>132</b> and/or communication service providers, a user of a selected one of mobile communication devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> and handsets <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> may initiate a communication session with another subscriber, based at least in part on the current presence and/or capability of the other subscriber, as desired, with either the selected one of mobile communication devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> or the communication service provider automatically resolving the appropriate target communication device for the communication session, to be described more fully below. In various embodiments, the mobile communication devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> or the communication service provider may allow the user to override its selection of the target communication device of the other subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Except for the teachings incorporated, and the manner they are employed, mobile communication devices <b>104</b> and handsets <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> may be any one of these devices known in the art. Similarly, except for the manner they are employed to practice the present invention, PSTN <b>152</b>, Internet <b>154</b> and Wireless Network <b>156</b> represent a broad range of these elements known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While for ease of understanding, only a handful of mobile communication devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> and handsets <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> are illustrated, the present invention is not so limited and may be practiced with any number of mobile communication devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> and handsets <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> subject only the communication network and service providers' capacity. Similarly, while only one server <b>132</b> is illustrated, when employed, server <b>132</b> may be one or more virtual and/or physical servers. The plurality of virtual servers may be instantiated on one or more single or multiple core, and/or single or multiple processors computing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, in various embodiments, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may be integrated with various appliances. For example, detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> may be integrated with a wireless networking access point. Additionally, detector <b>122</b> (at home) may be integrated with a set-top box, a base station of a cordless phone, a media control center (such as a desktop equipped with MS' Media Edition); detector <b>124</b> (at office) may be integrated with a desktop handset, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a flow chart view of selected operations performed by a detector <b>122</b>/<b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with various embodiments. As illustrated, for the embodiments, the operation may begin at block <b>202</b> where a detector may detect for the presence of an identification and/or mobile communication device. As described earlier, in various embodiments, the detector may detect the presence of an identification device by sensing and reading the identification device. For the detection of a mobile communication device, the detector may detect its by periodically sending out discovery packets and detecting responsive packets from the mobile communication device, or in other embodiments, the detector may detect the presence of the mobile communication device by detecting the discovery packets transmitted by the mobile communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">On detection, at block <b>204</b>, the detector proceeds to receive the identification and/or capability data. As described earlier, the detector may receive the identification and/or capability data via a push and/or pull model. Additionally, the detector may receive only the identification data, and infer the capability based on the received identification data. The detector may be pre-provided with the associated capability data or access and retrieve the capability data from a remote server.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">From block <b>202</b> or block <b>204</b>, operation may proceed to block <b>206</b> where a detector may determine whether it is time to distribute the presence and/or capability data collected. As described earlier, the distribution may be in real time, as the data are collected, or in batch, periodically, for a group of subscribers. If it is not time to distribute the collected data yet, operation may continue at block <b>202</b> again. For real time embodiments, the present invention may be practiced without this determination operation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In any event, on &#x201c;determining&#x201d; that it is time to distribute the collected data, operation proceeds to block <b>208</b>, where the detector proceeds to distribute the collected presence and/or capability data. As described earlier, the distribution may be to various subscriber devices, to other detectors, to one or more central servers, and to one or more communication service providers, directly or indirectly. The distribution may be effectuated to individual connections or through multi-cast transmissions. The connections may be over a WAN, and may be client-server or peer-to-peer connections.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Note that for the embodiments where the presence and/or capability data are distributed indirectly to the subscribers, operations similar to operations <b>206</b>-<b>208</b> are practiced by the various &#x201c;relay&#x201d; detectors <b>122</b>-<b>124</b> and sever <b>132</b> to in turn provide the distributed data to the subscriber devices (in a push and/or pull manner).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a flow chart view of selected operations performed by a mobile communication device <b>102</b>/<b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with various embodiments. For these embodiments, the mobile communication device may be equipped to provide the identification of the user or the device itself, and/or communication capability of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated, for the embodiments, the operation may begin at block <b>302</b> where a mobile communication device of the present invention determines whether it is to provide its identification and/or capability data to a proximally located detector, and/or receive presence and/or capability data of other subscribers of interest from a proximally located detector and/or server.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described earlier, in various embodiments, the mobile communication device may detect the presence of the proximally located detector by periodically sending out discovery packets and detecting responsive packets from the proximally located detector, or in other embodiments, the mobile communication device may detect the presence of the proximally located detector by detecting the discovery packets transmitted by the proximally located detector.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On determining it is time to provide identification and/or capability data, the operation proceeds to block <b>304</b>, where the mobile communication device provides its identification and/or capability data to a proximally located detector. Similarly, on determining it is time to receive identification and/or capability data of other subscribers of interest, the operation proceeds to block <b>304</b>, where the mobile communication device receive the identification and/or capability data of other subscribers of interest from a proximally or remotely located detector and/or server.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described earlier, the communication with a proximally located detector may be conducted over a WPAN, whereas communication with remotely located detectors and/or server, the communication may be conducted over a WAN, via a client-server and/or peer-to-peer connection.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">From block <b>302</b> or <b>304</b>, operation may proceed to block <b>306</b> where a determination is made whether the mobile communication device is to initiate a communication session with another subscriber of interest. If the mobile communication device is not to initiate a communication session with another subscriber of interest, operation may continue at block <b>302</b> as earlier described.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">On the other hand, if the mobile communication device is to initiate a communication session with another subscriber of interest, for the embodiments, the mobile communication device determines the appropriate communication device associated with the subscriber of interest to establish the communication session, based at least in part on the current presence and/or capability data of the subscriber, and proceeds to establish the communication session accordingly. For example, the mobile communication device may call the other subscriber's mobile communication device if the other subscriber's presence and capability is unknown, call the other subscriber's VOIP desk set if the other subscriber is at the office or at a venue with a VOIP desk set, or call the other subscriber's conventional POTS handset if the other subscriber is at home or at a venue with only conventional POTS.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As described earlier, the communication session to the appropriate communication device may be established automatically, or allow the user to override the selection. Additionally, the selection of the appropriate communication device may be performed by the communication service provider. In other words, the mobile communication device may merely provide the identification of the subscriber of interest to the communication service provider, and request a communication session be established with the subscriber. The communication service provider looks up the current presence and/or capability data of the target subscriber, and establishes the communication session accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Note that the logic for practicing the above described operations (with or without subtracting the ability to provide presence and/or capability data) may also be provided to handsets <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> to enable the handsets to facilitate presence and/or capability based communication for a user, as mobile communication devices <b>102</b>-<b>104</b>.</p>
