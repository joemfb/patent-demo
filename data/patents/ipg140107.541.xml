<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A coupling element, an injection molding object with the coupling element implanted therein, and an injection mold for manufacturing the injection molding object are provided. The coupling element has two reversely extended fixing ribs. The injection mold has a first mold and a second mold. The first mold has a first molding cavity and two positioning blocks separated by the first molding cavity. The second mold has a second molding cavity. When the first mold and the second mold are shut together and their molding cavities combine to define a closed room, the positioning blocks hold the coupling element by clamping the fixing ribs so the coupling element is suspended in midair of the closed room.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Taiwanese Application Serial Number 099138143, filed Nov. 5, 2010, which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an injection mold, more particular to an injection mold for injecting plastic material to envelop a solid object in the injection mold.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">At present, an educational computer for kids normally furnishes a holding handle thereon. The holding handle is provided with two coupling elements partially implanted at two opposite ends of the holding handle therein so that a connecting part of each coupling element is exposed from the holding handle for connecting with a spring of the educational computer at the corresponding position.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One of the methods for making the holding handle is with steps of providing two coupling elements; then, placing the coupling elements into a molding cavity of an injection mold; next, injecting plastic material to envelop the coupling elements in the injection mold, and after cooling, the plastic material is solidified to finally form a holding handle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, during the injecting step, in order to mostly envelope the coupling element inside the injected plastic material and expose its connecting part from the injected plastic material only, each of the coupling elements needs to be suspended in midair of the inner space of the molding cavity and not to contact with the inner surfaces of the molding cavity at all. Therefore, after the coupling element is enveloped in the plastic material and the plastic material is solidified, nowhere of the coupling element is exposed outside the surface of the holding handle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In practice, a traditional way is to extend pen-like pins upwardly and downwardly from both an upper mold and a lower mold to fix the coupling element by pushing the opposite sides of the coupling element so as to enable the coupling element to suspend in the midair of the molding cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Consequently, after the holding handle is formed, due to the pen-like pins, the opposite sides of the holding handle respectively remain some depressed holes or areas so as to further remain bad looking issues.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention discloses a coupling element and an injection mold for making an injection molding object, so as to provide a novel way capable of supporting the coupling element to be suspended in midair of the inner space of the injection mold to further improve the bad looking issues mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The injection mold is used for injecting plastic material to partially envelop a coupling element. The coupling element is provided with a connecting hole at one end thereof and two fixing ribs extended reversely with each other. The injection mold comprises a first mold and a second mold. The first mold comprises a first molding cavity, a location pin and two positioning blocks. The first molding cavity is installed on a surface of the first mold and used for accommodating the coupling element. The location pin is installed in the first molding cavity, and used for passing through the connecting hole. The positioning blocks are installed on the surface of the first mold, and separated by the first molding cavity. The second mold comprises a second molding cavity. The second molding cavity is installed on a surface of the second mold and arranged correspondingly to the first molding cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, when the first mold and the second mold are shut together and the first molding cavity and the second molding cavity are combined into a closed room for receiving the filled plastic material, the positioning blocks hold the coupling element therebetween by clamping the fixing ribs of the coupling element thereby the coupling element is suspended in midair of the closed room.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The coupling element provided in the present invention is for being placed in an injection mold so as to be implanted in a plastic body. The coupling element comprises a main body, a lug and two fixing ribs. The main body is provided with a lengthwise shape. The lug is disposed at one end of the main body, and the lug is provided with a connecting hole for being fixed in the injection mold.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The fixing ribs are respectively disposed on two opposite lengthwise sides of a surface of the main body, and extended reversely with each other, and used for supporting the main body to be suspended in midair of an inner space of the injection mold.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The injection molding object provided in the present invention comprises a plastic body, a plate and two coupling elements. The plastic body comprises a first plastic portion and two second plastic portions. The first plastic portion is with a lengthwise shape, and is provided with an exposing opening at one surface thereof. The second plastic portions is with a lengthwise shape, and respectively disposed at two opposite ends of the first plastic portion, and extended reversely with each other. Each of the second plastic portions is provided with two slits on two opposite lengthwise sides of the second plastic portion, respectively. The plate is embedded in the first plastic portion. The plate comprises a protrusive plane and a circled fillister. The protrusive plane is disposed on one surface of the plate, and is exposed outwardly from the first plastic portion through the exposing opening. The circled fillister surrounds the protrusive plane, and is arranged between the protrusive plane and the first plastic portion, and is exposed outwardly from the first plastic portion through the exposing opening. The coupling elements are respectively implanted in the second plastic portions one on one. Each of the coupling elements comprises a lug and two exposed parts. The lug is disposed at one end of the coupling element, and is exposed outwardly from one free end of the second plastic portion. The exposed parts are respectively exposed outward the second plastic portion through the slits one on one.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As mentioned above, in the present invention, by holding the fixing ribs of the coupling element, each main body of the coupling element keeps distances from both the first mold and the second mold. Thus, the present invention eliminates the traditional solution which uses two sets of pen-like pins to respectively extend upwardly and downwardly to press against the two opposite surfaces of the coupling element so as to prevent from bad looking depressed holes left on the holding handle, and to further decease the bad looking issues happened.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It needs to be emphasized that when the first mold <b>300</b> and the second mold <b>400</b> are shut together, since the two fixing ribs <b>130</b> of each coupling element <b>100</b> are clamped by the corresponding positioning blocks <b>340</b>, the main body <b>110</b> of the coupling element <b>100</b> arranged between the two fixing ribs <b>130</b> is suspended in midair of the closed room <b>460</b>, namely, the main body <b>110</b> is not contact with the inner surfaces of the first molding cavity <b>310</b> and the second molding cavity <b>410</b> at all.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Since the connecting hole <b>121</b> of the lug <b>120</b> is passed through by the fixing pin <b>322</b>, the main body <b>110</b> of each coupling element <b>100</b> can be hooked and not be flushed to move away along an X axle by the flowed plastic material. Also, since both the two fixing ribs <b>130</b> are clamped by the positioning blocks <b>340</b>, the main body <b>110</b> of each coupling element <b>100</b> can be held and not be flushed to move away along a Y axle by the flowed plastic material. Furthermore, because the first mold <b>300</b> and the second mold <b>400</b> are shut together, the two fixing ribs <b>130</b> of each coupling element <b>100</b> are fixed in the corresponding second containing recesses <b>440</b> respectively, thus, the main body <b>110</b> of each coupling element <b>100</b> can be held and not be flushed to move away along a Z axle by the flowed plastic material.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">After the plastic material is solidified to form the plastic body <b>710</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), the plastic body <b>710</b> mentioned above has enveloped the plate <b>500</b> and the coupling elements <b>100</b> partially (detailed description as below). However, because the second containing recesses <b>440</b> are respectively isolated with the closed room <b>460</b>, each fixing rib <b>130</b> in the second containing recess <b>440</b> can not be enveloped by the plastic body <b>710</b>. Consequently, the two fixing ribs <b>130</b> of each coupling element <b>100</b> respectively extend outwards two opposite sides of the plastic body <b>710</b>. Also, the plastic body <b>710</b> with the fixing ribs <b>130</b> extending outwards the plastic body <b>710</b> is so far called a &#x201c;semi-finished product <b>600</b>&#x201d;.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The final injection molding object <b>700</b> manufactured by the injection mold <b>200</b>, essentially includes a plastic body <b>710</b>, a mentioned plate <b>500</b> above, and two mentioned coupling elements <b>100</b> above. The plastic body <b>710</b> includes a first plastic portion <b>711</b> and two second plastic portions <b>712</b>. The first plastic portion <b>711</b> is disposed between the two second plastic portions <b>712</b>, and integrally connected the two second plastic portions <b>712</b>. Also, the first plastic portion <b>711</b> is presented as a lengthwise shape, and is provided with an exposing opening <b>713</b> at one surface thereof. Each of the second plastic portions <b>712</b> is presented as a lengthwise shape, and has a cross sectional area which is smaller than that of the first plastic portion <b>711</b>. The two second plastic portions <b>712</b> are reversely extended at two opposite ends of the first plastic portion <b>711</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Due to Step (<b>406</b>) of cutting down the fixing ribs <b>130</b>, each of the second plastic portions <b>712</b> is provided with two slits <b>714</b> on two opposite lengthwise sides of the second plastic portion <b>712</b>, respectively. Each slit <b>714</b> exposes a part of the coupling element <b>100</b> embedded in the second plastic portion <b>712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The plate <b>500</b> is embedded in the first plastic portion <b>711</b>. The protrusive plane <b>510</b> is exposed outwardly from the first plastic portion <b>711</b> through the exposing opening <b>713</b>. The plate <b>500</b> further includes a circled fillister <b>540</b> (practically called decoration line in the industries). The circled fillister <b>540</b> surrounds the protrusive plane <b>510</b>, is formed between the protrusive plane <b>510</b> and the first plastic portion <b>711</b>, and exposed outwardly from the first plastic portion <b>711</b> through the exposing opening <b>713</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Each of the coupling elements <b>100</b> is partially implanted in the second plastic portion <b>712</b>. Each lug <b>120</b> of the coupling element <b>100</b> is exposed outwardly from one free end of the second plastic portion <b>712</b>. Due to Step (<b>406</b>) of cutting down the fixing ribs <b>130</b>, two cutting marks (called exposed part <b>713</b>) that the fixing ribs <b>130</b> are removed on the coupling elements <b>100</b> are symmetrically exposed outward two opposite longwise sides of the second plastic portion <b>712</b> through the slits <b>714</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It needs to be emphasized that, since the injection mold of the present invention is adopted with an improved solution to fix the plate for positioning in the injection mold by extending the ring-shaped flange and the fixing pins upwardly and downwardly, after injection molding, comparing to the traditional solution mentioned above to fix an element for positioning in the injection mold by extending two sets of the pen-like pins upwardly and downwardly respectively, the traditional solution may remain depressed holes on the two opposite surfaces of the finished handle, the circled fillister <b>540</b> of the present invention remained by the ring-shaped flange provides a better solution of appearance artistic.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Therefore, using the ring-shaped flange and the fixing pins extending upwardly and downwardly to fix the plate in the injection mold not only achieves a position purpose in the injection mold, but also prevents from leaving bad looking holes on two opposite surface of the final injection molding object <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one embodiment of the present invention, the material of the mentioned plastic body <b>710</b> for example can be low density polyethylene (LDPE), thermoplastic rubber (TPR), Polyvinylchloride (PVC), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) or combination thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In one of the variations of the embodiment of the present invention, the mentioned injection molding object <b>700</b> for example can be a handle or a belt etc. for equipping on a notebook. Thus, the surface of the protrusive plane <b>510</b> of the plate <b>500</b> exposed outwardly from the first plastic portion <b>711</b> can be provided as a panel for writing. In a detailed embodiment, a melting point of the plastic body is lower than a melting point of the plate and the coupling elements.
