<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The amplitude voltage of a signal input to a level shifter can be increased and then output by the level shifter circuit. Specifically, the amplitude voltage of the signal input to the level shifter can be increased to be output. This decreases the amplitude voltage of a circuit (a shift register circuit, a decoder circuit, or the like) which outputs the signal input to the level shifter. Consequently, power consumption of the circuit can be reduced. Alternatively, a voltage applied to a transistor included in the circuit can be reduced. This can suppress degradation of the transistor or damage to the transistor.</p>

In particular, an example of a level shifter circuit and an example of the driving method of the level shifter circuit will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, an example of a semiconductor device in this embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of a semiconductor device. A circuit <b>100</b> includes a circuit <b>110</b> and a circuit <b>120</b>. The circuit <b>110</b> is connected to a wiring <b>11</b>, a wiring <b>13</b>, a wiring <b>14</b>, a wiring <b>16</b>, and a circuit <b>120</b>. The circuit <b>120</b> is connected to the wiring <b>11</b>, a wiring <b>12</b>, a wiring <b>15</b>, the wiring <b>16</b>, and the circuit <b>110</b>. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, the circuit <b>100</b>, the circuit <b>110</b>, and the circuit <b>120</b> can be connected to various wirings according to its configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The circuit <b>110</b> includes a transistor <b>111</b> and a transistor <b>112</b>. The circuit <b>120</b> includes a transistor <b>121</b>, a transistor <b>122</b>, a transistor <b>123</b>, and a transistor <b>124</b>. A first terminal of the transistor <b>121</b> is connected to the wiring <b>15</b>. A second terminal of the transistor <b>121</b> is connected to the wiring <b>12</b>. A first terminal of the transistor <b>122</b> is connected to the wiring <b>16</b>. A second terminal of the transistor <b>122</b> is connected to the wiring <b>12</b>. A first terminal of the transistor <b>123</b> is connected to the wiring <b>15</b>. A second terminal of the transistor <b>123</b> is connected to a gate of the transistor <b>121</b>. A gate of the transistor <b>123</b> is connected to the wiring <b>11</b>. A first terminal of the transistor <b>124</b> is connected to the wiring <b>16</b>. A second terminal of the transistor <b>124</b> is connected to the gate of the transistor <b>121</b>. A gate of the transistor <b>124</b> is connected to a gate of the transistor <b>122</b>. A first terminal of the transistor <b>111</b> is connected to the wiring <b>14</b>. A second terminal of the transistor <b>111</b> is connected to the gate of the transistor <b>122</b>. A gate of the transistor <b>111</b> is connected to the wiring <b>13</b>. A first terminal of the transistor <b>112</b> is connected to the wiring <b>16</b>. A second terminal of the transistor <b>112</b> is connected to the gate of the transistor <b>122</b>. A gate of the transistor <b>112</b> is connected to the wiring <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Note that the connecting point of the second terminal of the transistor <b>111</b>, the second terminal of the transistor <b>112</b>, the gate of the transistor <b>122</b>, and the gate of the transistor <b>124</b> is referred to as a node A. The connecting point of the gate of the transistor <b>121</b>, the second terminal of the transistor <b>123</b>, and the second terminal of the transistor <b>124</b> is referred to as a node B.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Note that the transistor <b>111</b>, the transistor <b>112</b>, and the transistors <b>121</b> to <b>124</b> are re-channel transistors. N-channel transistors are turned on when a potential difference between the gate and the source gets higher than the threshold voltage. Thus, the semiconductor device in this embodiment can be formed using a transistor including an amorphous semiconductor, a microcrystalline semiconductor, an oxide semiconductor, an organic semiconductor, or the like. Preferably, the semiconductor device in this embodiment is formed using a transistor including an oxide semiconductor, in particular. This is because the mobility of the transistor can be increased by using an oxide semiconductor for a semiconductor layer. Thus, the semiconductor device in this embodiment can be easily applied to a high-resolution display device or a large display device. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, all of the transistor <b>111</b>, the transistor <b>112</b>, and the transistors <b>121</b> to <b>124</b> can be p-channel transistors. P-channel transistors are turned on when a potential difference between the gate and the source gets lower than the threshold voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Note that a thin film transistor is an element having at least three terminals: a gate, a drain, and a source. In addition, a thin film transistor has a channel region between the drain (drain region or drain electrode) and the source (source region or source electrode) and can conduct current through the drain, the channel region, and the source. Here, the source and the drain of the transistor change depending on the structure, the operating condition, and the like of the transistor, and thus it is difficult to define which is a source or a drain. Therefore, a portion functioning as a source or a drain is not called a source or a drain in some cases. In that case, one of a source and a drain might be referred to as a first terminal, a first electrode, or a first region, and the other one of the source and the drain might be referred to as a second terminal, a second electrode, or a second region, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Note that an explicit description &#x201c;X and Y are connected&#x201d; indicates the case where X and Y are electrically connected, the case where X and Y are connected in terms of the function, the case where X and Y are directly connected, or the like. Here, each of X and Y denotes an object (e.g., a device, an element, a circuit, a wiring, an electrode, a terminal, a conductive film, a layer, or the like). Therefore, such a description is not limited to a predetermined connection relation, e.g. connection relation shown in a drawing or text, and includes connection relation other than connection relation shown in a drawing or text.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A voltage VDD<b>1</b> is input to the wiring <b>14</b>. The voltage VDD<b>1</b> has a constant value and has a higher value than the ground voltage. Therefore, the wiring <b>14</b> serves as a power supply line or a positive power supply line. A voltage VDD<b>2</b> is input to the wiring <b>15</b>. The voltage VDD<b>2</b> has a constant value and has a higher value than the voltage VDD<b>1</b>. Therefore, the wiring <b>15</b> serves as a power supply line or a positive power supply line. A voltage VSS is input to the wiring <b>16</b>. The voltage VSS has a constant value and has a lower value than the voltage VDD<b>1</b>. Therefore, the wiring <b>16</b> serves as a power supply line or a negative power supply line. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, a signal can be input to the wiring <b>14</b>, the wiring <b>15</b> and/or the wiring <b>16</b>. In such a case, the wiring <b>14</b>, the wiring <b>15</b> and/or the wiring <b>16</b> can serve as a signal line. For another example, the voltage VSS can be approximately the same as the ground voltage. Therefore, the wiring <b>16</b> can serve as a ground line or a ground.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A signal IN<b>1</b> is input to the wiring <b>11</b>. The signal IN<b>1</b> is a digital signal. In addition, the potential of the signal IN<b>1</b> at a high level is approximately VDD<b>1</b>, and the potential of the signal IN<b>1</b> at a low level is approximately VSS. Therefore, the wiring <b>11</b> serves as a signal line. A signal IN<b>2</b> is input to the wiring <b>13</b>. The signal IN<b>2</b> is a digital signal. In addition, the potential of the signal IN<b>2</b> at a high level is approximately VDD<b>1</b>, and the potential of the signal IN<b>2</b> at a low level is approximately VSS. Therefore, the wiring <b>13</b> serves as a signal line. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, a voltage (e.g., the voltage VDD<b>1</b> or the voltage VDD<b>2</b>) can be input to the wiring <b>13</b>. Thus, the signal IN<b>2</b> can be omitted, thereby reducing the number of signals and wirings and reducing power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A signal OUT is output from the wiring <b>12</b>. The signal OUT is a digital signal and is the output signal of the circuit <b>100</b>. In addition, the potential of the signal OUT at a high level is approximately VDD<b>2</b>, and the potential of the signal OUT at a low level is approximately VSS, that is, the amplitude voltage of the signal OUT is higher than that of the signal IN<b>1</b>. Therefore, the wiring <b>12</b> serves as a signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, an example of the operation of the semiconductor device in this embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing the operation of the semiconductor device in this embodiment. The semiconductor device in this embodiment can perform the first to fourth operations by combining the signal IN<b>1</b> and the signal IN<b>2</b> at a high level or low level. The first to fourth operations will be described. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, the semiconductor device in this embodiment can perform more operations by changing the potential of the wiring <b>14</b>, the wiring <b>15</b> and/or the wiring <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">First, the first operation will be described (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). In the first operation, the signal IN<b>1</b> goes high and the signal IN<b>2</b> goes low. Consequently, the transistor <b>111</b> is turned off and the transistor <b>112</b> is turned on, so that electrical continuity between the node A and the wiring <b>16</b> is established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>16</b> (the voltage VSS) is supplied to the node A, and thus the potential of the node A (referred to as a potential Va) becomes approximately VSS. Consequently, the transistor <b>124</b> is turned off. At that time, the transistor <b>123</b> is turned on, so that electrical continuity between the node B and the wiring <b>15</b> is established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>15</b> (e.g., the voltage VDD<b>2</b>) is supplied to the node B, and thus the potential of the node B (referred to as Vb) starts to increase. After that, the potential of the node B becomes VSS+Vth<b>121</b> (Vth<b>121</b>: the threshold voltage of the transistor <b>121</b>), and thus the transistor <b>121</b> is turned on. At that time, the transistor <b>122</b> is turned off, so that electrical continuity between the wiring <b>12</b> and the wiring <b>15</b> is established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>15</b> (e.g., the voltage VDD<b>2</b>) is supplied to the wiring <b>12</b>, and thus the potential of the wiring <b>12</b> (the signal OUT) starts to increase. After that, the potential of the node B and the potential of the wiring <b>12</b> keep further increasing. Then, the potential of the node B becomes a value obtained by subtracting the threshold voltage of the transistor <b>123</b> (Vth<b>123</b>) from the potential of the gate of the transistor <b>123</b> (the voltage VDD<b>1</b>). Then, the transistor <b>123</b> is turned off, so that electrical continuity between the wiring <b>15</b> and the node B is broken. Consequently, the node B becomes floating. At that time, the potential of the wiring <b>12</b> keeps increasing. Consequently, the potential of the node B further increases from VDD<b>1</b>+Vth<b>123</b> because of parasitic capacitance which occurs between the gate and second terminal of the transistor <b>121</b>. Then, the potential of the node B becomes VDD<b>2</b>+Vth<b>121</b>+V<b>1</b> (V<b>1</b>: a positive number). This is so-called a bootstrap operation. Consequently, the potential of the wiring <b>12</b> can increase to VDD<b>2</b>. Thus, the signal OUT goes high.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Second, the second operation will be described (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). In the second operation, the signal IN<b>1</b> goes low and the signal IN<b>2</b> goes high. Consequently, the transistor <b>111</b> is turned on and the transistor <b>112</b> is turned off, so that electrical continuity between the node A and the wiring <b>14</b> is established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>14</b> (the voltage VDD<b>1</b>) is supplied to the node A, and thus the potential of the node A increases. After that, the potential of the node A becomes a value (referred to as VDD<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth <b>111</b>) obtained by subtracting the threshold voltage of the transistor <b>111</b> (Vth <b>111</b>) from the potential of the gate of the transistor <b>111</b> (the signal IN<b>2</b> at a high level). Then, the transistor <b>111</b> is turned off, so that electrical continuity between the wiring <b>14</b> and the node A is broken. Thus, the node A becomes floating, and thus the potential of the node A is kept approximately VDD<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth<b>111</b>. Consequently, the transistor <b>124</b> is turned on. At that time, the transistor <b>123</b> is turned off, so that electrical continuity between the node B and the wiring <b>16</b> is established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>16</b> (the voltage VSS) is supplied to the node B, and thus the potential of the node B becomes approximately VSS. Consequently, the transistor <b>121</b> is turned off. At that time, the transistor <b>122</b> is turned on, so that electrical continuity between the wiring <b>12</b> and the wiring <b>16</b> is established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>16</b> (the voltage VSS) is supplied to the wiring <b>12</b>, and thus the potential of the wiring <b>12</b> (the signal OUT) becomes approximately VSS. Thus, the signal OUT goes low.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, the third operation will be described (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). In the third operation, the signal IN<b>1</b> goes high and the signal IN<b>2</b> goes high. Consequently, the transistor <b>111</b> is turned on and the transistor <b>112</b> is turned on, so that electrical continuity between the node A and the wiring <b>14</b>, and electrical continuity between the node A and the wiring <b>16</b> are established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>14</b> (the voltage VDD<b>1</b>) and the potential of the wiring <b>16</b> (the voltage VSS) are supplied to the node A, and thus the potential of the node A becomes a value intermediate between VSS and VDD<b>1</b>. This potential of the node A is determined by the current capability of the transistor <b>111</b> and the current capability of the transistor <b>112</b>. Here the current capability of the transistor <b>112</b> is higher than that of the transistor <b>111</b>. Therefore, preferably, the potential of the node A is a value nearer to VSS than VDD<b>1</b>. More preferably, the potential of the node A is a value lower than VSS+Vth<b>124</b> (Vth<b>124</b>: the threshold voltage of the transistor <b>124</b>) or lower than VSS+Vth<b>122</b> (Vth<b>122</b>: the threshold voltage of the transistor <b>122</b>). Consequently, the transistor <b>124</b> is turned off. At that time, the transistor <b>123</b> is turned on, so that electrical continuity between the node B and the wiring <b>15</b> is established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>15</b> (e.g., the voltage VDD<b>2</b>) is supplied to the node B, and thus the potential of the node B (which potential is referred to as Vb) starts to increase. After that, the potential of the node B becomes VSS+Vth<b>121</b> (Vth<b>121</b>: the threshold voltage of the transistor <b>121</b>), and thus the transistor <b>121</b> is turned on. At that time, the transistor <b>122</b> is turned off, so that electrical continuity between the wiring <b>12</b> and the wiring <b>15</b> is established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>15</b> (e.g., the voltage VDD<b>2</b>) is supplied to the wiring <b>12</b>, and thus the potential of the wiring <b>12</b> (the signal OUT) starts to increase. After that, the potential of the node B and the potential of the wiring <b>12</b> keep further increasing. Then, the potential of the node B becomes a value obtained by subtracting the threshold voltage of the transistor <b>123</b> (Vth <b>123</b>) from the potential of the gate of the transistor <b>123</b> (the voltage VDD<b>1</b>). Then, the transistor <b>123</b> is turned off, so that electrical continuity between the wiring <b>15</b> and the node B is broken. Consequently, the node B becomes floating. At that time, the potential of the wiring <b>12</b> keeps increasing. Consequently, the potential of the node B further increases from VDD<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth<b>123</b> because of parasitic capacitance which occurs between the gate and second terminal of the transistor <b>121</b>. Then, the potential of the node B becomes VDD<b>2</b>+Vth<b>121</b>+V<b>1</b> (V<b>1</b>: a positive number). This is so-called a bootstrap operation. Consequently, the potential of the wiring <b>12</b> can increase to VDD<b>2</b>. Thus, the signal OUT goes high.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the fourth operation will be described (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). In the fourth operation, the signal IN<b>1</b> goes low and the signal IN<b>2</b> goes low. Consequently, the transistor <b>111</b> is turned off and the transistor <b>112</b> is turned off, so that the node A becomes floating. Then, the potential of the node A remains at the same state as in the operation prior to the fourth operation. For example, suppose that the semiconductor device performs the first operation or the third operation prior to the fourth operation. In this case, the potential of the node A becomes approximately VSS. Then, suppose that the semiconductor device performs the second operation prior to the fourth operation. In this case, the potential of the node A becomes approximately VDD<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth<b>111</b>. Here, the semiconductor device performs the second operation prior to the fourth operation. Consequently, the potential of the node A is thus maintained at approximately VDD<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth<b>111</b>. Consequently, the transistor <b>124</b> is turned on. At that time, the transistor <b>123</b> is turned off, so that electrical continuity between the node B and the wiring <b>16</b> is established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>16</b> (the voltage VSS) is supplied to the node B, and thus the potential of the node B becomes approximately VSS. Consequently, the transistor <b>121</b> is turned off. At that time, the transistor <b>122</b> is turned on, so that electrical continuity between the wiring <b>12</b> and the wiring <b>16</b> is established. Then, the potential of the wiring <b>16</b> (the voltage VSS) is supplied to the wiring <b>12</b>, and thus the potential of the wiring <b>12</b> (the signal OUT) becomes approximately VSS. Thus, the signal OUT goes low.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, in the semiconductor device in this embodiment, the amplitude voltage of the signal IN<b>1</b> can be increased to be output. Specifically, the amplitude voltage of the signal IN<b>1</b> can be increased to be output. This decreases the amplitude voltage of a circuit (a shift register circuit, a decoder circuit, or the like) which outputs the signal IN<b>1</b> to the semiconductor device in this embodiment. Consequently, the power consumption of the circuit can be reduced. Alternatively, a voltage applied to a transistor in the circuit can be reduced. This suppresses degradation of the transistor or damage to the transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Alternatively, the timing of inverting the signal OUT can be approximately the same as the timing of inverting the signal IN<b>1</b>. Thus, the wiring <b>12</b> does not need to have an inverter circuit or the like. This achieves the reduction in power consumption, the reduction in circuit size, or the reduction in layout area.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Alternatively, in the first operation, when the signal IN<b>1</b> is high, the signal IN<b>2</b> goes low, thereby preventing flow-through current which occurs between the wiring <b>14</b> and the wiring <b>16</b>. This reduces the power consumption.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Note that when it is assumed that the circuit <b>401</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i </i>is connected to the wiring <b>24</b>_<b>1</b>, the circuit <b>401</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i</i>+1, the circuit <b>401</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i</i>+2, and the circuit <b>401</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i</i>+3 are often connected to the wiring <b>242</b>, the wiring <b>24</b>_<b>3</b>, and the wiring <b>24</b>_<b>4</b>, respectively.

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Note that the circuit <b>401</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i </i>is preferably connected to one of the wirings <b>24</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>24</b>_<b>4</b>, whose potential goes low in a period in which the signal SOUTi goes high. Thus, a period in which the transistor <b>111</b> and the transistor <b>112</b> are turned on at the same time can be omitted. This reduces the power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The circuit <b>500</b> has a function of controlling the timing of supplying a signal, a voltage, or the like to the circuits <b>300</b> and <b>400</b>. Further, the circuit <b>500</b> has a function of controlling the timing of when the circuit <b>300</b> and the circuit <b>400</b> operate. In other words, the circuit <b>500</b> serves as a controller.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The circuit <b>501</b> has a function of controlling the timing of outputting a signal SP, a signal CK<b>1</b>, a signal CK<b>2</b>, a signal CK<b>3</b>, and a signal CK<b>4</b> to the wiring <b>23</b>, the wiring <b>24</b>_<b>1</b>, the wiring <b>242</b>, the wiring <b>24</b>_<b>3</b>, and the wiring <b>24</b>_<b>4</b>, respectively. In other words, the circuit <b>501</b> serves as a signal-generating circuit (also referred to as a timing generator). Therefore, the circuit <b>501</b> can include a switch, a diode, a transistor, an oscillator circuit, a clocked generator, a PLL circuit and/or a frequency divider circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The signal SP, the signal CK<b>1</b>, the signal CK<b>2</b>, the signal CK<b>3</b>, and the signal CK<b>4</b> are often digital signals as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The potential of these signals at a high level is approximately VDD<b>1</b>, and the potential of these signals at a low level is approximately VSS. In addition the signal SP serves as a start pulse (also referred to as a horizontal synchronizing signal or a vertical synchronizing signal). Therefore, the wiring <b>23</b> serves as a signal line (also referred to as a start signal line). The signals CK<b>1</b> to CK<b>4</b> each function as a clock signal. Each of the signals CK<b>1</b> to CK<b>4</b> is out of phase with the subsequent clock signal by &#xbc; cycle (90&#xb0;). Therefore, the wiring <b>24</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>24</b>_<b>4</b> serve as clock signal lines (also referred to as signal lines).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Note that the signals CK<b>1</b> to CK<b>4</b> are balanced signals as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. A balanced signal is a signal whose period in which the signal is high and whose period in which the signal is low in one cycle have approximately the same length. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, the signals CK<b>1</b> to CK<b>4</b> can be unbalanced signals as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. An unbalanced signal is a signal whose period in which the signal is high and whose period in which the signal is low in one cycle have different lengths. Here, the term &#x201c;different&#x201d; is used in consideration of the case except the case where the length of the periods is approximately equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Note that a single-phase clock signal can be used for the semiconductor device in this embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B and 13C</figref>. In this case also, a clock signal can be either a balanced signal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> or an unbalanced signal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, a three-phase clock signal or a five- or more phase clock signal can be used for the semiconductor device in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The circuit <b>502</b> has a function of outputting the voltage VDD<b>1</b>, the voltage VDD<b>2</b>, and the voltage VSS to the wiring <b>25</b>, the wiring <b>26</b>, and the wiring <b>27</b>, respectively. In other words, the circuit <b>502</b> serves as a power supply circuit (also referred to as a regulator). Therefore, the wiring <b>25</b> serves as a power supply line or a positive power supply line. The wiring <b>27</b> serves as a power supply line, a negative power supply line, a ground line. Therefore, the circuit <b>502</b> can include a switch, a transistor, a capacitor, a coil, a diode, a regulator, a DCDC converter and/or a booster circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Note that the circuit <b>500</b>, the circuit <b>501</b>, and the circuit <b>502</b> can supply various signals or voltages to the circuit <b>300</b> and the circuit <b>400</b> according to the configuration of the circuit <b>300</b> and the circuit <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The circuit <b>300</b> has a function of controlling the timing of outputting signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm according to a signal and a voltage from the circuit <b>500</b> (e.g., the signal SP, the signals CK<b>1</b> to CK<b>4</b>, the voltage VDD<b>1</b>, and the voltage VSS). The signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm are often digital signals, and the potential of the signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm at a high level is approximately VDD<b>1</b>, and the potential of the signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm at a low level is approximately VSS. In addition, the circuit <b>300</b> has a function of setting sequentially the signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm high. In other words, the circuit <b>300</b> serves as a shift register circuit. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, the circuit <b>300</b> can have the function of setting the signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm high in a predetermined order. Therefore, the circuit <b>300</b> can serve as a decoder circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Note that the signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm are input to the circuit <b>400</b> via the wirings <b>21</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>21</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>m</i>, respectively. For example, the signal SOUTi is input to the circuit <b>401</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i </i>via the wiring <b>21</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i</i>. Therefore, the wirings <b>21</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>21</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>m </i>each serve as a signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Note that in a timing chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, part of a period in which the signal SOUTi is high and part of a period in which the signal SOUTi&#x2212;1 is high overlap with each other. Further, part of a period in which the signal SOUTi is high and part of a period in which the signal SOUTi+1 is high overlap with each other. Therefore, a period in which the signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm are high can be longer. Thus, the drive frequency of the circuit <b>300</b> can be reduced, thereby reducing the power consumption. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, it is possible for periods in which the signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm are high not to overlap with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The circuit <b>400</b> has a function of controlling the timing of outputting signals BOUT<b>1</b> to BOUTm according to a signal from the circuit <b>300</b> (e.g., the signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm), and a signal and voltage from the circuit <b>500</b> (e.g., the signals CK<b>1</b> to CK<b>4</b>, the voltage VDD<b>1</b>, the voltage VDD<b>2</b>, and the voltage VSS). The signals BOUT<b>1</b> to BOUTm are often digital signals, and the potential of the signals BOUT<b>1</b> to BOUTm at a high level is approximately VDD<b>2</b>, and the potential of the BOUT<b>1</b> to BOUTm at a low level is approximately VSS. In addition, the timing of when the signals BOUT<b>1</b> to BOUTm are inverted is approximately the same as the timing of when the signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm are inverted. In other words, the circuit <b>400</b> has a function of increasing the amplitude voltage of the signals SOUT<b>1</b> to SOUTm.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is an example of the timing chart of the circuit <b>401</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the signal SOUTi, the signal CK, the potential of the node A of the circuit <b>401</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i</i>, the potential of the node B of the circuit <b>401</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i</i>, and the signal BOUTi. The signal CK is any one of the signal CK<b>1</b> to CK<b>4</b>. The signal CK is a signal of the signal CK<b>1</b> to CK<b>4</b>, which goes low when the signal SOUTi goes high. In addition, the timing chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> includes a period Ta, a period Tb, and a period Tc. In the timing chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, there are, in addition to the period Ta, the period Tb and the period Tc which are provided in order.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Note that the signal SOUTi corresponds to the signal IN<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The signal CK corresponds to the signal IN<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The signal BOUTi corresponds to the signal OUT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">First, in the period Ta, the signal SOUTi goes high, and the signal CK goes low. Then, the circuit <b>400</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i </i>performs the first operation. Accordingly, the signal BOUTi goes high. This raises the potential of the signal SOUTi at a high level from VDD<b>1</b> to VDD<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Next, in the period Tb, the signal SOUTi goes low, and the signal CK goes high. Then, the circuit <b>400</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i </i>performs the second operation. Consequently, the signal BOUTi goes low.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Next, in the period Tc, the signal SOUTi remains low, and the signal CK goes low. Then, the circuit <b>400</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>i </i>performs the fourth operation. Further, since the previous period of the period Tc is the period Tb, the potential Va remains VDD<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth<b>111</b>. Consequently, the signal BOUTi remains low.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As described above, the semiconductor device in this embodiment can amplify the amplitude voltage of an output signal of the circuit <b>300</b> and then output the signal. This decreases the amplitude voltage of the circuit <b>300</b>. Therefore, the power consumption of the circuit <b>300</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Alternatively, the circuits <b>401</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>401</b><sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>m </i>each often perform any of the first operation, the second operation, and the fourth operation. Therefore, there is no period in which the transistor <b>111</b> and the transistor <b>112</b> are turned on at the same time, and the power consumption is thus reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0168" num="0167">As described above, video signals are input to pixels of a plurality of columns at a time, and thus the number of video signals or the number of wirings can be reduced. Therefore, the number of connections to an external circuit can be reduced, achieving the improvement in yield, the improvement in reliability, the reduction in the number of components, and/or the reduction in cost. Alternatively, video signals are input to pixels of a plurality of columns at a time, and thus write time can be extended. This prevents the video signals from being inadequately written to the pixels, so that visual quality can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Note that the increase in k can decrease the number of connections to the external circuit. However, if k is too large, the time to input signals to pixels is shortened. Therefore, it is preferable that k&#x2266;6. It is more preferable that k&#x2266;3. It is much more preferable that k=2. However, an example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In particular, in the case where the number of color elements of a pixel is n (n is a natural number), it is preferable that k=n or k=n&#xd7;d (d is a natural number). For example, in the case where the color element of the pixel is divided into three colors: red (R), green (G), and blue (B), it is preferable that k=3 or k=3&#xd7;d. However, an example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, in the case where the pixel is divided into m (m is a natural number) pieces of sub-pixels, k=m or k=m&#xd7;d is preferable. For example, in the case where the pixel is divided into two sub-pixels, k=2 is preferable. Alternatively, in the case where the number of color elements of the pixel is n, it is preferable that k=m&#xd7;n or k=m&#xd7;n&#xd7;d. However, an example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Note that all of the signal line driver circuits in this embodiment can be formed over the substrate over which the pixel portion is formed, and all of the signal line driver circuits in this embodiment can be formed over a substrate (e.g., a silicon substrate or SOI substrate) different from the substrate over which the pixel portion is formed. Alternatively, a part of the signal line driver circuits in this embodiment (e.g., the circuit <b>2002</b>) can be formed over the substrate over which the pixel portion is formed, and another part of the signal line driver circuits in this embodiment (e.g., the circuit <b>2001</b>) can be formed over a substrate different from the substrate over which the pixel portion is formed.</p>

In this structure, the number of connections between the substrate over which the pixel portion is formed and an external circuit can be reduced, achieving the improvement in yield, the improvement in reliability, the reduction in the number of components, or the reduction in cost. In particular, by also forming a scan line driver circuit <b>2006</b>A and a scan line driver circuit <b>2006</b>B over the substrate over which the pixel portion <b>2007</b> is formed, the number of connections to the external circuit can be further reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Note that the semiconductor device in Embodiments 1 and 2 can be used for the circuit <b>2001</b>.

However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Next, the material, structure, characteristics of each layer and the like will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Examples of the substrate (e.g., the substrate <b>5260</b> or the substrate <b>5300</b>) include a semiconductor substrate (e.g., a single crystal substrate or a silicon substrate), an SOI substrate, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a plastic substrate, a metal substrate, a stainless steel substrate, a substrate containing stainless steel foil, a tungsten substrate, a substrate containing tungsten foil, a flexible substrate, a bonding film, paper containing a fibrous material, and a base film. Examples of the material for the glass substrate include a barium borosilicate glass, an aluminoborosilicate, and soda lime. Examples of the material for the flexible substrate include a flexible synthetic resin such as plastics typified by polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), and polyether sulfone (PES), and a flexible synthetic resin such as acrylic. Examples of the material for the bonding film include polypropylene, polyester, vinyl, polyvinyl fluoride, and polyvinyl chloride. Examples of the material for the base film include polyester, polyamide, polyimide, inorganic vapor deposition film, and paper. Specifically, the use of semiconductor substrates, single crystal substrates, SOI substrates, or the like enables the manufacture of small-sized transistors with a small variation in characteristics, size, shape, or the like and with high current capability. A circuit using such transistors achieves lower power consumption of the circuit or higher integration of the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Note that it is possible to form a transistor over a substrate and then transpose the transistor to another substrate. Examples of the another substrate include, in addition to the above-described substrates, a paper substrate, a cellophane substrate, a stone substrate, a wood substrate, a cloth substrate (a natural fiber (e.g., silk, cotton, or hemp), a synthetic fiber (e.g., nylon, polyurethane, or polyester), a regenerated fiber (e.g., acetate, cupra, rayon, or regenerated polyester), or the like), a leather substrate, and a rubber substrate. The use of these substrates provides transistors with excellent properties, transistors which consume low power, devices with high durability, high heat resistance, light weight, or small thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Note that all the circuits needed to realize a predetermined function can be formed over the same substrate (e.g., a glass substrate, a plastic substrate, a single crystal substrate, or an SOI substrate). This achieves cost reduction by the reduced number of components or the improvement in reliability by the reduced number of connection points to circuit components.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Note that it is possible to form not all the circuits needed to realize the predetermined function over the same substrate. That is, a part of the circuits needed to realize the predetermined function can be formed over a substrate and another part of the circuits needed to realize the predetermined function can be formed over another substrate. For example, a part of the circuits needed to realize the predetermined function can be formed over a glass substrate and a part of the circuits needed to realize the predetermined function can be formed over a single crystal substrate (or an SOI substrate). Then, a single crystal substrate over which a part of the circuits needed to realize the predetermined function (such a substrate is also referred to as an IC chip) can be connected to a glass substrate by COG (chip on glass), and an IC chip can be provided over the glass substrate. Alternatively, an IC chip can be connected to a glass substrate using TAB (tape automated bonding), COF (chip on film), SMT (surface mount technology), a printed circuit board, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">For example, the insulating layers (e.g., the insulating layer <b>5261</b>, the insulating layer <b>5263</b>, the insulating layer <b>5265</b>, the insulating layer <b>5267</b>, the insulating layer <b>5269</b>, the insulating layer <b>5305</b>, the insulating layer <b>5356</b>, and the insulating layer <b>5358</b>) each have a single-layer or multilayer structure of a film containing oxygen or nitrogen (e.g., silicon oxide (SiOx), silicon nitride (SiNx), silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) (x&#x3e;y&#x3e;0), and silicon nitride oxide (SiNxOy) (x&#x3e;y&#x3e;0)), a film containing carbon (e.g., DLC (diamond-like carbon)), an organic material (e.g., siloxane resin, an epoxy, polyimide, polyamide, polyvinylphenol, benzocyclobutene, acrylic, or the like), or the like. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Note that when the insulating layer has a two-layer structure, a silicon nitride film and a silicon oxide film are provided as a first insulating layer and a second insulating layer, respectively. When the insulating layer has a three-layer structure, a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, and a silicon oxide film are provided as a first insulating layer, a second insulating layer, and a third insulating layer, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Examples of the material of the semiconductor layers (e.g., the semiconductor layer <b>5262</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>5303</b><i>a</i>, and the semiconductor layer <b>5303</b><i>b</i>) include a non-single-crystal semiconductor (e.g., amorphous silicon, polycrystalline silicon, or microcrystalline silicon), a single crystal semiconductor, a compound semiconductor or an oxide semiconductor (e.g., ZnO, InGaZnO, SiGe, GaAs, IZO (indium zinc oxide), ITO (indium tin oxide), SnO, TiO, or AlZnSnO (AZTO)), an organic semiconductor, and a carbon nanotube.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Note that using a catalyst (e.g., nickel) when manufacturing polycrystalline silicon or microcrystalline silicon further improves crystallinity and enables the manufacture of thin film transistors having excellent electric characteristics. It is thus possible to form a gate driver circuit (e.g., a scan line driver circuit), a source driver circuit (e.g., a signal line driver circuit), a part of the source driver circuit (e.g., a switch for dividing a video signal), a signal processing circuit (e.g., a signal generating circuit, a gamma correction circuit, or a DA converter circuit), or the like, over the same substrate. When microcrystalline silicon is manufactured by a catalyst (e.g., nickel), in particular, it is possible to improve crystallinity by only heat treatment without laser irradiation. Therefore, variations in the crystallinity of silicon can be reduced, leading to display of images with improved image quality. Note that it is possible to manufacture polycrystalline silicon or microcrystalline silicon without a catalyst (e.g., nickel).</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Note that although preferably, crystallinity of silicon is improved to polycrystal, microcrystal, or the like in the whole panel, the present invention is not limited to this. It is acceptable that the crystallinity of silicon is improved only in part of the panel. Selective improvement in crystallinity can be achieved by selective laser irradiation or the like. For example, only the region of a circuit that needs to operate at high speed, such as the region of a peripheral circuit other than pixels, the region of a gate driver circuit and a source driver circuit, a part of the source driver circuit (e.g., an analog switch), and the like can be irradiated with laser beam. On the other hand, the need for a pixel region to operate at high speed is not considerable, and a pixel circuit can thus operate without any problems even if the crystallinity is not improved. This makes the region small whose crystallinity should be improved, thereby shortening the manufacturing process. Thus, throughput can be increased and manufacturing cost can be reduced. Alternatively, the manufacture needs the small number of manufacturing apparatuses, so that manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">For example, each of the conductive layers (e.g., the conductive layer <b>5264</b>, the conductive layer <b>5266</b>, the conductive layer <b>5268</b>, the conductive layer <b>5271</b>, the conductive layer <b>5301</b>, the conductive layer <b>5304</b>, the conductive layer <b>5306</b>, the conductive layer <b>5308</b>, the conductive layer <b>5357</b>, and the conductive layer <b>5359</b>) is a single-layer film or a multilayer film.

The element can be formed using a pair of electrodes and a liquid crystal layer. Note that the optical modulation action of liquid crystals is controlled by an electric filed applied to the liquid crystal (including a lateral electric field, a vertical electric field and a diagonal electric field). Specifically, examples of the liquid crystal element include a nematic liquid crystal, a cholesteric liquid crystal, a smectic liquid crystal, a discotic liquid crystal, a thermotropic liquid crystal, a lyotropic liquid crystal, a low molecular liquid crystal, a high molecular liquid crystal, a PDLC (polymer dispersed liquid crystal), a ferroelectric liquid crystal, an anti-ferroelectric liquid crystal, a main chain type liquid crystal, a side chain type polymer liquid crystal, a plasma addressed liquid crystal (PALC), a banana-shaped liquid crystal, a TN (twisted nematic) mode, an STN (super twisted nematic) mode, an IPS (in-plane-switching) mode, an FFS (fringe field switching) mode, an MVA (multi-domain vertical alignment) mode, a PVA (patterned vertical alignment) mode, an ASV (advanced super view) mode, an ASM (axially symmetric aligned microcell) mode, an OCB (optical compensated birefringence) mode, an ECB (electrically controlled birefringence) mode, an FLC (ferroelectric liquid crystal) mode, an AFLC (anti-ferroelectric liquid crystal) mode, a PDLC (polymer dispersed liquid crystal) mode, a PNLC (polymer network liquid crystal) mode, a guest-host mode, and a blue-phase mode.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Note that each layer included in the above transistor can be formed using an inkjet method or a printing method. Thus, the transistor can be manufactured at room temperature, manufactured in a low vacuum, or manufactured to be over a large substrate. The transistor thus can be manufactured without a mask (reticle), a layout of the transistor can be changed easily. Alternatively, since the transistor can be formed without use of a resist, material cost is reduced and the number of steps can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Further, since a film can be formed where needed, a material is not wasted as compared to a manufacturing method by which etching is performed after the film is formed over the entire surface, so that cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The above is the description of one example of the structure of the transistor in this embodiment. However, the structure of the transistor is not limited to the above structure; the transistor can have various other structures.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">For example, a MOS transistor, a junction transistor, a bipolar transistor, or the like can be used as the transistor. By using a MOS transistor, in particular, the size of the transistor can be reduced. By using a bipolar transistor, in particular, a large amount of current can flow. Thus, a circuit can be operated at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">For another example, the transistor can have gate electrodes above and below a channel. A structure where the gate electrodes are provided above and below the channel gives a circuit structure where a plurality of transistors are connected in parallel. As a result, a channel region is increased, thereby increasing the current value. Alternatively, because a structure where the gate electrodes are provided above and below the channel causes a depletion layer to easily occur, a subthreshold swing (an S value) can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">For another example, the transistor can have the structure where a gate electrode is provided above a channel region, the structure where a gate electrode is provided below a channel region, a staggered structure, an inverted staggered structure, the structure where a channel region is divided into a plurality of regions, the structure where channel regions are connected in parallel or in series, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">For another example, the transistor can have the structure where the source electrode or the drain electrode overlaps with the channel region (or part thereof). The structure where the source electrode or the drain electrode overlaps with the channel region (or part thereof) prevents unstable operation due to electric charge accumulated in part of the channel region.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The transistor in this embodiment can be used for the semiconductor device or the display device in any of Embodiments 1 to 4.</p>

<p id="p-0210" num="0209">An example of a cross-sectional structure of a display device will be described in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> shows an example of the top view of a display device. A driver circuit <b>5392</b> and a pixel portion <b>5393</b> are formed over a substrate <b>5391</b>.

<p id="p-0212" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> shows an example of a section A-B of a display device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>. The display device includes a substrate <b>5400</b>, a conductive layer <b>5401</b>, an insulating layer <b>5402</b>, a semiconductor layer <b>5403</b><i>a</i>, a semiconductor layer <b>5403</b><i>b</i>, a conductive layer <b>5404</b>, an insulating layer <b>5405</b>, a conductive layer <b>5406</b>, an insulating layer <b>5408</b>, a liquid crystal layer <b>5407</b>, a conductive layer <b>5409</b>, and a substrate <b>5410</b>. The conductive layer <b>5401</b> is formed over the substrate <b>5400</b>. The insulating layer <b>5402</b> is formed so as to cover the conductive layer <b>5401</b>. The semiconductor layer <b>5403</b><i>a </i>is formed over the conductive layer <b>5401</b> and the insulating layer <b>5402</b>. The semiconductor layer <b>5403</b><i>b </i>is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>5403</b><i>a</i>. The conductive layer <b>5404</b> is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>5403</b><i>b </i>and the insulating layer <b>5402</b>. The insulating layer <b>5405</b> is formed over the insulating layer <b>5402</b> and the conductive layer <b>5404</b> and has an opening. The conductive layer <b>5406</b> is formed over the insulating layer <b>5405</b> and in the openings formed in the insulating layer <b>5405</b>. The liquid crystal layer <b>5407</b> is formed over the insulating layer <b>5405</b>. The insulating layer <b>5408</b> is formed over the insulating layer <b>5405</b> and the conductive layer <b>5406</b>. The conductive layer <b>5409</b> is formed over the liquid crystal layer <b>5407</b> and the insulating layer <b>5405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The conductive layer <b>5401</b> serves as a gate electrode. The insulating layer <b>5402</b> can serve as a gate insulating film. The conductive layer <b>5404</b> can serve as a wiring, an electrode of a transistor, an electrode of a capacitor, or the like. The insulating layer <b>5405</b> can serve as an interlayer or a planarizing film. The conductive layer <b>5406</b> can serve as a wiring, a pixel electrode, or a reflecting electrode. The insulating layer <b>5408</b> can serve as a sealant. The conductive layer <b>5409</b> can serve as a counter electrode or a common electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Here, parasitic capacitance can exist between the driver circuit <b>5392</b> and the conductive layer <b>5409</b>. Accordingly, an output signal from the driver circuit <b>5392</b> or the potential of each node can be distorted or delayed. This increases power consumption. However, the insulating layer <b>5408</b>, which can serve as a sealant, formed over the driver circuit <b>5392</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> can reduce parasitic capacitance between the driver circuit <b>5392</b> and the conductive layer <b>5409</b>. This is because the dielectric constant of the sealant is often lower than the dielectric constant of the liquid crystal layer. Therefore, distortion or delay of the output signal from the driver circuit <b>5392</b> or the potential of each node can be reduced. This reduces the power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Note that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref>, the insulating layer <b>5408</b> which can serve as a sealant can be formed over a part of the driver circuit <b>5392</b>. Even in such a case also, parasitic capacitance between the driver circuit <b>5392</b> and the conductive layer <b>5409</b> can be reduced, and thus distortion or delay of the output signal from the driver circuit <b>5392</b> or distortion or delay of the potential of each node can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Note that a display element is not limited to a liquid crystal element; a variety of display elements such as an EL element and an electrophoretic element can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Note that the structure of the display device in this embodiment can be applied to the semiconductor device or display device in Embodiments 1 to 5. For example, in the case where a non-single-crystal semiconductor, a microcrystalline semiconductor, an organic semiconductor, an oxide semiconductor, or the like is used for a semiconductor layer of a transistor, the channel width of the transistor is often large. However, by reducing parasitic capacitance of the driver circuit as in this embodiment, the channel width of the transistor can be made small. This reduces a layout area, so that the frame of the display device can be made small. Alternatively, the display device can have higher definition.</p>

<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In this embodiment, an example of a semiconductor device and an example of a manufacturing process of the semiconductor device will be described. In particular, an example of the manufacturing process of a transistor and an example of the manufacturing process of a capacitor will be described. In particular, a manufacturing process where an oxide semiconductor is used for a semiconductor layer will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A to 21C</figref> show an example of the manufacturing process of a transistor and a capacitor. A transistor <b>5441</b> is an inverted staggered thin film transistor. In the transistor <b>5441</b>, a wiring is provided over an oxide semiconductor layer with a source electrode or a drain electrode therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">First, a first conductive layer is formed over the entire surface of a substrate <b>5420</b> by sputtering. Next, the first conductive layer is selectively etched with the use of a resist mask formed through a photolithography process using a first photomask, forming a conductive layer <b>5421</b> and a conductive layer <b>5422</b>. The conductive layer <b>5421</b> can serve as a gate electrode. The conductive layer <b>5422</b> can serve as one of electrodes of the capacitor. Note that an example of this embodiment is not limited to this; each of the conductive layers <b>5421</b> and <b>5422</b> can include a portion serving as a wiring, a gate electrode, or an electrode of the capacitor. After that, the resist mask is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Next, an insulating layer <b>5423</b> is formed by plasma-enhanced CVD or sputtering. The insulating layer <b>5423</b> can serve as a gate insulating layer and is formed so as to cover the conductive layers <b>5421</b> and <b>5422</b>. Note that the thickness of the insulating layer <b>5423</b> is often 50 to 250 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Next, the insulating layer <b>5423</b> is selectively etched with the use of a resist mask formed through a photolithography process using a second photomask, so that a contact hole <b>5424</b> which reaches the conductive layer <b>5421</b> is formed. Then, the resist mask is removed. Note that an example of this embodiment is not limited to this; the contact hole <b>5424</b> can be omitted. Alternatively, the contact hole <b>5424</b> can be formed after an oxide semiconductor layer is formed. A cross-sectional view of the steps so far corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Next, an oxide semiconductor layer is formed over the entire surface by sputtering. Note that an example of this embodiment is not limited to this; it is possible to form the oxide semiconductor layer by sputtering and to form a buffer layer (e.g., an n<sup>+</sup> layer) thereover. Note that the thickness of the oxide semiconductor layer is often 5 to 200 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Next, the oxide semiconductor layer is selectively etched using a third photomask. After that, the resist mask is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Next, a second conductive layer is formed over the entire surface by sputtering. Then, the second conductive layer is selectively etched with the use of a resist mask formed through a photolithography process using a fourth photomask, so that a conductive layer <b>5429</b>, a conductive layer <b>5430</b>, and a conductive layer <b>5431</b> are formed. The conductive layer <b>5429</b> is connected to the conductive layer <b>5421</b> through the contact hole <b>5424</b>. The conductive layers <b>5429</b> and <b>5430</b> can serve as the source electrode and the drain electrode. The conductive layer <b>5431</b> can serve as the other of the electrodes of the capacitor. Note that this embodiment is not limited to this; each of the conductive layers <b>5429</b>, <b>5430</b>, and <b>5431</b> can include a portion serving as a wiring, the source electrode, the drain electrode, or the electrode of the capacitor. A cross-sectional view of the steps so far corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Next, heat treatment is performed at 200 to 600&#xb0; C. in an air atmosphere or a nitrogen atmosphere. This heat treatment leads to rearrangement of an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O based non-single-crystal layer at an atomic level. In this manner, through heat treatment (the heat treatment can be annealing with light), strain which inhibits carrier movement is released. Note that there is no particular limitation on the timing of when the heat treatment is performed, and the heat treatment can be performed at different timings after the oxide semiconductor layer is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Next, an insulating layer <b>5432</b> is formed over the entire surface. The insulating layer <b>5432</b> can be either single-layer or multilayer. For example, in the case where an organic insulating layer is used as the insulating layer <b>5432</b>, the organic insulating layer is formed in such a manner that a composition which is a material for the organic insulating layer is applied and subjected to heat treatment at 200 to 600&#xb0; C. in an air atmosphere or a nitrogen atmosphere. By forming the organic insulating layer that is in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer in this manner, a thin film transistor which has high reliability in terms of electric characteristics can be made. Note that in the case where an organic insulating layer is used as the insulating layer <b>5432</b>, a silicon nitride film or a silicon oxide film can be provided below the organic insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Next, a third conductive layer is formed over the entire surface. Then, the third conductive layer is selectively etched with the use of a resist mask formed through a photolithography process using a fifth photomask, so that a conductive layer <b>5433</b> and a conductive layer <b>5434</b> are formed. A cross-sectional view of the steps so far corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>. Each of the conductive layers <b>5433</b> and <b>5434</b> can serve as a wiring, a pixel electrode, a reflecting electrode, a light-transmitting electrode, or the electrode of the capacitor. In particular, since the conductive layer <b>5434</b> is connected to the conductive layer <b>5422</b>, the conductive layer <b>5434</b> can serve as the electrode of the capacitor <b>5442</b>. Note that an example of this embodiment is not limited to this; the conductive layers <b>5433</b> and <b>5434</b> can have the function of connecting the first conductive layer to the second conductive layer to each other. For example, by connecting the conductive layers <b>5433</b> and <b>5434</b> to each other, the conductive layer <b>5422</b> and the conductive layer <b>5430</b> can be connected to each other with the third conductive layer (the conductive layers <b>5433</b> and <b>5434</b>) therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">The transistor <b>5441</b> and the capacitor <b>5442</b> can be manufactured through the above steps. The transistor in this embodiment can be used for the semiconductor device or display device in Embodiments 1 to 8.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Note that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21D</figref>, an insulating layer <b>5435</b> can be formed over the oxide semiconductor layer <b>5425</b>.</p>
