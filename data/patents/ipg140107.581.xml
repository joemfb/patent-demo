No. 12/611,354, entitled &#x201c;HANDS FREE MEASURING INSTRUMENT&#x201d;, filed Nov. 3, 2009 by Louis A. Norelli, which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/112,903 entitled &#x201c;PLATFORM RULER&#x201d;, filed Nov. 10, 2008 by Louis A. Norelli, the entirety of each being hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to measuring instruments, and more particularly, to an instrument for assisting in the process of plumbing, leveling, or making straight any individual or interconnected objects of any shape for use by builders, carpenters, iron workers, masons, and other tradespersons.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The ruler, extension ruler, and tape measure are among the most commonly used measuring devices in the construction field. These measuring devices can also act as a guide or a gauge when building to plumb, level or straight is required. When undertaking a construction project, these qualities are essential to providing a professional and accurate product. This demand for accuracy creates challenges for a builder.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Different methods may be used by a builder to achieve plumb, level, and straight. When building to plumb or level, a builder can use a bubble level to fulfill these requirements. A bubble level's accuracy may be diminished by the length of the level relative to the length or size of the project being built. When a long horizontal span is required, the builder may use a dry line or laser to achieve better accuracy. For a vertical application, a plumb bob line or laser may used for better accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A useful skill in building to these requirements is the ability to fasten or secure material precisely and consistently. When setting up material to be fastened or secured, adjustments often need to be made to the material. However, when adjusting the material, a builder may often place the measuring device back in a tool belt, or otherwise put the measuring device aside, so that one or both hands can be used to adjust the building material. Occasionally, one hand can adjust material while the other hand holds the measuring device. When the desired dimension is found, both hands again may need to be freed to perform the fastening process. Consequently, a carpenter may be unable to assess or monitor the corresponding measurement until after the material is fastened or secured. Once the material is fastened or secured, the measurement will be checked again to ensure that the material did not move while fastening or securing the material. If the material moved during the fastening process, the fastening must be undone and the process repeated. This same procedure is needed not only for vertical applications, but for horizontal, levels and straights as well.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is directed to a measuring instrument adapted to facilitate hands-free measuring in one or more (e.g., upright, horizontal or upsidedown) orientations. In one envisioned embodiment, the disclosed instrument includes a base, and a body projecting orthogonally therefrom. The instrument may include ruler graduations, one or more bubble level vials, one or more notches adapted to operably engage a line (e.g., string) and/or one or more pilot holes. In an embodiment, the disclosed instrument includes one or more magnets to facilitate the mounting thereof on ferrous material. A spring-loaded spike assembly may be included in the instrument to facilitate the mounting thereof on wooden material, on gypsum-based materials (e.g., wallboard such as Sheetrock&#xae;, manufactured by USG Corporation of Chicago, Ill., United States), on composite materials (e.g., polymer-based materials such as Trex&#xae;, manufactured by Trex Company of Winchester, Va., United States), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosed instrument may provide utility for many different purposes, including without limitation, measuring, leveling, and squaring material. It is contemplated that an instrument in accordance with the present disclosure may be fixed in place temporarily, which may enable a builder to adjust material to its desired position, distance, and/or orientation, and fasten the material at the same time in a &#x201c;hands-free&#x201d; manner. It may remain in place to confirm that the fastening process was accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The base may be adapted for particular purposes. For example and without limitation, the base may be magnetized which may be useful when a builder is framing metal studs or metal door frames. The disclosed device may enable a carpenter to take vertical readings without manually holding the measuring device. The disclosed device may be positioned vertically for horizontal reading, either right side up or upside down, as is typically required when constructing fascias, soffits, or free standing walls. Metal track (e.g., suspended ceilings) can be lowered or raised to the corresponding dimensions established by the builder, with the use of a dry line or a laser line.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The base of the disclosed instrument may include a screw or other threaded means for attaching to wood, and/or may include a suction device (e.g., a suction cup) for attaching the base to glass or non-magnetic metals (e.g., aluminum). The base may provide a balanced and sturdy mounting that is well-adapted to the leveling of concrete (&#x201c;mud&#x201d;) floors, subfloors and raised flooring, e.g., computer room floors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the disclosed hands-free measuring instrument includes a base member having a top surface and a bottom surface. An upright member is coupled to the top surface base and extends orthogonally (e.g., at a right angle) therefrom. A first magnet may be disposed on a bottom surface of the base member to enable the instrument to be magnetically secured to a ferrous workpiece. A second magnet may additionally or alternatively be disposed on a vertical edge of the upright member. The instrument includes at least one bubble level vial disposed on the instrument, and may include one bubble level disposed horizontally on the base member, and/or one bubble level disposed vertically on the upright member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In embodiments, a spike assembly may be disposed within the instrument that is adapted to mechanically secure the measuring instrument to a workpiece. The spike assembly may include a shaft slidably disposed within the upright member. A top end of the shaft may extend upwardly beyond a top surface of the upright member. The bottom end of the shaft may include a spike tip coupled thereto. The shaft includes at least one stop member configured to limit upward and/or downward travel of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment in accordance with the present disclosure, a hands-free measuring instrument includes a base member having a top surface and a bottom surface, and a first magnet disposed on a bottom surface of the base member and configured to secure the measuring instrument to a workpiece. The instrument includes an upright member coupled to the top surface base and extending orthogonally therefrom, and a second magnet disposed on a vertical edge of the upright member and configured to secure the measuring instrument to a workpiece. The measuring instrument includes an adjustable ruler arm rotatable around a pivot adjacent to a top surface of the upright member. The pivot may be configured to selectively retain the adjustable ruler arm in a fixed position. At least one of the upright member or the adjustable ruler arm includes one or more detents configured to index the adjustable ruler arm to a predetermined position. The upright member may include a one or more angular graduations disposed on a face of the upright member. The one or more angular graduations may be numerated to indicate the angle at which the adjustable ruler arm is positioned relative to the upright member.</p>
