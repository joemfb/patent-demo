<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor light emitting device, a method of manufacturing the same, and a semiconductor light emitting device package using the same, and more particularly, to a semiconductor light emitting device that ensures a maximum light emitting area to maximize luminous efficiency and perform uniform current spreading by using an electrode having a small area, and enables mass production at low cost with high reliability and high quality, a method of manufacturing the same, and a semiconductor light emitting device package using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Semiconductor light emitting devices include materials that emit light. For example, light emitting diodes (LEDs) are devices that use diodes, to which semiconductors are bonded, convert energy generated by combination of electrons and holes into light, and emit light. The semiconductor light emitting devices are being widely used as lighting, display devices, and light sources, and development of semiconductor light emitting devices has been expedited.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, the widespread use of cellular phone keypads, side viewers, and camera flashes, which use GaN-based light emitting diodes that have been actively developed and widely used in recent years, contribute to the active development of general illumination that uses light emitting diodes. Applications of the light emitting diodes, such as backlight units of large TVs, headlights of cars, and general illumination, have advanced from small portable products to large products having high power, high efficiency, and high reliability. Therefore, there has been a need for light sources that have characteristics required for the corresponding products.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, a semiconductor junction light emitting device has a structure in which p-type and n-type semiconductors are bonded to each other. In the semiconductor junction structure, light may be emitted by recombination of electrons and holes at a region where the two types of semiconductors are bonded to each other. In order to activate the light emission, an active layer may be formed between the two semiconductors. The semiconductor junction light emitting device includes a horizontal structure and a vertical structure according to the position of electrodes of semiconductor layers. The vertical structure includes an epi-up structure and a flip-chip structure. As described above, structural characteristics of semiconductor light emitting devices that are required according to characteristics of individual products are seriously taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are views illustrating a horizontal light emitting device according to the related art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a vertical light emitting device according to the related art. Hereinafter, for the convenience of explanation, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, a description will be made on the assumption that an n-type semiconductor layer is in contact with a substrate, and a p-type semiconductor layer is formed on an active layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a horizontal light emitting device having an epi-up structure will be described first. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a description will be made on the assumption that a semiconductor layer formed at the outermost edge is a p-type semiconductor layer. A semiconductor light emitting device <b>1</b> includes a non-conductive substrate <b>13</b>, an n-type semiconductor layer <b>12</b>, an active layer <b>11</b>, and a p-type semiconductor layer <b>10</b>. An n-type electrode <b>15</b> and a p-type electrode <b>14</b> are formed on the n-type semiconductor layer <b>12</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>10</b>, respectively, and are connected to an external current source (not shown) to apply a voltage to the semiconductor light emitting device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When a voltage is applied to the semiconductor light emitting device <b>1</b> through the electrodes <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, electrons move from the n-type semiconductor layer <b>12</b>, and holes move from the p-type semiconductor layer <b>10</b>. Light is emitted by recombination of the electrons and the holes. The semiconductor light emitting device <b>1</b> includes the active layer <b>11</b>, and light is emitted from the active layer <b>11</b>. In the active layer <b>11</b>, the light emission of the semiconductor light emitting device <b>1</b> is activated, and light is emitted. In order to make an electrical connection, the n-type electrode and the p-type electrode are located on the n-type semiconductor layer <b>12</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>10</b>, respectively, with the lowest contact resistances.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The position of the electrodes may change according to the substrate type. For example, when the substrate <b>13</b> is a sapphire substrate that is a non-conductive substrate, the electrode of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>12</b> cannot be formed on the non-conductive substrate <b>13</b>, but on the n-type semiconductor layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, when the n-type electrode <b>15</b> is formed on the n-type semiconductor <b>12</b>, parts of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and the active layer <b>12</b> that are formed at the upper side are consumed to form an ohmic contact. The formation of the electrode results in a decrease of light emitting area of the semiconductor light emitting device <b>1</b>, and thus luminous efficiency also decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a horizontal light emitting device has a structure that increases luminous efficiency is illustrated. The semiconductor light emitting device, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, is a flip chip semiconductor light emitting device <b>2</b>. A substrate <b>23</b> is located at the top. Electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> are in contact with electrode contacts <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, respectively, which are formed on a conductive substrate <b>28</b>. Light emitted from an active layer <b>21</b> is emitted through the substrate <b>23</b> regardless of the electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>. Therefore, the decrease in luminous efficiency that is caused in the semiconductor light emitting device, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, despite the high luminous efficiency of the flip chip light emitting device <b>2</b>, the n-type electrode and the p-type electrode in the light emitting device <b>2</b> need to be disposed in the same plane and bonded in the semiconductor light emitting device <b>2</b>. After being bonded, the n-type electrode and the p-type electrode are likely to be separated from the electrode contacts <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>. Therefore, there is a need for expensive precision processing equipment. This causes an increase in manufacturing costs, a decrease in productivity, a decrease in yield, and a decrease in product reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to solve a variety of problems including the above-described problems, a vertical light emitting device that uses a conductive substrate, not the non-conductive substrate, appeared. A light emitting device <b>3</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, is a vertical light emitting device. When a conductive substrate <b>33</b> is used, an n-type electrode <b>35</b> may be formed on the substrate <b>33</b>. The conductive substrate <b>33</b> may be formed of a conductive material, for example, Si. In general, it is difficult to form semiconductor layers on the conductive substrate due to lattice-mismatching. Therefore, semiconductor layers are grown by using a substrate that allows easy growth of the semiconductor layers, and then a conductive substrate is bonded after removing the substrate for growth.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the non-conductive substrate is removed, the conductive substrate <b>33</b> is formed on the n-type semiconductor layer <b>32</b>, such that the light emitting device <b>3</b> has a vertical structure. When the conductive substrate <b>33</b> is used, since a voltage can be applied to the n-type semiconductor layer <b>32</b> through the conductive substrate <b>33</b>, an electrode can be formed on the substrate <b>33</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the n-type electrode <b>35</b> is formed on the conductive substrate <b>33</b>, and the p-type electrode <b>34</b> is formed on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b>, such that the semiconductor light emitting device having the vertical structure can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, when a high-power light emitting device having a large area is manufactured, an area ratio of the electrode to the substrate needs to be high for current spreading. Therefore, light extraction is limited, light loss is caused by optical absorption, luminous efficiency decreases, and product reliability is reduced.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a semiconductor light emitting device according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view illustrating the semiconductor light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Hereinafter, a description will be made with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A semiconductor light emitting device <b>100</b> according to the exemplary embodiment of the invention includes a first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>111</b>, an active layer <b>112</b>, a second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>113</b>, a second electrode layer <b>120</b>, a first insulating layer <b>130</b>, a first electrode layer <b>140</b>, and a conductive substrate <b>150</b> that are sequentially laminated. At this time, the second electrode layer <b>120</b> has an exposed area at the interface between the second electrode layer <b>120</b> and the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>113</b>. The first electrode layer <b>140</b> includes at least one contact hole <b>141</b>. The contact hole <b>141</b> is electrically connected to the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>111</b>, electrically insulated from the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>113</b> and the active layer <b>112</b>, and extends from one surface of the first electrode layer <b>140</b> to at least part of the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the semiconductor light emitting device <b>100</b>, the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>111</b>, the active layer <b>112</b>, and the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>113</b> perform light emission. Hereinafter, they are referred to as a light emitting lamination <b>110</b>. That is, the semiconductor light emitting device <b>100</b> includes the light emitting lamination <b>110</b>, the first electrode layer <b>140</b>, and the first insulating layer <b>130</b>. The first electrode layer <b>140</b> is electrically connected to the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>111</b>. The second electrode layer <b>120</b> is electrically connected to the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>113</b>. The first insulating layer <b>130</b> electrically insulates the electrode layers <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> from each other. Further, the conductive substrate <b>150</b> is included as a substrate to grow or support the semiconductor light emitting device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Each of the semiconductor layers <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> may be formed of a semiconductor, such as a GaN-based semiconductor, a ZnO-based semiconductor, a GaAs-based semiconductor, a GaP-based semiconductor, and a GaAsP-based semiconductor. The semiconductor layer may be formed by using, for example, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In addition, each of the semiconductor layers may be formed of any one of semiconductors, such as a III-V semiconductor, a II-VI semiconductor, and Si. Each of the semiconductor layers <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> is formed by doping the above-described semiconductor with appropriate impurities in consideration of the conductivity type.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The active layer <b>112</b> is a layer where light emission is activated. The active layer <b>112</b> is formed of a material that has a smaller energy bandgap than each of the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>111</b> and the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>113</b>. For example, when each of the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>111</b> and the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>113</b> is formed of a GaN-based compound, the active layer <b>112</b> may be formed by using an InAlGaN-based compound semiconductor that has a smaller energy bandgap than GaN. That is, the active layer <b>112</b> may include In<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x-y)</sub>N (0&#x2266;x&#x2266;1, 0&#x2266;y&#x2266;1, 0&#x2266;x+y&#x2266;1).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In consideration of characteristics of the active layer <b>112</b>, the active layer <b>120</b> is preferably not doped with impurities. A wavelength of light emitted can be controlled by adjusting a mole ratio of constituents. Therefore, the semiconductor light emitting device <b>100</b> can emit any one of infrared light, visible light, and UV light according to the characteristics of the active layer <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each of the electrode layers <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> is formed in order to apply a voltage to the same conductivity type semiconductor layer. Therefore, in consideration of electroconductivity, the electrode layers <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> may be formed of metal. That is, the electrode layers <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> include electrodes that electrically connect the semiconductor layers <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> to an external current source (not shown). The electrode layers <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> may include, for example, Ti as an n-type electrode, and Pd or Au as a p-type electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The first electrode layer <b>140</b> is connected to the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>111</b>, and the second electrode layer <b>120</b> is connected to the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>113</b>. That is, since the first and second layers <b>140</b> and <b>120</b> are connected to the different conductivity type semiconductor layers from each other, the first and second layers <b>140</b> and <b>120</b> are electrically separated from each other by the first insulating layer <b>130</b>. Preferably, the first insulating layer <b>130</b> is formed of a material having low electroconductivity. The first insulating layer <b>130</b> may include, for example, an oxide such as SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Preferably, the second electrode layer <b>120</b> reflects light generated from the active layer <b>112</b>. Since the second electrode layer <b>120</b> is located below the active layer <b>112</b>, the second electrode layer <b>120</b> is located at the other side of a direction in which the semiconductor light emitting device <b>100</b> emits light on the basis of the active layer <b>112</b>. Light moving from the active layer <b>112</b> toward the second electrode layer <b>120</b> is in an opposition direction to the direction in which the semiconductor light emitting device <b>100</b> emits light. Therefore, the light proceeding toward the second electrode layer <b>120</b> needs to be reflected to increase luminous efficiency. Therefore, when the second electrode layer <b>120</b> has light reflectivity, the reflected light moves toward a light emitting surface to thereby increase the luminous efficiency of the semiconductor light emitting device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In order to reflect the light generated from the active layer <b>112</b>, preferably, the second electrode layer <b>120</b> is formed of metal that appears white in the visible ray region. For example, the white metal may be any one of Ag, Al, and Pt.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second electrode layer <b>120</b> includes an exposed area at the interface between the second electrode layer <b>120</b> and the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>113</b>. A lower surface of the first electrode layer <b>140</b> is in contact with the conductive substrate <b>150</b>, and the first electrode layer <b>140</b> is electrically connected to the external current source (not shown) through the conductive substrate <b>150</b>. However, the second electrode layer <b>120</b> requires a separate connecting region so as to be connected to the external current source (not shown). Therefore, the second electrode layer <b>120</b> includes an area that is exposed by partially etching the light emitting lamination <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an example of a via hole <b>114</b> is shown. The via hole <b>114</b> is formed by etching the center of the light emitting lamination <b>110</b> to form an exposed area of the second electrode layer <b>120</b>. An electrode pad unit <b>160</b> may be further formed at the exposed area of the second electrode layer <b>120</b>. The second electrode layer <b>120</b> can be electrically connected to the external power source (not shown) by the exposed region thereof. At this time, the second electrode layer <b>120</b> is electrically connected to the external power source (not shown) by using the electrode pad unit <b>160</b>. The second electrode layer <b>120</b> can be electrically connected to the external current source (not shown) by a wire or the like.

The first electrode layer <b>140</b> includes at least one contact hole <b>141</b> in order to connect the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>111</b> to the external current source (not shown).

A small number of contact holes <b>141</b> may cause deterioration in electrical characteristics due to difficulties in performing current spreading. A large number of contact holes <b>141</b> may cause difficulties in forming the contact holes <b>141</b> and a reduction in light emitting area due to a decrease in area of the active layer. Therefore, each of the contact holes <b>141</b> is formed to have as small area as possible and allow uniform current spreading.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The contact hole <b>141</b> extends from the second electrode layer <b>120</b> to the inside of the first conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>111</b>.

Therefore, preferably, the contact hole <b>141</b> is electrically separated from the second electrode layer <b>120</b>, the second conductivity type semiconductor layer <b>113</b>, and the active layer <b>112</b>. Therefore, the first insulating layer <b>130</b> may extend while surrounding the contact hole <b>141</b>.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and Table 1, as the light emitting area increases, luminous efficiency increases. However, in order to ensure the light emitting area, the area of the distributed electrodes needs to be reduced, which reduces current density of the light emitting surface. The reduction in current density of the light emitting surface may deteriorate electrical characteristics of the semiconductor light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">However, this problem can be solved by ensuring current spreading by using contact holes according to the embodiments of the invention. Therefore, the deterioration in electrical characteristics that may be caused by the reduction in current density can be prevented by using a method of forming contact holes in the semiconductor light emitting device that do not extend to the light emitting surface for current spreading but are formed therein. Therefore, the semiconductor light emitting device according to the embodiments of the invention performs desired current spreading and ensures a maximum light emitting area to obtain desirable luminous efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As set forth above, according to exemplary embodiments of the invention, the semiconductor light emitting device can prevent emitted light from being reflected or absorbed by electrodes and ensure the maximum light emitting area by forming the electrodes of semiconductor layers, located in a light emitting direction, below an active layer except for part of the electrodes, thereby maximizing luminous efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, at least one contact hole is formed in the electrode to smoothly perform current spreading, such that uniform current spreading can be performed with the electrode having a small area.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, since the via hole is formed at the upper surface of the semiconductor light emitting device, alignment is not required during die bonding, and wire bonding can be easily performed. In addition, since the semiconductor light emitting device has a vertical structure, wire bonding and die bonding that can be easily performed at low cost can be used together when manufacturing a package. Therefore, mass production can be achieved at low cost.</p>
