<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method and system for stabilizing a spinal column and, more particularly, to a method and system of spinal fixation in which one or more screw type securing members are implanted and fixed into a portion of a patient's spinal column and a longitudinal member including flexible, semi-rigid rod-like or plate-like structures of various cross-sections (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;rods&#x201d; or &#x201c;plates&#x201d;, respectively) are connected and fixed to the upper ends of the securing members to provide stabilization of the spinal column.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Degenerative spinal column diseases, such as disc degenerative diseases (DDD), spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and so on, need surgical operation if they do not take a turn for the better by conservative management. Typically, spinal decompression is the first surgical procedure that is performed. The primary purpose of decompression is to reduce pressure in the spinal canal and on nerve roots located therein by removing a certain tissue of the spinal column to reduce or eliminate the pressure and pain caused by the pressure. If the tissue of the spinal column is removed the pain is reduced but the spinal column is weakened. Therefore, fusion surgery (e.g., ALIF, PLIF or posterolateral fusion) is often necessary for spinal stability following the decompression procedure. However, following the surgical procedure, fusion takes additional time to achieve maximum stability and a spinal fixation device is typically used to support the spinal column until a desired level of fusion is achieved. Depending on a patient's particular circumstances and condition, a spinal fixation surgery can sometimes be performed immediately following decompression, without performing the fusion procedure. The fixation surgery is performed in most cases because it provides immediate postoperative stability and, if fusion surgery has also been performed, it provides support of the spine until sufficient fusion and stability has been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional methods of spinal fixation utilize a rigid spinal fixation device to support an injured spinal part and prevent movement of the injured part. These conventional spinal fixation devices include: fixing screws configured to be inserted into the spinal pedicle or sacral of the backbone to a predetermined depth and angle, rods or plates configured to be positioned adjacent to the injured spinal part, and coupling elements for connecting and coupling the rods or plates to the fixing screws such that the injured spinal part is supported and held in a relatively fixed position by the rods or plates.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,193,720 discloses a conventional spinal fixation device, in which connection members of a rod or plate type are mounted on the upper ends of at least one or more screws inserted into the spinal pedicle or sacral of the backbone. The connection units, such as the rods and plates, are used to stabilize the injured part of the spinal column which has been weakened by decompression. The connection units also prevent further pain and injury to the patient by substantially restraining the movement of the spinal column. However, because the connection units prevent normal movement of the spinal column, after prolonged use, the spinal fixation device can cause ill effects, such as &#x201c;junctional syndrome&#x201d; (transitional syndrome) or &#x201c;fusion disease&#x201d; resulting in further complications and abnormalities associated with the spinal column. In particular, due to the high rigidity of the rods or plates used in conventional fixation devices, the patient's fixed joints are not allowed to move after the surgical operation, and the movement of the spinal joints located above or under the operated area is increased. Consequently, such spinal fixation devices cause decreased mobility of the patient and increased stress and instability to the spinal column joints adjacent to the operated area.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has been reported that excessive rigid spinal fixation is not helpful to the fusion process due to load shielding caused by rigid fixation. Thus, trials using load sharing semi-rigid spinal fixation devices have been performed to eliminate this problem and assist the bone fusion process. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,175, U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,688, and U.S. Pub No 2001/0037111 disclose dynamic spine stabilization devices having flexible designs that permit axial load translation (i.e., along the vertical axis of the spine) for bone fusion promotion. However, because these devices are intended for use following a bone fusion procedure, they are not well-suited for spinal fixation without fusion. Thus, in the end result, these devices do not prevent the problem of rigid fixation resulting from fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To solve the above-described problems associated with rigid fixation, non-fusion technologies have been developed. The Graf band is one example of a non-fusion fixation device that is applied after decompression without bone fusion. The Graf band is composed of a polyethylene band and pedicle screws to couple the polyethylene band to the spinal vertebrae requiring stabilization. The primary purpose of the Graf band is to prevent sagittal rotation (flexion instability) of the injured spinal parts. Thus, it is effective in selected cases but is not appropriate for cases that require greater stability and fixation. See, Kanayama et al, Journal of Neurosurgery 95(1 Suppl):5-10, 2001, Markwalder &#x26; Wenger, Acta Neurochrgica 145(3):209-14.). Another non-fusion fixation device called &#x201c;Dynesys&#x201d; has recently been introduced. See Stoll et al, European Spine Journal 11 Suppl 2:S170-8, 2002, Schmoelz et. al., J. of Spinal Disorder &#x26; Techniques 16(4):418-23, 2003. The Dynesys device is similar to the Graf band except it uses a polycarburethane spacer between the screws to maintain the distance between the heads of two corresponding pedicle screws and, hence, adjacent vertebrae in which the screws are fixed. Early reports by the inventors of the Dynesys device indicate it has been successful in many cases. However, it has not yet been determined whether the Dynesys device can maintain long-term stability with flexibility and durability in a controlled study. Because it has polyethylene components and interfaces, there is a risk of mechanical failure. Furthermore, due to the mechanical configuration of the device, the surgical technique required to attach the device to the spinal column is complex and complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,282,863 and 4,748,260 disclose a flexible spinal stabilization system and method using a plastic, non-metallic rod. U.S. patent publication no. 2003/0083657 discloses another example of a flexible spinal stabilization device that uses a flexible elongate member. These devices are flexible but they are not well-suited for enduring long-term axial loading and stress. Additionally, the degree of desired flexibility vs. rigidity may vary from patient to patient. The design of existing flexible fixation devices are not well suited to provide varying levels of flexibility to provide optimum results for each individual candidate. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,175 discloses a flexible spinal fixation device which utilizes a flexible rod made of metal alloy and/or a composite material. Additionally, compression or extension springs are coiled around the rod for the purpose of providing de-rotation forces on the vertebrae in a desired direction. However, this patent is primarily concerned with providing a spinal fixation device that permits &#x201c;relative longitudinal translational sliding movement along [the] vertical axis&#x201d; of the spine and neither teaches nor suggests any particular designs of connection units (e.g., rods or plates) that can provide various flexibility characteristics. Prior flexible rods such as that mentioned in U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,175 typically have solid construction with a relatively small diameter in order to provide a desired level of flexibility. Because they are typically very thin to provide suitable flexibility, such prior art rods are prone to mechanical failure and have been known to break after implantation in patients.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, conventional spinal fixation devices have not provided a comprehensive and balanced solution to the problems associated with curing spinal diseases. Many of the prior devices are characterized by excessive rigidity, which leads to the problems discussed above while others, though providing some flexibility, are not well-adapted to provide long-term stability and/or varying degrees of flexibility. Therefore, there is a need for an improved dynamic spinal fixation device that provides a desired level of flexibility to the injured parts of the spinal column, while also providing long-term durability and consistent stabilization of the spinal column.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, in a conventional surgical method for fixing the spinal fixation device to the spinal column, a doctor incises the midline of the back to about 10-15 centimeters, and then, dissects and retracts it to both sides. In this way, the doctor performs muscular dissection to expose the outer part of the facet joint. Next, after the dissection, the doctor finds an entrance point to the spinal pedicle using radiographic devices (e.g., C-arm flouroscopy), and inserts securing members of the spinal fixation device (referred to as &#x201c;spinal pedicle screws&#x201d;) into the spinal pedicle. Thereafter, the connection units (e.g., rods or plates) are attached to the upper portions of the pedicle screws in order to provide support and stability to the injured portion of the spinal column. Thus, in conventional spinal fixation procedures, the patient's back is incised about 10.about.15 cm, and as a result, the back muscle, which is important for maintaining the spinal column, is incised or injured, resulting in significant post-operative pain to the patient and a slow recovery period.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Recently, to reduce patient trauma, a minimally invasive surgical procedure has been developed which is capable of performing spinal fixation surgery through a relatively small hole or &#x201c;window&#x201d; that is created in the patient's back at the location of the surgical procedure. Through the use of an endoscope, or microscope, minimally invasive surgery allows a much smaller incision of the patient's affected area. Through this smaller incision, two or more securing members (e.g., pedicle screws) of the spinal fixation device are screwed into respective spinal pedicle areas using a navigation system. Thereafter, special tools are used to connect the stabilizing members (e.g., rods or plates) of the fixation device to the securing members. Alternatively, or additionally, the surgical procedure may include inserting a step dilator into the incision and then gradually increasing the diameter of the dilator. Thereafter, a tubular retractor is inserted into the dilated area to retract the patient's muscle and provide a visual field for surgery. After establishing this visual field, decompression and, if desired, fusion procedures may be performed, followed by a fixation procedure, which includes the steps of finding the position of the spinal pedicle, inserting pedicle screws into the spinal pedicle, using an endoscope or a microscope, and securing the stabilization members (e.g., rods or plates) to the pedicle screws in order to stabilize and support the weakened spinal column.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One of the most challenging aspects of performing the minimally invasive spinal fixation procedure is locating the entry point for the pedicle screw under endoscopic or microscopic visualization. Usually anatomical landmarks and/or radiographic devices are used to find the entry point, but clear anatomical relationships are often difficult to identify due to the confined working space. Additionally, the minimally invasive procedure requires that a significant amount of the soft tissue must be removed to reveal the anatomy of the regions for pedicle screw insertion. The removal of this soft tissue results in bleeding in the affected area, thereby adding to the difficulty of finding the correct position to insert the securing members and causing damage to the muscles and soft tissue surrounding the surgical area. Furthermore, because it is difficult to accurately locate the point of insertion for the securing members, conventional procedures are unnecessarily traumatic.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Radiography techniques have been proposed and implemented in an attempt to more accurately and quickly find the position of the spinal pedicle in which the securing members will be inserted. However, it is often difficult to obtain clear images required for finding the corresponding position of the spinal pedicle using radiography techniques due to radiographic interference caused by metallic tools and equipment used during the surgical operation. Moreover, reading and interpreting radiographic images is a complex task requiring significant training and expertise. Radiography poses a further problem in that the patient is exposed to significant amounts of radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although some guidance systems have been developed which guide the insertion of a pedicle screw to the desired entry point on the spinal pedicle, these prior systems have proven difficult to use and, furthermore, hinder the operation procedure. For example, prior guidance systems for pedicle screw insertion utilize a long wire that is inserted through a guide tube that is inserted through a patient's back muscle and tissue. The location of insertion of the guide tube is determined by radiographic means (e.g., C-arm fluoroscope) and driven until a first end portion of the guide tube reaches the desired location on the surface of the pedicle bone. Thereafter, a first end portion of the guide wire, typically made of a biocompatible metal material, is inserted into the guide tube and pushed into the pedicle bone, while the opposite end of the wire remains protruding out of the patient's back. After the guide wire has been fixed into the pedicle bone, the guide tube is removed, and a hole centered around the guide wire is dilated and retracted. Finally, a pedicle screw having an axial hole or channel configured to receive the guide wire therethrough is guided by the guide wire to the desired location on the pedicle bone, where the pedicle screw is screw-driven into the pedicle.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although the concept of the wire guidance system is a good one, in practice, the guide wire has been very difficult to use. Because it is a relatively long and thin wire, the structural integrity of the guide wire often fails during attempts to drive one end of the wire into the pedicle bone, making the process unnecessarily time-consuming and laborious. Furthermore, because the wire bends and crimps during insertion, it does not provide a smooth and secure anchor for guiding subsequent tooling and pedicle screws to the entry point on the pedicle. Furthermore, current percutaneous wire guiding systems are used in conjunction with C-arm flouroscopy (or other radiographic device) without direct visualization with the use of an endoscope or microscope. Thus, current wire guidance systems pose a potential risk of misplacement or pedicle breakage. Finally, because one end of the wire remains protruding out of the head of the pedicle screw, and the patient's back, this wire hinders freedom of motion by the surgeon in performing the various subsequent procedures involved in spinal fixation surgery. Thus, there is a need to provide an improved guidance system, adaptable for use in minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation procedures under endoscopic or microscopic visualization, which is easier to implant into the spinal pedicle and will not hinder subsequent procedures performed by the surgeon.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As discussed above, existing methods and devices used to cure spinal diseases are in need of much improvement. Most conventional spinal fixation devices are too rigid and inflexible. This excessive rigidity causes further abnormalities and diseases of the spine, as well as significant discomfort to the patient. Although some existing spinal fixation devices do provide some level of flexibility, these devices are not designed or manufactured so that varying levels of flexibility may be easily obtained to provide a desired level of flexibility for each particular patient. Additionally, prior art devices having flexible connection units (e.g., rods or plates) pose a greater risk of mechanical failure and do not provide long-term durability and stabilization of the spine. Furthermore, existing methods of performing the spinal fixation procedure are unnecessarily traumatic to the patient due to the difficulty in finding the precise location of the spinal pedicle or sacral of the backbone where the spinal fixation device will be secured.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As described above, the spinal fixation device is used for surgical treatment of spinal diseases by mounting securing members <b>2</b> at desired positions in the spinal column. In one embodiment, the rod <b>4</b> extends across two or more vertebrae of the spinal column and is secured by the securing members <b>2</b> so as to stabilize movement of the two or more vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a spinal fixation device in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention. The spinal fixation device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is similar to the spinal fixation device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> except that the rod <b>4</b> comprises a flexible middle portion <b>8</b> juxtaposed between two rigid end portions <b>9</b> of the rod <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides an exploded view of the securing member <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrating various components of the coupling assembly <b>14</b>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the coupling assembly <b>14</b> includes: a cylindrical head <b>16</b> located at a top end of the screw-type shaft <b>10</b>, a spiral thread or groove <b>18</b> formed along portions of the inner wall surface of the cylindrical head <b>16</b>, and a U-shaped seating groove <b>20</b> configured to receive the rod <b>4</b> therein. The coupling assembly <b>14</b> further comprises an outside-threaded nut <b>22</b> having a spiral thread <b>24</b> formed on the outside lateral surface of the nut <b>22</b>, wherein the spiral thread <b>24</b> is configured to mate with the internal spiral thread <b>18</b> of the cylindrical head <b>16</b>. In a further embodiment, the coupling assembly <b>14</b> includes a fixing cap <b>26</b> configured to be mounted over a portion of the cylindrical head <b>16</b> to cover and protect the outside-threaded nut <b>22</b> and more securely hold rod <b>4</b> within seating groove <b>20</b>. In one embodiment an inner diameter of the fixing gap <b>26</b> is configured to securely mate with the outer diameter of the cylindrical head <b>16</b>. Other methods of securing the fixing cap <b>26</b> to the cylindrical head, such as correspondingly located notches and groove (not shown), would be readily apparent to those of skill in the art. In preferred embodiments, the components and parts of the securing member <b>2</b> may be made of highly rigid and durable bio-compatible materials such as stainless steel, iron steel, titanium or titanium alloy. Additionally or alternatively, non-metal biocompatible materials may also be utilized such as polymers, elastomers, resins, ceramics, and composites thereof. Such materials are known in the art. As also known in the art, and used herein, &#x201c;bio-compatible&#x201d; materials refers to those materials that will not cause any adverse chemical or immunological reactions after being implanted into a patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in preferred embodiments, the rod <b>4</b> is coupled to the securing means <b>2</b> by seating the rod <b>4</b> horizontally into the seating groove <b>20</b> of the coupling means <b>14</b> perpendicularly to the direction of the length of the threaded shaft <b>10</b> of securing member <b>2</b>. The outside threaded nut <b>22</b> is then received and screwed into the cylindrical head <b>16</b> above the rod <b>4</b> so as to secure the rod <b>4</b> in the seating groove <b>20</b>. The fixing cap <b>26</b> is then placed over the cylindrical head <b>16</b> to cover, protect and more firmly secure the components in the internal cavity of the cylindrical head <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> illustrate perspective views of various embodiments of a rod <b>4</b> that may be used in a fixation device, in accordance with the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the rod <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> wherein the entire rod is made and designed to be flexible. In one embodiment, rod <b>4</b> comprises a metal tube or pipe having a cylindrical wall <b>5</b> of a predefined thickness. In alternative embodiments, the rod <b>4</b> may comprise a tube made from a biocompatible metal-synthetic hybrid material or entirely from a biocompatible synthetic material. Examples of biocompatible metals are: titanium, stainless steel, zirconium, tantalum, cobalt, chromium, nickel and alloys thereof. Examples of biocompatible synthetic materials are: polymers, elastomers, resins, plastics, carbon graphite and composites thereof. Such materials are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In one embodiment, in order to provide flexibility to the rod <b>4</b>, the cylindrical wall <b>5</b> is cut in a spiral fashion along the length of the rod <b>4</b> to form spiral cuts or grooves <b>6</b>. As would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the width and density of the spiral grooves <b>6</b> may be adjusted to provide a desired level of flexibility. In one embodiment, the grooves <b>6</b> are formed from very thin spiral cuts or incisions that penetrate through the entire thickness of the cylindrical wall of the rod <b>4</b>. As known to those skilled in the art, the thickness and material of the tubular walls <b>5</b> also affect the level of flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In one embodiment, the rod <b>4</b> is designed to have a flexibility that substantially equals that of a normal back. Flexibility ranges for a normal back are known by those skilled in the art, and one of ordinary skill can easily determine a thickness and material of the tubular walls <b>5</b> and a width and density of the grooves <b>6</b> to achieve a desired flexibility or flexibility range within the range for a normal back. When referring to the grooves <b>6</b> herein, the term &#x201c;density&#x201d; refers to tightness of the spiral grooves <b>6</b> or, in other words, the distance between adjacent groove lines <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example. However, it is understood that the present invention is not limited to a particular, predefined flexibility range. In one embodiment, in addition to having desired lateral flexibility characteristics, the rigidity of the rod <b>4</b> should be able to endure a vertical axial load applied to the patient's spinal column along a vertical axis of the spine in a uniform manner with respect to the rest of the patient's natural spine.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the rod <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> wherein only a middle portion <b>8</b> is made and designed to be flexible and two end portions <b>9</b> are made to be rigid. In one embodiment, metal end rings or caps <b>9</b>&#x2032;, having no grooves therein, may be placed over respective ends of the rod <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> so as make the end portions <b>9</b> rigid. The rings or caps <b>9</b>&#x2032; may be permanently affixed to the ends of the rod <b>4</b> using known methods such as pressing and/or welding the metals together. In another embodiment, the spiral groove <b>6</b> is only cut along the length of the middle portion <b>8</b> and the end portions <b>9</b> comprise the tubular wall <b>5</b> without grooves <b>6</b>. Without the grooves <b>6</b>, the tubular wall <b>5</b>, which is made of a rigid metal or metal hybrid material, exhibits high rigidity.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a further embodiment of the rod <b>4</b> having multiple sections, two flexible sections <b>8</b> interleaved between three rigid sections <b>9</b>. This embodiment may be used, for example, to stabilize three adjacent vertebrae with respect to each other, wherein three pedicle screws are fixed to a respective one of the vertebrae and the three rigid sections <b>9</b> are connected to a coupling assembly <b>14</b> of a respective pedicle screw <b>2</b>, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Each of the flexible sections <b>8</b> and rigid sections <b>9</b> may be made as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the rod <b>4</b> having a pre-bent structure and configuration to conform to and maintain a patient's curvature of the spine, known as &#x201c;lordosis,&#x201d; while stabilizing the spinal column. Generally, a patient's lumbar is in the shape of a &#x2018;C&#x2019; form, and the structure of the rod <b>4</b> is formed to coincide to the normal lumbar shape when utilized in the spinal fixation device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, the pre-bent rod <b>4</b> includes a middle portion <b>8</b> that is made and designed to be flexible interposed between two rigid end portions <b>9</b>. The middle portion <b>8</b> and end portions <b>9</b> may be made as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Methods of manufacturing metallic or metallic-hybrid tubular rods of various sizes, lengths and pre-bent configurations are well-known in the art. Additionally, or alternatively, the pre-bent structure and design of the rod <b>4</b> may offset a skew angle when two adjacent pedicle screws are not inserted parallel to one another, as described in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Additional designs and materials used to create a flexible tubular rod <b>4</b> or flexible middle portion <b>8</b> are described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a perspective, cross-sectional view of a flexible tubular rod <b>4</b>, or rod portion <b>8</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the flexible rod <b>4</b>, <b>8</b> is made from a first metal tube <b>5</b> having a spiral groove <b>6</b> cut therein as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>. A second tube <b>30</b> having spiral grooves <b>31</b> cut therein and having a smaller diameter than the first tube <b>5</b> is inserted into the cylindrical cavity of the first tube <b>5</b>. In one embodiment, the second tube <b>30</b> has spiral grooves <b>31</b> which are cut in an opposite spiral direction with respect to the spiral grooves <b>6</b> cut in the first tube <b>5</b>, such that the rotational torsion characteristics of the second tube <b>30</b> offset at least some of the rotational torsion characteristics of the first tube <b>5</b>. The second flexible tube <b>30</b> is inserted into the core of the first tube to provide further durability and strength to the flexible rod <b>4</b>, <b>8</b>. The second tube <b>30</b> may be made of the same or different material than the first tube <b>5</b>. In preferred embodiments, the material used to manufacture the first and second tubes <b>5</b> and <b>30</b>, respectively, may be any one or combination of the following exemplary biocompatible metals: titanium, stainless steel, zirconium, tantalum, cobalt, chromium, nickel, aluminum, vanadium, and alloys thereof. In alternative embodiments, the tubes <b>5</b> and <b>30</b> may be made from a biocompatible metal-synthetic hybrid material or entirely from a biocompatible synthetic material. Examples of biocompatible synthetic materials are: polymers, elastomers, resins, plastics, carbon graphite and composites thereof. Such materials are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a perspective, cross-sectional view of a flexible rod <b>4</b>, <b>8</b> in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, the flexible rod <b>4</b>, <b>8</b> includes an inner core made of a biocompatible metallic wire <b>32</b> comprising a plurality of overlapping thin metallic yarns, such as steel yarns, titanium yarns, or titanium-alloy yarns. The wire <b>32</b> is encased by a metal, or metal hybrid, flexible tube <b>5</b> having spiral grooves <b>6</b> cut therein, as discussed above. The number and thickness of the metallic yarns in the wire <b>32</b> also affects the rigidity and flexibility of the rod <b>4</b>, <b>8</b>. By changing the number, thickness or material of the yarns flexibility can be increased or decreased. Thus, the number, thickness and/or material of the metallic yarns in the wire <b>32</b> can be adjusted to provide a desired rigidity and flexibility in accordance with a patient's particular needs. Those of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine the number, thickness and material of the yarns, in conjunction with a given flexibility of the tube <b>5</b> in order to achieve a desired rigidity v. flexibility profile for the rod <b>4</b>, <b>8</b>. In alternative embodiments, the wire <b>32</b> and plurality of yarns may be made from a biocompatible metal-synthetic hybrid material or entirely from biocompatible synthetic materials, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows yet another embodiment of a flexible rod <b>4</b> wherein the flexible tube <b>5</b> encases a non-metallic, flexible core <b>34</b>. In various embodiments, the core <b>34</b> may be made from, for example, known biocompatible metals, biocompatible shape memory alloys (e.g., NITINOL), or biocompatible synthetic materials such as carbon fiber, Poly Ether Ether Ketone (PEEK), Poly Ether Ketone Ketone Ether Ketone (PEKKEK), or Ultra High Molecular Weight Poly Ethylene (UHMWPE).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a perspective view of another embodiment of the flexible rod <b>35</b> in which a plurality of wires <b>32</b>, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, are interweaved or braided together to form a braided wire rod <b>35</b>. The braided wire rod <b>35</b> can be made from the same materials as the wire <b>32</b> discussed above. In addition to the variability of the rigidity and flexibility of the wire <b>32</b> as explained above, the rigidity and flexibility of the braided rod <b>35</b> can be further modified to achieve desired characteristics by varying the number and thickness of the wires <b>32</b> used in the braided structure <b>35</b>. For example, in order to achieve various flexion levels or ranges within the known flexion range of a normal healthy spine, those of ordinary skill in the art can easily manufacture various designs of the braided wire rod <b>35</b> by varying and measuring the flexion provided by different gauges, numbers and materials of the wire used to create the braided wire rod <b>35</b>. In a further embodiment each end of the braided wire rod <b>35</b> is encased by a rigid cap or ring <b>9</b>&#x2032; as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, to provide a rod <b>4</b> having a flexible middle portion <b>8</b> and rigid end portions <b>9</b>. In a further embodiment (not shown), the braided wire rod <b>35</b> may be utilized as a flexible inner core encased by a tube <b>5</b> having spiral grooves <b>6</b> cut therein to create a flexible rod <b>4</b> or rod portion <b>8</b>, in a similar fashion to the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>. As used herein the term &#x201c;braid&#x201d; or &#x201c;braided structure&#x201d; encompasses two or more wires, strips, strands, ribbons and/or other shapes of material interwoven in an overlapping fashion. Various methods of interweaving wires, strips, strands, ribbons and/or other shapes of material are known in the art. Such interweaving techniques are encompassed by the present invention. In another exemplary embodiment (not shown), the flexible rod <b>35</b> includes a braided structure having two or more strips, strands or ribbons interweaved in a diagonally overlapping pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates a further embodiment of a flexible connection unit <b>36</b> having two rigid end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; and an exemplary number of spacers <b>37</b> interposed between the end portions.

<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> illustrates a side view of a spinal fixation device after it has been implanted into the pedicles of two adjacent vertebrae. As shown in this figure, the pedicle screws <b>2</b> are mounted into the pedicle bone such that a center axis <b>80</b> of the screws <b>2</b> are offset by an angle &#x3b8; from a parallel plane <b>82</b> and the center axes <b>80</b> of the two screws <b>2</b> are offset by an angle of approximately 2 &#x3b8; from each other. This type of non-parallel insertion of the pedicle screws <b>2</b> often results due to the limited amount of space that is available when performing minimally invasive surgery. Additionally, the pedicle screws <b>2</b> may have a tendency to be skewed from parallel due to a patient's natural curvature of the spine (e.g., lordosis). Thus, due to the non-parallel nature of how the pedicle screws <b>2</b> are ultimately fixed to the spinal pedicle, it is desirable to offset this skew when attaching a rod or plate connection unit to each of the pedicle screws <b>2</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref> illustrate perspective views of two embodiments of the fiducial pins <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, respectively. As mentioned above, the fiducial pins <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> according to the present invention are inserted and fixed into the spinal pedicle after passing through the hollow guider <b>102</b>. The pins <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> have a cylindrical shape with a diameter smaller than the inner diameter of the hollow of the guider tube <b>102</b> in order to pass through the hollow of the guider <b>102</b>. An end of each fiducial pin is a sharp point <b>111</b> configured to be easily inserted and fixed into the spinal pedicle of the spinal column. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>, the other end of the fiducial pin incorporates a threaded shaft <b>114</b> which is configured to mate with an internally threaded tube of a retriever (not shown) for extraction of the pin <b>112</b>. This retriever is described in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The fiducial pins <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are preferably made of a durable and rigid biocompatible metal (e.g., stainless steel, iron steel, titanium, titanium alloy) for easy insertion into the pedicle bone. In contrast to prior art guide wires, because of its comparatively shorter length and more rigid construction, the fiducial pins <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are easily driven into the spinal pedicle without risk of bending or structural failure. As explained above, the process of driving in prior art guidance wires was often very difficult and time-consuming. The insertion of the fiducial pins <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> into the entry point on the spinal pedicle is much easier and convenient for the surgeon and, furthermore, does not hinder subsequent procedures due to a guide wire protruding out of the patient's back.</p>

During this pin insertion procedure, a doctor strikes the trocar head <b>118</b> with a chisel or a hammer to drive the fiducial pin <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> into the spinal pedicle. In preferred embodiments, the pushing trocar <b>116</b> is in the form of a cylindrical tube, which has a diameter smaller than the inner diameter of the hollow of the guider tube <b>112</b>. The pushing trocar <b>116</b> also includes a cylindrical head <b>118</b> having a diameter larger than the diameter of the pushing trocar <b>116</b> to allow the doctor to strike it with a chisel or hammer with greater ease. Of course, in alternative embodiments, a hammer or chisel is not necessarily required. For example, depending on the circumstances of each case, a surgeon may choose to push or tap the head <b>118</b> of the pushing trocar <b>116</b> with the palm of his or her hand or other object.</p>

<p id="p-0143" num="0142">After the fiducial pins <b>110</b> or <b>112</b> have been inserted into the spinal pedicle as discussed above, in one embodiment, a larger hole or area centered around each pin <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> is created to allow easier insertion and mounting of a pedicle screw <b>2</b> into the pedicle bone. The larger hole is created using a cannulated awl <b>122</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. The cannulated awl <b>122</b> is inserted over the fiducial pin <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> fixed at the desired position of the spinal pedicle. The awl <b>122</b> is in the form of a cylindrical hollow tube wherein an internal diameter of the hollow is larger than the outer diameter of the fiducial pins <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> so that the pins <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> may be inserted into the hollow of the awl <b>122</b>. The awl <b>122</b> further includes one or more sharp teeth <b>124</b> at a first end portion for cutting and grinding tissue and bone so as to create the larger entry point centered around the fiducial pin <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> so that the pedicle screw <b>2</b> may be more easily implanted into the spinal pedicle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates a perspective cross-sectional view of a patient's spinal column when the cannulated awl <b>122</b> is inserted into a minimally invasive incision in the patient's back, over a fiducial pin <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> to create a larger insertion hole for a pedicle screw <b>2</b> (not shown). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, a retractor <b>130</b> has been inserted into the minimally invasive incision over the surgical area and a lower tubular body of the retractor <b>130</b> is expanded to outwardly push surrounding tissue away from the surgical area and provide more space and a visual field for the surgeon to operate. In order to insert the retractor <b>130</b>, in one embodiment, the minimally invasive incision is made in the patient's back between and connecting the two entry points of the guide tube <b>102</b> used to insert the two fiducial pins <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. Before the retractor <b>130</b> is inserted, prior expansion of the minimally invasive incision is typically required using a series of step dilators (not shown), each subsequent dilator having a larger diameter than the previous dilator. After the last step dilator is in place, the retractor <b>130</b> is inserted with its lower tubular body in a retracted, non-expanded state. After the retractor <b>130</b> is pushed toward the spinal pedicle to a desired depth, the lower tubular portion is then expanded as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. The use of step dilators and retractors are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">After the cannulated awl <b>122</b> has created a larger insertion hole for the pedicle screw <b>2</b>, in one embodiment, the fiducial pin <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> is removed. As discussed above, if the fiducial pin <b>112</b> has been used, a retrieving device <b>140</b> may be used to remove the fiducial pin <b>112</b> before implantation of a pedicle screw <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the retriever <b>140</b> comprises a long tubular or cylindrical portion having an internally threaded end <b>142</b> configured to mate with the externally threaded top portion <b>114</b> of the fiducial pin <b>112</b>. After the retriever end <b>142</b> has been screwed onto the threaded end <b>114</b>, a doctor my pull the fiducial pin <b>112</b> out of the spinal pedicle. In another embodiment, if the fiducial pin <b>110</b> without a threaded top portion has been used, appropriate tools (e.g., specially designed needle nose pliers) may be used to pull the pin <b>110</b> out.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In alternate embodiments, the fiducial pins <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are not extracted from the spinal pedicle.

In preferred embodiments, the rod <b>200</b>, and rods <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> and <b>240</b> described below, are comprised of a solid, cylindrically-shaped rod made of known biocompatible materials such as: stainless steel, iron steel, titanium, titanium alloy, NITINOL, and other suitable metal, metal-synthetic hybrid or non-metal materials or compositions, as discussed above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</figref>, spiral grooves <b>202</b> are cut or formed along at least a portion of the length of the cylindrical body of the rod <b>200</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the length of the rod &#x201c;l&#x201d; may be between 4 and 8 centimeters (cm), and its cylindrical diameter &#x201c;D&#x201d; is between 4-8 millimeters (mm). The spiral grooves <b>202</b> have a width &#x201c;w&#x201d; between 0.1 and 0.5 mm and a spiral angle &#x3b8; between 50 and 85 degrees from horizontal. The distance between spiral grooves <b>202</b> can be between 3 and 6 mm. However, as understood by those skilled in the art, the above dimensions are exemplary only and may be varied to achieve desired flexibility, torsion and strength characteristics that are suitable for a particular patient or application.</p>

As shown, spiral groove <b>202</b> is cut toward the center longitudinal axis of the cylindrical rod <b>200</b>. The groove may be formed continuously in a spiral fashion, as a helix or an interrupted helix for a solid or hollow rod, or are as disconnected circumferential grooves for a solid rod. If hollow rods have disconnected circumferential grooves formed in them, the grooves can only partially penetrate the rod material to avoid discontinuities. In one embodiment, the depth of the groove <b>202</b> is approximately equal to the cylindrical radius of the rod <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>, and penetrates as deep as the center longitudinal axis of the cylindrical rod <b>200</b>. However, the cross sectional area and shape of the rod, groove depth, groove width, groove cross-section shape, and groove to groove spacing of the grooved portion of the longitudinal member can be varied to adjust mechanical and structural characteristics as desired. For example, deepening or widening grooves increases flexibility, while increasing groove-to-groove spacing decreases flexibility. This can be used to modify extent of rod bending at a fixed bending force, custom tailor the bent shape of the rod, and equalize mechanical stresses in the rod during bending in order to minimize material fatigue and improve rod reliability.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</figref>, the angle from horizontal. &#x3a6; in this embodiment is approximately 90 degrees. However, it is understood that other angles &#x3a6; may be incorporated in accordance with the present invention. It is further understood that the dimensions, size and shape of the tunnels <b>232</b> (as well as tunnels <b>212</b>) may be varied to achieve desired mechanical and structural characteristics. For example, the cross-sectional shape of the tunnels <b>212</b> and <b>232</b> need not be circular. Instead, for example, they may be an oval or diamond shape, or other desired shape.</p>

<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a flexible rod <b>240</b>, in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention. The rod <b>240</b> includes a plurality of interleaved transverse tunnels <b>232</b> and <b>242</b> which are substantially orthogonal to each other and which do not intersect, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref>. In another embodiment, a cross-sectional view of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40B</figref>, adjacent tunnels <b>232</b> and <b>242</b> need not be orthogonal to one another. Each tunnel <b>232</b>, <b>242</b> can be offset at a desired angle &#x3c9; from its immediately preceding adjacent tunnel <b>232</b>, <b>242</b>. As can be verified by those of skill in the art, without undue experimentation, by varying the dimensions of the tunnels, their numbers, and their angular directions with respect to one another, various desired mechanical and structural characteristics for flexible rods used in spinal fixation devices may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Sometimes for multi-level spinal fixation procedures, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> for example, it may be desirable for one spinal joint to be rigidly fixed, while an adjacent spinal joint is dynamically (flexibly) stabilized. An embodiment of a longitudinal member to accomplish this function is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref>. Axial portion <b>254</b> of longitudinal member <b>250</b> is grooved to provide increased flexibility for bending, whereas axial portions <b>252</b> and <b>256</b> are not grooved and remain relatively rigid. The hole <b>258</b> is used to terminate the groove to prevent the formation of cracks and improve reliability. The use of such holes of expanded diameter to terminate grooves or slots in materials is well known in the art as a means of reducing peak mechanical stresses in materials and reducing the likelihood of material failure.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref> illustrates the assembly of the rod <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref> configured to be secured to a patient's spine using at least three securing members <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) having a flexible section <b>254</b> disposed between a first pair of securing members <b>2</b> and a non-flexible section <b>252</b> disposed between a second pair for securing members <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As a further embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41C</figref>, an extended ungrooved section <b>252</b> can accommodate a range of positions for a single securing member <b>2</b> to be placed. In another embodiment, extended ungrooved sections can be symmetrically disposed at either end of a grooved section. It is appreciated that the extended length of section <b>252</b> provides a &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; longitudinal member <b>250</b> that can accommodate various distances between the pedicle bones of adjacent vertebrae. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41C</figref>, the distance between the adjacent securing members, <b>2</b> and <b>2</b>&#x2032;, may be adjusted by selecting the location of the securing member <b>2</b> on section <b>252</b>. Any excess length of section <b>252</b> can then be trimmed away or removed.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Groove parameters such as groove depth, groove width, groove cross-section shape or profile, and groove to groove spacing of the grooved portion <b>254</b> can be uniformly constant for uniform structural and mechanical characteristics along the axis of the grooved portion <b>254</b>. Sometimes it is advantageous to have axially varying structural and mechanical characteristics for the longitudinal member in order to control local mechanical stress levels, custom tailor bending shapes, or affect resistance to bending in all bending directions or in selected bending directions. The cross-sectional area of a cylindrical (for example) hollow longitudinal member can be changed by changing the outer diameter, while maintaining constant wall thickness for the hollow cylinder. Another embodiment is to modify the wall thickness by adjusting the internal diameter (i.e. the diameter of the cavity within the cylinder) while keeping the outer diameter of the hollow cylinder constant. Still other embodiments simultaneously vary the external diameter and the internal diameter. It is easily seen how the above arguments also apply to longitudinal members with shapes that are not cylindrical.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref> illustrates a side view of a flexible, spirally grooved stabilization device <b>270</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The spirally grooved section <b>271</b> has an expanded outer diameter relative to ungrooved sections <b>262</b> and <b>262</b>&#x2032;. Whereas the spiral groove imparts increased flexibility to section <b>271</b>, it would also impart greater per unit area material strain to section <b>271</b> relative to ungrooved sections <b>262</b> and <b>262</b>&#x2032; because of reduced cross-sectional material area in section <b>271</b>, due to the presence of the grooves, if the outer diameter of spirally grooved section <b>271</b> were the same as the outer diameter of the ungrooved sections <b>262</b> and <b>262</b>&#x2032;. Expanding the outer diameter of section <b>271</b> can maintain acceptable material stress levels during the flexing of the spirally grooved section <b>271</b> for both the spirally grooved section <b>271</b>, and the ungrooved sections <b>262</b> and <b>262</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In one embodiment, if the longitudinal member of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref> is hollow, the inner diameter of the cavity of the spirally grooved section <b>271</b> can be the same as the inner diameter of the cavity of the ungrooved sections <b>262</b> and <b>262</b>&#x2032;, whereas the outer diameter of the grooved flexible section <b>271</b> is increased to reduce material stresses during bending and/or vary the flexibility of the grooved section <b>271</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A and 42B</figref> (discussed below) illustrate examples of a longitudinal spinal stabilization device wherein a flexible section has a different cross-sectional profile (e.g., outer diameter (in the case of a cylindrical rod) or perimetric shape than that of corresponding end portions of the longitudinal stabilization device.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In a further embodiment, the cross-sectional profile (e.g., outer diameter) of the grooved flexible section is kept the same as the cross-sectional profile (e.g., outer diameter) of the ungrooved sections, whereas the inner diameter of the cavity of the grooved flexible section is reduced relative to the inner diameters of the cavities of the ungrooved sections. This has a similar material stress reduction effect as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In still further embodiments of the present invention, both inner and outer diameters of the grooved flexible section can be varied with respect to the inner and outer diameters of the ungrooved sections to reduce material strain differences between the sections.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref> illustrates a side view of another embodiment of the present invention that accomplishes variation in flexibility along a longitudinal axis by adjusting the cylindrical diameter or cross-sectional profile of the grooved section <b>266</b> (while maintaining a constant inner cavity diameter for the case of a hollow longitudinal member) in order to achieve reduced mechanical stresses in the vicinity of transition sections <b>264</b> and <b>264</b>&#x2032;, between the grooved section <b>266</b> and ungrooved sections <b>262</b> and <b>262</b>&#x2032;, respectively. The outer diameter of the grooved section <b>266</b> is smallest near a central portion of the grooved section <b>266</b> and gradually expands toward the ungrooved sections <b>262</b>. This provides more cross-sectional material area to distribute forces through, thereby reducing per unit area stress in the regions of the grooved section <b>266</b> near the transition sections <b>264</b> and <b>264</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In another embodiment, axial variations of groove depth, groove width, groove cross-section shape, and groove to groove spacing can also achieve axially variant flexibility and mechanical characteristics, either alone or in combination with variance of the cylindrical cross-section as discussed above. For example: (i) tapering the groove depth from a maximum near the center of a grooved section to near zero at a boundary with a non grooved section (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref>); (ii) tapering the groove width from a maximum near the center of a grooved section to near zero at a boundary with a non grooved section (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</figref>); (iii) transitioning groove shape from one permitting maximum flexure near the center of a grooved section to a shape providing reduced flexure at a boundary with a non grooved section (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43C</figref>); or (iv) expanding groove to groove spacing from a minimum near the center of a grooved section to a maximum at a boundary with a non grooved section (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> illustrates a longitudinal member with an elastomer cladding <b>278</b> around the grooved section <b>276</b>. In this embodiment, elastomer cladding <b>278</b> covers only grooved section <b>276</b> and does not cover ungrooved sections <b>272</b>. Also optional tapers <b>274</b> are formed in the longitudinal member to provide for a smooth surface transition between clad and unclad sections. These optional tapers <b>274</b> also fixate the longitudinal position of the cladding. Alternately the cladding may be extended onto an ungrooved section <b>272</b>. The elastomer cladding may (i) contact only the surface of the longitudinal member, (2) additionally penetrate into the grooves of the longitudinal member, or (3) if the longitudinal member is hollow, additionally penetrate to and at least partially fill the inside of the longitudinal member. The elastomer cladding provides additional control over the axial and flexural stability of the longitudinal member, as well as providing a barrier between tissues and the grooved section.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The elastomer cladding can consist of any of a variety of medical grade elastomers, including, for example, silicone, polyurethane, polycarbonateurethane and silicone-urethane copolymers. The cladding can be applied to the longitudinal member using a variety of techniques that are well known in the art. In one technique, a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin can be injected into a heated mold surrounding the desired section of the longitudinal member, while it is affixed within a mold. An advantage of this injection molding process is that it can accommodate cladding material that are not of sufficiently low viscosity for application by alternate means at room temperature and pressure. A further advantage of injection molding is that the shape of the exterior of the cladding is determined by the shape of the mold that is used. Another injection molding advantage is the reproducible penetration of groove interstices and the interior of hollow longitudinal members. Alternative molding techniques include compression molding and transfer molding.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Other cladding application methods include liquid injection molding, dipping, spraying, or painting with a mechanical applicator such as a paintbrush. These methods require that the cladding material be applied in a low viscosity form. For an example a resin for application could be suspended in a solvent that evaporates after application. In another example, the cladding material is applied in a low viscosity form and subsequently cured through chemical, heat, or radiation methods. It is sometime useful to mask parts of the longitudinal member where application of the cladding material is not desired.</p>

If the materials of sections <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> have different bending characteristics, the rod of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45B</figref> will exhibit different bending behavior with applied force for the x and y directions. For example, if material <b>279</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45B</figref> is stiffer than material <b>277</b>, the rod will bend more easily in the x direction than in the y direction.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a metal hybrid longitudinal member with an elastomer cladding <b>278</b> around a wire portion <b>280</b> of the longitudinal member.

The wire may also be a single wire, multiple wires that are not braided (not shown), and may be coaxial with the end portions <b>262</b> or positioned eccentrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the end portions <b>262</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46B</figref>. The wire portion <b>280</b> may be straight as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A</figref> or curved, such as the wire <b>281</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46C</figref>. A straight wire <b>280</b> between end portions <b>262</b> provides greater resistance to tension than a curved wire <b>281</b>, which straightens as the longitudinal member elongates under tension. In one embodiment, the end portions <b>262</b> and wire <b>280</b> may be made from any desired and suitable biocompatible metal or metal-synthetic hybrid material discussed above with respect to rod <b>4</b> and wire <b>32</b>. In further embodiments, the cladding <b>278</b> may be made from any one or combination of suitable biocompatible synthetic or non-metal materials discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The stiffness of the metal hybrid longitudinal member in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A-C</figref> may be modified by varying the wire configuration within the elastomer cladding <b>278</b> as described above, or by varying the physical geometry of the wire <b>280</b> and/or cladding <b>278</b>.

<p id="p-0174" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47A</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a flexible connection unit having one or more spacers <b>37</b> between two rigid end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; with an elastomer cladding <b>278</b> covering the one or more spacers <b>37</b>. The connection unit further includes a wire <b>32</b>, which traverses a longitudinal axial channel or hole in each of the spacers <b>37</b>. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47A</figref>, the spacers <b>37</b> occupy substantially all of the space between the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; such that the plurality of spacers <b>37</b> are maintained in a substantially fixed position along a longitudinal axis direction between the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;. In other words, the spacers <b>37</b> do not move or slide substantially with respect to the wire <b>32</b> in the longitudinal direction because there is no space between the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; to do so. Each spacer <b>37</b> abuts an adjacent spacer <b>37</b> and/or end portion <b>9</b>&#x2032; such that it does not have room to slide with respect to the wire <b>32</b> or other flexible member located in the longitudinal axial channels of the spacers <b>37</b> between the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;. A cladding <b>278</b> is formed around each spacer <b>37</b> or around the entire group of spacers <b>37</b>. It is appreciated that the combination of the spacer <b>37</b> and cladding <b>278</b> forms a composite or hybrid spacer wherein the spacer <b>37</b> provides a first material of the hybrid spacer and the cladding provides a second material of the hybrid spacer. In one embodiment, the spacers <b>37</b> may be made from a biocompatible metal or metal-synthetic hybrid materials, as discussed above, and the cladding <b>278</b> may be made from any one or combination of suitable biocompatible synthetic or non-metal materials discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In another embodiment, the spacers <b>37</b> may be positioned along the wire <b>32</b> such that there is room between adjacent spacers <b>37</b> and the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47B</figref>. A cladding <b>278</b> is formed around the spacers <b>37</b> and the wire <b>32</b> such that substantially all of the space between adjacent spacers <b>37</b> and the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; is occupied by the cladding <b>278</b>. Thus, the cladding <b>278</b> limits the motion of spacers <b>37</b> and the wire <b>32</b> encased therein and provides additional rigidity to the flexible portion between the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;. The cladding <b>278</b>, spacers <b>37</b> and wire <b>32</b> may be made from any suitable material, including those discussed above with respect <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>47</b>A, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The cladding <b>278</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A</figref> &#x26; B is shown to encapsulate all of each of the metal-hybrid spacers <b>37</b> between the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the stiffness of the connection unit <b>36</b> may be altered by cladding only a portion of the spacers <b>37</b>, for example the space between the metal portion of the spacers <b>37</b> and the wire <b>32</b>, or the spaces between the spacers <b>37</b> and between the spacers <b>37</b> and the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The stiffness of the flexible connection unit described in the various embodiments above may be altered by selecting various biocompatible materials.

The spacers <b>37</b> may also be made from materials comprising known rigid polymers (e.g. UHMWPE, PEEK and polyurethane) or ceramics (e.g. alumina or zirconia).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> illustrates a further embodiment of a flexible connection unit <b>36</b> having a metal spacer <b>37</b> between rigid end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;, with an elastomer cladding <b>278</b> surrounding at least part of the rigid spacer <b>37</b>. The connection unit <b>36</b> further includes a flexible wire <b>32</b> positioned axially through the spacers <b>37</b> and end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;, wherein the spacer <b>37</b>, end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; and wire <b>32</b> are all physically separated by the elastomer cladding <b>278</b>. In such an embodiment, all elements of the flexible connection unit can move relative to any other element under mechanical load, restricted only by the flex, stretch and compression characteristics of the elastomer cladding <b>278</b>. Thus, the size and shape of the elements may be selected to withstand the loads on the human spinal column and to allow normal motion of the vertebrae to which the connection unit is attached. The metal spacer <b>37</b> and cladding <b>278</b> together form a metal-synthetic hybrid or composite spacer, wherein the elastomer cladding <b>278</b> separates the metal spacer <b>37</b> from respective rigid end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; and the metal wire <b>32</b> so that they do not rub against each other, thereby minimizing the generation of wear debris. It is a further advantage of this embodiment that the connection unit is flexible in all directions or degrees of freedom, and therefore will permit flexion, extension, lateral bending and axial rotation of the spinal column without a fixed or rigid mechanical restriction in any direction. The elastomer cladding <b>278</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> is concentric with the flexible wire <b>32</b>. In other embodiments (not shown), the wire <b>32</b> may be eccentrically located in the axial cavity of the spacer <b>37</b>, or multiple wires <b>32</b>, may be distributed throughout the axial cavity of the spacer <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The wire <b>32</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> is physically separated at both ends from the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;. This may be accomplished by cladding the wire <b>32</b> individually to create a metal-hybrid wire and assembling it with the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; prior to cladding the spacer <b>37</b>. Alternatively the metal-hybrid wire <b>32</b> may be clad by extruding elastomer around the wire <b>32</b> or sliding it into a pre-formed extruded elastomer prior to assembly. The latter method of manufacturing has the advantage of allowing the wire <b>32</b> to slide along its axis within the elastomer cladding <b>278</b>, thereby decreasing axial stiffness of the connection unit <b>36</b> relative to its flexural and shear stiffness. Those skilled in the art will recognize that if the flexible wire <b>32</b> is free to slide as described herein, then the flexural and shear stiffness of the connection unit <b>36</b> may be altered by varying the diameter of the wire <b>32</b>, with minimal change in the axial stiffness of the connection unit <b>36</b>. As known in the art, &#x201c;flexural stiffness&#x201d; relates to an amount that an object may bend and &#x201c;shear stiffness&#x201d; relates to an amount that an object can withstand lateral shear forces. &#x201c;Axial stiffness&#x201d; relates to an amount that an object can be stretched or compressed.</p>

Contact between the wire <b>32</b> and the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; may be sliding contact or fixed contact such as a press fit assembly, welded assembly or brazed assembly. If both ends of the wire <b>32</b> are in fixed contact with the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;, i.e. rigidly connected, the axial stiffness of the flexible connection unit is increased.

These embodiments may be easily manufactured by holding the metal portion of the spacer <b>37</b> in place relative to the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; in a mold, while the cladding <b>278</b> is applied. It is a further advantage of this embodiment that the circumferentially located spacer <b>37</b> limits the expansion and bending of the cladding <b>278</b> when the connection unit <b>36</b> is mechanically loaded.

<p id="p-0184" num="0183"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> illustrates a further embodiment of a spacer <b>37</b> and end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; in which the spacer <b>37</b> and end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; are physically separated by the elastomer cladding <b>278</b> and are configured such that they reinforce the elastomer cladding <b>278</b> when the connection unit <b>36</b> is mechanically loaded. The spacer <b>37</b> and end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; include overlapping portions that physically limit the shear displacement of the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; relative to each other without necessarily limiting axial displacement of the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; relative to each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> is exemplary of any number of combinations of shapes of a spacer <b>37</b> and end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032; that may be used to vary stiffness of the connection unit <b>36</b> in one or more directions. Those skilled in the art will recognize that this objective may be accomplished with overlapping features or simply by increasing or reducing the spacing between the rigid spacer <b>37</b> and the end portions <b>9</b>&#x2032;, or by adding additional spacers (not shown) and varying the spacing between adjacent spacers.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a connection unit <b>284</b> having two rigid end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b>, and a middle portion in which a flexible member <b>287</b> connects end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b> and traverses an axial hole in a metal-hybrid spacer <b>288</b>. In one embodiment, metal-hybrid spacer <b>288</b> is formed from at least one metal and one elastomer material, such that the metal part of the spacer <b>289</b> is configured to be accepted and retained by a securing member such as a pedicle screw or laminar hook, and the elastomer part <b>290</b> of the spacer <b>288</b> is located on opposite sides of the metal part <b>289</b> and adjacent to respective end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, when end portion <b>285</b> and metal spacer <b>289</b> are retained by respective securing members <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for example, and affixed to adjacent vertebrae, the connection unit <b>284</b> provides stability while simultaneously permitting motion to the vertebrae in six degrees of freedom (i.e., x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, pitch, roll and yaw). Although the end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b> substantially limit the motion of the metal-hybrid spacer <b>288</b> in the longitudinal axial direction, the compressibility and elasticity of the elastomer part <b>290</b> on both sides of the metal spacer <b>289</b> allows for stabilized motion of the metal spacer <b>289</b> relative to the end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b> and/or flexible connecting member <b>287</b> in each of the six degrees of freedom while also providing a resistance and stability of motion in each of the six degrees of freedom. Thus, in one embodiment, the connection unit provides a greater range of dynamically stabilized motion. Additionally, in one embodiment, the elastomer cladding <b>290</b> comprises a high-friction material that resists sliding of the metal-hybrid spacer <b>288</b> on flexible middle portion <b>287</b>, thereby providing further resistance to movement of the metal spacer <b>289</b> in the longitudinal axial direction. End portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b> are connected to respective ends of metal-hybrid spacer <b>288</b> using any of the techniques discussed above or other known methods. End portion <b>285</b> is configured to have sufficient length to be accepted and retained by a pedicle screw or other type of securing member. When the metal part <b>289</b> of the hybrid spacer <b>288</b> is coupled to and secured to a securing member <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), for example, end portion <b>286</b> extends beyond the securing member <b>2</b> (on the side opposite the space between the two securing members <b>2</b>). Thus, end portion <b>286</b> is configured to be short along the axis of the connection unit <b>284</b>, in order to minimize the length of the connection unit <b>284</b> that extends beyond the securing member <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In another embodiment (not shown), the flexible member <b>287</b> may be located eccentric from the central longitudinal axis of the connection unit <b>284</b>. This eccentric configuration provides different levels of stiffness, depending on the direction the connection unit <b>284</b> is bent. This may be advantageous if it is desired to provide a greater level of stiffness when the connection unit <b>284</b> is flexed during spinal extension (e.g., when a patient bends backward) and a lesser level of stiffness when the connection unit <b>284</b> is flexed during spinal flexion (e.g. when a patient bends forward). Additionally, or alternatively, different levels of stiffness v. direction of bending profiles may be achieved by applying different amounts or thicknesses of cladding <b>290</b> on one side of the connection unit <b>284</b> than on other sides of the connection unit <b>284</b>. Additionally, different amounts and/or types of cladding materials <b>290</b> may be applied on either side of the spacer <b>289</b>. Thus, the connection unit <b>284</b> can provide different levels of stiffness in different directions of movement of the spacer <b>289</b> and, hence, varying levels of stability can be provided to different directions of movement of a vertebra secured to the spacer <b>289</b> via a securing member <b>2</b>. In these embodiments wherein the level of stiffness of the connection unit <b>284</b> depends on the direction of bending, appropriate markings (e.g., laser etchings, physical features, etc.) may be placed on the connection unit <b>284</b> to indicate the proper orientation of the connection unit <b>284</b> prior to securing the connection unit <b>284</b> to a patient's spine.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> illustrates the position of two connection units <b>284</b> after they have been implanted and secured to respective vertebrae of the spine. For each connection unit <b>284</b>, the metal hybrid spacer <b>288</b> is fixed to the inferior vertebra <b>291</b>, and end portion <b>285</b> is fixed to the superior vertebra <b>292</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, the connection unit <b>284</b> provides allows for flexibility that takes into account the natural and anatomical motion of the spine. Because the intravertebral disc <b>293</b> and facet joint <b>294</b> are closer to the pedicle of the inferior vertebra <b>291</b> than the pedicle of the superior vertebra <b>292</b>, the flexible portion of the connection unit <b>284</b> provided by metal hybrid spacer <b>288</b>, when it is secured to the inferior vertebra <b>291</b>, is located off-center at or near the level of the natural joint in the spine, namely, the level of the intravertebral disc <b>293</b> and the facet joints <b>294</b>. This flexibility at the level of the natural joint allows for natural and anatomically correct motion of the spine.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Of course, if flexibility is desired at additional areas this may be achieved by duplicating the metal-hybrid spacer <b>288</b> and connecting member <b>287</b> at the opposite end of the connection unit <b>294</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>. Connection unit <b>295</b> is configured to be retained by respective securing members attached to both spacers <b>288</b>. The spacers <b>288</b> in connection unit <b>295</b> may be longer than the spacer <b>288</b> in connection unit <b>284</b> so that variability in the distance between vertebrae may be accommodated. In further embodiments, the connection units described above can be extended to stabilize two or more joints or spinal motion segments between three or more adjacent vertebrae, and affixed to respective vertebrae by three or more securing members (e.g., pedicle screws). Thus, in one embodiment, a connection unit includes a plurality of metal-hybrid spacers <b>288</b> for providing flexible stabilization to a plurality of joints or spinal motion segments. Additionally, the metal-hybrid spacers <b>288</b> may be alternated with rigid end portions <b>285</b> in any order or combination as needed by the surgeon. In this way, a hybrid multi-level or multi-spine segment connection unit may be designed, wherein each segment of the connection unit can provide a desired level of flexibility suited for each respective pair of inferior and superior vertebrae to be stabilized. For example, a first section of the connection unit that stabilizes a first pair of vertebrae may be very rigid, while a second section of the connection unit that stabilizes a second pair of vertebrae may be more flexible when compared to the first section. Numerous desired combinations of sections may be achieved to create a hybrid multi-level or multi-segment connection unit, in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In various embodiments, the flexible member <b>287</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52</figref>, <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> may be a solid member of rigid material, such as a biocompatible metal, preferably the same material as end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b> integrally formed with end portion <b>285</b> and permanently fixed to end portion <b>286</b>. Alternatively, connecting member <b>287</b> may be a wire, plurality of wires, braided cable or other structure for connecting end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b>. It will be clear to one skilled in the art that the structure, length and diameter of the connecting member will affect the flexibility of the connection unit <b>284</b>. Similarly, the metal-hybrid spacer <b>288</b> may be made of a biocompatible metal, preferably the same material as end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b>, and a biocompatible elastomer, for example, silicone or polyurethane and preferably polycarbonate urethane. The metal-hybrid spacer <b>288</b> is shown to be of substantially the same outside diameter as the rigid end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b>. Alternatively, the elastomer part of the spacer <b>290</b> may be smaller or larger in diameter, or may be variable in diameter. It will be clear to one skilled in the art that the flexibility of the connection unit <b>284</b> may be changed by the selection of the cladding material and varying its dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The non-metal or elastomer portion <b>290</b> of the metal-hybrid spacer <b>288</b> may be attached to the surfaces of the respective end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b>, the metal spacer <b>289</b> and/or the flexible member <b>287</b> by a variety of methods including those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50A-50D</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-55</figref>, the elastomer cladding <b>290</b> maintains the metal spacer <b>289</b> in a substantially fixed position with respect to the end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b>, while allowing some relative movement of the spacer <b>289</b> when external forces cause the cladding to bend or compress in any direction. Thus, in one embodiment, the flexibility of the connection unit <b>284</b> is substantially limited by the compressibility of the elastomer part <b>290</b> of the hybrid spacer <b>288</b>, which may be compressed in various directions by the motion of the metal part <b>289</b> of the spacer <b>288</b>, when the metal part <b>289</b> is fixed to the vertebral bone by a securing member <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a connection unit <b>296</b> with a metal-hybrid spacer <b>297</b> comprised of more than two different materials. The spacer <b>297</b> has a metal part <b>289</b> and an elastomer part <b>290</b> as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> and an additional bio-absorbable part <b>298</b>, shown external to the elastomer part <b>290</b>. The bio-absorbable part <b>298</b> of the metal-hybrid spacer is configured to substantially extend from each end of the metal part of the spacer <b>289</b> to the nearest end of respective rigid end portions <b>285</b> and <b>286</b> and to restrict motion of the metal part <b>297</b>, until bio-absorbable part <b>298</b> is softened or degraded in the body. The bio-absorbable part of the spacer <b>298</b> may be comprised of at least one material selected from a group of known bio-absorbable materials consisting of: polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polyglactic acid, polydioxanone, polyglyconate, calcium sulfate, calcium phosphate and combinations thereof. Other known bio-absorbable materials, and even those that will be discovered in the future, may be utilized in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In one embodiment, the connection unit <b>296</b> can be used after a spinal fusion procedure. In many cases, it is desirable to rigidly secure the spine with implanted devices during the period immediately postoperative to a fusion procedure, in order to allow the surgically placed bone graft to heal and effectively fuse the adjacent vertebrae together. After fusion is successfully achieved, it is desirable to remove the implanted devices to allow the bone graft to stabilize the spine independently. This creates load on the graft site and healthy remodeling of the bone graft for secure fixation long term. However, it is highly undesirable to perform a second surgery to remove the implanted devices. The connection unit <b>296</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> initially provides a more rigid stabilization following spinal fusion and then through a natural process the bio-absorbable portion <b>298</b> of the connection unit <b>296</b> degrades and becomes absorbed by the body, thereby reducing the stiffness of the connection unit <b>296</b> and allowing the bone graft to share a greater percentage of the load to stabilize the spine long term. The flexible connection unit <b>296</b> therefore allows a surgeon to transition the level of flexible stabilization from a first more rigid state to a second less rigid state, with only one surgical procedure. Needless to say, the elimination of a surgical procedure is a tremendous advantage to patients both from a health standpoint and a financial one.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The flexible connection unit <b>296</b> can be advantageously utilized in any situation where it is desirable to provide varying levels of stability. Additionally, the relative amount and type of bio-absorbable material incorporated into the connection unit <b>298</b> can be varied to alter the initial stiffness of the connection unit <b>296</b> and the time required to fully absorb all of the bio-absorbable portion(s) <b>298</b>. In one embodiment, two or more different types of bio-absorbable materials having different stiffness characteristics and/or absorption times can be utilized to provide transitions from multiple levels of stiffness. In a further embodiment, a connection unit configured to stabilize multiple spine segments can incorporate bio-absorbable materials in one or more flexible portions of the connection unit to provide varying states of flexibility by various flexible portions of the multi-spine segment connection unit. Additionally, the bio-absorbable material <b>298</b> may be applied to completely encapsulate a flexible portion (e.g., the metal-hybrid spacer portion) of a connection unit, or simply cover select portions of the connection unit, or fill gaps, spaces and/or channels of the connection unit. In other words, the application of one or more bio-absorbable materials <b>298</b> can be implemented in various ways to achieve desired initial and final stiffness characteristics for one or more flexible portions of a connection unit. Additionally, it is not necessary to combine bio-absorbable claddings <b>298</b> with non-bio-absorbable claddings <b>290</b>. Thus, in one embodiment, the elastomer cladding <b>290</b> of the connection unit <b>296</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> may be omitted altogether or replaced by the bio-absorbable cladding <b>298</b>, or another bio-absorbable cladding (not shown) having different stiffness and/or degradation/absorption characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> is an exploded view illustrating several features of a connection unit <b>300</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The connection unit <b>300</b> has first and second end portions <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> and a middle portion <b>304</b> in which a flexible member <b>306</b> connects end portions <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> and traverses an axial hole in a collar <b>308</b> and an axial hole in a metal-hybrid spacer <b>310</b>. The second end portion <b>302</b> is also referred to in this disclosure from time to time as the end cap <b>302</b>. The flexible member <b>306</b> can be formed integrally with the first end portion <b>301</b>, so that the first end portion <b>301</b> and a flexible member <b>306</b> are a rod-like element. In an alternative embodiment, the first end portion <b>301</b> and the flexible member <b>306</b> can be formed as two separate elements and secured together using any number of different securing methods, such as by use of adhesives, machine threads, welding, laser welding, press fitting, morse taper, or any other suitable method of securing presently known or that will be known in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The first end portion <b>301</b> and the flexible member <b>306</b> may be designed in a number of different ways for providing a desired stability to a patient's back, for example, substantially equal to that of a normal back. As is appreciated, varying the physical characteristics of the first end portion <b>301</b> and flexible member <b>306</b>, such as respective sizes and material composition, can change the flexibility characteristics of the connection unit <b>300</b>. For example, the first end portion <b>301</b> of the connection unit <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, has a larger diameter than the flexible member <b>306</b>. However, the dimensions need not be so limited, as other embodiments can have other dimensions such having the first end portion <b>301</b> and flexible member <b>306</b> with the same diameter or the flexible member <b>306</b> having a larger diameter than the first end portion <b>301</b>. The first end portion <b>301</b> can also be rigid, semi-rigid or flexible. In one embodiment, the first end portion <b>301</b> is flexible, but less flexible than the flexible member <b>306</b>. In addition, the first end portion <b>301</b> and the flexile member can be made of the same type of material or each can be made of different materials. In one embodiment, the first end portion <b>301</b> and flexible member <b>306</b> can be made of any suitable biocompatible metal, metal-hybrid or synthetic material discussed above with respect to the end portion <b>285</b> and flexible middle portion <b>287</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>. It is also understood that the first end portion <b>301</b> and the flexible member <b>306</b> can be made in accordance with the design and material specifications of any of the embodiments previously discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, a transition area <b>312</b> can be provided where first end portion <b>301</b> and the flexible member <b>306</b> connect. The transition area <b>312</b> can be tapered or stepped so that the change in diameter between the first end portion <b>301</b> and the flexible member <b>306</b> is gradual. This can reduce or eliminate stress points caused by a sudden change in diameter, as is understood by those skilled in the art. Thus, the transition area <b>312</b> can provide further strength to the device by, for example, reducing the stress associated with a change in diameter between the first end portion <b>301</b> and the flexible portion. In one embodiment, the transition area <b>312</b> is integral with the first end portion <b>301</b> and the flexible member <b>306</b> and is made of the same material as the first end portion <b>301</b> and the flexible member <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, which shows the connection unit <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> in an assembled state, the collar <b>308</b> can be positioned between the first end portion <b>301</b> and the metal-hybrid spacer <b>310</b> and over some or all of the transition area <b>312</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>). The collar <b>308</b> can provide an even surface for an end of the metal-hybrid spacer <b>310</b> to abut against; as opposed to the spacer <b>310</b> contacting the transition area <b>312</b>, which can provide an uneven contact surface. In one embodiment, the collar <b>308</b> is made of the same type of material as the first end portion <b>301</b> and the flexible member <b>306</b> discussed above, but may comprise a different type of material in other embodiments. Moreover, the collar <b>308</b> can be secured to the first end portion <b>301</b> or the collar <b>308</b> can be separate and &#x201c;float&#x201d; between the first end portion <b>301</b> and the spacer <b>310</b>. If secured, the collar <b>308</b> can be secured to the first end portion <b>301</b> using any number of different securing methods, such as by use of adhesives, machine threads, welding, laser welding, press fitting, morse taper, or any other suitable method of securing presently known or known in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the metal-hybrid spacer <b>310</b> can be similar to the metal-hybrid spacer <b>310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>. The metal-hybrid spacer <b>310</b> can include at least one metal ring element <b>314</b> and at least one resilient element or portion <b>316</b>. As best seen in the cross-sectional view of the spacer <b>310</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, the resilient element <b>316</b> can comprise multiple sections: a first bumper section <b>318</b> located on one side of the metal ring element <b>314</b>, a second bumper section <b>320</b> located on the other side of the metal ring element <b>314</b>, and an internal bumper section <b>322</b> located between the first and second bumpers <b>318</b> and <b>320</b> and substantially or completely inside the core of the metal ring element <b>314</b>. In one embodiment, each of the bumper sections <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> and <b>322</b> is formed integral with one another. However, in other embodiments, the bumper sections <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> and <b>322</b> can be non-integral or separate. In alternative embodiments, the resilient element <b>316</b> can comprise more that three bumper sections or fewer than three bumper sections for providing desired flexibility characteristics to the connection unit <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The resilient element <b>316</b> can consist of any of a variety of medical grade elastomers, including, for example, silicone, polyurethane, polycarbonateurethane and silicone-urethane copolymers. It is understood that the resilient element <b>316</b> can be made from other suitable non-metal materials such as those described above. In alternative embodiments, the resilient element <b>316</b> may be implemented as a helical metal spring, disc spring, wave spring or other resilient structures. The resilient element <b>316</b> can be formed on the sides of and within the core of the metal ring element <b>314</b> using a variety of techniques that are well known in the art. In one technique, a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin can be injected into a heated mold, while the metal ring element <b>314</b> is affixed within a mold. An advantage of this injection molding process is that it can accommodate elastomer materials that are not of sufficiently low viscosity for application by alternate means at room temperature and pressure. As is understood, the mold can be shaped to form the hollow axial core of the spacer <b>310</b>, or the hollow axial core can be formed by cutting out elastomer after the molding process is finished. A further advantage of injection molding is that the shape of the exterior of the cladding is determined by the shape of the mold that is used. Alternative molding techniques include compression molding and transfer molding.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In accordance with one embodiment, the stiffness of one of the bumper sections <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> or <b>322</b> can be different from one or more of the other bumper sections <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> or <b>322</b>. Specifically, the stiffness of each bumper can be independently tuned by adjusting the physical properties of the bumper. For example, as is appreciated by those skilled in the art, the stiffness can be modified by changing the length, diameter, ratio of diameters, placement and material composition of one or more of the bumper sections. Additionally, the resistance provided by bumper regions may be adjusted by changing the length of the spacing provided for the resilient element between the first and second ends of the connection unit, thereby compressively biasing the resilient element. In one embodiment, the length of the spacing provided between the first and second ends may be adjusted by selecting a collar <b>308</b> of desired dimensions. Other techniques for adjusting this length would be readily apparent to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Deformation zones can also be provided for controlling the deformation of the resilient element <b>316</b>. Deformations zones can have the desired effect of providing a more predictive and consistent response to compressive forces. For example, because most buckling of an resilient element <b>316</b> having deformation zones occurs at the deformation zones, it can be easier to predict the resilient element's <b>316</b> response. In contrast, an absence of deformation zones can result in deformation at any number of different locations about the elastomer portion <b>316</b>. For example, a resilient element <b>316</b> not having a defined deformation zone may buckle at one location in response to a compressive force that is applied a first time, but buckle at a different, second location when the exact same compressive force is applied a second time. As is appreciated by those skilled in the art, buckling at different locations can provide different responses to the same compressive force. Consequently, it can be difficult to predict the response of an elastomer portion that does not have predefined deformation zones.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In one embodiment of the present invention, predefined deformation zones are formed by contouring the shape of the resilient element <b>316</b> so that it buckles at the predefined deformation zones. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, the first bumper <b>318</b> is contoured to have a reduced diameter its center, thereby defining a first predefined deformation zone <b>324</b>, and the second bumper is contoured to have a reduced diameter its center, thereby defining a second predefined deformation zone <b>326</b>. Accordingly, the resilient element <b>316</b> is configured to buckle at the first deformation zone <b>324</b> when ring element <b>314</b> translates in, for example, a longitudinal axial direction toward the first deformation zone <b>324</b>, and buckle at the second deformation zone <b>326</b> when the ring element <b>314</b> translates in, for example, a longitudinal axial direction toward the second deformation zone <b>326</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Similar to the metal part <b>289</b> referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, the metal ring element <b>314</b> can be configured to be accepted and retained by a securing member such as the securing member <b>2</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. To help properly position the ring element <b>314</b> in a securing member, shoulders <b>328</b><i>a </i>and <b>328</b><i>b </i>can be provided at respective ends of the ring element <b>314</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57 and 58</figref>. For example, positioning the head <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the securing member <b>2</b> between the shoulders <b>328</b><i>a </i>and <b>328</b><i>b </i>can provide assurance that the ring element <b>314</b> is positioned correctly in the securing member <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In one embodiment, the shoulders <b>328</b><i>a </i>and <b>328</b><i>b </i>may also be sized so that a fastening member, such as the threaded nut <b>22</b> or the cap member <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, cannot be fastened to a screw mount, such as head <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if the shoulders <b>328</b><i>a </i>and <b>328</b><i>b </i>are not positioned properly. For example, the shoulders <b>328</b><i>a </i>and <b>328</b><i>b </i>may be required to be positioned on either side of the screw head <b>16</b>; otherwise, if one of the shoulders <b>328</b><i>a </i>or <b>328</b><i>b </i>is inside the screw head <b>16</b>, then the nut <b>22</b> cannot be properly inserted into the head <b>16</b> because the shoulder <b>328</b> extends at least partially into the area of the head <b>16</b> configured to receive the nut <b>22</b>. As a result, a person securing the ring element <b>314</b> to the securing member <b>2</b> should realize that the ring element <b>314</b> is not positioned properly in the head <b>16</b> if the nut <b>22</b> cannot be properly fastened to the securing member <b>2</b>. Thus, if unable to fasten the nut <b>22</b>, the person installing the connection unit <b>300</b> should reposition the ring element <b>314</b> within the head <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, in particular the magnified view of the spacer <b>310</b>, the interior edges of the ring element <b>314</b> may be trumpeted. As used herein, the term trumpeted can be defined as rounded out or flared. In one embodiment, the inner diameter of the ring element <b>314</b> is substantially constant in the center portion of the metal ring element <b>314</b>, but increases (i.e., is trumpeted) near the ends of the ring element <b>314</b>. In a further embodiment, the inner diameter is smallest at the center and gradually increases toward the ends of the ring element <b>314</b> so that the longitudinal cross-sectional shape of the interior surface of the ring element <b>314</b> has a constant radius of curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Trumpeting the ends of the ring element <b>314</b> can provide several benefits. First, trumpeting the ends can provide more surface area between the ring element <b>314</b> and the resilient element <b>316</b> than if the inner surface of the ring element <b>314</b> had, for example, sharp corners at the edges. The additional surface area can result in less contact stress, which can reduce the likelihood of the ring element <b>314</b> cutting the resilient element <b>316</b>, especially at the edges of the ring element <b>314</b>. Trumpeting the ends can also facilitate toggling rotation of the ring element <b>314</b>. Toggling rotation permits a more natural motion of the spine, and is discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59</figref><i>a </i>and <b>59</b><i>b </i>depict a further embodiment of a ring element <b>414</b> in accordance with the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref><i>a </i>is a perspective view of the ring element <b>414</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref><i>b </i>is a front cross-sectional view of the ring element <b>414</b>. As shown, the ring element <b>414</b> is similar to the ring element <b>314</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56-58</figref>, except that the ring element <b>414</b> has a generally D-like cross-sectional shape. The ring element <b>414</b> is referred to in this disclosure from time to time as a &#x201c;D-ring.&#x201d; Also, similar to the ring element <b>314</b>, the D-ring <b>414</b> can have trumpeted ends <b>330</b> as well as shoulders <b>328</b><i>a</i>, <b>328</b><i>b</i>. It is believed that the cross-sectional shape of the D-ring <b>414</b> can distribute a compressive load resulting from a locking cap (e.g. nut <b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) compressing down onto a flat top surface <b>332</b> of the ring <b>414</b> better than most other configurations. The D-ring's <b>414</b> ability to better distribute this type of compressive load can reduce or altogether avoid localized buckling, thereby enabling higher locking torques and the use of thinner ring walls.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the end cap <b>302</b> is fastened to an end of the flexible member <b>306</b> and retains the collar <b>308</b> and the spacer <b>310</b> between the first end <b>301</b> and the end cap <b>302</b>. In one embodiment, the end cap <b>302</b> has an axial core with internal threads (not shown). The end cap <b>302</b> can be secured to the flexible member <b>306</b> by threading the internal threads with corresponding external threads <b>334</b> located at an end of the flexible member <b>306</b>. Once threaded together, an outside seam (not shown) between the flexible member <b>306</b> and the end cap <b>302</b> can be laser welded to further secure the end cap <b>302</b> to the flexible member <b>306</b>. In other embodiments, the end cap <b>302</b> may be secured to the first end portion <b>301</b> using any number of different securing methods, including but not limited to press fitting, use of adhesives, swaging and morse taper.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, a shoulder <b>336</b> can be formed on the flexible member <b>306</b> for preventing the end cap <b>302</b> from traveling along the longitudinal axis of the flexible member <b>306</b> past a predetermined distance when being secured to the flexible member <b>306</b>. Advantageously, the predetermined distance can be associated with a desired preload on the spacer <b>310</b>. This is because when assembling the connection unit <b>300</b>, the resilient element <b>316</b> of the spacer <b>310</b> may be compressed to some extent after the end cap <b>302</b> is attached. This may happen, for example, if the spacer <b>310</b> in its uncompressed state has a longitudinal length that is longer than the length between the collar <b>308</b> and the end cap <b>302</b>. Accordingly, the amount the spacer <b>310</b> is compressed after the end cap <b>302</b> is attached can correspond to a preload amount.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">In one embodiment, the spacer <b>310</b> having a preload provides a first level of resistance to a longitudinal movement of the metal ring <b>314</b> until the preload is overcome. Once the preload is overcome, the spacer <b>310</b> provides a second level of resistance, which is less than the first level of resistance. Because it is believed that most people dealing with spine pain typically feel most the their pain during an initial range of motion of the spine, but do not feel as much pain after the initial range of motion, the spacer <b>310</b> can be configured with a preload that provides more support (e.g. more resistance) during the initial, painful range of motion and less support (e.g. less resistance) after the initial range of motion.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">As described above, in one embodiment, the spacer <b>310</b> is not affixed to the collar <b>308</b>, end cap <b>302</b> or of flexible member <b>306</b> and, therefore, can separate from the end cap <b>302</b> or collar <b>308</b> after a preload associated with the spacer <b>310</b> has been overcome. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the spacer <b>310</b> only resists compression and does not resist motion by tension or elongation. By configuring the spacer <b>310</b> to resist compression only, it is believed that the connection unit <b>300</b> can provide better dynamic support during motion of the spine.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, when end portion <b>301</b> and spacer <b>310</b> are retained by respective securing members <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for example, and affixed to adjacent vertebrae, the connection unit <b>300</b> provides stability while simultaneously permitting motion to the vertebrae in six degrees of freedom (i.e., x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, pitch, roll and yaw). Movement of the metal ring element <b>314</b> in a pitch, roll, yaw or combination thereof may also be referred to in this disclosure as a &#x201c;toggling&#x201d; motion. Although the end portions <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> substantially limit the motion of the spacer <b>310</b> in the longitudinal axial direction, the compressibility and elasticity of the resilient element <b>316</b> on both sides of the metal ring element <b>314</b> and between the metal ring element <b>314</b> and the flexible member <b>306</b> allows for stabilized motion of the metal ring element <b>314</b> relative to the end portions <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> and/or flexible member <b>306</b> in each of the six degrees of freedom while also providing a resistance and stability of motion in each of the six degrees of freedom. Thus, in one embodiment, the connection unit <b>300</b> provides a greater range of dynamically stabilized motion. Additionally, in one embodiment, the resilient element <b>316</b> permits sliding of the metal-hybrid spacer <b>310</b> on flexible member <b>306</b>, thereby providing further movement of the metal ring element <b>314</b> in the longitudinal axial direction. In one embodiment, the metal hybrid spacer <b>310</b> floats between end portions <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> (i.e. the spacer <b>310</b> is not affixed to respective ends portions <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> or collar <b>308</b>) so that the metal-hybrid spacer <b>310</b> can be physically separated from the end cap <b>302</b> or collar <b>308</b> in response to a sufficient longitudinal axial force.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a connection unit <b>500</b> in accordance with the present invention. Connection unit <b>500</b> is similar to connection unit <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, except that the spacer <b>310</b> is comprised of single resilient element <b>510</b> rather than the metal-hybrid spacer <b>310</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>. In this embodiment, the single resilient element <b>510</b> is configured to be directly received within a correspondingly shaped securing head of a bone securing member (e.g., ring-shaped head of a pedicle screw). Thus, the securing head of the bone securing member assumes the functionality of the ring element <b>314</b> of the metal-hybrid spacer. When the resilient element <b>510</b> is received within and secured to the securing head of a bone securing member, the resilient element <b>510</b> functions to provide dynamic resistance against relative motion of the bone securing member in at least five degrees of freedom, excluding rotation about a longitudinal axis of the connection unit. In an alternative embodiment, the resilient element <b>510</b> provides sufficient friction against the flexible member <b>306</b> located within the axial channel of the resilient element <b>510</b> so as to provide resistance to motion of the bone securing member in all six degrees of freedom.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> is a perspective view of a flexible connection unit <b>600</b>, in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. Connection unit <b>600</b> is similar to connection units <b>300</b> and <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56 and 60</figref>, respectively, except that the spacer <b>610</b> of connection unit <b>600</b> includes a ring element <b>612</b> interposed between resilient spring elements <b>614</b> and <b>616</b>. The ring element <b>612</b> is configured to be engaged with a securing head of a bone securing member (e.g., pedicle screw) and the resilient spring elements <b>614</b> and <b>616</b> provide resistance to longitudinal movement (e.g., sliding) of the ring element <b>612</b> along a longitudinal axis of the flexible element <b>306</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, the spacer <b>610</b> is positioned between a first end <b>301</b> and a second end <b>302</b>, comprising end cap <b>302</b>, as described above. A collar <b>308</b> is interposed between the spacer <b>610</b> and the first end <b>301</b>. As discussed above, the collar <b>308</b> can provide an even surface for an end of the metal-hybrid spacer <b>310</b> to abut against; as opposed to the spacer <b>310</b> contacting a transition area <b>312</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>), which can provide an uneven contact surface.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Various embodiments of the connection units discussed in this disclosure can have several other advantages. First, some of the embodiments have a similar profile to conventional spinal fixation devices consisting of a metal rod secured to vertebrae via securing members. Because embodiments of connection units in accordance with the present invention can have a similar profile to a metal rod, the embodiments disclosed herein can have the advantage of being installed using conventional spinal fixation instrumentation. Furthermore, the low profile associated with many of the connection unit embodiments occupies less room in the patient, thereby resulting in less interference with the patient's range of motion, among other things.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Various embodiments of the invention have been described above. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the above descriptions of the preferred embodiments are exemplary only and that the invention may be practiced with modifications or variations of the devices and techniques disclosed above. Those of ordinary skill in the art will know, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein.
