<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Conventional data centers are known to include a number of sensors positioned to detect various conditions at locations of interest in the data centers. The conditions include, for example, temperature, pressure, vibration, humidity, energy consumption, and airflow direction and velocity. The locations of interest have included inlets and outlets of electronics cabinets, inlets and outlets of air conditioning units, and outlets of ventilation tiles.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The sensors have also been networked to a database system to enable constant streaming of data to the database system. The database system often aggregates the streaming data, for instance, to monitor the network of sensors. Conventional database systems often receive massive amounts of streaming data from the sensors, which typically makes the database systems prohibitively slow. Conventional database systems are therefore unable to provide users or other applications immediate responses to changes or anomalies in the data collected by the sensors. This problem is further exacerbated by recent trends to increase the size of data centers and thus, the number of sensors employed to detect conditions in the data centers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It would thus be beneficial to have the capability to relatively quickly identify changes or anomalies in an environment containing a sensor network.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the present invention is described by referring mainly to an exemplary embodiment thereof. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however, to one of ordinary skill in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances, well known methods and structures have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Disclosed herein are a method for detecting anomalies in an environment in a relatively quick and efficient manner and an analyzer configured to perform the method. In one example, the method involves the identification of a number of hidden variables in linear models that approximate a data set. In this example, an anomaly may be deemed to have occurred if the number of hidden variables changes between consecutive iterations of the method.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another example, the method involves identify principal sensors, which may be defined as those sensors that are the most sensitive to changes in the environment and are thus better indicators of changes in the environment. In this example, the method may employ a reduced set of data supplied by the principal sensors in identifying anomalies to thereby reduce the computational overhead required in performing the method.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Through implementation of the method and analyzer disclosed herein, anomalies, such as, changes in temperature, pressure, airflow volume, energy consumption, etc., detected by a plurality of sensors may quickly and efficiently be analyzed to identify the anomalies.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a simplified block diagram of an environment <b>100</b> having an analyzer <b>110</b> for detecting anomalies in the environment <b>100</b>, according to an example. It should be understood that the environment <b>100</b> and the analyzer <b>110</b> may include additional components and that one or more of the components described herein may be removed and/or modified without departing from a scope of the environment <b>100</b> or the analyzer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The environment <b>100</b> may comprise any reasonably suitable structure, location, space, etc., in which a plurality of sensors are employed to detect one or more conditions. The environment <b>100</b> may also comprise any reasonable suitable structure, location, space, etc., in which data collected from the plurality of sensors are aggregated, for instance, for purposes of data mining, control over cooling systems, etc. Examples of suitable structures, locations, spaces, etc., include an IT data center, a section of an IT data center, a building, a room in a building, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an example, the analyzer <b>110</b> comprises an apparatus configured to perform various computational processes in the environment <b>100</b>. In this example, the analyzer <b>110</b> comprises, for instance, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a microcontroller, etc. The analyzer <b>110</b> may thus comprise a circuit or a processor in a computing device. The analyzer <b>110</b> may also comprise a computing device configured to perform the various functions discussed herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another example, the analyzer <b>110</b> comprises software that is executable by a microprocessor. In this example, the analyzer <b>110</b> may be stored, for example, on a memory of a computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In either example, the analyzer <b>110</b> is depicted as collecting data from a plurality of sensors <b>130</b>. The data collected by the sensors <b>130</b> may be communicated to the analyzer <b>110</b> through a network <b>140</b>. The network <b>140</b> may comprise a wired or wireless communication link between the sensors <b>130</b> and the analyzer <b>110</b>. In this regard, the network <b>140</b> may comprise a local area network, a wide area network, the Internet, etc. Although not shown, the analyzer <b>110</b>, or a computing device containing the analyzer <b>110</b>, and the sensors <b>130</b> may be equipped with hardware and/or software designed to enable transmission of data from the sensors <b>130</b> and receipt of data from the sensors <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are a plurality of components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n</i>, where &#x201c;n&#x201d; is an integer equal to or greater than one. The components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n </i>are depicted as including respective ones of the sensors <b>130</b>. The components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n </i>may comprise any reasonably suitable components contained in the environment <b>100</b> where at least one condition is detected by a plurality of sensors <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">By way of particular example, the environment <b>100</b> comprises an IT data center and the components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n </i>comprise electronics cabinets in the IT data center. In this example, each of the electronics cabinets may include a plurality of sensors <b>130</b> positioned to detect one or more conditions at various locations in respective electronics cabinets. For instance, for a particular electronics cabinet, a plurality of sensors <b>130</b> may be configured and positioned to detect inlet and/or outlet temperatures at various heights along the electronics cabinet. As another example, a plurality of sensors <b>130</b> may be configured and positioned to detect the volume flow rate of airflow through the electronics cabinet at various heights. As a further example, a plurality of sensors <b>130</b> may be configured and positioned to detect energy consumption levels of electronic devices housed in the electronics cabinet.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n </i>are also depicted as including respective base stations <b>134</b>. The base stations <b>134</b> generally comprise apparatuses configured and positioned to receive data from respective sets of sensors <b>130</b> and communicate the data to the analyzer <b>110</b>. In this regard, the base stations <b>134</b> may comprise the hardware and/or software to communicate the data collected by the sensors <b>130</b> to the analyzer <b>110</b>. The base stations <b>134</b>, however, are considered optional because the sensors <b>130</b> may be equipped to directly communicate the sensed data to the analyzer <b>110</b>. Although not shown, in instances where the base stations <b>134</b> are employed, a base station <b>134</b> may be configured to receive data from sensors <b>130</b> of multiple components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n </i>and to communicate the data to the analyzer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In any event, the data collected by the sensors <b>130</b> may be communicated to the analyzer <b>110</b> through implementation of any reasonably suitable data communication protocol over a network.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally speaking, the analyzer <b>110</b> is configured to analyze the data received from the sensors <b>130</b> to identify abnormal sensor responses or anomalies from normal sensor behavior. In addition, the analyzer <b>110</b> is configured to identify principal sensors among the sensors <b>130</b>, which may be defined as those sensors that are the most sensitive to perturbations in the environment <b>100</b> and are thus better indicators of changes in the environment <b>100</b>. According to an example, the analyzer <b>110</b> is configured to employ the data received from the principal sensors instead of all of the sensors <b>130</b> to thus reduce the amount of data processed in identifying anomalies. In analyzing the data, the analyzer <b>110</b> is further configured to identify numbers of hidden variables in sets of linear equations that model the data collected from the sensors <b>130</b> to at least a predetermined level of accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The analyzer <b>110</b> is depicted as including a data input module <b>112</b>, a filtering module <b>114</b>, a candidate identification module <b>116</b>, a matrix formulation module <b>118</b>, a principal components analysis (PCA) module <b>120</b>, and an anomaly detection module <b>122</b>. The modules <b>112</b>-<b>122</b> may comprise software stored on a computer readable medium or hardware, such as, circuits, or combinations thereof. As described in greater detail herein below, the analyzer <b>110</b> may implement or invoke the modules <b>112</b>-<b>122</b> to perform the functions discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In any regard, the analyzer <b>110</b> is configured to store the data received from the sensors <b>130</b> in a database <b>150</b>. The analyzer <b>110</b> may also access the database <b>150</b> to retrieve stored data to identify anomalies in the data streamed from the sensors <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The analyzer <b>110</b> outputs various representations of either or both of the identified anomalies and principal sensors to one or more outputs <b>160</b>. The various representations may comprise graphs, plots, or other forms of data representation. According to an example, the output <b>160</b> comprises a display upon which a user may view the various representations. In another example, the output <b>160</b> comprises a computer readable storage medium on which the various representations may be stored. In a further example, the output <b>160</b> comprises a computing device that is connected to the analyzer <b>110</b> either locally or over a network. In any of these examples, the outputs of the analyzer <b>110</b> may be employed to dynamically monitor various resources, such as cooling and power resources, in the environment <b>100</b>. The outputs may also be employed in controlling the various resources.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a flow diagram of a method <b>200</b> for detecting anomalies in an environment, according to an example. It should be understood that the method <b>200</b> may include additional steps and that one or more of the steps described herein may be removed and/or modified without departing from a scope of the method <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The description of the method <b>200</b> is made with reference to the environment <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and thus makes particular reference to the elements contained in the environment <b>100</b>. It should, however, be understood that the method <b>200</b> may be implemented in an environment that differs from the environment <b>100</b> without departing from a scope of the method <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Generally speaking, the analyzer <b>110</b> may implement the method <b>200</b> to detect anomalies in an environment <b>100</b> in a relatively quick and efficient manner. In one regard, the analyzer <b>110</b> is configured to relatively quick detect changes occurring at one or more locations in the environment <b>100</b> by identifying principal sensors at the one or more locations. In another regard, the analyzer <b>110</b> is configured to identify the principal sensors in a relatively quick and efficient manner by identifying sets of linear equations that model the data.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With particular reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at step <b>202</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> implements or invokes the data input module <b>112</b> to receive packages of data from the sensors <b>130</b>. As described above, the analyzer <b>110</b> may receive the data packages directly from the sensors <b>130</b> or through one or more base stations <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At step <b>204</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> implements or invokes the candidate identification module <b>116</b> to identify one or more candidate problem locations in the environment <b>100</b> from the data contained in the data packages. The candidate problem locations may be defined as those locations in the environment <b>100</b> in which one or more sensors <b>130</b> have detected at least one condition that is outside of a normal condition. Manners in which the candidate problem locations may be identified are described in greater detail herein below with respect to the method <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At step <b>206</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> implements or invokes the principal components analysis (PCA) module <b>120</b> to perform a PCA on the data collected from sensors <b>130</b> associated with the candidate problem locations to identify a number of hidden variables. As is generally known, PCA is a technique for reducing multidimensional data sets to lower dimensions to simplify analysis of the data sets. PCA has been used as a tool in exploratory data analysis for making predictive models. Again, various manners in which the analyzer <b>110</b> performs the PCA on the data is described in greater detail with respect to the method <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At step <b>208</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> implements or invokes the anomaly detection module <b>122</b> to analyze the number of hidden variables identified at step <b>206</b> for at least one of the candidate locations identified at step <b>204</b> to detect anomalies in the data. More particularly, for instance, the analyzer <b>110</b> determines whether the number of hidden variables changes during consecutive time windows and a change in the number of hidden variables from a norm may be determined as an indication of the existence of an anomaly.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At step <b>210</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> outputs a representation of the detected anomalies to one or more outputs <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to an example, at step <b>210</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> may further analyze the data received from the plurality of sensors to determine whether the data received from any one of the plurality of sensors is substantially correlated with the data received from any of the other sensors of the plurality of sensors. By way of example, the analyzer <b>110</b> may analyze the correlations between the data in instances when identification of sensors <b>130</b> having similar response characteristics is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a flow diagram of a method <b>300</b> for detecting anomalies in an environment, which is a more detailed illustration of the method <b>200</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, according to an example. It should be understood that the method <b>300</b> may include additional steps and that one or more of the steps described herein may be removed and/or modified without departing from a scope of the method <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At step <b>302</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> implements or invokes the data input module <b>112</b> to receive packages of data from the sensors <b>130</b>. In addition, the analyzer <b>110</b> implements or invokes the filtering module <b>114</b> to filter the data contained in the packages at step <b>304</b>. More particularly, at step <b>304</b>, the filtering module <b>114</b> is configured to implement a conventional filtering technique to substantially eliminate data due to random variations or noise in the data.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At step <b>306</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> reads the filtered data. In addition, at step <b>308</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> invokes or implements the candidate identification module <b>116</b> to determine whether the filtered data falls outside of a predetermined threshold range. That is, whether each of the filtered data either exceeds an upper limit of the predetermined range or falls below a lower limit of the predetermined range. The predetermined range may be set according to a level of granularity desired in identifying candidate problem locations. That is, for instance, the predetermined range may be made smaller in order to capture larger numbers of candidate problem locations.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, the predetermined range may be set based upon the type of data that is collected by the sensors <b>130</b>. In an example where the data collected is temperature, the predetermined range may comprise a nominal range of allowable temperatures at the inlets of the components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n</i>. As another example, where the data collected is energy consumption, the predetermined range may comprise a nominal range of allowable energy consumption levels of electronic devices contained in the components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In any regard, the analyzer <b>110</b> may continue to receive packages from those sensors <b>130</b> that supplied the filtered data that have been found to be within the predetermined range at step <b>302</b>. In addition, the analyzer <b>110</b> may repeat steps <b>304</b>-<b>308</b> on that new data received at step <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For those sensors <b>130</b> that supplied filtered data that have been found to fall outside of the predetermined range, the analyzer <b>110</b> identifies the components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n </i>to which those sensors <b>130</b> are associated and identifies those components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n </i>as candidate problem locations, as indicated at step <b>310</b>. The analyzer <b>110</b> identifies those components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n </i>as candidate problem locations because at least one condition in or around these components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n </i>has been identified at step <b>308</b> as being outside of a normal condition.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At step <b>312</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> invokes or implements the data input module <b>112</b> to collect additional packages of data from the sensors <b>130</b> associated with the components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n </i>identified as candidate problem locations. By way of example, the analyzer <b>110</b> receives approximately 100 packages of data from each of the associated sensors <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At step <b>314</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> extracts the data and timestamps at which the data were collected from the additional packages collected at step <b>312</b>. According to an example, the analyzer <b>110</b> invokes or implements the matrix formulation module <b>118</b> to arrange the data and timestamps in a matrix X. An example of a matrix <b>400</b> formed from the data and timestamps is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the matrix <b>400</b>, X<sub>n </sub>denotes the sensor <b>130</b> associated with respective components <b>132</b><i>a</i>-<b>132</b><i>n</i>, T<b>1</b>-T<b>5</b> denote the sensed data, and t denotes the timestamp at which the data was collected.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At step <b>316</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> invokes or implements the PCA module <b>120</b> to analyze the data contained in the matrix X. An example of a manner in which the PCA module <b>120</b> may be implemented to identify the number of hidden variables contained in a linear transform that is used to reconstruct the data contained in the matrix X is depicted in the flow diagram of the method <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at step <b>502</b>, the matrix X is inputted into the PCA module <b>120</b>. At step <b>504</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> initializes the hidden variables w<sub>i </sub>to be unit vectors. In addition, at step <b>506</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> calculates a matrix Y, which is a transformation of the principal components of the data, through the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Y<sub>i</sub>=w<sub>i</sub><sup>T</sup>x<sub>i</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At step <b>508</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> calculates a matrix <u style="single">X</u>, which generally comprises a reconstruction of the X matrix, through the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><u style="single">X</u><sub>i</sub>=Y<sub>i</sub>w<sub>i</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation (2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>510</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> calculates a difference between the reconstructed matrix <u style="single">X</u> and the original matrix X and determines whether the difference is sufficiently small. By way of example, the difference may be considered to be sufficiently small if the reconstructed matrix <u style="single">X</u> is at least about 95% of the original matrix X. In other words, the difference is considered as being sufficiently small if the model calculated at step <b>506</b> is at least about 95% accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If the analyzer <b>110</b> determines that the difference is not sufficiently small at step <b>510</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> adapts the hidden variable w<sub>i </sub>vectors at step <b>512</b>. In addition, the analyzer <b>110</b> repeats steps <b>506</b>-<b>512</b> until a linear model that approximates the original matrix X is identified to at least a minimum degree of accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Once the analyzer <b>110</b> determines that such a linear model has been found at step <b>510</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> stores the number of hidden variables w<sub>i </sub>contained in the linear model, as indicated at step <b>514</b>. In addition, at step <b>516</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> invokes or implements the anomaly detection module <b>122</b> to compare the number of hidden variables stored at step <b>514</b> with any previously stored number of hidden variables to determine whether the number of hidden variables has changed. In addition, or alternatively, the analyzer <b>110</b> compares the stored number of hidden variables with a nominal number of hidden variables, for instance, as determined through testing, to determine whether the stored number of hidden variables has changed from the nominal number of hidden variables.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">If the analyzer <b>110</b> determines that the number of hidden variables has not changed or that the number of hidden variables has not changed from the nominal number of hidden variables, the analyzer <b>110</b> repeats steps <b>502</b>-<b>516</b> to substantially continuously monitor the conditions detected in the environment <b>100</b>. However, if the analyzer <b>110</b> determines that the number of hidden variables has changed or that the number of hidden variables has changed from the nominal number of hidden variables, the analyzer <b>110</b> outputs the number of hidden variables and a timestamp at which the change occurred at step <b>518</b>. In other words, when a change in the number of hidden variables occurs, the analyzer <b>110</b> determines that there is an anomaly in the sensed data. Generally speaking, an increase in the number of hidden variables is an indication that the total energy of the reconstructed matrix <u style="single">X</u> is higher than the total energy of the original matrix X and that there was an anomaly. A decrease in the number of hidden variables is an indication that the conditions in the environment <b>100</b> are returning to a normal state.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Following step <b>518</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> repeats steps <b>502</b>-<b>518</b> to continue tracking the environment <b>100</b> for anomalies.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at step <b>318</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> identifies the principal sensors from a vector of participation weights contained in the reconstructed matrix <u style="single">X</u>. More particularly, for instance, the principal sensors comprise those sensors having the greatest values in the columns of the reconstructed matrix <u style="single">X</u> because the matrix of weights is ordered by the significance of the principal components. In addition, the position of the sensor <b>130</b> is related to the position of the sensor data in the matrix <u style="single">X</u>. As such, the principal sensors, that is, those sensors having the most significance in the PCA, are identified based upon the positions of their weights in the reconstructed matrix <u style="single">X</u>. By way of example, those sensors <b>130</b> that detect the greatest number of changes may comprise the principal sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At step <b>320</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> outputs a representation of the hidden variables identified at step <b>316</b> and may also output the principal sensors identified at step <b>318</b>. The representation of the hidden variables may comprise, for instance, a plot of a time series and bar plots for the numbers of hidden variables identified during consecutive iterations of the method <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, although not shown, the analyzer <b>110</b> may employ the principal sensors in future implementations of the methods <b>300</b> and <b>500</b> as core sensor groups. In other words, instead of analyzing data streaming from all of the sensors <b>130</b>, the analyzer <b>110</b> may substantially limit the analysis performed in the methods <b>300</b> and <b>500</b> to the data received from the principal sensors to thereby substantially reduce the amount of data processed and thus expediting the detection of anomalies in the environment <b>100</b>.</p>

In addition, the methods <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, and <b>500</b> may be embodied by a computer program, which may exist in a variety of forms both active and inactive.
