<p id="p-0029" num="0028">This cellular phone includes an upper unit <b>11</b> and a lower unit <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>). The upper unit <b>11</b> is provided with the display portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the receiver <b>10</b> on a front surface thereof, while the lower unit <b>12</b> is provided with the operation section <b>7</b> and the microphone <b>9</b> on a front surface thereof. The cellular phone is configured so as to be capable of folding via a hinge portion <b>13</b> in the state where the front surface of the upper unit <b>11</b> faces the front surface of the lower unit <b>12</b>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), the upper unit <b>11</b> is provided with the display portion <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the camera <b>6</b> and the speaker <b>8</b> on a back surface thereof. The face panel <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>) can be attached to and removed from the back surface of the upper unit <b>11</b> via a screw, a clutch or the like (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A two-dimensional code (not shown) (for example, the two-dimensional code B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is attached onto the back surface of the face panel <b>14</b>. Since the multiple kinds of face panels <b>14</b> each having a different design are prepared, a different two-dimensional code is attached to each of the face panels <b>14</b> in this case. Further, the mask corresponding to the content that has been masked and stored in the memory <b>5</b> is removed in accordance with the kind of face panel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart explaining the operation of the cellular phone of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a view showing an example of an icon displayed on a display portion <b>3</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a view showing a display of a display portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>for informing addition of contents. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a view showing an example of respective key words stored in a memory <b>5</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view showing an example of data corresponding to the respective key words in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Processing contents of control executed in the cellular phone of the present exemplary embodiment will be described with reference to these drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this cellular phone, the two-dimensional code of the face panel <b>14</b> photographed by the camera <b>6</b> is analyzed, and the analysis result of the two-dimensional code, that is, one into which the photographed two-dimensional code is converted as text data is compared with each of key word data stored in the memory <b>5</b>. Then, when the both correspond with each other, the mask of the content corresponding to the coincident key word is removed, and the process corresponding to the content (for example, an image, a melody or the like) is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Namely, the two-dimensional code attached to the face panel <b>14</b> is read by the camera <b>6</b> before the face panel <b>14</b> is attached to the upper unit <b>11</b>, the read two-dimensional code is decoded by the control section <b>4</b>, and the decoded one is converted into text data (analysis result) (Step A<b>1</b>). This analysis result is then compared with each of the key words registered in the memory <b>5</b> (Step A<b>2</b>). When there is no coincident key word (NO), a normal process corresponding to the analysis result is executed (Step A<b>3</b>). When there is a coincident key word (YES), a non-display flag for the content corresponding to the coincident key word is changed to an off state, whereby the mask is removed (Step A<b>4</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, hiding of a content specified by the two-dimensional code of the face panel on a standby screen of the display portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is removed, and an icon indicating a name of the content is displayed as a preinstalled content (Step A<b>5</b>). To be more specific, an icon of a &#x201c;gift&#x201d;(&#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="3.56mm" wi="8.13mm" file="US08622301-20140107-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>&#x201d;) in numeral <b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> is an icon in which a hidden content is displayed. Numerals <b>1</b> to <b>4</b> are preinstalled contents (contents that are not hidden). A content added with a two-dimensional code is to be added to 4 or later.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Then, when an operation to select this icon is carried out, a message that a content is newly added is displayed on the standby screen of the display portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Thus, when the operation to select this content is carried out, a process corresponding to the content is executed. For example, in the case where the content is image data, the image data are set as a standby screen or a screen for displaying at incoming and outgoing calls. In the case where the content is melody data, the melody data are set as a tone at a incoming call (a ring tone).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The respective key words registered in the memory <b>5</b> are registered in a storage area of 16 bytes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For example, a key word &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="3.56mm" wi="8.13mm" file="US08622301-20140107-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>1&#x201d; of a content ID.<b>1</b> is registered in the storage area of 16 bytes. Similarly, a key word &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003" he="3.56mm" wi="8.13mm" file="US08622301-20140107-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>2&#x201d; of a content ID.<b>2</b>, a key word &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004" he="3.13mm" wi="5.25mm" file="US08622301-20140107-P00002.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>xyz&#x201d; of a content ID.<b>3</b>, a key word &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00005" he="3.13mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US08622301-20140107-P00003.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/><b>12</b><i>a</i>&#x201d; of a content ID.<b>4</b>, a key word &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00006" he="3.13mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US08622301-20140107-P00003.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>&#x201d; of a content ID.<b>5</b> and the like are registered in the storage areas of 16 bytes. In this case, each character constituting the respective key words is converted into a quadruple-digit or double-digit hexadecimal number to be stored as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Further, a portion of a space in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is converted into a double-digit hexadecimal number (&#x201c;<b>20</b>&#x201d;) to be stored. For this reason, the respective key words are managed as 16 bytes of data including the space. In the case where the respective key words are registered in the storage areas of 16 bytes in this manner, a text in which a two-dimensional code is decoded is converted into 16 bytes of binary data, and the binary data are compared with 16 bytes of data of a key word.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Thus, even though the decoded text data are converted into a two-dimensional code as they are after reading of the two-dimensional code and the two-dimensional code is secondarily delivered to other cellular phone via a communication line, the mask of the content is never removed in the other cellular phone. Namely, the text data decoded after reading the two-dimensional code in the cellular phone do not include a space or spaces. Thus, even though the text data are again converted into the two-dimensional code as they are to secondarily deliver them to other cellular phone, no space is included in the analysis result of the delivered two-dimensional code. For this reason, the analysis result of the delivered two-dimensional code does not correspond with the key word managed in other cellular phone as 16 bytes of data including the space or spaces. Thus, the mask of the content is never removed in the other cellular phone.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, in the present exemplary embodiment, the two-dimensional code of the face panel <b>14</b> photographed by the camera <b>6</b> is analyzed, and the analysis result of the two-dimensional code is compared with each of the key words stored in the memory <b>5</b>. In the case where there is a key word that corresponds with the analysis result, a mask of the content corresponding to the coincident key word is removed to execute a process corresponding to the content. Thus, it is possible to show a user so that a content is added, and it is also possible to show the user so that the content is a purchase bonus of the face panel <b>14</b>. For this reason, it can be expected that amusement thereof is improved, a number of face panels <b>14</b> become widely used, and sales thereof are promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As explained above, although the exemplary embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the appending drawings, a concrete configuration is not limited to that in the exemplary embodiment. Change or variation of a design without departing from the scope of the present invention is included in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, although the content is masked and stored in the memory <b>5</b>, for example, a function control program such as a calculator function or a TV (television) remote controller function may be masked and stored, and a key word may be registered for every function control program. Thus, when the mask of the function control program is removed, a process corresponding to the function control program is executed. Further, it is possible to show the user so that a function is newly added. Moreover, in this case, the function control program may be provided so as to be associated with the face panel <b>14</b>. Furthermore, in the case where the amount of information is few, the two-dimensional code may be a one-dimensional barcode.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the present invention can be applied to a cellular phone in which no face panel is utilized. In this case, a two-dimensional code is attached to a cover of a battery, for example. Moreover, although the enclosure of the cellular phone is a foldable form in the above exemplary embodiment, it may be a straight form or a slidable form. Furthermore, in the above exemplary embodiment, although a matrix type of two-dimensional code developed by Denso Wave Inc. has been utilized as the two-dimensional code B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in addition to this two-dimensional code, for example, a stacked matrix type of two-dimensional barcode developed by Symbol Technologies, Inc. (USA), a matrix type of two-dimensional code developed by RVSI Acuity ClMatrix (USA), a matrix type of two-dimensional code developed by UPS Inc. (USA) or the like may be utilized.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Industrial Applicability</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present invention can be generally applied to cellular phones that photograph a two-dimensional code by means of a camera and execute an operation corresponding to an analysis result of the two-dimensional code.</p>
