<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A transceiver includes a receiver section and a transmitter section. The receiver section converts an inbound Multiple Frequency Bands Multiple Standards (MFBMS) signal into a down converted signal, wherein the inbound MFBMS signal includes a desired signal component and an undesired signal component. In addition, the receiver section determines spectral positioning of the undesired signal component with respect to the desired signal component and adjusts at least one of the MFBMS signal and the down converted signal based on the spectral positioning to substantially reduce adverse affects of the undesired signal component on the desired signal component to produce an adjusted signal. The transmitter section converts an outbound symbol stream into an outbound MFBMS signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0006">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">This invention relates generally to wireless communication systems and more particularly to transceivers that operate in such systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">Communication systems are known to support wireless and wire lined communications between wireless and/or wire lined communication devices. Such communication systems range from national and/or international cellular telephone systems to the Internet to point-to-point in-home wireless networks. Each type of communication system is constructed, and hence operates, in accordance with one or more communication standards. For instance, wireless communication systems may operate in accordance with one or more standards including, but not limited to, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, advanced mobile phone services (AMPS), digital AMPS, global system for mobile communications (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), local multi-point distribution systems (LMDS), multi-channel-multi-point distribution systems (MMDS), radio frequency identification (RFID), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and/or variations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">Depending on the type of wireless communication system, a wireless communication device, such as a cellular telephone, two-way radio, personal digital assistant (PDA), personal computer (PC), laptop computer, home entertainment equipment, RFID reader, RFID tag, et cetera communicates directly or indirectly with other wireless communication devices. For direct communications (also known as point-to-point communications), the participating wireless communication devices tune their receivers and transmitters to the same channel or channels (e.g., one of the plurality of radio frequency (RF) carriers of the wireless communication system or a particular RF frequency for some systems) and communicate over that channel(s). For indirect wireless communications, each wireless communication device communicates directly with an associated base station (e.g., for cellular services) and/or an associated access point (e.g., for an in-home or in-building wireless network) via an assigned channel. To complete a communication connection between the wireless communication devices, the associated base stations and/or associated access points communicate with each other directly, via a system controller, via the public switch telephone network, via the Internet, and/or via some other wide area network.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">For each wireless communication device to participate in wireless communications, it includes a built-in radio transceiver (i.e., receiver and transmitter) or is coupled to an associated radio transceiver (e.g., a station for in-home and/or in-building wireless communication networks, RF modem, etc.). As is known, the receiver is coupled to an antenna and includes a low noise amplifier, one or more intermediate frequency stages, a filtering stage, and a data recovery stage. The low noise amplifier receives inbound RF signals via the antenna and amplifies then. The one or more intermediate frequency stages mix the amplified RF signals with one or more local oscillations to convert the amplified RF signal into baseband signals or intermediate frequency (IF) signals. The filtering stage filters the baseband signals or the IF signals to attenuate unwanted out of band signals to produce filtered signals. The data recovery stage recovers raw data from the filtered signals in accordance with the particular wireless communication standard.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">As is also known, the transmitter includes a data modulation stage, one or more intermediate frequency stages, and a power amplifier. The data modulation stage converts raw data into baseband signals in accordance with a particular wireless communication standard. The one or more intermediate frequency stages mix the baseband signals with one or more local oscillations to produce RF signals. The power amplifier amplifies the RF signals prior to transmission via an antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">Many wireless transceivers are able to support multiple communication standards, which may be in the same frequency band or in different frequency bands. For example, a wireless transceiver may support Bluetooth communications for a personal area network and IEEE 802.11 communications for a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). In this example, the IEEE 802.11 communications and the Bluetooth communications may be within the same frequency band (e.g., 2.4 GHz for IEEE 802.11b, g, etc.). Alternatively, the IEEE 802.11 communications may be in a different frequency band (e.g., 5 GHz) than the Bluetooth communications (e.g., 2.4GHz). For Bluetooth communications and IEEE 802.11b, (g), etc. communications there are interactive protocols that appear to the user as simultaneous implementation, but is actually a shared serial implementation. As such, while a wireless transceiver supports multiple types of standardized communications, it can only support one type of standardized communication at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">In addition, a transceiver that supports multiple standards includes multiple radio frequency (RF) front-ends (e.g., on the receiver side, separate LNA, channel filter, and IF stages for each standard and, on the transmitter side, separate IF stages, power amplifiers, and channels filters for each standard). As such, multiple standard transceivers include multiple separate RF front-ends; one for each standard in a different frequency band, channel utilization scheme (e.g., time division multiple access, frequency division multiple access, code division multiple access, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, etc.), and/or data modulation scheme (e.g., phase shift keying, frequency shift keying, amplitude shift keying, combinations and/or variations thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Further, transceivers that support full duplex communications require a technique to minimize the adverse affects of transmissions upon receptions of RF signals. Many standards account for this by providing a transmission frequency and a reception frequency (e.g., 1920-1980 MHz for uplink WCDMA communications and 2110-2170 MHz for downlink WCDMA communications). While standardized transmission and reception frequencies eliminate direct overlap, the transmitted signal still adversely affects the received signal when the signal strength difference is substantial (e.g., 60 dBm or more). In this instance, further reduction of the transmit signal is needed within the receiver section, which may be achieved by using a duplexer and/or blocking In a multiple standard transceiver, such conventional approaches may not provide sufficient reduction of the transmit signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">Therefore, a need exists for a transceiver that is capable of at least partially overcoming one or more of the above mentioned multiple standard limitations.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of a transceiver <b>10</b> that includes a receiver section <b>12</b> and a transmitter section <b>14</b>. The transceiver <b>10</b> may further include a baseband processing module <b>26</b>, which may be a single processing device or a plurality of processing devices. Such a processing device may be a microprocessor, micro-controller, digital signal processor, microcomputer, central processing unit, field programmable gate array, programmable logic device, state machine, logic circuitry, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or any device that manipulates signals (analog and/or digital) based on hard coding of the circuitry and/or operational instructions. The processing module <b>26</b> may have an associated memory and/or memory element, which may be a single memory device, a plurality of memory devices, and/or embedded circuitry of the processing module. Such a memory device may be a read-only memory, random access memory, volatile memory, non-volatile memory, static memory, dynamic memory, flash memory, cache memory, and/or any device that stores digital information. Note that when the processing module <b>26</b> implements one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry, the memory and/or memory element storing the corresponding operational instructions may be embedded within, or external to, the circuitry comprising the state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry. Further note that, the memory element stores, and the processing module <b>26</b> executes, hard coded and/or operational instructions corresponding to at least some of the steps and/or functions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">In an embodiment, the transceiver <b>10</b> includes the receiver section <b>12</b> and the transmitter section <b>14</b> on a single integrated circuit (IC). In another embodiment, the transceiver <b>10</b> includes the receiver section <b>12</b> on one IC and the transmitter section on another IC. In yet another embodiment, the transceiver includes the receiver section <b>12</b>, the transmitter section <b>14</b>, and the baseband processing module <b>26</b> on a single IC. In further embodiment, the transceiver <b>10</b> includes the receiver section <b>12</b> and the transmitter section <b>14</b> on one IC and the baseband processing module <b>26</b> on another IC. In yet a further embodiment, the transceiver <b>10</b> includes each of the receiver section <b>12</b>, the transmitter section <b>14</b>, and the baseband processing module <b>26</b> on separate ICs.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">In operation, the baseband processing module <b>26</b> converts one or more outbound signals <b>30</b> into an outbound symbol stream <b>20</b> in accordance with one or more standards. For example, if the transceiver <b>10</b> is currently supporting a single standardized communication (e.g., IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, GSM, CDMA, RFID, EDGE, GPRS, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, combinations and/or variations thereof), the baseband processing module <b>26</b> converts a single outbound signal <b>30</b> into the outbound symbol stream <b>20</b> in accordance with the standard. As another example, if the transceiver <b>10</b> is currently supporting two or more standards, the baseband processing module <b>26</b> converts two or more outbound signals <b>30</b> (one for each standard) into the outbound symbol stream <b>30</b>. In this example, the outbound symbol stream <b>30</b> may include individual symbol streams for each outbound signal <b>30</b>, a composite outbound symbol stream that includes a combination of the individual symbol streams, and/or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">The baseband processing module <b>26</b> may convert the outbound signal(s) <b>30</b> into the outbound symbol stream <b>20</b> by performing one or more of encoding (e.g., 1/2 rate, 2/3 rate, or other rate convolutional encoding, scrambling, puncturing, and/or any other type of encoding), interleaving, data modulation (e.g., x-QAM mapping, FSK modulation, QPSK modulation, BPSK modulation, ASK modulation, etc.), and frequency-to-time domain conversion (e.g., inverse fast Fourier transform). In addition, the baseband processing module <b>26</b> may employ a channel usage scheme to produce the outbound symbol stream <b>20</b>. The channel usage scheme may be time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency divisional multiple access (FDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), a combination thereof, and/or variations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">The transmitter section <b>14</b> converts the outbound symbol stream <b>20</b> into a multiple frequency band multiple standard (MFBMS) signal <b>22</b>, which includes at least one signal component in one or more frequency bands (e.g., 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 29 GHz, 60 GHz, etc.). As such, the resulting MFBMS signal <b>22</b> has a bandwidth that spans one or more frequency bands. In an embodiment, the transmitter section <b>14</b> may be done by mixing the outbound symbol stream <b>20</b> with a local oscillation to produce an up-converted signal. One or more power amplifiers and/or power amplifier drivers amplifies the up-converted signal to produce the outbound MFBMS signal <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">In another embodiment, the transmitter section <b>14</b> includes an oscillator that produces an oscillation. The outbound symbol stream <b>20</b> provides phase information (e.g., +/&#x2212;&#x394;&#x3b8; [phase shift] and/or &#x3b8;(t) [phase modulation]) that adjusts the phase of the oscillation to produce a phase adjusted signal, which is transmitted as the outbound MFBMS signal <b>22</b>. In another embodiment, the outbound symbol stream <b>20</b> includes amplitude information (e.g., A(t) [amplitude modulation]), which is used to adjust the amplitude of the phase adjusted signal to produce the outbound MFBMS signal <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">In yet another embodiment, the transmitter section <b>14</b> includes an oscillator that produces an oscillation. The outbound symbol stream <b>20</b> provides frequency information (e.g., +/&#x2212;&#x394;f [frequency shift] and/or f(t) [frequency modulation]) that adjusts the frequency of the oscillation to produce a frequency adjusted signal, which is transmitted as the outbound MFBMS signal <b>22</b>. In another embodiment, the outbound symbol stream <b>20</b> includes amplitude information, which is used to adjust the amplitude of the frequency adjusted signal to produce the outbound MFBMS signal <b>22</b>. In a further embodiment, the transmitter section <b>14</b> includes an oscillator that produces an oscillation. The outbound symbol stream <b>20</b> provides amplitude information (e.g., +/&#x2212;&#x394;A [amplitude shift] and/or A(t) [amplitude modulation) that adjusts the amplitude of the oscillation to produce the outbound MFBMS signal <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">The receiver section <b>12</b> receives an inbound MFBMS signal <b>16</b>, which includes a plurality of frequency bands <b>32</b> (e.g., two or more). Each frequency band <b>32</b> may be divided into channels <b>34</b>, which in turn may be further divided into one or more division multiple access slots (e.g., time, frequency, and/or code division multiple access slots). A standardized communication (e.g., IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, GSM, CDMA, RFID, EDGE, GPRS, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, combinations and/or variations thereof) may use one more channels and/or division multiple access slots to support a communication. In some instances, multiple standards may utilize communication resources (e.g., channels and/or slots) within the same frequency band and/or across multiple frequency bands. Note that the MFBMS signal <b>16</b> has the potential to support multiple standardized communications concurrently, however, in many instances, the MFBMS signal <b>16</b> may have only one active standardized communication. Further note that the transmitter and receiver sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may share one or more antennas or each may have its own one or more antennas. Still further note that the transmitter section <b>14</b> may generate the outbound MFBMS signal <b>22</b> based on an orthogonal relationship with the inbound MFBMS signal <b>16</b> to further reduce interference therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">The receiver section <b>12</b> converts the MFBMS signal <b>16</b> into a down converted signal <b>18</b>. The inbound MFBMS signal <b>16</b> may include one or more a desired signal components and one or more undesired signal components. The desired signal components correspond to an active standard specific communication <b>36</b>, which is represented in this example via a bold line. As shown in this example, standard specific communications <b>36</b> may be in different frequency bands, in the same frequency bands using different channels or slots thereof, and/or in the same frequency band using the same channels, or slots thereof. The undesired signal component may be caused by transmitting of the outbound MFBMS signal <b>22</b> and/or by another transceiver transmitting at approximately the same frequency as the frequency of the frequency bands, or channels thereof, supporting a standard specific communication <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">The receiver section <b>12</b> functions to determine spectral positioning of the undesired signal component with respect to the desired signal component. For example, the receiver section <b>12</b> may determine whether the undesired signal component is outside the frequency bands of interest (i.e., those containing a standard specific communication <b>36</b>), is within a frequency band of interest, is caused by an interferer (i.e., another transceiver transmitting at approximately the same frequency), or is a blocking signal (i.e., the transmit signal of a full duplex standard specific communication <b>36</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The receiver section <b>12</b> then adjusts at least one of the MFBMS signal <b>16</b> and the down converted signal <b>218</b> based on the spectral positioning to substantially reduce adverse affects of the undesired signal component on the desired signal component to produce an adjusted signal. The adjusting may be done by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver section <b>12</b> such that the undesired signal component is outside of the adjusted bandwidth of the receiver section <b>12</b> while the desired signal component is within the adjusted bandwidth. Alternatively and/or in addition to, the adjusting may be done by filtering the MFBMS signal <b>16</b> to attenuate the undesired signal component. As yet another alternative and/or addition, the adjusting may be done by blocking the undesired signal component.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of an example of an inbound multiple frequency band multiple standard (MFBMS) signal <b>16</b> that has an undesired signal component <b>40</b> adjacent thereto. In this example, the undesired signal component <b>40</b> may be an interferer signal (i.e., a transmit signal from another transceiver not involved in a standard specific communication <b>36</b> with the present transceiver). As is further shown, the center frequency band includes a desired signal component <b>42</b> (e.g., one or more slots and/or one or more channels supporting a standard specific communication <b>36</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">When the receiver section <b>12</b> receives such a MFBMS signal <b>16</b>, it determines the spectral position of the undesired signal component <b>40</b> with respect to the desired signal component <b>42</b>. In this example, the undesired signal component <b>40</b> is substantially separated in frequency from the desired signal component <b>42</b> such that, if the signal strength of the undesired signal component <b>40</b> is not significantly greater than the signal strength of the inbound MFBMS signal <b>16</b> (e.g., less than 40 dBm), then, in many instances, it may be ignored since it will not have a substantial adverse affect (e.g., interference) on the desired signal component <b>42</b>. If, however, the signal strength is significantly greater, then the undesired signal component <b>40</b> may be filtered, blocked, and/or the bandwidth of the receiver section is adjusted such that it does not substantially adversely affect the desired signal component <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram of another example of a multiple frequency band multiple standard (MFBMS) signal <b>16</b> that has an undesired signal component <b>40</b> within one of the frequency bands. In this example, the undesired signal component <b>40</b> may be an interferer signal (i.e., a transmit signal from another transceiver not involved in a standard specific communication <b>36</b> with the present transceiver) or a blocking signal (e.g., the present transceiver transmitting a signal). As is further shown, two frequency bands include a desired signal component <b>42</b> (e.g., one or more slots and/or one or more channels supporting a standard specific communication <b>36</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">When the receiver section <b>12</b> receives such a MFBMS signal <b>16</b>, it determines the spectral position of the undesired signal component <b>40</b> with respect to the desired signal component <b>42</b>.

If, however, the signal strength is significantly greater, then the undesired signal component <b>40</b> may be filtered, blocked, and/or the bandwidth of the receiver section is adjusted such that it does not substantially adversely affect the desired signal component <b>42</b>.</p>

As is further shown, the same frequency band includes a desired signal component <b>42</b> (e.g., one or more slots and/or one or more channels supporting a standard specific communication <b>36</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">When the receiver section <b>12</b> receives such a MFBMS signal <b>16</b>, it determines the spectral position of the undesired signal component <b>40</b> with respect to the desired signal component <b>42</b>. In this example, the undesired signal component <b>40</b> is substantially close in frequency from the desired signal component <b>42</b> such that it will have a substantial adverse affect (e.g., interference, which reduces the sensitivity of the receiver section <b>12</b>) on the desired signal component <b>42</b>. As such, the undesired signal component <b>40</b> may be filtered and/or blocked such that it does not substantially adversely affect the desired signal component <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, only one undesired signal component <b>40</b> is shown, however, there may be a plurality of undesired signal components <b>40</b>. In this instance, the receiver section <b>12</b> individually determines the spectral position of the undesired signal components and their individual positioning with respect to one or more desired signal components <b>42</b>. For each undesired signal component, the receiver section <b>12</b> ignores it, filters it, blocks it, and/or adjusts it bandwidth.</p>

The signal adjust module <b>50</b> functions to determine spectral positioning of the undesired signal component with respect to the desired signal component. The signal adjust module <b>50</b> further functions to adjust the MFBMS signal <b>16</b> based on the spectral positioning to produce an adjusted MFBMS signal <b>54</b>, which includes a reduction of the undesired signal component such that its adverse affects on the desired signal component are reduced. Various embodiments of the signal adjust module <b>50</b> will be further discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">The down conversion module <b>52</b> convert the adjusted MFBMS signal <b>54</b> into a down converted symbol stream or signal <b>16</b>. In an embodiment, the down conversion module <b>52</b> mixes in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the adjusted MFBMS signal <b>54</b> with in-phase and quadrature components of receiver local oscillation to produce a mixed I signal and a mixed Q signal. The mixed I and Q signals are combined to produce the inbound symbol stream.
