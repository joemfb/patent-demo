<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a medium receiving device that receives media which have been ejected and fallen into the medium receiving device at a lower position in the gravity direction and a recording device having the medium receiving device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ink jet printers are known as an example of recording device that performs recording on a medium. JP-A-2010-215367 and JP-A-2001-130814 disclose a configuration of a printer in which recording is performed by ejecting ink from a recording head in a recording unit onto a long sheet-shaped medium which is unwound from a roll of the medium and is transported through the recording unit, and then the medium is cut at a predetermined length and is ejected from the printer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">That is, the printer described in JP-A-2010-215367 includes a recording unit that performs recording on a sheet (medium), and a sheet storing unit (medium receiving device) that receives and stores the sheets which have been ejected from a paper ejection guide disposed at a position downstream to the recording unit and fallen in an obliquely forward direction such that the sheet storing unit receives and stores the sheets at a position lower than the paper ejection guide. The sheet storing unit of this printer is movable between a receiving position in which a rod-shaped member that forms a receiving port for the sheets ejected from the recording unit between the rod-shaped member and the distal end of the paper ejection guide is positioned in front of the paper ejection guide, and a storing position in which the rod-shaped member is positioned at the back of the receiving position and is housed under the paper ejection guide without forming the receiving port.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the printer described in JP-A-2010-215367, the rod-shaped member that serves as the front edge of the receiving port in the sheet storing unit is configured to be movable backward from the receiving position, but not movable forward from the receiving position. As a result, the receiving port that is formed between the rod-shaped member and the distal end of the paper ejection guide cannot be enlarged forward, which causes a problem that the sheets stored in the sheet storing unit are difficult to be picked-up from the front side through the receiving port.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, in an ejected paper receiving device (medium receiving device) of the printer described in JP-A-2001-130814, a front-side connection member that forms a receiving port for print papers (media) ejected from a printing unit between the front-side connection member and the distal end of the paper ejection section is movable between a front-side ejected paper receiving position which provides relatively large receiving port between the front-side connection member and the distal end of the paper ejection section, and a back-side ejected paper receiving position which provides relatively small receiving port. Accordingly, in this printer, since the front-side connection member of the ejected paper receiving device is movable from the back-side ejected paper receiving position to the front-side ejected paper receiving position, the receiving port can be enlarged forward, which allows the print sheets to be easily picked-up from the front side through the receiving port.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the printer described in JP-A-2001-130814, when the front-side connection member of the ejected paper receiving device is displaced from the back-side ejected paper receiving position to the front-side ejected paper receiving position, the entire ejected paper receiving device rotates forward to a large extent about the pivot axis on the proximal end thereof, which is opposite from the distal end that forms the receiving port. That is, in the ejected paper receiving device in which a sheet member formed of a fabric material is hung between the front-side connection member and a back-side connection member with a sag, the back-side connection member is displaced forward simultaneously with the front-side connection member. As a result, when the entire ejected paper receiving device rotates forward to a large extent about the pivot axis on the proximal end thereof, the print sheets stored in the ejected paper receiving device are biased forward due to an inertial force, thereby causing a problem that the print sheets may extend out of the ejected paper receiving device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Such a problem is not limited to the above-mentioned ink jet printer and the ejected paper receiving device in the printer, but is generally common to medium receiving devices that receive media that have been ejected and fallen from a medium ejection unit such that the media are received at a position lower than the medium ejection unit in the gravity direction and recording devices having the medium receiving device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An advantage of some aspects of the invention is that a medium receiving device that facilitates picking-up of a medium while preventing the medium from extending out of the medium receiving device during picking-up and a recording device having the medium receiving device are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an aspect of the invention, a medium receiving device that receives a medium which is ejected and falls from a medium ejection unit at a position lower than the medium ejection unit in the gravity direction includes a first member that extends in a width direction of the medium that intersects with an ejection direction of the medium at a position spaced from the medium ejection unit, a second member that is fixedly provided at a position which is lower than the medium ejection unit in the gravity direction and on the side of the medium ejection unit with respect to the first member and extends in the width direction of the medium, and a medium holding member that is hung between the first member and the second member so as to form a receiving surface for the medium which falls thereon and is capable of holding the medium on the receiving surface, wherein the first member moves between a first position which is spaced from the medium ejection unit in a direction that intersects with the vertical line and a second position which is further spaced from the medium ejection unit than the first position with rotative displacement about a rotation shaft that extends in the width direction of the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With this configuration, the medium which has been ejected and fallen from the medium ejection unit is received on the receiving surface of the medium holding member in the medium receiving device and held on the receiving surface. When the medium held on the receiving surface is picked-up from the medium receiving device, the first member is rotatively displaced from the first position to the second position. Accordingly, the first member is further spaced from the medium ejection unit, thereby increasing the size of the receiving port for the medium in the medium receiving device that is formed between the first member and the medium ejection unit. As a result, the media can be easily picked-up from the medium receiving device through the wide receiving port. Further, the medium holding member that forms the receiving surface for the medium is hung between the first member and the second member, and accordingly, even if the first member is rotatively displaced to widen the receiving port, the entire receiving surface of the medium holding member is prevented from being reversed since the second member is provided at a fixed position. As a result, it is possible to prevent the medium from extending out of the medium holding member during picking-up of the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the medium receiving device according to the above-mentioned aspect of the invention, a distance between the rotation shaft and the first member in a direction that intersects with an axial direction of the rotation shaft is smaller than a distance between the rotation shaft and the second member in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">With this configuration, the displacement amount of the first member about the rotation shaft when the first member is rotatively displaced about the rotation shaft can be smaller compared with the case where the distance between the rotation shaft and the first member is larger than the distance between the rotation shaft and the second member. As a result, the displacement amount of the distance between the first member and the second member when the first member is rotatively displaced from the first position to the second position decreases, thereby reducing a risk of the medium holding member that is hung between the first member and the second member interfering with rotative displacement of the first member. This allows the first member to be easily rotatable with the medium holding member being hung between the first member and the second member during picking-up of the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the medium receiving device according to the above-mentioned aspect of the invention, the rotation shaft is located vertically above a straight line extending between the first member and the second member in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With this configuration, when the first member is rotatively displaced downward from the first position to the second position during picking-up of the medium, the distance between the first member and the second member decreases. As a result, the position of the first member can be rotatable without effecting on the tension of the medium holding member that is hung between the first member and the second member.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The medium receiving device according to the above-mentioned aspect of the invention further includes a support member that is configured to be rotatable about the rotation shaft while supporting the first member and has an engaging projection that extends in the axial direction of the rotation shaft from a position spaced from the rotation shaft in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft, a member to be slid having a section to be slid on which the engaging projection slides when the support member rotates, and a bias member that biases the support member in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft so that the engaging projection is brought into pressing contact with the section to be slid, wherein the section to be slid has a cam surface that locks the engaging projection in a circumferential direction about the rotation shaft due to a biasing force of the bias member.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With this configuration, when the cam surface of the section to be slid is brought into pressing contact with the engaging projection due to the biasing force of the bias member, the engaging projection is locked by the cam surface in the circumferential direction about the rotation shaft. As a result, the rotation position of the support member about the rotation shaft can be stably held. Further, when the first member rotates about the rotation shaft, the engaging projection resists the biasing force of the bias member and moves over the cam surface, thereby releasing engagement between the cam surface and the engaging projection. As a result, rotation movement of the support member about the rotation shaft becomes possible, thereby allowing the first member to be displaced as necessary during picking-up of the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the medium receiving device according to the above-mentioned aspect of the invention, the section to be slid composed of a first section to be slid that extends in the circumferential direction about the rotation shaft and a second section to be slid that extends downward from a lower end of the first section to be slid on the radially outside of the rotation shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the number of the media that are held in the medium holding member increases, the size of the receiving port for the media that is formed between the medium ejection unit and the first member gradually decreases. According to the above configuration, when the weight of the media increases as the number of the media held in the medium holding member increases, the engaging projection of the support member that supports the first member slides downward on the second section to be slid of the member to be slid. As a result, as the support member rotates downward about the rotation shaft, the size of the receiving port for the media that is formed between the medium ejection unit and the first member increases. Accordingly, even if a plurality of media are held in the medium holding member, a sufficient size of the receiving port for the media can be achieved between the medium ejection unit and the first member.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another aspect of the invention, a recording device includes a recording unit that performs recording on a medium, and medium receiving device of the above-mentioned configuration that receives the medium on which recording has been performed by the recording unit. With this configuration, a similar effect to that of the invention of the medium receiving device can be obtained.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">One embodiment of the invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a recording device <b>10</b> includes a pair of legs <b>12</b>, each of which having an inverted T-shape in side view, a pair of caster wheels <b>11</b> that are capable of running on a floor surface and are mounted on the lower end of the respective legs <b>12</b>, and an apparatus body <b>13</b> that is placed on and assembled to the pair of legs <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The apparatus body <b>13</b> is formed in a substantially cuboid shape that extends in a width direction of a sheet S which is an example of a medium and a sheet feeding unit <b>16</b> that extends obliquely upward from the back side of the apparatus body <b>13</b> and supports a roll sheet holder <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A roll of sheet paper S is rotatably held by a rotation shaft <b>17</b> in the roll sheet holder <b>15</b>. When the rotation shaft <b>17</b> rotates by driving a feed motor, which is not shown in the figure, the sheet S unwound from the roll is fed into the apparatus body <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A carriage <b>20</b> is disposed in the apparatus body <b>13</b> so as to reciprocate in a main scan direction X. A recording head <b>19</b> which is an example of a recording unit is mounted on the carriage <b>20</b>. In the apparatus body <b>13</b>, a plurality of pairs of transportation rollers (not shown in the figure) that are driven by a transportation motor, which is not shown in the figure, to transport the sheet S fed out from the sheet feeding unit <b>16</b>. The recording device <b>10</b> performs recording of an image according to print data on the sheet S by substantially alternatively repeating a recording operation for one scan in which ink droplets are ejected from the recording head <b>19</b> while the carriage <b>20</b> moves in the main scan direction X and a transportation operation in which the sheet S is transported to the next recording position.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, a cartridge container <b>22</b> having a front opening that contains a plurality of ink cartridges <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a cover <b>23</b> that openably covers the front opening of the cartridge container <b>22</b> are provided on the front side of the apparatus body <b>13</b> at one end in the longitudinal direction of the apparatus body <b>13</b> (the right end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The cover <b>23</b> rotates in the forward and backward direction about a rotation shaft (not shown in the figure) that extends in the longitudinal direction of the apparatus body <b>13</b> at a lower end of the cover <b>23</b>, thereby uncovering the opening of the cartridge container <b>22</b>. When the recording head <b>19</b> ejects ink from the ink cartridges <b>21</b> of the cartridge container <b>22</b>, printing is performed on the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, a rotation cutter (not shown in the figure) is provided in the apparatus body <b>13</b> at a position downstream with respect to the recording head <b>19</b> in the transportation direction of the sheet S so as to move in the width direction of the sheet S. The rotation cutter separates the sheet S into pieces of a predetermined length by cutting the sheet S in the thickness direction while moving in the width direction of the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A medium receiving unit <b>24</b> as an example of a medium receiving device that receives the sheets S after printing is performed is disposed on the lower side of the apparatus body <b>13</b>. The medium receiving unit <b>24</b> receives the sheets S which have been ejected and fallen from an ejection port <b>25</b> that is open to the front side of the apparatus body <b>13</b> which is an example of a medium ejection unit such that the sheets S are received at a position lower than the apparatus body <b>13</b> in the gravity direction.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, a configuration of the medium receiving unit <b>24</b> will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, rotative arm mechanisms <b>30</b> are disposed at the upper position of each of the pair of legs <b>12</b>. Each rotative arm mechanism <b>30</b> includes a base <b>31</b> that extends horizontally forward from the leg <b>12</b> and an arm <b>33</b> that is connected to the base <b>31</b> so as to be rotatable about a rotation shaft <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that extends in the width direction of the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One of a pair of arms <b>33</b> which is positioned adjacent to the cartridge container <b>22</b> extends horizontally forward from a position connected to the base <b>31</b>, and then bends at a substantially right angle in the horizontal direction toward the inside of the width direction of the sheet S, and then bends vertically upward at a substantially right angle. That is, a portion of the arm <b>33</b> which corresponds to the cartridge container <b>22</b> in the width direction of the sheet S has a substantially L-shape in front view.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a portion of the arm <b>33</b> that bends in a substantially L-shape is located at a position offset from a rotation path of the cover <b>23</b> rotating forward in the direction by which the opening of the cartridge container <b>22</b> is opened. As a result, an opening movement of the cover <b>23</b> is not interfered by the arm <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The other of the pair of arms <b>33</b> extends horizontally forward from a position connected to the base <b>31</b>, and then bends vertically upward at a substantially right angle. Further, a support shaft <b>35</b> which is an example of a first member horizontally extends in the width direction of the sheet S between each of the distal ends of the pair of arms <b>33</b>. Accordingly, the arms <b>33</b> serve as support members that are rotatable about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> while supporting the support shaft <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a post <b>36</b> extends between each of the pair of legs <b>12</b> in the width direction of the sheet S. The post <b>36</b> supports a locking member <b>37</b> as an example of a second member that extends in the width direction of the sheet S at a fixed position. The locking member <b>37</b> extends straight obliquely downward toward the back side of the apparatus body <b>13</b> from a position connected to the post <b>36</b>. The locking member <b>37</b> has a locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>on the distal end thereof that bends vertically downward at an obtuse angle.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, a medium holding member <b>38</b> formed of a sheet material such as a fabric is hung between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b>. Specifically, since a hollow cylinder <b>38</b><i>a </i>is formed at the front edge of the medium holding member <b>38</b>, the medium holding member <b>38</b> is hung over the support shaft <b>35</b> by inserting the support shaft <b>35</b> into the hollow cylinder <b>38</b><i>a</i>. The support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> are spaced from each other by a predetermined distance such that the medium holding member <b>38</b> sags therebetween. Accordingly, the medium holding member <b>38</b> forms a curved surface with the upper surface being concave such that the upper surface serves as a receiving surface of the sheets S that have been ejected and fallen from the ejection port <b>25</b> of the apparatus body <b>13</b>. The leading edge of the sheet S comes into contact with the upper surface of the medium holding member <b>38</b>, and then moves along the upper surface of the medium holding member <b>38</b> until it abuts and is locked by the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this embodiment, since the rotative arm mechanism <b>30</b> is connected to the upper portion of the leg <b>12</b>, the length of the base <b>31</b> is relatively small compared with the case where the rotative arm mechanism <b>30</b> is connected to the lower end of the leg <b>12</b>, which improves strength of the base <b>31</b>. Further, the rotational diameter of the support shaft <b>35</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is relatively small compared with the case where the rotative arm mechanism <b>30</b> is connected to the lower end of the leg <b>12</b>. As a result, the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the support shaft <b>35</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is smaller than the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. Further, in this embodiment, the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is located vertically above the straight line extending between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the support shaft <b>35</b> has a substantially D-shaped hollow cross section. A projection <b>39</b> having a substantially D-shaped cross section is formed at each distal end of the pair of arms <b>33</b> so as to extend toward the inside of the width direction of the sheet S. Each end of the support shaft <b>35</b> in the axial direction fits on the periphery of the projection <b>39</b> in a non-rotatable manner. Further, the outer diameter of the support shaft <b>35</b> is about 30 mm, which is suitable to be held by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, a connection structure between the base <b>31</b> and the arm <b>33</b> in the rotative arm mechanism <b>30</b> will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in which a portion of an exterior of the base <b>31</b> of the rotative arm mechanism <b>30</b> is not shown, the proximal end portion of the base <b>31</b> is connected to the leg <b>12</b>, while the distal end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>is formed in a substantially disk shape. An oblong hole <b>40</b> elongated in the front-back direction is formed at the substantially center on the side face of the distal end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>31</b> so as to penetrate in the thickness direction of the base <b>31</b>. The rotation shaft <b>32</b> that extends from the arm <b>33</b> toward the outside of the width direction of the sheet S fits into the oblong hole <b>40</b> so as to be movable in the front-back direction. That is, the arm <b>33</b> is relatively movable with respect to the base <b>31</b> in the front-back direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, a groove <b>41</b> is formed at a position in front of the oblong hole <b>40</b> on the distal end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>31</b> so as to penetrate in the thickness direction of the base <b>31</b>. The groove <b>41</b> is composed of a first groove <b>42</b> and a second groove <b>43</b>. The first groove <b>42</b> has a lower end at a position in front of the oblong hole <b>40</b> at the substantially same height as the oblong hole <b>40</b> and extends upward in the substantially circumferential direction about the oblong hole <b>40</b>, while the second groove <b>43</b> has an upper end at a position same as that of the lower end of the first groove <b>42</b> and extends downward in the substantially circumferential direction about the oblong hole <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Specifically, as the first groove <b>42</b> extends upward from the lower end to a halfway point, the distance between the first groove <b>42</b> and the oblong hole <b>40</b> gradually increases, and as the first groove <b>42</b> extends upward from the halfway point to the upper end, the distance between the first groove <b>42</b> and the oblong hole <b>40</b> gradually decreases. Further, as the second groove <b>43</b> extends downward from the upper end to a halfway point, the distance between the second groove <b>43</b> and the oblong hole <b>40</b> gradually increases, and as second groove <b>43</b> extends downward from the halfway point to the lower end, the distance between the second groove <b>43</b> and the oblong hole <b>40</b> gradually decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A cylindrical engaging projection <b>44</b> is formed on the arm <b>33</b> at a position spaced from the rotation shaft <b>32</b> in the radial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b> so as to extend toward the outside of the width direction of the sheet S and engages the groove <b>41</b> of the base <b>31</b>. As the arm <b>33</b> rotates about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and is displaced in the circumferential direction about the rotation shaft <b>32</b>, the engaging projection <b>44</b> slides on the groove <b>41</b> of the base <b>31</b>. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the groove <b>41</b> on which the engaging projection <b>44</b> slides serves as a section to be slid, and the base <b>31</b> having the groove <b>41</b> also serves as a member to be slid.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the inner surface of the second groove <b>43</b> that extends obliquely forward and downward from the upper end to the halfway point while gradually increasing the distance from the oblong hole <b>40</b> serves as a cam surface <b>45</b> (see for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) that locks the engaging projection <b>44</b> in the circumferential direction about the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. The cam surface <b>45</b> extends straight obliquely downward toward the outside in the radial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. In this embodiment, the first groove <b>42</b> extending in the circumferential direction about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> serves as a first section to be slid, while the second groove <b>43</b> extending downward from the lower end of the first groove <b>42</b> toward the outside in the radial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b> serves as a second section to be slid.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, a recess <b>46</b> is formed at a position at the back of the oblong hole <b>40</b> on the distal end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>31</b> at the substantially same height as the oblong hole <b>40</b>. A tension spring <b>47</b> which is an example of a bias member is disposed between the inner surface of the recess <b>46</b> and the rotation shaft <b>32</b> of the arm <b>33</b>. The tension spring <b>47</b> biases the rotation shaft <b>32</b> of the arm <b>33</b> to the back in the horizontal direction, thereby pressing the engaging projection <b>44</b> of the arm <b>33</b> against the inner surface of the groove <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, an operation of the above-mentioned recording device <b>10</b> will be described below, specifically focusing on an operation of the arm <b>33</b> of the rotative arm mechanism <b>30</b> rotating about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> while supporting the support shaft <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the medium receiving unit <b>24</b> receives the sheet S ejected from the ejection port <b>25</b> of the apparatus body <b>13</b>, engaging projections <b>44</b> of the arms <b>33</b> in the rotative arm mechanism <b>30</b> are locked by the cam surface <b>45</b> of the groove <b>41</b> in the circumferential direction about the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. Then, the rotation position of the arms <b>33</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> are held such that the distal ends of the arms <b>33</b> extend vertically upward. In this configuration, the support shaft <b>35</b> supported between the distal ends of the arms <b>33</b> is located at a position spaced forward from the lower end face of the apparatus body <b>13</b> and at the substantially same height as the lower end face of the apparatus body <b>13</b>. A space between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the lower end face of the apparatus body <b>13</b> serves as a receiving port <b>50</b> for the sheet S ejected from the ejection port <b>25</b> of the apparatus body <b>13</b>. That is, a position of the support shaft <b>35</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a receiving position of the sheet S ejected from the ejection port <b>25</b> of the apparatus body <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows that the support shaft <b>35</b> has been lifted up from the receiving position. When the arm <b>33</b> rotates upward about the rotation shaft <b>32</b>, the engaging projection <b>44</b> slides upward on the inner surface of the first groove <b>42</b> while being biased by the tension spring <b>47</b>. The first groove <b>42</b> extends upward from the lower end to a halfway point with the distance between the first groove <b>42</b> and the oblong hole <b>40</b> gradually increasing. Accordingly, as the engaging projection <b>44</b> slides upward, the rotation shaft <b>32</b> resists the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b> and moves horizontally forward in the oblong hole <b>40</b> toward the side of the engaging projection <b>44</b>. That is, when the engaging projection <b>44</b> is lifted upward from the lower end of the first groove <b>42</b>, it is necessary to apply an external force that resists the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>. At this point, the engaging projection <b>44</b> is held at the lower end of the first groove <b>42</b> due to the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>. As a result, the rotation position of the arm <b>33</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is stably held such that the support shaft <b>35</b> is positioned at the receiving position.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the engaging projection <b>44</b> has passed by a portion of the first groove <b>42</b> that extends upward with the distance between the first groove <b>42</b> and the oblong hole <b>40</b> gradually increases, the engaging projection <b>44</b> enters a portion of the first groove <b>42</b> in which the distance between the first groove <b>42</b> and the oblong hole <b>40</b> gradually decreases. As the engaging projection <b>44</b> slides upward in the first groove <b>42</b>, the rotation shaft <b>32</b> moves horizontally backward in the oblong hole <b>40</b> toward the side opposite from the engaging projection <b>44</b> due to the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows that the engaging projection <b>44</b> has moved to the upper end of the first groove <b>42</b> with the aid of the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>. At this point, the support shaft <b>35</b> supported between the distal ends of the arms <b>33</b> is located at a position closer to the apparatus body <b>13</b> in the front-back direction compared with the case where the support shaft <b>35</b> is positioned at the receiving position. As a result, a distance from the apparatus body <b>13</b> to the arm <b>33</b> of the rotative arm mechanism <b>30</b> positioned in front of the apparatus body <b>13</b> in the storing position is smaller than that in the receiving position. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the size of the recording device <b>10</b> in the horizontal direction when the support shaft <b>35</b> is not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, when the support shaft <b>35</b> is pressed downward so as to move the engaging projection <b>44</b> downward from the upper end of the first groove <b>42</b>, it is necessary to apply an external force that resists the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>. At this point, the engaging projection <b>44</b> is held at the upper end of the first groove <b>42</b> due to the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>. As a result, the rotation position of the arm <b>33</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is stably held such that the support shaft <b>35</b> is positioned at the storing position.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows that the support shaft <b>35</b> has been pressed downward from the receiving position. When the arm <b>33</b> rotates downward about the rotation shaft <b>32</b>, the engaging projection <b>44</b> slides downward on the cam surface <b>45</b> that extends from the upper end of the second groove <b>43</b> while being biased by the tension spring <b>47</b>. The cam surface <b>45</b> extends downward from the upper end of the second groove <b>43</b> toward the outside in the radial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b> with the distance between the second groove <b>43</b> and the oblong hole <b>40</b> gradually increasing. Accordingly, as the engaging projection <b>44</b> slides downward, the rotation shaft <b>32</b> resists the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b> and moves horizontally forward in the oblong hole <b>40</b> toward the side of the engaging projection <b>44</b>. That is, when the support shaft <b>35</b> is pressed downward so as to move the engaging projection <b>44</b> downward from the upper end of the second groove <b>43</b>, it is necessary to apply an external force that resists the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>. At this point, the engaging projection <b>44</b> is held at the upper end of the second groove <b>43</b> due to the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>. As a result, the rotation position of the arm <b>33</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is stably held such that the support shaft <b>35</b> is positioned at the receiving position.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the engaging projection <b>44</b> has passed by the cam surface <b>45</b> which is a portion of the second groove <b>43</b> that extends downward with the distance between the second groove <b>43</b> and the oblong hole <b>40</b> gradually increases, the engaging projection <b>44</b> enters a portion of the second groove <b>43</b> in which the distance between the second groove <b>43</b> and the oblong hole <b>40</b> gradually decreases. As the engaging projection <b>44</b> slides downward in the second groove <b>43</b>, the rotation shaft <b>32</b> moves horizontally backward in the oblong hole <b>40</b> toward the side opposite from the engaging projection <b>44</b> due to the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows that the engaging projection <b>44</b> has moved to the lower end of the second groove <b>43</b> with the aid of the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>. At this point, the support shaft <b>35</b> supported between the distal ends of the arms <b>33</b> is located at the picking-up position which is largely spaced from the apparatus body <b>13</b> in the front-back direction compared with the case where the support shaft <b>35</b> is positioned at the receiving position. Since the receiving port <b>50</b> for the sheet S that is formed between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the lower end face of the apparatus body <b>13</b> becomes large, the sheets S are easily picked-up from the medium receiving unit <b>24</b> through the wide receiving port <b>50</b>. That is, in this embodiment, the receiving position at which the sheet S ejected from the ejection port <b>25</b> of the apparatus body <b>13</b> is received corresponds to a first position, while the picking-up position which is largely spaced from the apparatus body <b>13</b> compared with the receiving position corresponds to a second position. The support shaft <b>35</b> moves between the receiving position and the picking-up position with rotative displacement about rotation shaft <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, when the support shaft <b>35</b> is lifted upward so as to move the engaging projection <b>44</b> upward from the lower end of the second groove <b>43</b>, it is necessary to apply an external force that resists the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>. At this point, the engaging projection <b>44</b> is held at the lower end of the second groove <b>43</b> due to the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>. As a result, the rotation position of the arm <b>33</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is stably held such that the support shaft <b>35</b> is positioned at the picking-up position.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment in which the medium holding member <b>38</b> that forms a receiving surface of the sheet S is hung between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking member <b>37</b>, the support shaft <b>35</b> that supports the proximal end portion of the sheet S in the ejection direction from the underside is rotatively displaced about the rotation shaft <b>32</b>, while the locking member <b>37</b> that locks the leading edge of the sheet S in the ejection direction is provided at a fixed position. Accordingly, even if the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatively displaced about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> to widen the receiving port <b>50</b> for the sheet S, the entire receiving surface of the medium holding member <b>38</b> is prevented from being reversed. As a result, it is possible to prevent the sheet S from extending out of the medium holding member <b>38</b> during picking-up of the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, in this embodiment, a distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the support shaft <b>35</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is smaller than the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. Accordingly, the displacement amount of the support shaft <b>35</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> when the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatively displaced about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is smaller compared with the case where the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the support shaft <b>35</b> is larger than the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b>. As a result, the displacement amount of the distance between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> when the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatively displaced from the receiving position to the picking-up position decreases, thereby reducing a risk of the medium holding member <b>38</b> that is hung between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking member <b>37</b> interfering with rotative displacement of the support shaft <b>35</b>. This allows the support shaft <b>35</b> to be easily rotatable about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> during picking-up of the sheet S with the medium holding member <b>38</b> being hung between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, in this embodiment, the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is located vertically above the straight line extending between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. Accordingly, when the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatively displaced downward from the receiving position to the picking-up position during picking-up of the sheet S, the distance between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> decreases. As a result, the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatable about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> without effecting on the tension of the medium holding member <b>38</b> that is hung between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to the above embodiment, the following effect can be achieved:</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">(1) When the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatively displaced from the receiving position to the picking-up position, the wide receiving port <b>50</b> for the sheets S in the medium receiving unit <b>24</b> is formed between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the apparatus body <b>13</b>. As a result, the sheets S are easily picked-up from the medium receiving unit <b>24</b> through the wide receiving port <b>50</b>. Further, in this configuration, the medium holding member <b>38</b> is hung between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking member <b>37</b>, and accordingly, even if the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatively displaced to widen the receiving port <b>50</b> for the sheet S, the entire receiving surface of the medium holding member <b>38</b> is prevented from being reversed since the locking member <b>37</b> is provided at a fixed position. As a result, it is possible to prevent the sheet S from extending out of the medium holding member <b>38</b> during picking-up of the sheet S.
<br/>
(2) The distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the support shaft <b>35</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is smaller than the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. Accordingly, the displacement amount of the support shaft <b>35</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> when the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatively displaced about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is smaller compared with the case where the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the support shaft <b>35</b> is larger than the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b>. As a result, the displacement amount of the distance between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> when the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatively displaced from the receiving position to the picking-up position decreases, thereby reducing a risk of the medium holding member <b>38</b> that is hung between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking member <b>37</b> interfering with rotative displacement of the support shaft <b>35</b>. This allows the support shaft <b>35</b> to be easily rotatable about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> during picking-up of the sheet S with the medium holding member <b>38</b> being hung between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b>.
<br/>
(3) The rotation shaft <b>32</b> is located vertically above the straight line extending between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. Accordingly, when the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatively displaced downward from the receiving position to the picking-up position during picking-up of the sheet S, the distance between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> decreases. As a result, the support shaft <b>35</b> is rotatable about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> without effecting on the tension of the medium holding member <b>38</b> that is hung between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b>.
<br/>
(4) When the cam surface <b>45</b> of the groove <b>41</b> is in close contact with the engaging projection <b>44</b> due to the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b>, the engaging projection <b>44</b> is locked by the cam surface <b>45</b> in the circumferential direction about the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. As a result, the rotation position of the arm <b>33</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> can be stably held. Moreover, when the support shaft <b>35</b> further rotates about the rotation shaft <b>32</b>, the engaging projection <b>44</b> resists the biasing force of the tension spring <b>47</b> and moves over the cam surface <b>45</b>, thereby releasing engagement between the cam surface <b>45</b> and the engaging projection <b>44</b>. As a result, rotation movement of the arm <b>33</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> becomes possible, thereby allowing the support shaft <b>35</b> to be displaced as necessary during picking-up of the sheet S.
</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The following modifications may be made to the above-mentioned embodiment:</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the above-mentioned embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a recess <b>51</b> may be formed vertically above the oblong hole <b>40</b> on the distal end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>31</b>, and a tension spring <b>52</b> may be disposed between the inner surface of the recess <b>51</b> and the engaging projection <b>44</b> of the arm <b>33</b>. In this configuration, the cam surface <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) that locks the engaging projection <b>44</b> may be formed, for example, along the line extending between the upper end of the second groove <b>43</b> and the recess <b>51</b>. In this configuration, the cam surface <b>45</b> extends straight obliquely downward from the upper end of the second groove <b>43</b> which is the lower end of the first groove <b>42</b> toward the outside in the radial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, since the tension spring <b>52</b> biases the engaging projection <b>44</b> of the arm <b>33</b> obliquely upward and backward, the engaging projection <b>44</b> of the arm <b>33</b> is brought into pressing contact with the inner surface of the upper end of the second groove <b>43</b>. As a result, the engaging projection <b>44</b> is held at the upper end of the second groove <b>43</b> due to the biasing force of the tension spring <b>52</b>. Accordingly, when the sheets S are held in the medium holding member <b>38</b>, the rotation position of the arm <b>33</b> about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is stably held such that the support shaft <b>35</b> is positioned at the receiving position.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the number of the sheets S that are held in the medium holding member <b>38</b> increases, the size of the receiving port <b>50</b> for the sheet S that is formed between the apparatus body <b>13</b> and the support shaft <b>35</b> gradually decreases. In this configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, when the weight of the sheets S increases as the number of the sheets S held in the medium holding member <b>38</b> increases, the engaging projection <b>44</b> of the arm <b>33</b> that supports the support shaft <b>35</b> slides obliquely downward on the cam surface <b>45</b> of the base <b>31</b> due to the gravity force. As a result, as the arm <b>33</b> rotates downward about the rotation shaft <b>32</b>, the size of the receiving port <b>50</b> for the sheet S that is formed between the apparatus body <b>13</b> and the support shaft <b>35</b> increases. Accordingly, even if a plurality of sheets S are held in the medium holding member <b>38</b>, a sufficient size of the receiving port <b>50</b> for the sheet S can be achieved between the apparatus body <b>13</b> and the support shaft <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, in this configuration, when the support shaft <b>35</b> positioned at the receiving position is lifted upward, the engaging projection <b>44</b> slides to the upper end of the first groove <b>42</b> with the aid of the biasing force of the tension spring <b>52</b>. Accordingly, a load applied when the support shaft <b>35</b> is moved upward from the receiving position to the storing position while resisting the gravity force can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, in this configuration, when the support shaft <b>35</b> which is positioned at the receiving position is pressed downward, the engaging projection <b>44</b> slides to the lower end of the second groove <b>43</b> while resisting the biasing force of the tension spring <b>52</b>. Accordingly, when the support shaft <b>35</b> is pressed downward from the receiving position to the picking-up position, the tension spring <b>52</b> serves as a damper that buffers the downward rotative displacement of the arm <b>33</b>. As a result, when the support shaft <b>35</b> moves from the receiving position to the picking-up position, it is possible to prevent sudden movement of the arm <b>33</b> in rotative displacement about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> due to a weight of the sheets S held in the medium holding member <b>38</b> or a weight of the arm <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Although the tension spring <b>52</b> is provided as a bias member that brings the engaging projection <b>44</b> of the arm <b>33</b> into pressing contact with the inner surface of the upper end of the second groove <b>43</b> in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the bias member is not limited to the tension spring <b>52</b>. For example, a torsion spring that biases the arm <b>33</b> in the circumferential direction about the rotation shaft <b>32</b> may be provided as a bias member.

        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0079">In the above-mentioned embodiment, the tension spring <b>47</b> may be configured to bring the engaging projection <b>44</b> of the arm <b>33</b> into pressing contact with the inner surface of the groove <b>41</b> by connecting one end of the tension spring <b>47</b> to the engaging projection <b>44</b> of the arm</li>

        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0081">In the above-mentioned embodiment, the rotation shaft <b>32</b> may be located vertically below the straight line extending between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. Further, the rotation shaft <b>32</b> may be located on the straight line extending between the support shaft <b>35</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0082">In the above-mentioned embodiment, the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the support shaft <b>35</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b> may be larger than the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>. Further, the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the support shaft <b>35</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b> may be about the same as the distance between the rotation shaft <b>32</b> and the locking portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the locking member <b>37</b> in the direction that intersects with the axial direction of the rotation shaft <b>32</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0083">Although the recording device is embodied as a recording device <b>10</b> having the recording head <b>19</b> that ejects ink as an example of liquid in the above-mentioned embodiment, the invention may also be embodied as a liquid ejection apparatus that ejects liquid other than ink. The invention may be applied to a variety of liquid ejection apparatuses having a liquid ejection head that ejects fine liquid droplets. The liquid droplets refer to a state of liquid that is ejected from the liquid ejection apparatuses and are intended to include those in a particle, tear drop or string shape.

The ink as described herein includes various liquid components such as general water-based ink, oil-based ink, gel ink and hot melt ink. Specific examples of liquid ejection apparatus may include, for example, liquid ejection apparatuses that eject liquid containing materials such as electrode material and color material in a dispersed or dissolved state, which are used for manufacturing of liquid crystal displays, electro-luminescence (EL) displays, surface emitting displays or color filters. Alternatively, they may include liquid ejection apparatuses that eject bioorganic materials used for manufacturing biochips, liquid ejection apparatuses that are used as a precision pipette and eject liquid of a sample, textile printing apparatuses and micro dispensers. Further, they may also include liquid ejection apparatuses that eject lubricant to precision instrument such as a clock or camera in a pin-point manner, liquid ejection apparatuses that eject transparent resin liquid such as ultraviolet cured resin onto a substrate for manufacturing minute hemispheric lenses (optical lenses) used for optical communication elements or the like, and liquid ejection apparatuses that eject acid or alkali etching liquid for etching a substrate or the like.
