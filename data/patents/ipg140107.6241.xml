<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed herein are techniques to enable users to purchase or receive information regarding items identified in a stream output by a content output device, regardless of whether the users are previously associated with the content output device or a device that monitors the stream. With these techniques, for instance, a user watching a video stream displayed on a television may see an advertisement for an item offered for purchase. In response, the user may choose to initiate a purchase of the item from an item offering service, to add the item to a shopping cart of the user at the item offering service, or to receive information regarding the item from the item offering service.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/823,611, filed on Aug. 25, 2006, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/548,111, filed on Oct. 10, 2006, both entitled UTILIZING PHRASE TOKENS IN TRANSACTIONS and both incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">While watching a video stream such as broadcast television, users view scores of advertisements for an array of different products offered for sale by an array of different merchants. However, if one of these users desires to purchase an offered product, the user must typically either go to a brick-and-mortar store that offers the desired product or use a computer that is entirely disconnected from the television to order the desired product over the Internet. For instance, after watching an advertisement for a particular pair of shoes, the user may either travel to a local merchant that offers the shoes or may order the shoes from a merchant using a desktop or laptop computer of the user. However, both of these two options require the user to direct his or her attention away from the object currently of interest&#x2014;namely the television stream that is currently being broadcasted to the television of the user.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The detailed description is described with reference to the accompanying figures. In the figures, the left-most digit(s) of a reference number identifies the figure in which the reference number first appears. The use of the same reference numbers in different figures indicates similar or identical items.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example architecture that includes a user watching a video stream on a television. As illustrated, the television couples to a device that monitors the video stream displayed on the television. Within this architecture, the user may, for example, request to purchase or receive information regarding an item displayed on the television, regardless of whether the device or the television has been previously associated with the user making the request.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates example components of the device coupled to the television of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as well as example components of an item offering service of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that offers the item or information about the item displayed on the television.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a series of example user interfaces (UIs) that may be displayed on the television of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as the user requests to purchase an item displayed on the television.</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This disclosure is directed, in part, to techniques to enable users take advantage of offers identified within a media stream. For instance, the techniques may allow the users to obtain (e.g., purchase, rent, lease, download, etc.) items or receive information regarding items identified in media stream being output by a content output device. The content output device may comprise a personal computing device, a television, a radio, a heads up display, a kiosk or any other device capable of outputting any sort of content. In addition, the stream output by the content output device may comprise a video stream, an audio stream or any other form of media stream. These techniques apply regardless of whether the users are previously associated with the content output device or with a device that monitors the stream output by the content output device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With these techniques, in one example, a user watching a video stream displayed on a television may see an advertisement for an item offered for purchase. In response, the user may choose to initiate a purchase of the item from an item offering service, to add the item to a shopping cart of the user at the item offering service, or receive information regarding the item from the item offering service.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To do so, the user may send the request, via a remote control or otherwise, to a device, such as a set-top box, that monitors the video stream being displayed by the television. In response to receiving the request, the device may facilitate entry of an identifier of the user. The user may then enter an email address of the user, a mobile phone number of the user, a name of the user or any other information that allows the item offering service to uniquely identify the user.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">After receiving the user's identifier, the device may send the identifier along with an identifier of the item to the item offering service to initiate the request, such as the request to purchase the item. In some instances discussed below, the device may also send a message authentication code (MAC) (e.g., a Hash-based MAC) or the like for the purpose of enabling the item offering service to verify the authenticity of the received message.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The item offering service may receive the user identifier, the item identifier and, potentially, the MAC. After verifying the authenticity of the message, the item offering service may map the received user identifier to a user account for the purpose of identifying the user. The service may also map the item identifier to an electronic catalog of items for the purpose of identifying the item, unless the device such as the set-top box has already done so.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">After identifying the item, the service may analyze the user account to determine how the user prefers to approve purchases at the item offering service, as well as the contact information that the service may use to contact the user. For instance, the service may determine that the user prefers to receive an email in order to approve requested purchases. Conversely, the service may determine that the user prefers to receive short messaging service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS) text messages. In still other instances, the service may send a communication to the user based on the user identifier received. For example, the item offering service may send an email if the user provided an email address, may send an SMS text message if the user sent a mobile phone number, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In either instance, the service may send a request to approve the purchase of the item to a user. In some instances, the service sends this message to the user via a communication channel that differs from a communication channel by which the user entered the user identifiers and by which the item offering service received the user and item identifiers. For instance, the service may receive the user and item identifiers from the device that monitors the video stream via a private connection between the device and the service, while sending an email or an SMS text message to the user to approve the purchase.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In each of these instances, the user may receive a request to approve the purchase of the item from the item offering service. The user may then approve or deny the approval request and may provide this approval or denial back to the item offering service. Because the service sent this request via a communication channel that differs from how the user inputted the request to initiate the purchase, the user does not approve or deny the approval request via the television, but via another computing device. For instance, the user may send an approval to the item offering service via an SMS text message in instances where the service sent the approval request to the user via an SMS text message.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With use of these techniques, users are able to send requests to one or more item offering services to purchase items, add items to shopping carts, receive information about items, or the like, while watching a video stream on a computing device or a television (e.g., while watching broadcast television, a locally-stored movie, navigating an electronic program guide (EPG), playing a game, etc.), while listening to an audio stream on a radio or while consuming any other media stream by any other content output device. Furthermore, after sending the requests, the users are able to receive approval requests from the item offering service(s) via a mobile phone of the user, a laptop computing device of the user or any other electronic device other than the televisions through which the users inputted the initial requests. Furthermore, these users are able to receive the requested item or information via these other channels as well. For instance, a user may receive requested information about an item via an email after making the request for the information through the device coupled to the television.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In still other instances, a user may request to purchase an item identified in stream, such as a video stream, and provide, as a part of this request, both a user identifier and a personal identification number (PIN) or other password associated with the account of the user at the item offering service. Then, the device coupled to the content output device may send this request with the user identifier and the PIN to the item offering service, which may actually process the request on behalf of the identified user if the PIN matches a PIN stored by the item offering system in association with an account of the identified user. That is, the item offering service may approve the request to purchase an item in response to receiving a request from the device that is accompanied with a user identifier and a PIN that is associated with the user identifier at the item offering service.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, because these techniques enable users to enter user identifiers before providing these identifiers to an item offering service, these techniques allow multiple different users to send requests through a common device and/or content output device. That is, if multiple users are watching a common video stream, each of these users is able to request to purchase or otherwise take an action regarding an item displayed on the television, for example, before consummating the transaction with the item offering service over communication channels that are unique to the individual users.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For instance, a first user may request to purchase a new pair shoes by entering a mobile phone number of the user into the device coupled to a content output device, such as a television. After receiving the identifier of the shoes and the email address of the user, the item offering service may then send an email to the entered address to allow the user to approve or deny the purchase. A second user, meanwhile, may see an advertisement for a particular book for sale and, in response, may request more information regarding the advertised book. The user may enter a mobile phone number of the user into the device coupled to the television and, after receiving the user and item identifiers, the item offering service may send an SMS or MMS text message to the entered mobile phone number containing additional information about the advertised book.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The discussion begins with a section entitled &#x201c;Illustrative Architecture&#x201d; that describes one example architecture and several example components that implement the techniques introduced above. Next, a section entitled &#x201c;Illustrative User Interfaces&#x201d; follows, describing examples of user interfaces (UIs) that may be served to and rendered at the television of the user of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> after the user requests to purchase an item displayed on the television, add an item to a shopping cart of the user or request information regarding an item. The discussion then moves on to discuss an &#x201c;Illustrative Flow Diagram&#x201d; for implementing the described techniques in the architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, before concluding with a section entitled &#x201c;Illustrative Processes&#x201d; and a brief conclusion.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This brief introduction, including section titles and corresponding summaries, is provided for the reader's convenience and is not intended to limit the scope of the claims, nor the proceeding sections. Furthermore, the techniques described above and below may be implemented in a number of ways and in a number of contexts. Several example implementations and contexts are provided with reference to the following figures, as described below in more detail. However, the following implementations and contexts are but a few of many. For instance, and as discussed above, these techniques apply to a variety of content output devices and for a variety of media streams, including audio streams, video streams and any other form of media stream.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Illustrative Architecture</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example architecture <b>100</b> in which a user <b>102</b> may leverage the techniques described above while consuming a stream being output by a content output device. Here, user <b>102</b> is viewing a video stream on a display <b>104</b> of a television <b>106</b>. As illustrated, a content provider <b>108</b> provides the displayed video stream over a network <b>110</b>, which may include any one or combination of multiple different types of networks, such as cable networks, the Internet, and wireless networks. In some instances, network <b>110</b> comprises a cable network, a satellite network or any other network that provides a television broadcast signal, an audio stream, video-on-demand or any other video or audio signal.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Content provider <b>108</b> may comprise a cable television provider, a satellite television provider or any other type of provider capable of providing a video stream to television <b>106</b>. In some instances, a device <b>112</b> coupled to television <b>106</b> receives and causes display of the video stream on the television. In these and other instances, device <b>112</b> monitors the video stream to detect when items are shown on display <b>104</b>, as introduced above and described in detail below. Although illustrated as separate from television <b>106</b>, this device may also be integral with television <b>106</b> in other implementations. Furthermore, device <b>112</b> may comprise a set-top box, a game console, a media center or any other computing device that receives the video signal and causes display of the received signal on display <b>104</b> or any other device that otherwise monitors the incoming video stream.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further illustrates that user <b>102</b> may use a remote control <b>114</b> or other input device to operate television <b>106</b> and/or device <b>112</b>. For instance, user <b>102</b> may use remote control <b>114</b> to control contents of the displayed video stream (i.e., to change the channel), to control a volume of television <b>106</b>, to adjust settings of television <b>106</b> or the like. Furthermore, remote control <b>114</b> may include controls that, when actuated by user <b>102</b>, cause display of an overlay on display <b>104</b>. This overlay may allow user <b>102</b> to request to purchase an item currently or previously displayed on display <b>104</b>, may allow user <b>102</b> to request to add the item to a shopping cart or list (e.g., a wish list) associated with the user, may allow user <b>102</b> to request information regarding the item or may allow user <b>102</b> to take any other action regarding the item.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As introduced briefly above, device <b>112</b> receives these requests from user <b>102</b> and passes the requests to one or more offering services <b>116</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>116</b>(<b>2</b>), . . . , <b>116</b>(M). In response to receiving these requests, the receiving offering services (e.g., service <b>116</b>(M)) contacts user <b>102</b> for the purpose of fulfilling the request. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further illustrates that multiple other users <b>118</b> may also operate respective devices coupled to respective televisions for the purpose of making these requests to the same or different offering services <b>116</b>(<b>1</b>)-(M).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for instance, illustrates that display <b>104</b> currently displays an image of a digital camera. Device <b>112</b>, which monitors the video stream displayed on display <b>104</b>, detects that the digital camera may comprise an item offered for consumption (e.g., purchase, rental, lease, etc.) by one or more of offering services <b>116</b>(<b>1</b>)-(M). The device may make such a determination by detecting an advertisement and determining the items being marketed therein, or the device may simply detect the item within the video stream, regardless of whether the item resides within an advertisement. In either event, device <b>112</b> detects that display <b>104</b> currently displays a particular identified item, namely a digital camera in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Device <b>112</b> may implement one or more of a variety of techniques to identify the items within the audio and/or video stream. In the latter example, the device may implement image recognition technology to analyze the visually-displayed item and attempt to match the identified characteristics against a catalog of items. In addition or in the alternative, the device may request that a group of human users manually identify the items. For audio streams, the device may employ audio recognition techniques to identify item characteristics and compare these characteristics against the catalog of items. Again, the device may also request that a group of human users manually identify these items within the audio stream. However the device identifies the item, the techniques may employ a feedback loop to ask for user feedback regarding the identified item. By doing so, the device may continually improve its ability to correctly recognize items within a stream.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In response to identifying an item and in response to receiving a request from user <b>102</b> (e.g., via remote control <b>114</b>), device <b>112</b> causes display of one or more icons on display <b>104</b> that enable user <b>102</b> to make specific request regarding the displayed item. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that device <b>112</b> may display an icon <b>120</b> entitled &#x201c;Buy Now,&#x201d; an icon <b>122</b> entitled &#x201c;Add to Cart,&#x201d; and an icon <b>124</b> entitled &#x201c;More Info.&#x201d; In addition or in the alternative, device <b>112</b> may compile each item identified within a particular program, movie, song or other stream. Then, device <b>112</b> may provide a list of the identified items to the user at the conclusion of the program for the user's browsing and perusal. For instance, the user may be able to receive information and/or request to purchase one or more items that were displayed within a particular episode of a television program, within a particular movie, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With this information displayed, user <b>102</b> may again operate remote control <b>114</b> (or any other control associated with device <b>112</b>) to select one of icons <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b>. For instance, when user <b>102</b> desires to purchase the illustrated digital camera, user <b>102</b> may select icon <b>120</b> to initiate a purchase of the camera from example offering service <b>116</b>(M). In response to selecting icon <b>120</b>, device <b>112</b> may facilitate entry of an identifier associated with user <b>102</b> or another user. For instance, device <b>112</b> may display a text box that allows user <b>102</b> to enter (e.g., via remote control <b>114</b>, via a keyboard, via a touch screen, audibly (via a microphone), etc.) a piece of information that uniquely identifies user <b>102</b> with offering service <b>116</b>(M) and/or device <b>112</b>. For instance, user <b>102</b> may enter his or her name, a mobile phone number of the user, an email address of the user, a user name of the user at offering service <b>116</b>(M) or any other identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some instances, user <b>102</b> may enter a transaction phrase token as an identifier. As described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/548,111 (incorporated by reference above), a transaction phrase token comprises a set of numeric or alphanumeric characters that may have a secondary meaning to the user (e.g., &#x201c;Camera Wizard,&#x201d; &#x201c;Grace's Textbooks,&#x201d; &#x201c;Tanner's Allowance,&#x201d; &#x201c;Rambling Trail Runner,&#x201d; etc.). Furthermore, in some instances, each of the phrases may comprise at least one word. In still other instances, each of the phrases may comprise between two and seven words, and may be free of numbers, symbols and the like. As such, these phrases may comprise a number of grammatically-correct words that may or may not be separated from one another by a space.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some instances, a user may request creation of a transaction phrase token for the user's own use. That is, the user may link his or her payment instrument to a phrase token, such as &#x201c;Camera Wizard,&#x201d; and may then use the transaction phrase token to purchase or otherwise consume services or items. In other instances, a first user may request creation of a token that is for use by a second user. For instance, a father may create a transaction phrase token for his son, Griffin, entitled &#x201c;Griffin's Utility Bills.&#x201d; The father may then set rules about how Griffin may and may not use the transaction phrase token. For instance, the father could set a monthly allowance for the transaction phrase token or could specify that the token may only be used to pay for utility bills from specific vendors (and, hence, cannot be used to purchase other services or items).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In both instances, a user of a created transaction phrase token may use the phrase token to conduct transactions (e.g., to purchase or otherwise consume services or items offered for sale or consumption). For instance, the user could purchase, give, or receive a service or item (e.g., an item from a merchant, money, etc.) with the use of the transaction phrase token, or the user could similarly engage in any other sort of transaction with use of the token.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some instances, a transaction phrase token that is associated with an aspect of a user account is free from information identifying the aspect of the user account. For instance, the transaction phrase token &#x201c;Camera Wizard&#x201d; may be associated with a payment instrument of user <b>102</b>, yet may be free from information identifying the payment instrument. Therefore, the user associated with the phrase may more freely share the phrase than an actual identifier of the payment instrument. That is, user <b>102</b> may more freely share the phrase &#x201c;Camera Wizard&#x201d; when compared with the sharing of the underlying payment instrument (e.g., a credit card number, bank account number, gift card number, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition to being associated with one or more aspects of a user account (e.g., payment instrument, shipping address, etc.), a transaction phrase token may have other characteristics. For instance, a transaction phrase token may be assigned one or more rules specifying how the token may be used. For instance, user <b>102</b> may assign rules to his or her phrase token &#x201c;Camera Wizard,&#x201d; specifying that offering service <b>116</b>(M) is to automatically approve any purchase requests for digital camera items that are less than $100, and that these items are to be shipped via 2-day shipping. User <b>102</b> may similarly create any other similar or different rules.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Regardless of the identifier used, device <b>112</b> may send the user's entered identifier along with an identifier of the item (here, a digital camera) to offering service <b>116</b>(M). In some instances, device <b>112</b> also sends a message authentication code (MAC) for the purpose of enabling offering service <b>116</b>(M) to authenticate the message.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In response to receiving the message from device <b>112</b>, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may map the user identifier to a particular user and/or user account at the service. Service <b>116</b>(M) may also map the item identifier to a particular item within an electronic catalog of items hosted by the service. The offering service <b>116</b>(M) may also analyze the identified user account to determine a communication preference of the user. Conversely, the service may simply use the received user identifier to determine how to contact user <b>102</b> regarding the user's request to purchase the illustrated camera. In addition, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may determine a payment instrument against which to charge the item, as well as a shipping address and ship speed that is to be associated with the order for the camera. Conversely, the service may instead request that user <b>102</b> specify this information in a communication to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After determining some or all of this information, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may then send a request to approve the purchase to user <b>102</b>. In alternative instances, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may automatically complete the purchase for the user if the user's account dictates. The service may then send a confirmation of the purchase rather than a request to approve the purchase. In each of these instances, service <b>116</b>(M) may send an email, a short messaging service (SMS) text message, a multimedia messaging service (MMS) text message, an interactive voice response (IVR) communication, a phone call, a message to a web-accessible user account of user <b>102</b>, or any other similar or different type of communication to user <b>102</b>. In some instances, offering service <b>116</b>(M) sends this message via a communication channel that differs from the communication channel by which user <b>102</b> inputted the information and by which device <b>112</b> sent the information to offering service <b>116</b>(M). This approval request may simply include a request to approve or deny the purchase, or may also request additional information, such as a preferred payment instrument, shipping address and/or shipping method.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">After receiving this approval request (e.g., via an SMS text message), user <b>102</b> may respond to offering service <b>116</b>(M). In response to receiving an approval of the purchase, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may proceed to finalize the purchase and fulfill the request for the digital camera. Conversely, the offering service may refrain from completing the purchase in response to receiving a denial of the purchase from user <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As discussed above, by allowing user <b>102</b> to enter a user identifier on an overlay of a video stream displayed on television <b>106</b>, the user and other users are able to purchase items advertised or otherwise shown on broadcast television, movies or the like without having to first associate device <b>112</b> with an account of the user at offering service <b>116</b>(M). That is, potentially any user who is watching the video stream on display <b>104</b> may request to purchase a displayed item. In addition, multiple users may each request to purchase same or different items from the same television and via common device <b>112</b>. Furthermore, by separating the initiating of the transaction with the approval of the transaction, users are able to initiate a purchase while watching the video stream and finalize the purchase at a later time. In instances where these users have a business relationship with offering service <b>116</b>(M) (e.g., when the users maintain a user account at the service), the users do not have to provide payment details to a party that the users may or may not trust. Instead, these users are able to finalize this transaction with a party that already maintains trust of the users.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates example components of device <b>112</b> coupled to television <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as well as example components of item offering service <b>116</b>(M) that offers the item or information about the item displayed on the television.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated, device <b>112</b> may include one or more processors <b>202</b> and memory <b>204</b>. Memory <b>204</b> stores or otherwise has access to an item detection module <b>206</b>, an item mapping module <b>208</b>, a user identification module <b>210</b> and a communication module <b>212</b>. Device <b>112</b> may include one or more other non-illustrated modules in some implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Item detection module <b>206</b> serves to monitor the video stream being displayed on display <b>104</b> of television <b>106</b> for the purpose of identifying an item displayed within the stream. In some instances, module <b>206</b> monitors the stream to determine if the video stream displays an item that is included in one or more specified electronic catalogs, such as an electronic catalog hosted by offering service <b>116</b>(M). Monitoring the stream may include both monitoring visual aspects of the displayed stream as well as metadata that accompany the video stream. In some instances, item detection module <b>206</b> identifies advertisements within the stream (e.g., video, audio, etc.) in order to identify one or more displayed items (e.g., with reference to tags in the metadata), while in other instances the module may identify items within the stream regardless of whether the item appears in a designated advertisement. As illustrated, item detection module <b>206</b> may reside on device <b>112</b> and/or on offering service <b>116</b>(M).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In order to verify that a displayed object is indeed an item, item detection module <b>206</b> may communicate with item mapping module <b>208</b>. Item mapping module <b>208</b> may receive candidate items from item detection module <b>206</b> and may attempt to map these items into one or more specified electronic catalogs for the purpose of verifying whether the object is indeed an item within the catalog, as well as the exact identity of the item. Once module <b>208</b> determines that an object is indeed an item, item mapping module <b>208</b> may determine an identifier associated with the item, such as a title of the item, a stock-keeping unit (SKU) of the item, a universal product code (UPC) of the item and the like. As illustrated, item mapping module <b>208</b> may reside on device <b>112</b> and/or on offering service <b>116</b>(M).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, item mapping module <b>208</b> may identify one or more accessory items that are related to the identified item for the purpose of offering these accessories to the user at a later time. Additionally or alternatively, module <b>208</b> may identify similar items that having higher reviews or additional functionality for later offering of these &#x201c;up sell&#x201d; items to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, user identification module <b>210</b> enables user <b>102</b> (or any other user viewing the video stream on display <b>104</b>) to enter an identifier associated with the user for the purpose of taking some action regarding a displayed item. For instance, when user <b>102</b> makes a request to initiate a purchase of the displayed digital camera, user identification module <b>210</b> facilitates entry of an identifier associated with the user. For instance, module <b>210</b> may present a text box to allow user <b>102</b> to enter his or her name, email address, mobile phone number, transaction phrase token, etc. Conversely, module <b>210</b> may enable user <b>102</b> to orally state an identifier or may enable user <b>102</b> to input such an identifier in any other similar or different manner.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Once device <b>112</b> has received a request from user <b>102</b>, has identified the item associated with the request and has received an identification of user <b>102</b>, communication module <b>212</b> may communicate this information to one or more of offering services <b>116</b>(<b>1</b>)-(M). Specifically, communication module <b>212</b> may send a message that includes the determined item identifier, the entered user identifier and, potentially, a message authentication code (MAC) or the like that allows the receiving offering service(s) to validate the authenticity of the message.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some instances, communication module <b>212</b> sends this message to a particular merchant that offers multiple different items regardless of the identity of the particular item. In other instances, communication module <b>212</b> uses the identity of the displayed item to determine which of the offering services <b>116</b>(<b>1</b>)-(M) to which to send the message. For instance, in the illustrated example, module <b>212</b> may send the message to a manufacturer of the camera or to a merchant that is providing the advertisement. Similarly, communication module <b>212</b> may send the message to multiple different merchants that offer the item.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the illustrated example, communication module <b>212</b> sends the message to offering service <b>116</b>(M). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, service <b>116</b>(M) includes one or more processors <b>214</b> and memory <b>216</b>, which stores or otherwise has access to an electronic catalog <b>218</b> that includes information about multiple items <b>220</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>220</b>(<b>2</b>), . . . , <b>220</b>(P), such as the illustrated digital camera. An item can include a product, a service, a digital download, a news clip, customer-created content, information, or some other type of sellable or non-sellable unit. The stored information, meanwhile, may include item identifying information (e.g., SKUs, UPCs, titles, etc.), availability information, price information, rating information, or any other similar or different information.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Offering service <b>116</b>(M) also stores or otherwise has access to a communication module <b>222</b>, a user/item mapping module <b>224</b> and a payment module <b>226</b>. Communication module <b>222</b> receives the message from the communication module of device <b>112</b> and also functions to contact user <b>102</b> in response to the receiving of the message, as described in detail below. To contact the user associated with the request, mapping module <b>224</b> maps the received user identifier to a database <b>228</b> that stores individual user accounts <b>230</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>230</b>(<b>2</b>), . . . , <b>230</b>(N). As illustrated, example user account <b>230</b>(N) stores one or more identifiers <b>232</b> of a user associated with the account, one or more payment instruments <b>234</b> associated with the user and the account, shipping data <b>236</b> associated with the user and the account and, potentially, preferences <b>238</b> associated with the user and the account. User account <b>230</b>(N) may also store a shopping cart that includes items that are stored by the user for potential later purchase by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Mapping module <b>224</b> may compare the received user identifier to identifiers <b>232</b> stored within user accounts <b>2301</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N) in order to identify user <b>102</b> that sent the request via device <b>112</b>. Next, mapping module <b>224</b> may consult preferences <b>238</b> of the user account of user <b>102</b> to determine how user <b>102</b> prefers to communicate with offering service <b>116</b>(M). For instance, preferences <b>238</b> may dictate that communication module <b>222</b> should send an email to a particular email address of user <b>102</b> in response to receiving a request to initiate purchase of an item via device <b>112</b>. In other instances, the received identifier of the user may dictate how communication module <b>222</b> communicates with user <b>102</b>, with or without reference to preferences <b>238</b>. For instance, if user <b>102</b> initially inputs a mobile phone number, then communication module <b>222</b> may communicate with the user via the received number.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, user/item mapping module <b>224</b> may map the received item identifier against electronic catalog <b>218</b> to identify the referenced item (here, the illustrated digital camera). After making this determination, the communication module <b>222</b> sends a message to identified user <b>102</b> regarding the identified digital camera and, potentially, regarding identified accessory and/or up sell items related to the identified digital camera. Here, because user <b>102</b> originally requested to initiate a purchase of the camera in the given example, this message comprises a request to approve purchase of the camera (for the determined cost of the camera) using one of payment instruments <b>234</b> and shipping data <b>236</b> (e.g., shipping address, shipping method and ship speed). This message is typically sent via a communication channel that differs from how user <b>102</b> originally input the request and from how device <b>112</b> sent the request to offering service <b>116</b>(M). User <b>102</b> may then send an approval or a denial of the request to approve the purchase. In the former instances, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may fulfill the request via payment module <b>226</b> by charging the specified payment instrument and delivering the item to user <b>102</b>. In the latter instances, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may cancel the transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While this example describes purchasing the illustrated item, user <b>102</b> may request to take other actions regarding the item. For instance, user <b>102</b> may request that offering service <b>116</b>(M) add the illustrated digital camera to a shopping cart of the user. In response, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may add the camera to shopping cart <b>240</b> and may send a message indicating as much to user <b>102</b>. Alternatively, user <b>102</b> may request that offering service <b>116</b>(M) provide additional information about the camera to user <b>102</b>. In response, offering service may locate this information from electronic catalog <b>218</b> and may provide this additional information to user <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, discussed immediately below, illustrate example user interfaces that may be used with the techniques described above. While the proceeding section illustrates and describes example interfaces, it is noted that the claimed techniques may be implemented with use of many other similar or different interfaces or otherwise.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Illustrative User Interfaces</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a series of example user interfaces (UIs) that may be displayed on display <b>104</b> of television <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> as user <b>102</b> requests to purchase an item displayed on the television.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> first illustrates that the video stream being displayed on television <b>106</b> may include an advertisement for the &#x201c;ABC 6.2 Mega Pixel Digital Camera.&#x201d; In response to seeing this item on display <b>104</b>, user <b>102</b> may request to purchase or otherwise take some action regarding this item. For instance, user <b>102</b> may actuate a button on remote control <b>114</b> that sends a request to device <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In response, device <b>112</b> may cause display of an overlay on display <b>104</b> of television. In this example, the overlay includes icons <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> as discussed above. As illustrated, user <b>102</b> next selects icon <b>120</b> (entitled &#x201c;Buy Now&#x201d; in this example) and, in response, device <b>112</b> presents a new overlay that facilitates entry of an identifier associated with user <b>102</b> (or with another user if user <b>102</b> desires another user to purchase the item). As discussed above, user <b>102</b> may enter any sort of identifying information, such as the user's name, mobile phone number, email address, user account name at offering service <b>116</b>(M), etc. In some instances, the device stores different options for the user to select from. For instance, the device may store the identifiers of users that have previously made requests via the device. The user is then able to, for example, select &#x201c;1&#x201d; for a first identified user, &#x201c;2&#x201d; for a second identified user and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this example overlay includes a text box <b>302</b> and an icon <b>304</b> that, when selected, submits that request to initiate the purchase to the device, which passes this information on to offering service <b>116</b>(M). Here, user <b>102</b> has entered a mobile phone number of user <b>102</b> into text box <b>302</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> illustrate that user <b>102</b> enters his or her identifying information via text box <b>302</b>, device <b>112</b> may facilitate entry of these identifiers audibly or via other techniques in other instances.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">After user <b>102</b> enters the mobile phone number of the user and selects icon <b>304</b>, device <b>112</b> causes display of an indication <b>306</b> that informs user <b>102</b> that the device has sent the request to offering service <b>116</b>(M). At this point, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may receive the request, identify the item and the user, and may contact the user via a different communication channel for the purpose of completing the transaction. For instance, the offering service <b>116</b> may send an SMS text message to the user's mobile phone number to allow user <b>102</b> to approve or deny purchase of the camera.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a series of example user interfaces (UIs) that may be displayed on display <b>104</b> of television <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> as the user requests to add an item displayed on the television to a shopping cart associated with the user. To do so, the user first makes a request (e.g., via remote control <b>114</b> or otherwise) to take some action regarding the illustrated camera, and then selects icon <b>122</b> (&#x201c;Add to Cart&#x201d;). In response, device <b>112</b> again allows user to enter an identifier of the user, before selecting an icon <b>402</b> to &#x201c;Add [the item] to [the user's] Cart.&#x201d; Again, the device <b>112</b> then sends the request to offering service <b>116</b>(M), which adds the identified camera to the shopping cart of the identified user. Device <b>112</b> then may display a confirmation message <b>404</b> to user <b>102</b>, although it need not. In some instances, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may also send a message to user <b>102</b> indicating that offering service <b>116</b>(M) has indeed added the camera to the shopping cart of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a series of example user interfaces (UIs) that may be displayed on display <b>104</b> of television <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> as user <b>102</b> requests information regarding an item displayed on the television. Here, the user selects to receive &#x201c;more information&#x201d; regarding the illustrated camera by selecting icon <b>124</b>. In response, device <b>112</b> again allows user <b>102</b> to enter his or her identifying information before selecting an icon <b>502</b> to submit the request. Device <b>112</b> then sends the request to offering service <b>116</b>(M), which then identifies the item and the user, before locating the requested information and sending a message with this information to user <b>102</b>. For instance, in the illustrated example, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may send information regarding the ABC Digital Camera via an email to an email address associated with user, via an SMS text message to the user's mobile phone number, or the like.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Illustrative Flow Diagram</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> illustrate an example flow diagram of a process <b>600</b> for fulfilling a user's request to purchase an item displayed on a television. While this example describes user <b>102</b> purchasing an illustrated item, similar techniques may apply in instances where the user requests to add the item to a shopping cart of the user, to receive additional information regarding the item or take any other action regarding the displayed item.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Process <b>600</b> includes operation <b>602</b>, at which device <b>112</b> monitors a video stream being displayed by a television. Again, device <b>112</b> may comprise a set-top box, a game console, an integral portion of the television or any other device capable of monitoring a displayed video stream to locate an item, as discussed above. At <b>604</b>, device <b>112</b> detects an item on the video stream. Again, detecting an item may comprise detecting an item that appears within an electronic catalog of items maintained by one or more offering services. At <b>606</b>, user <b>102</b> sends a request to device <b>112</b> to initiate purchase of the displayed item. In some instances, user <b>102</b> first sends the request, which then initiates the monitoring of the video stream and the detecting of the item by device <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In either instance, at <b>608</b>, device <b>112</b> receives the request and, at <b>610</b>, device <b>112</b> facilitates entry of a user identifier associated with user <b>102</b>. For instance, device <b>112</b> may cause display of an overlay on the video stream that allows user <b>102</b> to provide identifying information. At <b>612</b>, user <b>102</b> provides an identifier to device <b>112</b>, which receives this information at <b>614</b>. At <b>616</b>, device <b>112</b> communicates the user identifier, the item identifier and, potentially, an HMAC or the like to an offering service over a first communication channel.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> continues the illustration of process <b>600</b>. Here, offering service receives the user identifier, the item identifier and an HMAC at <b>618</b>. At <b>620</b>, offering service <b>116</b>(M) validates the message with reference to the received HMAC. Next, at <b>622</b>, offering service <b>116</b>(M) maps the received user identifier to a unique user account within database <b>228</b> and maps the received item identifier to one or more unique items within electronic catalog <b>218</b>. At <b>624</b>, offering service <b>116</b>(M) determines a communication channel preference of user <b>102</b> with reference to the identified user account of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At <b>626</b>, the offering service sends a request to approve the purchase of the item to user <b>102</b> over a preferred communication channel that differs from the communication channel by which the user initially made the request and that differs from the communication channel by which device <b>112</b> sent the request to service <b>116</b>(M). For instance, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may send the request via an SMS or MMS text message, via an email, via a message to a user account of the user at the offering service, via an IVR phone call or in any other manner. However, this approval request is not sent through device <b>112</b> and television <b>106</b> in some instances. At <b>628</b>, the user receives the approval request.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> continues the illustration of process <b>600</b> and includes, at <b>630</b>, user <b>102</b> approving or denying the approval request. At <b>632</b>, offering service <b>116</b>(M) receives the approval or denial and, in the former instances, completes payment for the item and fulfills the order at <b>634</b>. For instance, the offering service may charge a payment instrument of user <b>102</b> and may initiate delivery of the item to the user with reference to a shipping address of the user and a preferred shipping method and speed of the user. As discussed above, the user account of user <b>102</b> at offering service <b>116</b>(M) stores each of these pieces of information. In instances where the purchased item is a physical good, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may initiate delivery of the item to a specified physical shipping address of the user. In instances where the purchased item is a digital good, meanwhile, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may initiate delivery of the item to a specified digital location of the user.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Illustrative Processes</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref> illustrate example processes <b>900</b> and <b>1000</b> for implementing the techniques described above. While these processes are described with reference to the architectures discussed above, the described techniques may be equally applicable in many other architectures and environments. Furthermore, the described processes can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. In the context of software, the illustrated operations represent computer-executable instructions stored on one or more computer-readable storage media that, when executed by one or more processors, perform the recited operations. Generally, computer-executable instructions include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, and the like that perform particular functions or implement particular abstract data types. The order in which the operations are described is not intended to be construed as a limitation, and any number of the described blocks can be combined in any order and/or in parallel to implement the process.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Device <b>112</b>, coupled to television <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may implement process <b>900</b> in some instances. Process <b>900</b> includes monitoring, at <b>902</b>, a video stream being displayed by a television. At <b>904</b>, device <b>112</b> detects an advertisement for an item on the displayed video stream. At <b>906</b>, the device receives a request to purchase the item, possibly from user <b>102</b> as discussed above. In response, device <b>112</b> facilitates entry of an identifier of a user to initiate purchase of the item at <b>908</b>. At <b>910</b>, device <b>112</b> receives an identifier of a user, such as an email address, a mobile phone number, a user account name, etc. Finally, at <b>912</b>, device <b>112</b> provides the user identifier and an identifier of the item to a retailer that offers the item for sale.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates process <b>1000</b>, which offering service <b>116</b>(M) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> may implement in some instances. This process includes receiving, at <b>1002</b>, an identifier of a first user and an identifier of a first item over a first communication channel from a device that is coupled to a television and that monitors a video stream being displayed by the television. For instance, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may receive an identifier of user <b>102</b> and an identifier of the illustrated digital camera from device <b>112</b>. Next, at <b>1004</b>, offering service <b>116</b>(M) sends a message to the first user regarding the first item over a second communication channel that differs from the first communication channel. For instance, offering service <b>116</b>(M) may send such a message to the first user via a text message, an email, a message to a user account of the user or the like. This message may comprise a request to approve a purchase of the item, a notification that the item has been added to a shopping cart of the user, information regarding the item or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At <b>1006</b>, offering service <b>116</b>(M) receives an identifier of a second user and an identifier of a second item over the first communication channel from the same device that is coupled to a television and that monitors a video stream being displayed by the television. Stated otherwise, the offering service may receive an identification of a different user via the same device coupled to the same television. For instance, two different users may request to initiate purchases of two different items while consuming the same video stream on the television.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">At <b>1008</b>, the offering service <b>116</b>(M) sends a message to the second user regarding the second item over a third communication channel that differs from the first and second communication channels. For instance, this channel may comprise a communication channel that is unique to the second user, such as via a text message to a mobile phone of the second user, an email to an email address of the second user, and the like. Again, this message may comprise a request to approve a purchase of the item, a notification that the item has been added to a shopping cart of the user, information regarding the item or the like.</p>
