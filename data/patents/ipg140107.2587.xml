<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from an application for METHOD OF FORMING EMISSION LAYER OF ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DISPLAY DEVICE, METHOD OF MANUFACTURING ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DISPLAY DEVICE INCLUDING EMISSION LAYER, AND ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DISPLAY DEVICE THEREOF earlier filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on 25 Oct. 2010 and there duly assigned Ser. No. 10-2010-0104183.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method of forming an emission layer of an organic light emitting display device, a method of manufacturing the organic light emitting display device including the emission layer, and the organic light emitting display device thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An organic light emitting display device that is an active matrix type display device is expected to become a next generation display device due to its wide viewing angle, high contrast, and fast response speed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The organic light emitting display device is manufactured by forming an anode on a glass or a transparent insulating substrate according to a predetermined pattern and then by sequentially stacking an organic material and a cathode on the anode. When a voltage is applied to the anode and the cathode of the organic light emitting display device, a hole injected from the anode moves to an emission layer via a hole transport layer (HTL), and an electron is injected from the cathode to the emission layer via an electron transport layer (ETL). The electron and the hole are recombined in the emission layer and thus an exciton is formed, and when the exciton is changed from an excitation state to a ground state, an organic molecule of the emission layer emits light and thus an image is realized.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to manufacture an organic light emitting display device capable of realizing a full color spectrum, in general, a unit pixel is formed by independently depositing a red emission layer for a red subpixel (R), a green emission layer for a green subpixel (G), and a blue emission layer for a blue subpixel (B) on a substrate by using a mask whereon patterned openings are formed. However, the use of the mask having the openings limits manufacturing of a large display.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

An intermediate layer arrangement including red, green and blue emission layers (refer to emission layers EML of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) having a predetermined pattern is formed on the first electrode layer <b>101</b>.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, for convenience of description, only a method of forming red emission layers on the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>is described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, but the same method can also be used to form the green emission layers on the green emission parts <b>111</b><i>g</i>, <b>112</b><i>g</i>, and <b>113</b><i>g</i>, and the blue emission layers on the blue emission parts <b>111</b><i>b</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>and <b>113</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of a mask <b>200</b> used in one or more embodiments of the present invention and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the mask <b>200</b>, taken along a line III-III&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the mask <b>200</b> includes one or more charge inducing units <b>210</b> that correspond to locations of the emission portions E of the substrate <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In more detail, the mask <b>200</b> includes the charge inducing units <b>210</b> disposed in such a manner that the charge inducing units <b>210</b> correspond to locations of the emission portions E corresponding to one type among the red, green, and blue subpixels Pr, Pg, and Pb of the substrate <b>100</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the charge inducing units <b>210</b> are disposed so as to correspond to locations of the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>on which the red emission layers of an organic light emitting display device are to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, the number of charge inducing units <b>210</b> is equivalent to the number of red subpixels Pr on the substrate <b>100</b>. In other words, the number of charge inducing units <b>210</b> is equivalent to the number of red emission parts on the substrate <b>100</b>. Thus, an emission layer forming method according to an embodiment of the present invention is advantageous in that emission layers of the same type on the substrate <b>100</b>, e.g., emission layers having the same color on the substrate <b>100</b>, may be formed by performing a single process.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each charge inducing unit <b>210</b> is made out of a conductive material. For example, each charge inducing unit <b>210</b> may include Cu, Ag, Al, Pt, Pd, Au, Ni, or Li. Thus, it is possible to use a principle in which, when a conductive object contacts a non-conductive object, a negative charge is induced on a surface of the non-conductive object. In more detail, when the charge inducing units <b>210</b> respectively contact surfaces of the emission portions E, negative charges are induced on the surfaces of the emission portions E.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An area and a shape of the charge inducing units <b>210</b> respectively contacting the emission portions E are the same as those of the surfaces of the emission portions E. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the emission portions E have a rectangular shape, and thus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the charge inducing units <b>210</b> have a rectangular shape so as to have the same size, area, and shape as the emission portions E. However, the sizes, the areas, and the shapes of the emission portions E and the charge inducing units <b>210</b> are not limited thereto and thus may vary.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 8</figref> are diagrams for describing a method of forming an emission layer of an organic light emitting display device according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a substrate <b>100</b> whereon subpixels Pr, Pg, and Pb including emission portions E are arranged, is provided. A first electrode layer <b>101</b> having a predetermined pattern is formed on the substrate <b>100</b>. An HIL <b>103</b> is formed on the first electrode layer <b>101</b> and an HTL <b>104</b> is formed on the HIL <b>103</b>. Here, an emission layer (not shown) is formed on the HTL <b>104</b>. Hereinafter, as an example, a procedure for forming emission layers on emission parts of red subpixels will now be described. In this regard, the emission parts of the red subpixels are indicated as red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r. </i></p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a mask <b>200</b> is provided, wherein charge inducing units <b>210</b> corresponding to the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>are arranged on a surface of the mask <b>200</b>, a surface of the substrate <b>100</b> and the surface of the mask <b>200</b> are disposed to face each other, and then the charge inducing units <b>210</b> contact the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r, </i>and <b>113</b><i>r</i>. Since the charge inducing units <b>210</b> are made out of a conductive material and the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>are made out of a non-conductive material, negative charges are induced on surfaces of the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>via the contact with the charge inducing units <b>210</b>. Here, since the surfaces of the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r, </i><b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>are easily damaged by pressure, the charge inducing units <b>210</b> only gently contacts the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>and a large amount of pressure is not applied.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the charge inducing units <b>210</b> contact the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>so that negative charges are induced on only the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r</i>. That is, surface charges are not induced on portions corresponding to surfaces of emission parts <b>111</b><i>g</i>, <b>111</b><i>b</i>, <b>112</b><i>g</i>, and <b>112</b><i>b </i>of subpixels having different colors and a surface of a PDL <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a variation of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. In the variation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, after the charge inducing units <b>210</b> contact the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r</i>, a voltage is applied to the mask <b>200</b> so that surface charges having negative polarity are induced on the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r</i>. Here, according to the polarity of the voltage applied to the mask <b>200</b>, the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r, </i><b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>may be charged to have a positive polarity or a negative polarity. The variation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is advantageous in that surface charges are intensively induced, compared to the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> in which surface charges are induced only by contact with the charge inducing units <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the mask <b>200</b> and the substrate <b>100</b> contacting each other are separated. At this time, it is possible to verify that negative charges have been induced on the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>of the substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, droplets that are positively charged are supplied to the substrate <b>100</b>. Here, the droplets function to form emission layers having various colors, and may be made out of a Poly-Phenylenevinylene (PPV)-based polymer material, a polyfluorene-based polymer material, or the like. According to the present embodiment, the droplets may be positively charged by applying a voltage to a nozzle <b>300</b> that supplies the droplets. In more detail, a predetermined voltage, e.g., a voltage between about 4 kV and about 15 kV, is applied to a ground voltage source of the nozzle <b>300</b>, and when an appropriate amount of liquid is supplied to the nozzle <b>300</b>, the droplets may be supplied to the substrate <b>100</b> in various manners according to the intensity of an electric field, and a flow amount. Here, a supply area and a supply speed of droplets per one supply may be controlled by the voltage. In general, the supplied droplets are positively charged. However, the charge of the droplets is not limited thereto, and thus may be positively or negatively charged according to the polarity of the voltage applied to the nozzle <b>300</b>. The droplets flowing from the nozzle <b>300</b> are circular-shaped due to surface tension, but may instead be oval-shaped as the voltage applied to the nozzle <b>300</b> increases.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the droplets may be supplied in such a manner that the droplets are thoroughly sprayed on the surface of the substrate <b>100</b>. The sprayed droplets, which are positively charged, move to the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>on which negative charges are induced to form emission layers. Due to attraction between the droplets and the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r</i>, the droplets are deposited on the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>to form the emission layers. The aforementioned method is advantageous in that emission layers may be simultaneously formed on a plurality of red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>that are formed on a large substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in a variation to the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, droplets may be supplied to the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>by being dropped from locations that only correspond to the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r</i>. Here, a plurality of nozzles <b>300</b> for supplying the droplets may be arranged in row or column direction of subpixels, and then may simultaneously form emission layers on emission parts that are disposed in the row or column direction. According to this method, a thickness and a shape of each emission layer may be easily controlled by controlling a voltage of each nozzle <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram for describing a principle in which emission layers are formed by using one or more embodiments of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a portion of a surface of a substrate <b>100</b> other than red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>on which surface charges are induced is in a hydrophobic state. Thus, droplets are easily separated from the surface of the substrate <b>100</b>, and repulsion exists between the droplets exhibiting the same positive polarity. Thus, when the droplets are dropped on parts other than the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>on which the surface charges are induced, the droplets move to the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>exhibiting negative polarity. The droplets dropped on the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>on which the surface charges are induced are solidified on the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r, </i><b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>due to attraction to the negative charges that are induced on the surfaces of the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r</i>. Due to this principle, the emission layers are formed only on the red emission parts <b>111</b><i>r</i>, <b>112</b><i>r</i>, and <b>113</b><i>r </i>contacting charge inducing units <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a diagram for describing a method of manufacturing an organic light emitting display device according to another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, intermediate layer arrangements including emission layers EML and a second electrode layer <b>107</b> are formed on first electrodes <b>101</b> and pixel defining layer <b>102</b> by using the method described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 9</figref>, to manufacture the organic light emitting display device. Although the method of forming emission layers of red subpixels is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 9</figref>, emission layers of green and blue subpixels are formed by repeating the method described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 9</figref> to produce the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Then, an ETL <b>105</b> and an EIL <b>106</b> are sequentially formed on the emission layers EML by performing inkjet printing or spin coating. Afterward, the second electrode layer <b>107</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a case of a bottom emission type organic light emitting display device in which an image is realized toward a glass or insulating substrate <b>1</b>, a first electrode layer <b>101</b> may be a transparent electrode including ITO, IZO, ZnO, or In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the second electrode layer <b>107</b> may be a reflective electrode. Here, the second electrode layer <b>107</b> may be made out of a metal material having a low work function, such as Ag, Mg, Al, Pt, Pd, Au, Ni, Nd, Ir, Cr, Li, or Ca. However, in a case of a top emission type organic light emitting display device in which an image is realized toward the second electrode layer <b>107</b>, the first electrode layer <b>101</b> may be a reflective electrode and the second electrode layer <b>107</b> may be a transparent electrode. In a case of a dual emission type organic light emitting display device, both the first electrode layer <b>101</b> and the second electrode layer <b>107</b> may be transparent electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The method of forming an emission layer of an organic light emitting display device, the method of manufacturing the organic light emitting display device including the emission layer, and the organic light emitting display device thereof according to the one or more embodiments of the present invention have advantages described below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">First, in order to form an emission layer according to the related art, a mask including openings is used, but this manner causes problems such as a shadow effect, spots, and a spread of an emission material. However, according to the one or more embodiments of the present invention, surface charges are induced on emission parts by a mask <b>200</b> and then the mask <b>200</b> is separated from the emission parts, to solve the aforementioned problems. In addition, according to the one or more embodiments of the present invention, highly expensive vacuum equipment necessary for emission layer formation according to the related art is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Second, emission layers are formed by attraction between emission parts and droplets exhibiting different charge polarities, so that it is not necessary to form a PDL <b>102</b> in the shape of a dam to define subpixels. In an emission layer forming method according to the related art, an emission material cannot be deposited unless emission parts are defined by using the PDL <b>102</b>. However, according to the one or more embodiments of the present invention, emission layers are formed by using attraction and repulsion due to an electrostatic force, so that a process for forming the PDL <b>102</b> or openings may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an effect that is created when emission layers are formed according to one or more embodiments of the present invention.

By being able to omit PDL <b>102</b>, a manufacturing process maybe simplified, productivity may be increased, manufacturing costs may be reduced, a yield rate may be increased, and reliability deterioration due to formation of a PDL according to the related art may be resolved.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Third, according to the one or more embodiments of the present invention, the emission layers may be formed without being limited by a size of a substrate, so that it is advantageous in manufacturing a large display.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the method of forming an emission layer, and the organic light emitting display device thereof are described in the one or more embodiments of the present invention, the present invention is not limited to the formation of the emission layer but may be used to form various other layers including the HIL <b>103</b>, the HTL <b>104</b>, an ETL <b>105</b>, and an EIL <b>106</b>.
