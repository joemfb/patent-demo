<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a puncturing device, a biological sample measuring apparatus and a biological sample measuring system that do not start performing puncturing operation by mistake.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Patent literature 1 discloses a bodily fluid sampling device that can readily and reliably sample bodily fluid, with a simple configuration. A puncturing device described in Patent Literature 1 has a puncturing needle to puncture skin, a puncturing needle holding section that holds a puncturing needle and a biasing spring that applies biasing force to the puncturing needle holding section. In addition, the above-described puncturing device has a magnetic force retaining section that retains the puncturing holding portion in the base end side of the puncturing device by magnetic force, and a retention releasing section that has a solenoid to generate a magnetic field in a direction to offset the magnetic force of the magnetic force retaining section.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to perform puncturing, the user first compresses the biasing spring by drawing the puncturing needle holding section to the base end side of the puncturing device to lock the puncturing needle holding section in the magnetic force retaining section. Then, the user performs the operation including pressing a puncturing execution button, so that the retention releasing section applies a voltage to the solenoid to cancel the locked state. By this means, the puncturing needle projects from the tip of the puncturing device to puncture skin.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above-described puncturing device has a configuration to electrically drive the retention releasing section. Therefore, a puncturing needle is released from being retained by the magnetic force retaining section by conducting electricity to the retention releasing section, so that it is possible to start the puncturing operation of the puncturing needle. In addition, the puncturing operation of a puncturing needle is started by energizing the retention releasing section, and therefore, when the puncturing execution button is pressed in a defective condition in which the retention releasing section does not completely and adequately apply a voltage to the solenoid, the puncturing operation of a puncturing needle is not started. In this way, this conventional puncturing device can prevent the puncturing operation of a puncturing needle from being started unexpectedly, in a condition in which electrical release requirements are not satisfied.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, even if the conventional puncturing device has a configuration to electrically perform releasing of the puncturing needle holding section from the locked state, it is not possible to prevent the puncturing operation of a puncturing needle from being started unexpectedly if electrical requirements for releasing are satisfied. For example, a case is possible where a child plays with this puncturing device, not only a case where biological samples are measured. Then, a case is possible where electrical release requirements are satisfied unexpectedly in process of playing with the puncturing device. Conventionally, there has been a problem that, when a puncturing device is operated for purposes other than measurement of biological samples, the puncturing operation of a puncturing needle is likely to be started unexpectedly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a puncturing device, a biological sample measuring apparatus and a biological sample measuring system that prevents a puncturing needle from unexpectedly starting puncturing operation when the puncturing device is operated for purposes other than measurement of biological samples.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The puncturing device according to the present invention adopts a configuration to include: a puncturing mechanism that actuates a puncturing needle; a puncturing mechanism control section that controls the puncturing mechanism to allow/disallow puncturing operation; a radio communication section that receives a radio signal from an external registration device; and a control section that releases the puncturing mechanism control section from restricting and disallowing puncturing when the radio communication section receives a predetermined radio signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The biological sample measuring apparatus according to the present invention that measures a biological sample obtained by puncturing by means of a puncturing device adopts a configuration to include: a biological sample measuring section that measures a biological sample; and a radio communication section that transmits a puncturing allowing signal that allows the puncturing device to perform puncturing, when the biological sample measuring section is ready to start measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The biological sample measuring system according to the present invention including a puncturing device and a biological sample measuring apparatus that measures a biological sample obtained by puncturing by means of the puncturing device, wherein: the puncturing device includes: a puncturing mechanism that actuates a puncturing needle; a puncturing mechanism control section that controls the puncturing mechanism to allow/disallow puncturing operation; radio communication section that receives a radio signal from the biological sample measuring apparatus; and a control section that releases the puncturing mechanism control section from restricting and disallowing puncturing when the radio communication section receives a predetermined radio signal, and the biological sample measuring apparatus includes: a biological sample measuring section that measures a biological sample; and a radio communication section that transmits a puncturing allowing signal that allows the puncturing device to perform puncturing, when the biological sample measuring section is ready to start measurement.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present invention, it is possible to disallow the puncturing operation of a puncturing device unless a biological sample measuring apparatus resides nearby the puncturing device and is ready to perform measurement. Therefore, it is possible to realize a puncturing device, a measuring apparatus and a measuring system that prevents a puncturing needle from unexpectedly starting puncturing operation when the puncturing device is operated for purposes other than measurement of biological samples.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Locking mechanism <b>121</b> is composed of locking ring <b>123</b> and locking ring spring <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Locking ring <b>123</b> is an annular component through which puncturing needle holding section <b>113</b> penetrates. Locking ring <b>123</b> abuts on locking convex part <b>116</b> provided on the side surface of puncturing needle holding section <b>113</b> when puncturing needle holding section <b>113</b> moves to the biased position. By this means, locking ring <b>123</b> locks puncturing needle holding section <b>113</b> in the biased position. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, locking ring <b>123</b> is provided with puncturing trigger <b>123</b><i>a </i>projecting from casing <b>101</b> to the exterior in the position facing locking ring spring <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Locking ring spring <b>124</b> contacts the end of locking ring <b>123</b> opposite to puncturing trigger <b>123</b><i>a </i>to consistently apply force to make puncturing trigger <b>123</b><i>a </i>project from casing <b>101</b>. The user presses puncturing trigger <b>123</b><i>a </i>to release puncturing needle holding section <b>113</b> from the locked state (perform puncturing). By this operation, locking ring spring <b>124</b> is compressed to release the contact state between locking ring <b>123</b> and locking convex part <b>116</b>, and resultant biasing force makes puncturing mechanism <b>110</b> perform puncturing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Biasing control mechanism <b>122</b> is formed by biasing control ring <b>125</b>, biasing control ring spring <b>126</b>, permanent magnet <b>127</b> and solenoid <b>128</b>. Biasing control mechanism <b>122</b> switches whether or not to enable the user to apply biasing force to puncturing mechanism <b>110</b>, based on a control signal outputted from puncturing control circuit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Biasing control ring <b>125</b> is an annular component to which biasing operation section <b>115</b> penetrates. Permanent magnet <b>127</b> is embedded in one end of biasing control ring <b>125</b>, and biasing control ring sprig <b>126</b> contacts the other end.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If the user pulls biasing operation section <b>115</b> to the rear end side (opposite to tip part <b>112</b>) of puncturing device <b>100</b> when puncturing is not enabled (in a state in which the operation of biasing operation section <b>115</b> is disabled), biasing control ring spring <b>126</b> applies biasing force to biasing control ring <b>125</b>. To be more specific, biasing control ring spring <b>126</b> applies biasing force to biasing control ring <b>125</b> to retain biasing control ring <b>125</b> in the position in which biasing control convex part <b>118</b> provided on the side surface of biasing operation section <b>115</b> interferes with biasing control ring <b>125</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Solenoid <b>128</b> is embedded in the inner wall of casing <b>101</b> contacting one end side in which permanent magnet <b>127</b> in biasing control ring <b>125</b> is embedded. Repulsive force works between permanent magnet <b>127</b> and solenoid <b>128</b> due to a magnetic field generated by solenoid <b>128</b>. When repulsive force works between permanent magnet <b>127</b> and solenoid <b>128</b>, biasing control ring <b>125</b> is pressed on biasing control ring spring <b>126</b>. This pressing force makes biasing control ring spring <b>126</b> be compressed, and biasing control ring <b>125</b> moves to the inner wall side of case <b>101</b> in which biasing control ring spring <b>126</b> is accommodated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. As a result of this, interference between biasing control ring <b>125</b> and biasing control convex part <b>118</b> is cancelled.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">By this means, the user can pull biasing operation section <b>115</b> to the rear end side, so that it is possible to lock puncturing needle holding section <b>113</b> in the biased position.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Puncturing control circuit <b>150</b> is electrically connected with solenoid <b>128</b> to control whether or not to make solenoid <b>128</b> generate a magnetic field. Puncturing control circuit <b>150</b> is mounted on substrate <b>130</b>, together with radio communication section <b>140</b>, and electrically connected with radio communication section <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing electrical circuit section <b>130</b>A in puncturing device <b>100</b>. Electrical circuit section <b>130</b>A is formed on substrate <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, electrical circuit section <b>130</b>A has microcontroller IC <b>131</b>, driver IC <b>132</b>, receiver IC <b>133</b>, filter <b>134</b>, antenna <b>135</b>, serial communication means <b>136</b> and power supply circuit <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The above-mentioned receiver IC <b>133</b>, filter <b>134</b> and antenna <b>135</b> constitute radio communication section <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The above microcontroller IC <b>131</b> and driver IC <b>132</b> constitute puncturing control circuit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Upon receiving an interrupt request from radio communication section <b>140</b>, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> reads data stored in radio communication section <b>140</b>. Then, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> decides whether or not the serial number of the data stored in radio communication section <b>140</b> matches the serial number registered in a memory (not shown) provided in microcomputer IC <b>131</b>. When the numbers match, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> decides whether or not the data stored in radio communication section <b>140</b> is a puncturing allowing signal, and, when it is a puncturing allowing signal, issues a driving request to driver IC <b>132</b>. Here, issuing a driving request refers to outputting a control signal from microcontroller IC <b>131</b> to driver IC <b>132</b> to command solenoid <b>128</b> to drive via driver IC <b>132</b> (the same shall apply hereinafter). In addition, upon receiving, as input, a signal indicating that puncturing performed by puncturing mechanism <b>110</b> has been detected, from a puncturing detecting section (not shown), microcontroller IC <b>131</b> commands driver IC <b>132</b> to stop supplying a drive current.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To enable execution of puncturing operation, driver IC <b>132</b> supplies a drive current to solenoid <b>128</b>, according to a command from microcontroller IC <b>131</b>. When microcontroller IC <b>131</b> issues a driving request, driver IC <b>132</b> starts supplying a drive current to solenoid <b>128</b>. This drive current generates a magnetic field in the direction in which solenoid <b>128</b> generates repulsive force against permanent magnetic <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Receiver IC <b>133</b> has a demodulation function and an error detection function, demodulates a signal received by antenna <b>135</b>, and then performs error detection processing on a demodulated signal, and stores correctly received data in an embedded memory. Receiver IC <b>133</b> is connected to microcontroller IC <b>131</b> in puncturing control circuit <b>150</b> by serial communication means <b>136</b>, and transmits and receives commands and data.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Filter <b>134</b> is inserted between receiver IC <b>133</b> and antenna <b>135</b> in order to reduce interference of out-of-band radio waves when antenna <b>135</b> receives signals.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Antenna <b>135</b> receives a radio signal transmitted from the outside of puncturing device <b>100</b>, and outputs the received signal to receiver IC <b>133</b> via filter <b>134</b>. Antenna <b>135</b> is a small chip antenna made of, for example, a high dielectric material.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Serial communication means <b>136</b> is, for example, a UART (universal asynchronous receiver transmitter) or a SPI (serial peripheral interface). Both a UART and a SPI are used with a general serial communication scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Electrical circuit <b>137</b> is mounted on substrate <b>130</b> and supplies power to puncturing control circuit <b>150</b> and radio communication section <b>140</b>. Power supply circuit <b>137</b> is composed of coin battery <b>138</b> and voltage regulator IC <b>139</b> to supply a constant voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Now, the operation of puncturing device <b>100</b> configured as described above will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart showing processing steps from turnon of power to execution of puncturing regarding puncturing device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">First, in step S<b>1</b>, when the user turns on a power switch (not shown), the step moves to step S<b>2</b> to perform receiving operation.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In step S<b>2</b>, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> commands receiver IC <b>133</b> in radio communication section <b>140</b> to be placed in a receiving state via serial communication means <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step S<b>3</b>, receiver IC <b>133</b> performs error detection on a received data packet, and, when there is no error, moves to step S<b>4</b>, and, on the other hand, when there is an error, returns to step S<b>2</b> and continues the receiving operation.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In step S<b>4</b>, receiver IC <b>133</b> stores the data packet that has been decided that there is no error in step S<b>3</b>, in a memory embedded in receiver IC <b>133</b>, and issues a signal reception interrupt to microcontroller IC <b>131</b> via serial communication means <b>136</b>. Upon receiving a signal reception interrupt request from receiver IC <b>133</b>, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> reads data stored in the embedded memory in receiver IC <b>133</b> via serial communication means <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step S<b>5</b>, micro controller IC <b>131</b> identifies the serial number contained in the data packet. If this serial number matches the serial number registered in advance in the memory embedded in microcontroller IC <b>131</b>, the step moves to the next step S<b>6</b>. On the other hand, if the serial numbers do not match, the step returns to step S<b>2</b> and the receiving operation is continued. The above-described serial number is a number unique to puncturing device <b>100</b>, and is contained in packet data to prevent puncturing operation from being allowed mistakenly by a puncturing allowing signal transmitted to different puncturing device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step S<b>6</b>, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> interprets the content of the data packet and decides whether or not it represents a puncturing allowing signal. If the content of the data packet indicates a puncturing allowing signal, the step moves to the next step S<b>7</b>. If the content represents information other than a puncturing allowing signal, the step returns to step S<b>2</b> and the receiving operation is continued.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In step S<b>7</b>, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> cancels disallowing biasing operation. In the initial state, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> does not issue a solenoid driving request to driver IC <b>132</b>, so that solenoid <b>128</b> and permanent magnet <b>127</b> do not interact with one another, and biasing control ring <b>125</b> and biasing control convex part <b>118</b> contact. During cancellation of disallowing biasing operation in step S<b>7</b>, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> issues a solenoid driving request to driver IC <b>132</b>, and driver IC <b>132</b> supplies a drive current to solenoid <b>128</b>. By this means, repulsive force works between solenoid <b>128</b> and permanent magnetic <b>127</b> to cancel interference between biasing control ring <b>125</b> and biasing control convex part <b>118</b> and releases biasing operation section <b>115</b> from the biasing operation disallowing state.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In step S<b>8</b>, the user presses puncturing trigger <b>123</b><i>a </i>after pulling and operating biasing operation section <b>115</b> to lock puncturing needle holding section <b>113</b> in a biased state. By pressing puncturing trigger <b>123</b><i>a</i>, locking ring <b>123</b> releases puncturing needle holding section <b>113</b> from the locked state in the biased position. By this means, puncturing mechanism <b>110</b> is released from the locked state. Meanwhile, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> receives, as in put, a detection signal from a puncturing detecting section (not shown). Microcontroller IC <b>131</b> knows that puncturing has been performed, by receiving the detection signal from puncturing detecting section. Microcontroller IC <b>131</b> outputs a control signal to driver IC <b>132</b>. Driver IC <b>132</b> stops supplying a driving current to solenoid <b>128</b> and places biasing operation section <b>115</b> in the biasing operation disallowing state again. This biasing operation disallowing state is the above-described initial state in which biasing control ring <b>125</b> and biasing control convex part <b>118</b> contact.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As described above, according to the present embodiment, puncturing device <b>100</b> has puncturing mechanism <b>110</b>, puncturing mechanism control section <b>120</b> that controls the puncturing operation of puncturing mechanism <b>110</b>, radio communication section <b>140</b> that receives radio signals from external registration device <b>200</b> and performs radio authentication, and puncturing control circuit <b>150</b> that releases puncturing mechanism control section <b>120</b> from restricting and disallowing puncturing when radio communication section <b>140</b> provides authentication. Puncturing device <b>100</b> cannot perform biasing operation for puncturing unless external registration device <b>200</b> issues a puncturing allowing signal. For example, when external registration device <b>200</b> is a biological sample measuring apparatus, it is possible to disallow puncturing device <b>100</b> from performing puncturing operation unless the biological sample measuring apparatus (external registration device <b>200</b>) resides nearby puncturing device <b>100</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent puncturing device <b>100</b> from mistakenly performing puncturing when puncturing device <b>100</b> is operated for purposes other than measurement of biological samples.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">That is, biological sample measuring system <b>1</b> is used with collaboration between a biological sample measuring apparatus (external registration device <b>200</b>) and puncturing device <b>100</b>.

On that condition, the biological sample measuring apparatus measures biological samples.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When a biological sample measuring apparatus outputs a puncturing allowing signal at the time to measure biological samples, it is possible to prevent a puncturing device from mistakenly performing puncturing for purposes other than measurement of biological samples.</p>

On the other hand, the content represents information other than a puncturing allowing signal, microcontroller IC <b>511</b> returns to step S<b>43</b> and continues the receiving operation.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In step S<b>48</b>, microcontroller IC <b>511</b> writes data for allowing puncturing in the embedded memory in RF transceiver IC <b>515</b> and issues a data transmission request to RF transceiver IC <b>515</b>, using serial communication means <b>521</b>. RF transceiver IC <b>515</b> adds an error detection code to the data written from microcontroller IC <b>511</b>, and then applies modulation processing to the result, and transmits a data packet indicating allowing puncturing to puncturing apparatus <b>400</b>, via antenna <b>517</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The serial number unique to puncturing apparatus <b>400</b> transmitting a puncturing allowing request signal, is contained in advance in the data packet to be transmitted, in order not to mistakenly allow an irrelevant puncturing device to perform puncturing when the irrelevant puncturing device receives a puncturing allowing signal.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">After a puncturing allowing signal is transmitted in the above step S<b>48</b>, the step moves to step S<b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In step S<b>49</b>, microcontroller IC <b>511</b> decides whether or not blood has been deposited on a specimen in a spot, based on the measurement result from blood sugar measuring section <b>510</b>. In addition, during this time, puncturing apparatus <b>400</b> receives a puncturing allowing signal. The user performs puncturing using puncturing apparatus <b>400</b> having received the puncturing allowing signal, and deposits blood on a specimen in a spot.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">When detecting blood being deposited on the specimen in a spot, microcontroller IC <b>511</b> determines that puncturing has been performed in puncturing apparatus <b>400</b> and stops transmitting a puncturing allowing signal. Then, blood sugar measuring section <b>510</b> measures the blood sugar level of blood deposited on the specimen in a spot (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">On the other hand, when it is not possible to detect blood having been deposited in a spot, microcontroller IC <b>511</b> returns to step S<b>48</b> and retransmits a puncturing allowing signal.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Here, it is determined to return the step from step S<b>49</b> to step S<b>48</b> in order to perform retransmission, for example, after ten seconds, taking into account the period of time required for actions including puncturing and depositing in a spot by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Blood sugar meter <b>500</b> operates in the above-described steps.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The basic operation of puncturing apparatus <b>400</b> when receiving a puncturing allowing signal have already been explained with Embodiment 2.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As described above, according to the present embodiment, blood sugar meter <b>500</b> has radio communication section <b>520</b> that transmits a puncturing allowing signal to puncturing device <b>100</b> or puncturing device <b>300</b> when blood sugar measuring section <b>510</b> is ready to perform measurement. It is possible to disallow puncturing device <b>100</b> or <b>300</b> from performing puncturing operation unless blood sugar meter <b>500</b> resides nearby puncturing device <b>100</b> or <b>300</b> and is ready to perform measurement. Therefore, it is possible to prevent puncturing device <b>100</b> or <b>300</b> from performing puncturing by mistake when puncturing device <b>100</b> or <b>300</b> is operated for purposes other than measurement of biological samples.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">That is, biological sample measuring system <b>3</b> is used with collaboration between biological sample measuring apparatus (blood sugar meter <b>500</b>) and puncturing device <b>100</b> or <b>300</b>, like in Embodiments 1 and 2. Puncturing device <b>100</b> or <b>300</b> cannot perform puncturing unless a biological sample measuring apparatus resides nearby puncturing device <b>100</b> or <b>300</b>. On that condition, the biological sample measuring device measures biological samples. A biological sample measuring apparatus outputs a puncturing allowing signal when measuring biological samples, so that it is possible to prevent mistaken puncturing for purposes other than measurement of biological samples.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In addition to the above-described advantages, there are the following advantages. By the above-described configurations and operation, it is not possible to perform puncturing using a puncturing apparatus unless a specimen is inserted in a biological sample measuring apparatus, so that it is possible to prevent the user from performing puncturing using a puncturing apparatus despite forgetting to insert a specimen. Blood from a finger tip is sampled using a puncturing apparatus in order to measure blood sugar levels, and, when the user attempts to insert the specimen after puncturing in a biological sample measuring apparatus, blood from the finger tip adheres on the biological sample measuring apparatus and clothes, so that it is not preferable from a hygiene standpoint. That is, it is possible to avoid this hygienic problem using the puncturing device and the biological sample measuring system according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In addition, in recent years, it is possible to measure a blood sugar level even by a small amount of blood, so that the depth of puncturing is shallow to reduce the amount of blood to. Therefore, when the user inserts a specimen in a biological sample measuring apparatus and prepares for measurement of the blood sugar level after performing puncturing, blood dries during this time, and consequently is not likely to be sampled unless puncturing is performed again. By using the puncturing device and the biological sample measuring system according to the present embodiment, it is possible to avoid this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Here, with the present embodiment, although a case has been shown as an example where, after microcontroller IC <b>511</b> in blood sugar meter <b>500</b> awakes from a sleep mode by inserting a specimen, radio communication section <b>520</b> transmits a puncturing allowing signal (step S<b>33</b>) or radio communication section <b>520</b> enters receiving operation (step S<b>43</b>), the present invention is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">For example, even if microcontroller IC <b>511</b> in blood sugar meter <b>500</b> is not placed in a sleep mode but in a normal operating mode, the above-described steps S<b>33</b> and S<b>34</b> should not be performed unless a specimen is inserted. Then, when microcontroller IC <b>511</b> is placed in a normal operating mode and detects a specimen being inserted, steps S<b>33</b> and S<b>43</b> may be performed. Blood sugar meter <b>500</b> is not limited as long as it issues a puncturing allowing signal as a trigger that a specimen has been inserted.</p>

<p id="p-0192" num="0191">When puncturing device <b>600</b> is turned on, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> requests RF-ID controller <b>641</b> to communicate with IC card <b>700</b>, via serial communication means <b>136</b>.

<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In a case of a system that performs passive RF-ID communication, this standby refers to a state in which RF-ID antenna <b>642</b> emits radio waves in a very short distance. When IC card <b>700</b> approaches the coverage of the emitted radio waves, the radio waves are rectified by a rectifier circuit (not shown) provided in RF-ID antenna <b>702</b> in IC card <b>700</b> and supplied to RF-ID responder IC <b>701</b>, as an electromotive current. RF-ID antenna <b>702</b> reads the content (in this case, the serial number and the puncturing allowing flag) recorded in RF-ID responder IC <b>701</b>, converts the content into radio waves and emits them.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In this way, when response radio waves are emitted from RF-ID antenna <b>702</b> in IC card <b>700</b>, RF-ID antenna <b>642</b> receives these radio waves. RF-ID controller <b>641</b> reads the above-described serial number and puncturing allowing flag, from the radio waves received by RF-ID antenna <b>642</b>, and transmits an interrupt request to microcontroller IC <b>131</b> via serial communication means <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Upon receiving the interrupt request from RF-ID communication section <b>640</b>, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> reads data stored in RF-ID communication section <b>640</b> and decides whether or not to match the serial number registered in a memory (not shown) provided in microcontroller IC <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">When the serial number matches the serial number registered in advance, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> also decides whether or not the data stored in RF-ID communication section <b>640</b> is a puncturing allowing signal, and, when it is a puncturing allowing signal, issues a driving request to driver IC <b>132</b>. Subsequent operation of puncturing device <b>600</b> are the same as steps following step S<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">On the other hand, when microcontroller IC <b>131</b> decides whether or not to match the serial number and allow puncturing, and, if either one does not satisfy the requirement, microcontroller IC <b>131</b> requests again RF-ID controller <b>641</b> to perform communication again.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As described above, puncturing device <b>600</b> according to the present embodiment is configured to decide whether or not to allow biasing and puncturing by authentication using RF-ID after turnon of power, and therefore cannot perform biasing operation for puncturing unless IC card <b>700</b> which is registered and paired with puncturing device <b>600</b> approaches puncturing device <b>600</b>. That is, puncturing device <b>600</b> cannot perform puncturing unless the user having IC card <b>700</b> registered with puncturing device <b>600</b> performs authentication when measuring biological samples, so that it is possible to prevent puncturing device <b>600</b> from performing puncturing by mistake when puncturing device <b>600</b> is operated for purposes other than measurement of biological samples.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Here, although a case has been explained as an example where puncturing device <b>600</b> has RF-ID communication section <b>640</b> instead of communication section <b>140</b> in puncturing device <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1, another case is possible where RF-ID communication section <b>640</b> is provided instead of radio communication section <b>340</b> in puncturing device <b>300</b> according to Embodiment 2.</p>

<p id="p-0201" num="0200">To be more specific, radio communication section <b>340</b> in puncturing device <b>300</b> according to Embodiment 2 is replaced with RF-ID communication section <b>640</b> shown in the present embodiment.

<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Although the names &#x201c;biological sample measuring apparatus&#x201d; and &#x201c;biological sample measuring system&#x201d; are used in each of the above-described embodiment for ease of explanation, &#x201c;blood sugar level measuring apparatus&#x201d;, &#x201c;puncturing unit&#x201d; and so forth are possible naturally. In addition, an external registration device may also be referred to as &#x201c;external device&#x201d; or &#x201c;radio communication unit.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Moreover, the type, the number, the connection method and so forth of components, for example, for restricting and disallowing puncturing, are not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-034969, filed on Feb. 18, 2009, including the specification, drawings and abstract, is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The puncturing device, measuring apparatus and measuring system according to the present invention have the function of preventing mistaken use by means of a radio communication function, and are useful for a biological sample measuring system and so forth that need to sample blood by puncturing.
