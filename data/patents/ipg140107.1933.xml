<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Sensor offsets for an air filter monitor installed in an HVAC system may be determined by measuring a sensor offset differential pressure value across an air filter when substantially no air flow exists through the air filter. The sensor offset differential pressure value obtained at or near zero flow may represent the sensor offset for the air filter monitor. The sensor offset differential pressure value may be used to compensate an un-compensated differential pressure value obtained during flow conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure generally relates to HVAC systems that include an air filter, and more particularly, to methods and systems for monitoring the condition of the air filter and to provide an indication of when the air filter should be changed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) systems are often used to control the comfort level within a building or other structure. Such HVAC systems typically include an HVAC controller that controls various HVAC components of the HVAC system in order to affect and/or control one or more environmental conditions within the building. Many HVAC systems, including many forced air HVAC systems, include an air filter to help remove dust and other pollutants from within the building and to protect the HVAC equipment from dust buildup which may negatively impact system performance. The air filter will become dirty over time, and as part of regular maintenance, the air filter should be changed. Continuing to run an HVAC system with an excessively dirty filter can reduce the efficiency of the HVAC system, and in some cases, can cause damage and/or reduce the expected lifetime of some of the HVAC components.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to methods and systems for monitoring the condition of an air filter of an HVAC system, and to provide an indication of when the air filter should be changed. In one illustrative example, a method is provided for monitoring a status of an air filter of an HVAC system, where the HVAC system has a fan for driving air through the air filter of the HVAC system. The fan of the HVAC system may be turned &#x201c;off&#x201d; so that substantially no air is driven through the air filter. With the fan &#x201c;off&#x201d;, a sensor offset differential pressure value may be measured between an upstream side of the air filter and a downstream side of the air filter. The sensor offset differential value may be stored. Next, the fan of the HVAC system may be turned &#x201c;on&#x201d; so that air is driven through the air filter. With the fan &#x201c;on&#x201d;, an un-compensated differential pressure value may be measured between the upstream side of the air filter and the downstream side of the air filter. Then, a compensated differential pressure value may be determined by removing the sensor offset differential value from the un-compensated differential pressure value. In some cases, the compensated differential pressure value is determined by merely subtracting the sensor offset differential value from the un-compensated differential pressure value.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The status of the air filter may be determined based at least in part on the compensated differential pressure value. For example, if the compensated differential pressure value is less than a threshold value, the status of the air filter may be classified as &#x201c;good&#x201d;, while if the compensated differential pressure value is greater than a threshold value, the status of the air filter may be classified as &#x201c;replace now&#x201d;. Once the status of the air filter is determined, the status may be displayed on a display of an HVAC controller.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is contemplated that a new sensor offset differential value may not need to be generated more than occasionally. That is, the same sensor offset differential pressure value may be used to compensate several or many un-compensated differential pressure values. In some cases, a new sensor offset differential value may be automatically generated occasionally, intermittently, at regular intervals, or at any other time. In some cases, a user may initiate the generation of a new sensor offset differential value. Also, it is contemplated that a new sensor offset differential value may be generated if a sensed temperature adjacent the air filter changes by more than a threshold amount.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An illustrative HVAC controller may include a controller, a memory coupled to the controller. The controller may be programmed to send a command to turn a fan of an HVAC system &#x201c;off&#x201d; so that substantially no air is driven through the air filter. With the fan &#x201c;off&#x201d;, the controller may obtain a sensor offset differential pressure value that is representative of a sensed pressure between an upstream side of the air filter and a downstream side of the air filter. The controller may store the sensor offset differential value in the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The controller may send a command to turn the fan of the HVAC system &#x201c;on&#x201d; so that air is driven through the air filter. With the fan &#x201c;on&#x201d;, the controller may obtain an un-compensated differential pressure value that is representative of a sensed pressure between the upstream side of the air filter and the downstream side of the air filter. The controller may then determine a compensated differential pressure value by removing the sensor offset differential value from the un-compensated differential pressure value. The controller may determine the status of the air filter based, at least in part, on the compensated differential pressure value. In some cases, the controller may also display the status of the air filter on a display.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a building or other structure <b>2</b> having an illustrative heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system <b>4</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a typical forced air type HVAC system, other types of HVAC systems are contemplated including, but not limited to, boiler systems, radiant heating systems, electric heating systems, or any other suitable type of HVAC system, as desired. The HVAC system <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes one or more HVAC components <b>6</b>, a system of ductwork and air vents including a supply air duct <b>10</b> and a return air duct <b>14</b>, and one or more HVAC controllers <b>18</b>. The one or more HVAC components <b>6</b> may include, but are not limited to, a furnace, a heat pump, an electric heat pump, a geothermal heat pump, an electric heating unit, an air conditioning unit, a humidifier, a dehumidifier, an air exchanger, an air cleaner, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is contemplated that the HVAC controller(s) <b>18</b> may be configured to control the comfort level in the building or structure by activating and deactivating the HVAC component(s) <b>6</b>. The HVAC controller(s) <b>18</b> may be configured to control the HVAC component(s) <b>6</b> via a wired or wireless communication link <b>20</b>. In some cases, the HVAC controller(s) <b>18</b> may be a thermostat, such as, for example, a wall mountable thermostat, but this is not required in all embodiments. In some embodiments, the one or more HVAC controllers <b>18</b> may include multiple zone controllers, each monitoring and/or controlling the comfort level within a particular zone in the building or other structure. An illustrative HVAC controller, which is not meant to be limiting in any way, is disclosed in: US Published Patent Application No. 20090140062, entitled &#x201c;HVAC CONTROLLER THAT SELECTIVELY REPLACES OPERATING INFORMATION ON A DISPLAY WITH SYSTEM STATUS INFORMATION&#x201d;; US Published Application No. 20090143880, entitled &#x201c;HVAC CONTROLLER WITH CONTEXT SENSITIVE HELP SCREENS&#x201d;; US Published Application No. 20090143918, entitled &#x201c;METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONFIGURING AN HVAC CONTROLLER&#x201d;; US Published Application No. 20090143916, entitled &#x201c;HVAC CONTROLLER HAVING A PARAMETER ADJUSTMENT ELEMENT WITH A QUALITATIVE INDICATOR&#x201d;; US Published Application No. 20090143879, entitled &#x201c;HVAC CONTROLLER WITH PARAMETER CLUSTERING&#x201d;; US Published Application No. 20090140056, entitled &#x201c;HVAC CONTROLLER WITH QUICK SELECT FEATURE,&#x201d; the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the illustrative HVAC system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the HVAC component(s) <b>6</b> may provide heated air (and/or cooled air) via the ductwork throughout the building or other structure <b>2</b>. As illustrated, the HVAC component(s) <b>6</b> may be in fluid communication with every room and/or zone in the building or other structure <b>2</b> via the ductwork <b>10</b> and <b>14</b>. In operation, when a heat call signal is provided by the HVAC controller(s) <b>18</b>, an HVAC component <b>6</b> (e.g., forced warm air furnace) may be activated to supply heated air to one or more rooms and/or zones within the building or other structure <b>2</b> via supply air ducts <b>10</b>. The heated air may be forced through supply air duct <b>10</b> by a blower or fan <b>22</b>. In this example, the cooler air from each zone may be returned to the HVAC component <b>6</b> (e.g., forced warm air furnace) for heating via return air ducts <b>14</b>. Similarly, when a cool call signal is provided by the HVAC controller(s) <b>18</b>, an HVAC component <b>6</b> (e.g., air conditioning unit) may be activated to supply cooled air to one or more rooms and/or zones within the building or other structure via supply air ducts <b>10</b>. The cooled air may be forced through supply air duct <b>10</b> by the blower or fan <b>22</b>. In this example, the warmer air from each zone may be returned to the HVAC component <b>6</b> (e.g., air conditioning unit) for cooling via return air ducts <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some cases, the system of vents or ductwork <b>10</b> and/or <b>14</b> can include one or more dampers <b>24</b> to regulate the flow of air. For example, one or more dampers <b>24</b> may be coupled to one or more of the HVAC controllers <b>18</b> and can be coordinated with the operation of one or more HVAC components <b>6</b>. The one or more HVAC controllers <b>18</b> may actuate dampers <b>24</b> to an open position, a closed position, and/or a partially open position to modulate the flow of air from the one or more HVAC components to an appropriate room and/or zone in the building or other structure. The dampers <b>24</b> may be particularly useful in zoned HVAC systems, and may be used to control which zone(s) receives conditioned air from the HVAC components <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In many instances, one or more air filters <b>30</b> may be used to remove dust and other pollutants from the air inside the building or other structure <b>2</b>. In the illustrative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the air filter(s) <b>30</b> is installed in the return air duct <b>14</b> to filter the air prior to the air entering the HVAC component <b>6</b>, but it is contemplated that any other suitable location for the air filter(s) <b>30</b> may be used. The presence of the air filter(s) <b>30</b> may not only to improve the indoor air quality, but may also may protect the HVAC components <b>6</b> from dust and other particulate matter that would otherwise be permitted to enter the HVAC component.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The air filter <b>30</b> may restrict the air flow within the HVAC system <b>4</b>. The level of restriction may be characterized by, for example, a differential pressure drop across the air filter <b>30</b>, a static pressure on one or both sides of the air filter, an air flow through the air filter, a current draw by the fan or blower <b>22</b> at a given fan speed, etc. The differential pressure drop across a new, clean air filter <b>30</b> may be low, but may increase as the air filter <b>30</b> catches dust and other particulate matter during the operation of the HVAC system <b>4</b>. After a period of time, the differential pressure drop across the air filter may become significantly higher and replacement of the air filter <b>30</b> may be required to avoid potential damage to the HVAC system <b>4</b> and its various components.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The rate at which the air filter <b>30</b> may become dirty and needs replacement is often dependent on a variety of factors, some of which include the ductwork characteristics, equipment specifications, age and/or condition of the HVAC component(s) <b>6</b>, the duty cycle of the HVAC component(s) <b>6</b>, the type of filter, elapsed time, among others. One approach is to replace the air filter <b>30</b> on a regular basis (e.g. every three months). However, this may lead to excessive cost due to more frequent air filter replacement than needed, or may lead to a decrease in the efficiency and/or expected lifetime of the HVAC component(s) <b>6</b> in the case of less frequent replacements than needed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some cases, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the HVAC system <b>4</b> may include an air filter monitor <b>34</b>. The air filter monitor <b>34</b> may be configured to measure or detect a change in a given parameter that is related to the amount of flow restriction presented by the air filter <b>30</b>, such as a static pressure or differential pressure drop across the air filter <b>30</b>, an air flow through the air filter <b>30</b>, the amount of current drawn by the fan or blower <b>22</b> at a given fan speed, etc. In some cases, the air filter monitor <b>34</b> may include a differential pressure sensor including a first pressure tap <b>38</b><i>a </i>located in the return (incoming) air duct <b>14</b> and a second pressure tap <b>38</b><i>b </i>located in the supply (outgoing) air duct <b>10</b>. In some cases, the pressure tap <b>38</b><i>a </i>may be located outside the return air duct <b>14</b> and may reference the ambient or atmospheric pressure. In some cases, the air filter monitor <b>34</b> may include a flow sensor that is capable of providing a measure that is related to the amount of air flow restriction through the air filter <b>30</b>. For example, the air filter monitor <b>34</b> may be adapted to measure a flow rate, pressure, or a combination of flow rate and pressure through the air filter <b>30</b>. These are just some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The air filter monitor <b>34</b> may be configured to communicate with the HVAC controller <b>18</b> via, for example, a wired or wireless communication link <b>42</b>. The air filter monitor <b>34</b> may communicate, relay or otherwise transmit data regarding the selected parameter related to the amount of flow restriction presented by the air filter <b>30</b> to the HVAC controller <b>18</b>. The HVAC controller <b>18</b> may use the data from the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to evaluate the filter status. In some cases, the HVAC controller <b>18</b> may be configured to display information regarding the status of the air filter <b>30</b> to a user, based on data received from the air filter monitor <b>34</b>. Also, and in some cases, the HVAC controller <b>18</b> may be configured to indicate to the user when a filter change may be necessary or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view of an illustrative HVAC controller <b>18</b>.

A single bar or no bar at all displayed on a graph may represent that a filter change is needed. In still other cases, color-coded labels or indicators may be used to indicate if a filter change is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">So that the HVAC controller <b>18</b> may display accurate information regarding the status of the air filter <b>30</b>, the air filter monitor <b>34</b> may be calibrated. Calibrating the air filter monitor <b>34</b> may account for system variables/variations including, but not limited to, ductwork characteristics, equipment specifications, equipment set up, and the condition of the equipment, among others. Additionally, calibration may help ensure that the filter monitor <b>34</b> will work properly with the selected filter type and the particular HVAC system (e.g., HVAC system <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The filter monitor <b>34</b> may be capable of working with a variety of filter types and a variety of HVAC systems, as well as different set-ups from different manufacturers. Calibration may also be used to provide a threshold value against which the parameter monitored (e.g., differential pressure drop across the air filter <b>30</b>) may be evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary method <b>200</b> of setting an air filter change threshold value for an HVAC system. In such a case, a clean air filter may be installed in the HVAC system and used to determine and set an air filter change threshold value. The air filter change threshold value may then be used to calibrate and indicate the status of the filter, and in some cases, as discussed in further detail below, may trigger an alert to the user that the air filter <b>30</b> is dirty and may need to be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">To determine and set an air filter change threshold value for the HVAC system), first a system user (e.g., installer or HVAC contractor) may install a clean air filter in the system. Next, in response to an indication that a clean air filter has been installed, the controller may instruct the HVAC system to operate in a selected mode or state (Block <b>210</b>). The HVAC system may be operated in a mode or state in which the fan is &#x201c;on&#x201d; and drives air through the air filter. In some cases, this may be a &#x201c;fan only&#x201d; mode or state in which the heating and/or cooling element is &#x201c;off&#x201d; and only the fan is operated at a selected speed. In other cases, the HVAC system may be operated in a heating mode (e.g., HEAT 1) or a cooling mode (e.g., COOL 2). In another case, the HVAC system may be operated in a ventilation mode. In still other cases, the HVAC system may be operated in a humidifying mode or dehumidifying mode. Typically, the mode or state having the highest fan speed may be selected, but this is not always the case. In some cases, the mode may be selected based on which mode or state may provide the greatest negative impact on equipment life from a dirty filter.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While the HVAC system is operating in the selected mode, the controller (e.g., controller <b>18</b>) may command or require the air filter monitor to measure the differential pressure across the clean air filter to obtain a system differential pressure measurement that is related to an amount of flow restriction presented by the clean air filter (Block <b>214</b>). The differential pressure measurement may then be displayed to the user by the controller <b>18</b> on an appropriate screen of the display <b>62</b>. In some cases the user may operate the HVAC system in various different states, obtaining a differential pressure or other measure related to an amount of flow restriction (e.g. air flow for a given fan speed) associated with the clean air filter for each state. However, each time a new measurement is obtained, it may replace the previous measurement, but this is not required. When so provided, the differential pressure measurement (or other measure related to an amount of flow restriction) may be based on the last state in which the HVAC system is operated, but this is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Regardless of whether the user obtains a system differential pressure measurement from operating the HVAC system in a single or multiple modes or states, the system differential pressure measurement may be used to determine an air filter change threshold value (Block <b>218</b>). The air filter change threshold value is indicative of an expected differential pressure across what is considered a dirty filter. The air filter change threshold value may be used to determine the status of the filter (e.g., clean or dirty). In some cases, the user may use their own knowledge of the system variables that may affect the air filter change threshold value for the specific application to determine or modify the air filter change threshold value. Alternatively, or in addition, a processor <b>44</b> may be programmed with an algorithm that may determine an air filter change threshold value using a measure related to the amount of flow restriction presented by the clean air filter. In some cases, the algorithm may rely on only the differential pressure measurement, but this is not required in all embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While not required, the algorithm used to determine the air filter change threshold value may employ one or more inputs that may be provided by the user. In some cases, the user may input information regarding the HVAC system components in response to one or more questions provided by the processor <b>44</b>. For example, through the user interface <b>48</b>, the user may input information regarding the HVAC system including, but not limited to, the MERV rating of the filter, the fan type (e.g., variable speed fan), the number of dampers, whether or not the HVAC system is a zone system, the location of the HVAC components, the age of the components, and/or the size of the building or dwelling, among others. Using the data provided by the user and/or the system a measure related to the amount of flow restriction presented by the clean air filter (e.g. differential pressure measurement), the controller <b>18</b> may calculate and sometimes subsequently display an air filter change threshold value for the HVAC system.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some cases, the air filter change threshold value may be set such that it is about 25%-400% higher than that measured for the clean air filter. In some cases, the air filter change threshold value may be set such that it is about 5-300% higher than a differential pressure measurement associated with the clean air filter. In other cases, the air filter change threshold value may be set such that it is about 5-200% higher than a differential pressure measurement associated with the clean air filter. In other cases, the air filter change threshold value may be set such that it is about 5-150% higher than a differential pressure measurement associated with the clean air filter. In still yet other cases, the air filter change threshold value may be set such that it is about 1-50% higher than a differential pressure measurement associated with the clean air filter.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">While the air filter change threshold value for indicating a dirty filter may be determined or adjusted by the user based on their own knowledge and/or by the controller using an algorithm for that purpose, the air filter change threshold value may nonetheless be limited by an upper threshold value and/or a lower threshold value. For example, the industry accepted standard for an air filter change threshold value indicating a dirty air filter may be about 0.6 inches of water (w.c.). In some cases, the air filter change threshold value for indicating a dirty filter determined by the user and/or the controller <b>18</b> may be limited to not exceed this or some other value. Similarly, the lower threshold value for the air filter change threshold value may be limited to be no less than the system differential pressure measurement obtained using a clean air filter. For example, if the system differential pressure measurement for a clean air filter is measured to be 0.1 w.c., an exemplary range in which the air filter change threshold value for indicating a dirty filter may be confined to a range of 0.2 w.c. to about 0.6 w.c., but this is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some instances, the air filter change threshold value may be stored in the memory <b>52</b> of the controller <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) (Block <b>222</b>). In some cases, the processor <b>44</b> may be programmed with an algorithm that uses the air filter change threshold value stored in the memory <b>52</b> to determine the status of the air filter <b>30</b> by comparing, for example, a current differential pressure measurement to the air filter change threshold value, and based on the results of this comparison, may trigger an alert indicating that that the air filter is dirty and needs to be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some cases, setting an air filter change threshold value using a clean air filter may be initiated by a user through the user interface <b>48</b> of the controller <b>18</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11H</figref> provide several illustrative examples of various display screens <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b>, <b>242</b>, and <b>244</b> that may be displayed by the controller <b>18</b> while setting an air filter change threshold value using a clean air filter.</p>

Selection of the calibration method may be initiated by pressing either the CLEAN FILTER CALIBRATION button <b>276</b><i>a </i>or the BLOCKED FILTER CALIBRATION button <b>276</b><i>b</i>. In this example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, the CLEAN FILTER CALIBRATION METHOD button <b>276</b><i>a </i>is highlighted indicating to the user that the CLEAN FILTER METHOD option has been selected. Selection of the CLEAN FILTER CALIBRATION METHOD may be confirmed and/or initiated by pressing the NEXT button <b>286</b> displayed on the CALIBRATION menu screen <b>236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Selection of the calibration method (e.g., the CLEAN FILTER CALIBRATION method), may cause a first user prompt screen <b>237</b> to be displayed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>).

Selecting the &#x201c;Calibrate for Clean Filter Now&#x201d; may finalize initiation of the calibration protocol and may cause the controller <b>18</b> to initiate a calibration protocol. The user prompt screen <b>238</b> may also be configured to display a BACK button <b>294</b> which may return the user to a previous screen (e.g., screen <b>236</b>), a HELP button <b>296</b> which upon its selection may cause a HELP menu to be displayed, and/or a CANCEL button <b>298</b>, which may cancel the selection of the desired calibration method (e.g., CLEAN FILTER CALIBRATION) and which may return the user to the previous screen (e.g., CALIBRATION menus screen <b>236</b>) or a home screen.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Upon initiation of the selected calibration method, the display may be configured to display a STATUS screen <b>240</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11G</figref>).

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Upon initiation of the clean air filter calibration method, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to instruct or command the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to measure, for example, a differential pressure, across the clean air filter <b>30</b> installed by the user in response to the selection of the appropriate calibration method displayed by the first user prompt screen <b>238</b>. Rather than a differential pressure measurement, it is contemplated that a static pressure measurement, an air flow measurement, or any other suitable measurement that is related to an amount of flow restriction presented by the air filter may be used. In some cases, after a measurement is made with the clean air filter, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to display the measured value (e.g. differential pressure measurement value) on a third user prompt screen <b>242</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11H</figref>). The third user prompt screen <b>242</b> may include multiple regions for conveying a variety of information to the user. For example, the third user prompt screen <b>242</b> may display a differential pressure measurement value obtained during calibration in a first region <b>306</b>, and a user prompt <b>308</b> in a second region <b>310</b>. The third user prompt screen <b>242</b> may be configured to display the selected calibration method in the first region <b>306</b> adjacent the differential pressure measurement value. The user prompt <b>308</b> may instruct or prompt the user to set or adjust an air filter change threshold value which may indicate a dirty filter based on, for example, the differential pressure measurement displayed in the first region <b>306</b>.

The adjustment bar <b>312</b> may include a slider <b>318</b> adapted to display a label <b>320</b> indicating a current quantitative setting of the air filter change threshold value. Additionally, the adjustment bar <b>312</b> may include a first button <b>322</b> and a second button <b>324</b> for increasing and decreasing the setting for the air filter change threshold value. In some cases, as the user increases and/or decreases the air filter change threshold value displayed by the controller using the first and/or second button <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, the label <b>320</b> may indicate the current setting of the air filter change threshold value, and may continuously or incrementally change the value as it is increased or decreased. In some cases, the third user prompt screen <b>242</b> may also include at least one of a RETEST button <b>326</b>, a HELP button <b>328</b>, a CANCEL button <b>330</b>, and a DONE button <b>332</b> located in a fourth region <b>334</b> of the display screen <b>242</b>. Upon selection of the RETEST button <b>326</b>, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to re-execute the selected calibration method (e.g., clean filter calibration).

Selecting the HELP button <b>328</b> may cause a HELP menu to be displayed. Selecting of the CANCEL button <b>330</b> may cancel the current operation (e.g., adjustment of the threshold value) and may return the user to a previous screen (e.g., CALIBRATION menu screen <b>236</b>) or a home screen (e.g., Home Screen <b>230</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">After setting the air filter change threshold value, the user may select the DONE button <b>332</b> to indicate that that the air filter change threshold value has been set.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">To determine and set an air filter change threshold value for an HVAC system using an at least partially blocked air filter (and/or blocking panel), a system user (e.g., installer or HVAC contractor) may install a clean air filter in the system (Block <b>354</b>). Next, the user may install a blocking panel into the system to at least partially block the clean air filter to simulate a dirty air filter (Block <b>354</b>). The blocking panel may be a piece of cardboard, cardstock, poster board, or similar materials that may be inserted into the system to at least partially block the air filter in order to simulate a dirty air filter. The blocking panel may be installed in the system such that it at least partially blocks the return air side or the supply air side of the filter. The blocking panel may be sized using a template for that purpose. The template may be provided with the installation guide for the air filter monitor. In some cases, the blocking panel may also be provided with an installation guide. In some cases, a blocking panel may be used without a clean air filter installed. That is, the blocking panel may replace the air filter in the HVAC system, at least temporarily during calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some cases, a kit for installing an air filter monitor may include an installation guide or manual including instructions for installing and calibrating the air filter monitor.

In certain cases, a blocking panel may be initially provided with the kit. The template and the blocking panel may be discarded after successful installation and calibration of the air filter monitor.</p>

The template <b>382</b> may be used to size the blocking panel such that when the blocking panel <b>378</b> is inserted into the HVAC system, it results in at least a 25% air flow blockage, at least a 33% air flow blockage, at least a 50% air flow blockage, at least a 67% air flow blockage, or at least a 75% blockage. These are just some examples. The amount of blockage used to simulate a dirty filter may be selected by the user. In some cases, a 50% air flow blockage may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some cases, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the template <b>382</b> may be a piece of paper or thin cardstock including at least one set of horizontal and vertical measurement lines <b>386</b><i>a</i>-<b>386</b><i>e </i>that may be used to size the blocking panel <b>378</b> such that it results in a desired amount of air flow blockage.

In some cases, different sets of lines may be provided on the template, where each set of lines corresponds to a corresponding size air filter. This way, one blocking panel and template may be suitable for calibrating HVAC systems with different size air filters and/or different air flow blockages, as desired. In some cases, the blocking panel <b>378</b> may be sized by placing the template on the blocking panel <b>378</b> and using a cutting tool such as, for example, a pair of scissors, a razor blade, or an X-ACTO&#xae; knife to cut along the selected set of measurement lines <b>386</b><i>a</i>-<b>386</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, after the blocking panel has been sized to achieve the desired amount of air flow blockage and inserted into the system, the user may select a system mode or state in which to operate the HVAC system (Block <b>362</b>). The HVAC system may be operated in a mode or state in which the fan is &#x201c;on&#x201d; and drives air through the blocking panel and/or air filter. In some cases, this may be a &#x201c;fan only&#x201d; state or mode in which the heating and/or cooling element is &#x201c;off&#x201d; and only the fan is operated at a selected speed. In other cases, the HVAC system may be operated in a heating mode (e.g., HEAT 1) or a cooling mode (e.g., COOL 2). In another cases, the HVAC system may be operated in a ventilation mode. In still other cases, the HVAC system may be operated in a humidifying mode or a dehumidifying mode. Typically, the mode having the highest fan speed is selected, but this is not always the case. In some cases, the mode may be selected based on which mode may provide the greatest negative impact on equipment life from a dirty filter. The HVAC system may then be operated in the selected mode with the blocking panel to obtain, for example, a differential pressure or other measure related to an amount of flow restriction presented by the blocking panel (Blocks <b>358</b> and <b>362</b>). In some cases, the user may operate the HVAC system in various different modes, obtaining a differential pressure or other measure related to an amount of flow restriction presented by the blocking panel for each mode. In some cases, each time a new measurement is obtained it may replace the previous measurement. Thus, the system differential pressure measurement associated with the at least partially blocked air filter may be based on the last mode in which the HVAC system is operated, but this is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some cases, after the system differential pressure measurement (or other measure related to an amount of flow restriction presented by the blocking panel) is obtained, the user may verify that the change in air temperature across the heat exchanger and the discharge air temperature are within an acceptable range suitable for the particular system (Block <b>370</b>). This verification may be accomplished in any suitable way. For example, and in a first method, a return air sensor and a discharge air sensor may be connected to the HVAC controller <b>18</b>. The HVAC system may then be configured to display the change in air temperature across the heat exchanger. In a second illustrative method, a discharge air sensor may be connected to the HVAC system controller and the HVAC system controller may be configured to display the discharge air temperature. The user may then measure the change in air temperature across the heat exchanger using standard HVAC air temperature measurement tools. In a third illustrative method, neither a return air temperature nor a discharge air temperature is utilized. Instead, the user may simply measure the change in air temperature across the heat exchanger and the discharge air temperature using standard HVAC air temperature measurement tools. These are merely illustrative.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the change in temperature across the heat exchanger and/or the discharge air temperature are not within acceptable limits, then the user may adjust the amount of blockage by re-sizing the blocking panel or by using a different blocking panel, and may repeat the steps outlined in Blocks <b>362</b>, <b>366</b>, and <b>370</b>. If the change in temperature across the heat exchanger and/or the discharge air temperature are found to be within the acceptable limits, the user may repeat the steps outlined in Blocks <b>362</b>, <b>366</b>, and <b>370</b> for multiple system modes, if desired. In some cases, the differential pressure measurement (or other measure related to an amount of flow restriction presented by the blocking panel) that is obtained may be based on the last mode in which the system was operated.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some cases, the differential pressure measurement (or other measure related to an amount of flow restriction presented by the blocking panel) may be displayed to the user by the controller <b>18</b>. It is contemplated that the system differential pressure measurement (or other measure related to an amount of flow restriction presented by the blocking panel) may be used, at least in part, to determine an air filter change threshold value (Block <b>366</b>). Subsequently, the air filter change threshold value may be used to determine the status of the filter (e.g., clean or dirty). In some cases, the user may use their knowledge of the system variables that may affect the differential pressure threshold value for the specific HVAC system to determine or alter the air filter change threshold value, but this is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In many cases, the air filter change threshold value may be set such that it is substantially equal to the measure that is related to the amount of air flow restriction presented by the at least partially blocked air filter. In this instance, the user may accept the measure as the default air filter change threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">While the air filter change threshold value for indicating a dirty filter may be adjusted by the user based on their knowledge or by the controller using an algorithm for that purpose, the air filter change threshold value may be limited by an upper threshold value and a lower threshold value, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The air filter change threshold value may be stored in the memory <b>52</b> of the controller <b>18</b> (Block <b>370</b>). In some cases, the processor <b>44</b> may be programmed with an algorithm that uses the air filter change threshold value stored in the memory <b>52</b> to determine the status of the air filter by comparing a current measure related to an amount of flow restriction presented by the air filter to the air filter change threshold value, and that, based on the results of this comparison, may trigger an alert indicating that that the filter is dirty and needs to be replaced. After the air filter change threshold value is set, the blocking panel may be removed from the HVAC system (Block <b>376</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the air filter monitor <b>34</b> may be used to monitor the air filter <b>30</b> during operation of the HVAC system <b>4</b>. For the purposes of this discussion, the air filter monitor <b>34</b> will be described as being adapted to measure a differential pressure across the air filter <b>30</b> between the supply air side and the return air side of the air filter <b>30</b>. However, it must be understood, that the air filter monitor <b>34</b> may be adapted to measure a different physical parameter or to detect a change in a different physical parameter, such as air flow through the air filter, a static pressure on one or both sides of the air filter, current draw by the fan or blower <b>22</b> at a given fan speed, etc., as previously discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In many cases, the air filter monitor <b>34</b>, as described herein, may include a differential pressure sensor, which may experience a sensor offset and/or sensor drift over time and with temperature and/or over other environmental conditions. Sensor offset and/or sensor offset drift may decrease the accuracy of the differential pressure measurement. To improve accuracy of the differential pressure measured by the air filter monitor <b>34</b>, sensor offset and/or sensor drift may be taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">To determine sensor offset and/or sensor offset drift over time, the differential pressure between an upstream side and a downstream side of the air filter <b>30</b> may be measured at or near zero system pressure (e.g. with substantially no air flowing through the air filter). While differential pressure is used here as an example, it is contemplated that offsets for other sensors may be removed in a similar manner. It should be generally recognized that it is possible that a minimal amount of pressure may be present in the system, but that this minimal pressure may be considered to be negligible. In an ideal system, the differential pressure between the upstream side and the downstream side of the air filter <b>30</b> at zero system pressure should be equal to zero. However, this is not always the case for a variety of reasons. As such, the differential pressure measurement at zero pressure may be indicative of a sensor offset, which may drift with time and may reduce the accuracy of the differential pressure value. As such, and to improve the accuracy of the system, it is contemplated that the sensor offset may be measured from time to time and eliminated when determining the status of the air filter <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> outlines a method <b>600</b> of monitoring a status of an air filter (e.g., air filter <b>30</b>) using a sensor offset differential pressure value for a differential pressure sensor (e.g., air filter monitor <b>34</b>). While a differential pressure sensor is used here as an example, it is contemplated that sensor offsets from other types of sensors may be removed in a similar manner. As discussed above, the air filter monitor <b>34</b> may be in communication with the controller <b>18</b> via a wired or wireless communication link <b>42</b>. In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> and/or processor <b>44</b> may be adapted to send a command to the HVAC system to turn off the fan or blower <b>22</b> so that substantially no air is driven through the air filter <b>30</b> (Block <b>602</b>). Once the fan or blower <b>22</b> has been turned off, air stops circulating through the ductwork (e.g., supply air duct <b>10</b> and return air duct <b>14</b>), and the system pressure may approach zero. Once the fan is &#x201c;off&#x201d; and the system pressure is at or near zero, the controller <b>18</b> and/or processor <b>44</b> may send a command to the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to measure a sensor offset differential pressure value between an upstream side of the air filter <b>30</b> and a downstream side of the air filter <b>30</b> (Block <b>604</b>). The sensor offset differential pressure value may then be delivered to and stored within the memory <b>52</b> of the controller <b>18</b> (Block <b>608</b>). In some cases, the controller may be configured to display the differential pressure measurement on the display, but this is not required. The controller <b>18</b> may then return the HVAC system <b>4</b> to a previous or selected operating mode in which the fan is turned &#x201c;on&#x201d; so that air is driven through the air filter (Block <b>610</b>). In some cases, the previous or selected operating mode or state may be a cooling mode, a heating mode, a ventilation mode, a humidifying mode, a dehumidifying mode, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The sensor offset differential pressure value obtained at or near zero system pressure may be indicative of the sensor offset. For example, if the sensor offset differential pressure value measured at or near zero system pressure is 0.1 w.c., then the sensor offset can be considered to be equal to 0.1 w.c. The sensor offset differential pressure value may be monitored by the controller <b>18</b> as a function of time and/or ambient temperature. In some cases, when the sensor offset differential pressure value is obtained at or near zero system pressure, the controller <b>18</b> may also record the current ambient temperature and/or the amount of time lapsed from the last measurement of the sensor offset differential pressure value. Other physical parameters such as absolute pressure or humidity may also be monitored and recorded by the controller <b>18</b> as they may also affect sensor offset and/or sensor drift. This information may help the controller <b>18</b> to determine if the sensor offset differential pressure value is still accurate using an algorithm designed for this purpose. In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> may use the sensor offset differential pressure value to determine whether or not the current sensor offset differential pressure value calibration has expired. In such a case, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to display a message to the user on the controller display <b>62</b> that the sensor offset differential pressure value calibration has expired and/or that a new sensor offset differential pressure value calibration may be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some cases, the sensor offset differential pressure value may be obtained immediately or shortly after the initial system setup and calibration. In other cases, the sensor offset differential pressure value may be obtained at any time during operation of the HVAC system, such as occasionally from time-to-time, at regularly scheduled intervals according to an algorithm stored and executed by the controller <b>18</b>, and/or in response to a user's request. In some cases, the sensor offset differential pressure value may be obtained on a monthly basis, a weekly basis, every five days, every three days, every 48 hours, every 24 hours, every 12 hours, every 6 hours, every 20 hours of fan operation, whenever the temperature changes by more than 2 degrees, etc., as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to operate the HVAC system in a state in which substantially no air flows through the system to generate a new sensor offset differential pressure value. The new sensor offset differential pressure value may replace a previously obtained sensor offset differential pressure value if the new value differs from the previously obtained value by a pre-determined amount. In other cases, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to operate the HVAC system in a state in which substantially no air flows through the system to generate a new sensor offset differential pressure value if the temperature or ambient pressure changes by more than a predetermined threshold amount. The new sensor offset differential pressure value may then be stored in the memory of the controller. In certain cases, the controller may be configured to track the change in sensor offset differential pressure values over time; thereby quantifying the sensor offset drift. If the overall change in sensor offset differential pressure values is greater than a predetermined threshold for a predetermined number of measurements, then the controller maybe configured to alert the user that an error has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some cases, the sensor offset differential pressure value may be used to more accurately calculate the differential pressure measurement used to evaluate the filter status. Often, this measurement may be obtained during operation of HVAC system, as will be described in greater detail below. In some cases, for example, after the sensor offset differential pressure value has been obtained; the controller <b>18</b> may send a command to turn the fan or blower <b>22</b> of the HVAC system &#x201c;on&#x201d; so that air flow is driven through the air filter. The controller <b>18</b> may then send a command or otherwise instruct the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to sense a differential pressure between the upstream side and the downstream side of the air filter <b>30</b> to obtain an un-compensated differential pressure value (Block <b>612</b>). A compensated differential pressure measurement may be then obtained by, for example, subtracting the sensor offset differential pressure value (sensor offset) from the differential pressure measurement value according to the equation below (Block <b>614</b>):

</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The compensated differential pressure measurement (&#x394;Pcompensated) may then be used, at least in part, to evaluate the status of the air filter <b>30</b> (Block <b>616</b>). For example, in some cases, the controller may be programmed with an algorithm that compares the compensated differential pressure value to a predetermined air filter change threshold value to determine a current status of the air filter. In other cases, the controller may be programmed with an algorithm that compares a first compensated differential pressure measurement to a second compensated differential pressure measurement to determine a current status of the air filter. The controller may then be configured to display the status of the air filter to the user (Block <b>618</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> may be adapted to control the air filter monitor <b>34</b> such that the air filter monitor may periodically or occasionally monitor and measure the differential pressure across the air filter <b>30</b> during normal or routine operation of the HVAC system <b>4</b>. The controller <b>18</b> and/or processor <b>44</b> may be programmed with an algorithm that uses this measurement to determine the status of the air filter (e.g., clean or dirty), which may trigger a user alert or perform any other suitable action, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a flow chart of an illustrative method <b>624</b> of monitoring a status of an air filter of an HVAC system during routine or normal operation of the HVAC system. In some cases, the status of the air filter is monitored by comparing a differential pressure measurement obtained when the HVAC system is operating in a predetermined state such as, for example, an air filter monitoring state. This method may be periodically or occasionally repeated during routine or normal operation of the HVAC system, with each new differential pressure measurement used, at least in part, to determine and/or update the status of the air filter. In some cases, the status of the air filter may be displayed by the controller and/or may be used to trigger a user alert.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> and/or processor <b>44</b> may be adapted to control the HVAC system equipment to place the HVAC system <b>4</b> in a an air filter monitoring mode before commanding the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to measure, for example, the differential pressure across the air filter <b>30</b> (Block <b>626</b>). In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> and/or processor <b>44</b> periodically command the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to measure the differential pressure (e.g. at regular scheduled intervals), from time-to-time, and/or &#x201c;on demand&#x201d; in response to a user request. In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> may be adapted to place the HVAC system in the air filter monitoring mode such that the air filter monitor may measure the differential pressure across the air filter <b>30</b> on a monthly basis, a weekly basis, every five days, every three days, every 48 hours, every 24 hours, every 12 hours, or every 6 hours, every 20 hours of fan operation, or at any other suitable time, as desired. Alternatively, or in addition, the controller <b>18</b> may be programmed to place the HVAC system in the air filter monitoring mode and to command or instruct the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to measure the differential pressure in response to a user input or request (i.e., on demand).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In many cases, the same mode is used each time the air filter monitor <b>34</b> is requested to measure the differential pressure across the air filter <b>30</b>. In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> may place the HVAC system in a &#x201c;fan only&#x201d; mode prior to commanding the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to measure the differential pressure across the air filter <b>30</b>. In a &#x201c;fan only&#x201d; mode, all HVAC system equipment except for the fan may be placed in the &#x201c;off state,&#x201d; and for a zoned system, all dampers may be placed in the &#x201c;open&#x201d; position. In some cases, the heating or cooling element may be turned &#x201c;off&#x201d; In other cases, the heating element and/or cooling element may be turned on. In any event, the controller <b>18</b> may be adapted to turn on the fan or blower <b>22</b>. The fan or blower <b>22</b> may be operated at the same fan speed each time a differential pressure measurement is made. For variable speed fans, the fan speed may be adjusted such that the fan is operated at the highest fan speed available, but this is not required. What may be desirable is that the fan speed setting should be consistent for each measurement, and all other variable (e.g. the on or off set of the heating and/or cooling element, the damper positions, etc., should also be constant. Thus, it may provide a more consistent and accurate differential pressure measurement over time.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The differential pressure across the air filter may be measured while the HVAC system is operating in the air filter monitoring (e.g. &#x201c;fan only&#x201d;) mode to obtain a differential pressure value or other value that is related to the amount of air flow restriction presented by the air filter (Block <b>628</b>). The differential pressure value obtained while the HVAC system is operating in the air filter monitoring mode may be used, at least in part, to determine the current status of the air filter (Block <b>628</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The air filter monitor <b>34</b> may transmit or deliver data indicative of the differential pressure measurement to the controller <b>18</b>, which may store the data in the controller memory <b>52</b>. The controller <b>18</b> may be adapted to use this data to determine the status of the air filter <b>30</b>. As discussed above, the differential pressure measurement used to determine the status of the air filter <b>30</b> may be compensated by subtracting a sensor offset differential value from the measured differential pressure value to produce a compensated differential pressure value which may be more accurate over time. In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> may be programmed with an algorithm that compares the differential pressure value from the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to an air filter change threshold value determined by calibrating the filter monitor using either a clean air filter or an at least partially blocked air filter (and/or blocking panel), as described herein, to determine the current status of the air filter, which may, in turn, be used to trigger a user alert.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">After a differential pressure value associated with the HVAC system operating in the air filter monitoring has been obtained, the controller <b>18</b> may operate the HVAC system in a different state other than the air filter monitoring mode (Block <b>630</b>). In this different operating state, at least one of the HVAC components may be operated in a different mode than it was while the HVAC system was operating in the air filter monitoring mode. In some cases, the different operating state may be a previous operating state of the HVAC system. For example, the controller <b>18</b> may operate the HVAC system in a cooling mode, a heating mode, a ventilation mode, a humidifying mode, a dehumidifying mode, and the like. After a period of time, the controller may again place the HVAC system in the air filter monitoring mode (Block <b>632</b>). While the HVAC system is operating in the air filter monitoring mode, the controller may again command or request the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to obtain a second or subsequent differential pressure measurement associated with the air filter monitoring mode (Block <b>634</b>). This second or subsequent value may be used, at least in part, to determine and/or update the status of the air filter after which, the controller may return the HVAC system to a different operating state other than the air filter monitoring mode. In some cases, the HVAC system may continue to operate in the different operating state according to a predetermined schedule. These steps may be occasionally repeated according to a predetermine schedule or in response to a user's request during the normal or routine operation of the HVAC system.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As previously discussed, the differential pressure measurement (or other measure related to the amount of air flow restriction presented by the air filter) may be used to evaluate the status of the air filter <b>30</b>. In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> and/or processor <b>44</b> may be configured with an algorithm that compares the differential pressure measurement as measured by the air filter monitor <b>34</b> during operation of the HVAC system <b>4</b> to the air filter change threshold value. This comparison may then be used to determine the current status of the air filter.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In many cases, the controller <b>18</b> and/or processor <b>44</b> may be configured to trigger a user alert when the value of a measured physical parameter (e.g. differential pressure value) falls outside of the limits set for that particular parameter. In many cases, as discussed herein, the differential pressure across the air filter <b>30</b> may be monitored and detected by the air filter monitor <b>34</b>. The differential pressure value that is measured by the air filter monitor <b>34</b> during operation of the HVAC system is related to an amount of air flow restriction presented by the air filter in the HVAC system. A dirty air filter will present more of an air flow restriction than a clean filter. The controller <b>18</b> may be programmed to receive the measured differential pressure value from the air filter monitor and compare the measured differential pressure value to the air filter change threshold value stored in the controller memory. As described above, the air filter change threshold value against which the measured differential pressure is evaluated may be determined using, for example, a clean air filter, an at least partially blocked air filter (and/or blocking panel) according to the methods as described herein, or any other suitable method as desired. If the differential pressure measurement as measured by the air filter monitor <b>34</b> during operation of the HVAC system <b>4</b> is greater than air filter change threshold value then, in some cases, the controller <b>18</b> and/or processor <b>44</b> may display the status of the air filter <b>30</b> on the user interface <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), provide an alarm, or perform any other suitable action, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to display any one of a number of qualitative terms indicating the status of the air filter <b>30</b>. Exemplary qualitative terms that may be used to indicate the status of the air filter include, but are not limited to, &#x201c;CLEAN&#x201d;, &#x201c;GOOD&#x201d;, &#x201c;DIRTY&#x201d;, &#x201c;CHANGE FILTER SOON&#x201d;, &#x201c;REPLACE FILTER SOON&#x201d; &#x201c;CHANGE FILTER NEEDED&#x201d;, &#x201c;REPLACE FILTER NOW&#x201d; and &#x201c;FILTER CHANGE REQUIRED&#x201d;, among others. In other cases, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to display a graphical representation indicating the current status of the air filter <b>30</b>. For example, a maximum number of bars displayed on a graph may represent that the air filter <b>30</b> is clean, while only a few bars displayed on a graph may indicate that a filter change is needed soon. A single bar or no bar at all displayed on a graph may represent that a filter change is needed. Additionally, color-coded labels or filter status indicators may be used to indicate if a filter change is needed. In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to use a combination of the various indicators, as described herein, to indicate the status of the air filter <b>30</b>. In still other cases, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to sound an audible alert (e.g., intermittent beeps).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to trigger a user alert depending upon the status of the air filter <b>30</b>. In some cases, the user alert may be a part of a three-level user alert system configured to alert the user to the status of the air filter and, if necessary, alert the user to take action (i.e., change the filter, re-calibrate, check connections, calibration expired, etc.). The illustrative three-level user alert system may, in some cases, combine qualitative terms with a color code to alert the user to the filter status. In some cases, the three-level alert system may employ a stoplight metaphor. For example, when the differential pressure value across the air filter remains below the air filter change threshold value, the status displayed by the controller may be labeled as &#x201c;Good&#x201d; and a green color may be displayed. When the differential pressure value across the air filter remains repeatedly at or above the air filter change threshold value, sometimes for at least two or more consecutive measurements or for a predetermined amount of time, the controller <b>18</b> may display a label &#x201c;Change Filter Soon&#x201d;, along with the color yellow. In some cases, when the filter status changes from &#x201c;Good&#x201d; to &#x201c;Change Filter Soon&#x201d;, the controller <b>18</b> may initiate a timer that expires a predetermined amount of time later. The air filter monitor <b>34</b> may continue to monitor the differential pressure during this period, but this is not necessary. The controller <b>18</b> may include a &#x201c;snooze&#x201d; function, which may permit the user to temporarily remove or delay the &#x201c;Change Filter Soon&#x201d; user alert for a short period of time. If the user does not replace the filter during this snooze period, the controller may trigger a new user alert.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some cases, once in the &#x201c;Change Filter Soon&#x201d; state, after a predetermined period of time set by the controller <b>18</b>, the controller <b>18</b> may change the filter status from &#x201c;Change Filter Soon&#x201d; to &#x201c;Change Filter Now&#x201d;, and may change the color from yellow to red. In some cases, the &#x201c;snooze&#x201d; function may no longer be available to the user.</p>

The differential pressure measurement obtained after a new filter has been installed may not be below the air filter change threshold value if a more restrictive filter (e.g., higher MERV rating) was installed, or if the user did not actually install a new and/or clean filter.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some cases, the HVAC system <b>4</b> may be operating according to a predetermined schedule and/or mode in which the air filter monitor <b>34</b> may periodically perform a new differential pressure measurement.

<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>750</b> of evaluating a new air filter. In some cases, a user may install a new filter in the HVAC system. In some cases, the controller <b>18</b> may accept an input from the user indicating that a new air filter has been installed (Block <b>752</b>). In response to the input, the controller <b>18</b> may be configured to automatically operate the HVAC system <b>4</b> in an air filter verifying state or mode before commanding the air filter monitor <b>34</b> to measure the differential pressure across the air filter <b>30</b> (Block <b>754</b>). In many cases, prior to being operated in the air filter verifying state, at least one of the HVAC components was operated in a different state.

The air filter monitor <b>34</b> may transmit or deliver data indicative of the differential pressure measurement across the new air filter <b>30</b> to the controller <b>18</b>. The controller <b>18</b> may receive the differential pressure measurement data from the air filter monitor and may store the data within the controller memory <b>52</b> (Block <b>756</b>). The controller <b>18</b> and/or processor <b>44</b> may be adapted to use this data, at least in part, to determine whether or not a proper new filter has been installed (Block <b>758</b>).

If the differential pressure measurement obtained using the new filter is above the predetermined threshold value, the controller <b>18</b> may display an error message or other user alert. The user may then repeat the steps as outlined in Blocks <b>752</b>, <b>754</b>, <b>756</b>, and <b>758</b> using the same or a different filter. The user may also access information about the appropriate filter(s) for the HVAC system through the user interface, as described above.
