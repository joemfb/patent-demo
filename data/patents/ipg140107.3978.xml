<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Computing devices are becoming increasingly more prevalent in a wide variety of environments. As such, computing devices may be exposed to liquids, dust, and other substances. Therefore, some computing devices are designed to be more rugged in order to withstand such environments and protect the device. One approach for ruggedizing a computing device is to encase the entire device in an optically clear enclosure. However, such an approach is not ideal for interactive displays, as a thick enclosure introduces parallax resulting in a frustrating user experience.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The following disclosure is directed to fluid ingress resistance interactive display devices. As described in detail below, fluid ingress resistant interactive display devices in accordance with the present disclosure may include one or more fluid barriers. As described below, a variety of different fluid barriers may be used alone or in combination. Interactive display devices in accordance with the present disclosure are thought to be better protected from fluids, thus allowing users to interact with the display device in a wide variety of environments. For example, a fluid ingress resistant interactive display device may be a large interactive table top display in a restaurant setting. In such an environment, users may set a water glass on the display, and any condensation and/or spilling that may pool from the glass is resisted from entering an interior of the interactive display device. In this way, interactive display devices may be exposed to fluids without accumulating moisture within an interior of the device. Thus, internal components of such an interactive display device may experience reduced exposure to fluid, which may otherwise adversely affect the functionality of some components. Further, aesthetically adverse affects such as staining may be at least partially avoided in such an interactive display device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Aspects of this disclosure will now be described by example and with reference to the illustrated embodiments. Components and other elements that may be substantially the same in one or more embodiments are identified coordinately and are described with minimal repetition. It will be noted, however, that elements identified coordinately may also differ to some degree. It will be further noted that the figures included herein are schematic and generally not drawn to scale. Rather, the various drawing scales, aspect ratios, and numbers of components shown in the figures may be purposely distorted to make certain features or relationships easier to see. Furthermore, the size, shape, and spatial relationships of the various layers of the fluid ingress resistant interactive display device are not intended to be technically precise, but rather to ease understanding.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a perspective view of an example fluid ingress resistant interactive display device <b>100</b>. As shown, interactive display device <b>100</b> may be in a horizontal configuration such that a water glass <b>102</b> may rest on a surface <b>104</b> of the display. In this example, liquid <b>106</b> may spill from water glass <b>102</b> onto surface <b>104</b>. However, liquid <b>106</b> may be averted from entering an interior of interactive display device <b>100</b> due to fluid barrier <b>108</b> provided around a perimeter of surface <b>104</b>. For example, fluid barrier <b>108</b> may be a rubber silicone gasket, silicone foam, or virtually any suitable non-porous and impermeable material. As described in more detail below, a fluid ingress resistant interactive display device may be configured with one or more fluid barriers to protect the interactive display device from exposure to fluids. Further, the one or more fluid barriers may be positioned within an interior of the device such that the fluid barrier is not visible to the user. Additionally or alternatively, the fluid ingress resistant interactive display device may include one or more fluid channels to divert fluid away from electronic components, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a cross sectional view of an example fluid ingress resistant interactive display device <b>10</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a top view of fluid ingress resistant interactive display device <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, interactive display device <b>10</b> includes an optical stack <b>12</b>, a chassis <b>14</b>, a housing cover <b>16</b>, and a gasket layer <b>18</b>. As described in more detail below, gasket layer <b>18</b> may be a fluid barrier to resist fluid from entering an interior of interactive display device <b>10</b>. In this way, interactive display device <b>10</b> may be exposed to fluids without accumulating moisture within an interior of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optical stack <b>12</b> may include a transparent cover layer <b>20</b>, an electronic display <b>22</b>, and one or more optical sheets <b>24</b>. The various layers of optical stack <b>12</b> may be formed of optically clear materials configured to transmit visible light, and in some embodiments infrared light as well. Further, in some embodiments optical stack <b>12</b> may include a capacitive indium tin oxide (ITO) layer. Thus, the optical stack is comprised of materials that permit visible light and/or infrared light transmission through the optical stack.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Transparent cover layer <b>20</b> may serve as a protective layer for interactive display device <b>10</b>. As such, transparent cover layer <b>20</b> may be made of chemically strengthened glass, which is provided as one non-limiting example. Transparent cover layer <b>20</b> may be coupled directly to electronic display <b>22</b> via a bonding material or an adhesive, or transparent cover layer <b>20</b> may be bonded to one or more optical sheets, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Electronic display <b>22</b> may be a light modulating device such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) or an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display. Electronic display <b>22</b> may be configured as a touch sensitive or multi-touch sensitive display, and it will be appreciated that virtually any touch sensitive technology may be employed. As non-limiting examples, an active pixel sensor (APS), or a capacitive layer configured to detect touch on the top surface of the display through changes in detected capacitance may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The one or more optical sheets <b>24</b> may include a polarizing layer, a diffusing layer, an antireflective film, an antiglare film, a conductive film, a privacy film, an electromagnetic interference filter, etc. Further, it will be appreciated that the optical sheets <b>24</b> may include more than one of the aforementioned layers, films, and filters, etc. For example, optical sheets <b>24</b> may include a plurality of diffusing layers, which is provided as one non-limiting example. It will be appreciated that while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the one or more optical sheets <b>24</b> positioned below electronic display <b>22</b>, such that electronic display <b>22</b> is positioned between transparent cover layer <b>20</b> and optical sheets <b>24</b>, other configurations are possible. For example, additionally or alternatively, one or more optical sheets may be positioned between electronic display <b>22</b> and transparent cover layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Chassis <b>14</b> may serve as a structural support for device <b>10</b> by holding optical stack <b>12</b> and serving as a mounting platform for optical stack <b>12</b>. Chassis <b>14</b> may be configured in virtually any suitable way to accommodate the configuration of optical stack <b>12</b>. As such, chassis <b>14</b> generally has a size and shape that is compatible with a size and shape of optical stack <b>12</b>. Chassis <b>14</b> may be comprised of any suitable material, such as a metal or metal alloy, for example. It will be appreciated that chassis <b>14</b> may include one or more portions to hold optical stack <b>12</b> in place within interactive display device <b>10</b>. As described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, the chassis may be a tiered chassis in order to hold an optical stack in a tiered configuration, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, housing cover <b>16</b> may serve as an outer cover of interactive display device <b>10</b>. Housing cover <b>16</b> may be made of any suitable material, such as a plastic or metal. Housing cover <b>16</b> and/or chassis <b>14</b> may be configured to hold optical stack <b>12</b> in a horizontal or tilt configuration. For example, housing cover <b>16</b> may include support mounts configured to hold transparent cover layer <b>20</b> in the horizontal configuration. As one nonlimiting example, the support mounts may be legs or leg mounts. Further, as shown, housing cover <b>16</b> may include a frame rim <b>26</b> defining a viewing window <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, frame rim <b>26</b> may be sized and shaped to overlap an entire perimeter of transparent cover layer <b>20</b>. A region coinciding with an overlapped area provides a space for fluid ingress. In the illustrated embodiment, a barrier such as gasket layer <b>18</b> is used to restrict and/or eliminate fluid ingress. Housing cover <b>16</b>, as described above, provides an outer cover of interactive display device <b>10</b> and is defined in one dimension at <b>15</b>. As shown, housing cover <b>16</b> includes frame rim <b>26</b> which is defined in one dimension at <b>25</b>. Frame rim <b>26</b> overlaps a portion of transparent cover layer <b>20</b>, which is defined in one dimension at <b>21</b>. Gasket layer <b>18</b> may reside within this overlapped area such that viewing window <b>28</b> is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown, Gasket layer <b>18</b> may be a continuous gasket layer provided around a perimeter of viewing window <b>28</b>. Since gasket layer <b>18</b> serves as a fluid barrier for interactive display device <b>10</b>, it is comprised of a non-porous water tight material. For example, gasket layer <b>18</b> may be made of a silicone rubber, or silicone foam such as PORON. Gasket layer <b>18</b> may be positioned between transparent cover layer <b>20</b> and frame rim <b>26</b>. Further, gasket layer <b>18</b> may be fixed to frame rim <b>26</b> via a bonding material <b>19</b> and pressure fit against transparent cover layer <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, an uncompressed thickness of gasket layer <b>18</b> may be larger than the space between transparent cover layer <b>20</b> and frame rim <b>26</b>. However, the gasket layer <b>18</b> may be sufficiently resilient so as to compress into the space, thus forming a tighter seal.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">By applying gasket layer <b>18</b> to transparent cover layer <b>20</b> without a bonding material or an adhesive, damage due to material mismatch and thermal expansion can be reduced. Further, one-sided bonding provides more flexible manufacturing tolerances.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It will be appreciated that gasket layer <b>18</b> is provided by way of example and is not meant to be limiting in any way. Gasket layer <b>18</b> may be positioned in a location different from the overlapped region as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Further, gasket layer <b>18</b> may be configured in virtually any shape and/or size to resist fluid ingress. In some embodiments, gasket layer <b>18</b> may include two or more interrupted strips of gasket material and a sealant or other substance to resist fluids between such strips.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, fluid ingress resistant interactive display device <b>10</b> may include additional gasket layers to provide additional fluid barriers to resist fluid infiltration into an interior of the device. For example, the configuration of the optical stack and/or the configuration of the chassis may include various seams into which a fluid could enter. One or more gasket layers may be used to avert fluid from entering a further interior of the device at these locations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref> illustrate various examples of alternative or additional gaskets and/or sealants for an optical stack assembly of a fluid ingress resistant interactive display device.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show example embodiments of an optical stack assembly that includes fluid resistant features. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a cross sectional view of optical stack assembly <b>400</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an exploded view of optical stack assembly <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, optical stack assembly <b>400</b> may include a tiered optical stack <b>402</b>, a tiered chassis <b>404</b>, and a segmented gasket layer <b>406</b>. Some features in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> have already been described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> and therefore are referenced with common numbers. As such, these features will not be discussed repetitively.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, tiered optical stack <b>402</b> may include two or more layers including first display layer <b>408</b>, and second display layer <b>410</b>. First display layer <b>408</b> and second display layer <b>410</b> may correspond to different layers of an LCD panel, and/or various optical sheets, for example. While two layers are shown in the schematic representation, it should be understood that three or more layers are within the scope of this disclosure. It will be appreciated that first and second layers may be other layers compatible with the optical stack in any suitable order, as discussed above. Additionally, tiered optical stack <b>402</b> may include transparent cover layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">First display layer <b>408</b> may have a size that is greater in at least one dimension than transparent cover layer <b>20</b>. Likewise, second display layer <b>410</b> may have a size that is greater in at least one dimension than first tiered layer <b>408</b>. In this way, the optical stack may form a tiered configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Tiered chassis <b>404</b> may be configured to hold tiered optical stack <b>402</b> and serve as a mounting platform for tiered optical stack <b>402</b>. As shown, tiered chassis <b>404</b> may include a first tiered layer <b>412</b> and a second tiered layer <b>426</b> that mirror the size and shape of the tiered optical stack <b>402</b>. In this way, tiered chassis <b>404</b> accommodates the size and shape of tiered optical stack <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Segmented gasket layer <b>406</b> may be positioned between first display layer <b>408</b> of tiered optical stack <b>402</b> and the corresponding first tiered layer <b>412</b> of tiered chassis <b>404</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, segmented gasket layer <b>406</b> may include at least two segments <b>414</b> and <b>416</b> separated by a void <b>418</b>, the two segments <b>414</b> and <b>416</b> meeting near a corner <b>420</b> of tiered optical stack <b>402</b>. Further, void <b>418</b> may be filled with sealant <b>422</b> interposed between each segment. In this way, sealant <b>422</b> fills void <b>418</b> thereby collectively forming a fluid tight seal with sealant <b>422</b> and segmented gasket layer <b>406</b>. Therefore, fluid may be averted away from an interior of the interactive display device such that fluid exposure to electronics <b>423</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Sealant <b>422</b> may be made of any suitable material. As one example, sealant <b>422</b> is a silicone based sealant, such as silicone foam. For example, sealant <b>422</b> may be PORON, which is provided as one non-limiting example.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, segmented gasket layer <b>406</b> includes four segments wherein each segment coincides with a side of first display layer <b>408</b> and an analogous side of corresponding tiered layer <b>412</b> of the tiered chassis <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, segmented gasket layer <b>406</b> may be a first segmented gasket layer, wherein optical stack assembly <b>400</b> may optionally include a second segmented gasket layer <b>424</b>. Second segmented gasket layer <b>424</b> may be positioned between second display layer <b>410</b> of tiered optical stack <b>402</b> and a corresponding second tiered layer <b>426</b> of tiered chassis <b>404</b>. Similar to first segmented gasket layer <b>406</b>, second segmented gasket layer <b>424</b> may include at least two segments <b>428</b> and <b>430</b> separated by a void <b>432</b>. The two segments <b>428</b> and <b>430</b> may meet near a corner <b>434</b> of tiered optical stack <b>402</b>. Further, the segment <b>428</b> may be bonded to segment <b>430</b> via sealant <b>422</b> thus filling void <b>432</b>. In this way, sealant <b>422</b> fills void <b>432</b> thereby collectively forming a second fluid tight seal with sealant <b>422</b> and second segmented gasket layer <b>424</b>. Therefore, fluid may be averted away from an interior of the interactive display device such that fluid exposure to electronics <b>423</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further in some embodiments, second segmented gasket layer <b>424</b> may include four segments. In such cases, each segment may coincide with a side of second display layer <b>410</b> and a respective side of corresponding tiered layer <b>426</b> of the tiered chassis <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be appreciated that first and/or second segmented gasket layers may be any suitable shape or size. Further, the segmented gasket layers may have any number of segments that meet at virtually any location within the fluid ingress resistant interactive display device. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a top view of a segmented gasket layer <b>500</b>. As shown, first segment <b>502</b> and second segment <b>504</b> meet such that more than one surface of first segment <b>502</b> accommodates second segment <b>504</b>. In the illustrated example, first segment <b>502</b> and second segment <b>504</b> meet such that three surfaces of first segment <b>502</b> are in close proximity to three opposing surfaces of second segment <b>504</b>. Said in another way, the first and second segments are configured with an interlocking feature such that a seam between the first and second segments creates a stepwise gap <b>506</b>. In this way, the gap <b>506</b> between the first and second segments may be filled with sealant <b>422</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> are provided by way of example and are not meant to be limiting. It will be appreciated that the tiered configurations provided for the optical stack and the chassis may be tiered on one or more sides without departing from the scope of this disclosure. As one example, the one or more segmented gasket layers may be configured to overlap with each other, and the size and shape of the tiered layers may be configured to accommodate the overlapped segmented gasket layers. Further, it will be appreciated that gaskets and/or sealants may be additionally or alternatively applied to an interactive display device in configurations and/orientations other than the continuous gasket layer and the one or more segmented gasket layers as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a cross sectional view of fluid ingress resistant interactive display device <b>600</b> depicting an overlapped region <b>602</b> of segmented gasket layers <b>406</b> and <b>424</b>. Such a configuration may increase the fluid ingress resistant potential of the device. Some features in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> have already been described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref> and therefore are referenced with common numbers. As such, these features will not be discussed repetitively.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, interactive display device <b>600</b> may include void <b>604</b> between a portion of chassis <b>404</b> and a side perimeter surface <b>606</b> of transparent cover layer <b>20</b>. Void <b>604</b> may be filled with sealant <b>422</b>. In this way, fluid ingress may be averted from entering an interior beyond sealant <b>422</b> within interactive display device <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows another example of a gasket that may be used additionally or alternatively to the gaskets and/or sealants described above. Some features in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> have already been described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> and therefore are referenced with common numbers. As such, these features will not be discussed repetitively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown, fluid ingress resistant interactive display device <b>700</b> may include gasket layer <b>702</b> between housing cover <b>16</b> and chassis <b>404</b>. Similar to gasket layer <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, gasket layer <b>702</b> may include a portion affixed to housing cover <b>16</b> at frame rim <b>26</b> via bonding material <b>19</b>, and pressure fit to a corresponding region of transparent cover layer <b>20</b>. As shown, gasket layer <b>702</b> may extend beyond frame rim <b>26</b> to be affixed to a greater portion of housing cover <b>16</b>. Further, gasket layer <b>702</b> may include a portion that is further affixed to a top surface of chassis <b>404</b> via bonding material <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Additionally, as shown, gasket layer <b>702</b> may include a portion that is pressure fit to side perimeter surface <b>606</b> of transparent cover layer <b>20</b>. In other words, gasket layer <b>702</b> may be applied to transparent cover layer <b>20</b> on side perimeter surface <b>606</b> and a top surface corresponding to the frame rim overlapped region without a bonding material or an adhesive. In this way, fluid ingress may be averted from entering an interior beyond gasket layer <b>702</b> within interactive display device <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the fluid ingress resistant interactive display device may additionally or alternatively include one or more channels to divert fluid away from an interior of the interactive display device. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a top view of gasket layer <b>702</b> including example channels <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown, channels <b>800</b> may be a feature of gasket layer <b>702</b> and may be present in any number around a perimeter of gasket layer <b>702</b>, for example. Channels <b>800</b> may have a downgraded slope such that fluid spilled on transparent cover layer <b>20</b> may be gravity fed through channels <b>800</b> to an exterior of the interactive display device. For example, an outer enclosure of the interactive display device may include venting holes to allow fluid to exit an interior of the interactive display device, for example. In this way, fluid may be diverted away from underlying electronic components thus protecting the interactive display device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be appreciated that channels <b>800</b> may have any suitable shape and/or size. The example provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is non-limiting and it is to be understood that other configurations are possible without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Further, channels to divert fluid from an interior of the interactive display device may be configured to accommodate virtually any layer of the optical stack.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this way, fluid may be inhibited from entering an interior of the device at virtually any level of the device. For example, one or more gaskets may inhibit fluid from entering the device at a component level and/or a system level. Further, fluid channels may additionally or alternatively inhibit fluid from contacting electronic components of the device by diverting fluid to an exterior of the device, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is to be understood that the configurations and/or approaches described herein are exemplary in nature, and that these specific embodiments or examples are not to be considered in a limiting sense, because numerous variations are possible. Rather, the illustrations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> and the accompanying descriptions are provided as example configurations of a fluid ingress resistant device and are not meant to be limiting in any sense.
