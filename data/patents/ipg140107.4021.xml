<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a top plan view of an inspection target substrate W. Inspection target substrate W may include semiconductor devices that are subjected to an exposure process under different exposure conditions, in order to detect more defects at the edge area than at the center area. In addition, even semiconductor devices SD<b>1</b> included in the center region of the substrate W may be exposed under different exposure conditions. Similarly, even semiconductor devices SD<b>2</b>, included in an edge region of substrate W, may be exposed under different exposure conditions. The exposure conditions may be, for example, focal length and exposure time. A pattern is formed by developing and etching the exposed substrate. Using the substrate inspecting apparatus <b>1</b>, a test is performed in order to determine whether a defect occurs at a substrate where the pattern is formed. Exposure conditions applied to semiconductor devices which have been determined through the substrate test to be less defective (i.e., good) may be applied to a practical exposure process of semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although an inspection target substrate according to this exemplary embodiment is a substrate where patterns are formed while varying exposure conditions, the inventive concept is not limited thereto. Rather, the inspect target substrate may be a test substrate for verifying conditions of other semiconductor manufacturing processes.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, according to conventional substrate inspection methods, defects of a substrate W may be inspected while moving a light irradiation position by means of zigzag scanning performed in a horizontal direction, to the entire pattern surface of the substrate (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or zigzag scanning performed in a vertical direction to the entire pattern surface of the substrate (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In such an inspection method, before inspecting semiconductor devices in the center area of a substrate to which an exposure condition is applied, semiconductor devices in the edge area of the substrate are first inspected to detect more defects. Thus, since an excessive number of defects are detected from the semiconductor devices in the edge area of the substrate in the early stage of substrate inspection, the storage unit for storing data of defects which are detected during inspection may be overloaded and result in a shut down of the operation of the substrate inspection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example of a substrate inspection method according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, light irradiation member <b>20</b> irradiates light a semiconductor device SD formed on a substrate W.

At this point, a light irradiation position of light irradiation member <b>20</b> may gradually move from a semiconductor device formed in the center area of substrate W to a semiconductor device formed in the edge area of substrate W. First and second moving members <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>move substrate support member <b>10</b> in first and second directions (I and II), which may allow a light irradiation position to move along substrate W.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, the light irradiation position may sequentially move from one semiconductor device X<b>1</b> disposed in the center area on the center line CL<b>1</b> from semiconductor devices I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b>, . . . , and I<b>6</b> arranged in an upward second direction (II). Upon moving the light irradiation position along the semiconductor devices I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b>, . . . , and I<b>6</b>, when the number of detects of an inspected semiconductor device exceeds a predetermined value, the other semiconductor devices disposed at the outer side of the inspected semiconductor device are not inspected in the second direction. In this exemplary embodiment, although the number of defects of the semiconductor device <b>16</b> exceeds a predetermined value, the semiconductor device <b>16</b> is not inspected any longer because it is disposed at the end of a corresponding column.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Thereafter, the light irradiation position may sequentially move to semiconductor devices J<b>1</b>, J<b>2</b>, . . . , and J<b>5</b> arranged in a downward second direction (II).

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Similarly, semiconductor devices are inspected while moving the light irradiation position around semiconductor devices X<b>3</b>, X<b>4</b>, . . . , and X<b>12</b> disposed at different locations along the center line CL in the second direction (II).

In the situation regarding semiconductor devices X<b>6</b> and X<b>12</b>, the number of their respective inspected defects exceeds a predetermined value.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there has been described an example where semiconductor devices are inspected while moving a light irradiation position around semiconductor devices X<b>1</b>, X<b>2</b>, . . . , and X<b>12</b> on a center line CL in an upward second direction (II) and a downward second direction (II).

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When semiconductor devices on the substrate W are inspected in such a manner, semiconductor devices denoted by circles and semiconductor devices passed through by solid lines are inspected while semiconductor devices passed through by dotted lines are not inspected.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When a substrate is inspected by means of the above-described method, the inspection is not conducted to semiconductor devices in a substrate edge area where an excessive number of defects occur. Therefore, the time required for inspecting the substrate may be reduced.
