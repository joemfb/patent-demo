<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of the priority of Japanese patent application No. 2011-111673, filed on May 8, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a semiconductor device having a detection test structure for a crack of a semiconductor chip (or chip crack detection structure).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In manufacture of a semiconductor device, a stress or the like on cutting, mounting or heating sometimes causes a crack in a semiconductor chip. As a method of detecting such a crack, there is an example using a structure disclosed by Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. H06-244254 (Patent Document 1), for example. This detects existence of the crack by measuring resistance of an electric conductor provided in a periphery of the semiconductor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 2009-54862A, which corresponds to US2009/057925A1 (Patent Document 2) discloses an art of detecting whether or not there is a crack in a semiconductor chip by providing a wiring and a plurality of electrode pads for detecting the crack along an entire periphery of the semiconductor chip and detecting change of resistance between the electrode pads which are selected among the plurality of the electrode pads and connected to both ends of the wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above Patent Documents are incorporated herein by reference thereto in their entirety. The inventor has realized that in the detection methods disclosed in Patent Documents 1 and 2, no consideration is given to a detection of a crack of each semiconductor chip in a semiconductor device of a stack type in which a plurality of the semiconductor chips are stacked. If a plurality of the semiconductor chips disclosed in Patent Document 2 are stacked, in the semiconductor device of the stack type, the pads for detecting a crack are connected in common. Therefore, even though the occurrence of a crack in any semiconductor chip of the semiconductor device of the stack type can be confirmed, there is a problem that the semiconductor chip having the crack can not be identified.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventor has realized that if the structure disclosed in Patent Document 1 is used for the semiconductor device of the stack type, even though semiconductor chips having an electric conductor <b>70</b> for crack detection shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> are stacked, the crack in the most exterior semiconductor chip (Slice <b>0</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> may be detected, but the crack in interior semiconductor chips can not be detected.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an aspect of this disclosure, there provided a semiconductor device that comprises a semiconductor substrate including first and second main surfaces opposite to each other; a first penetration electrode penetrating the semiconductor substrate, a plurality of second penetration electrodes each penetrating the semiconductor substrate; a first terminal formed on a first main surface side of the semiconductor substrate, a plurality of second terminals formed on the first main surface side of the semiconductor substrate; a third terminal formed on a second main surface side of the semiconductor substrate, a plurality of fourth terminals formed on the second main surface side of the semiconductor substrate; and a conductive line formed on the first main surface side of the semiconductor substrate. The first terminal is vertically aligned with and electrically connected to the first penetration electrode. Each of the second terminals is vertically aligned with an associated one of the second penetration electrodes and electrically connected to another one of the second penetration electrodes that is not vertically aligned with the associate second terminal. The third terminal is vertically aligned with and electrically connected to the first penetration electrode. Each of the fourth terminals is vertically aligned with and electrically connected to an associated one of the second penetration electrodes. The conductive line includes a first end portion electrically connected to the first terminal and a second end portion electrically connected to one of the second terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the disclosure provides such a device that comprises a first semiconductor chip and a second semiconductor chip stacked with the first semiconductor chip. The first semiconductor chip comprises: a first semiconductor substrate including first and second main surfaces opposite to each other, a first penetration electrode penetrating through the first semiconductor substrate, a plurality of second penetration electrodes each penetrating through the first semiconductor substrate, a first terminal formed on a side of the first main surface of the first semiconductor substrate, the first terminal being vertically aligned with and electrically connected to the first penetration electrode, a plurality of second terminals formed on a side of the first main surface of the first semiconductor substrate, each of the second terminals being vertically aligned with an associated one of the second penetration electrodes and electrically connected to another one of the second penetration electrodes that is not vertically aligned with the associated one of the second penetration electrodes, a third terminal formed on a side of the second main surface of the first semiconductor substrate, the third terminal being vertically aligned with and electrically connected to the first penetration electrode, a plurality of fourth terminals formed on a side of the second main surface of the first semiconductor substrate, each of the fourth terminals being vertically aligned with and electrically connected to an associated one of the second penetration electrodes, and a first conductive line formed on a side of the first main surface of the first semiconductor substrate, the first conductive line including a first end portion electrically connected to the first terminal and a second end portion electrically connected to one of the second terminals.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit block diagram of Example 1 illustrating in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. An internal circuit <b>15</b> includes a memory cell array <b>11</b> having memory cells, a read/write-controlling circuit <b>12</b> and the like.

The (front side) first test terminal <b>621</b><i>h </i>and (front side) second test terminals <b>622</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h </i>are preferably disposed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> so that a part of a conductive line <b>61</b> for the crack check which is disposed along the periphery is made longer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, on the front side of the semiconductor chip memory device) <b>21</b> including the internal circuit <b>15</b>, the conductive line <b>61</b> for the crack check is provided on the semiconductor chip along the periphery of the semiconductor chip. When the conductive line <b>61</b> is broken by causing a crack in the semiconductor chip, for example, the resistance of the conductive line increases unusually. The increase of the resistance of the conductive line <b>61</b> may be measured through the test terminals <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One end of the conductive line <b>61</b> is connected to the test terminal <b>621</b><i>h </i>(first test terminal), and the other end is connected to the test terminal <b>625</b><i>h </i>(one of second test terminals). The connection relation may be same as in any of the semiconductor chips <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>. Namely, it is unnecessary to manufacture the semiconductor chips <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> as a plurality of the memory chips having different connections of the conductive line <b>61</b> and the front side test terminals from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, in the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>, (front side) test terminals <b>62</b><i>h </i>(<b>621</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h</i>) for the crack test are formed in order from the left side of the figure. On the opposite surface (back side), five (back side) test terminals <b>62</b><i>t </i>(<b>621</b><i>t</i>-<b>625</b><i>t</i>) (see further <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for the crack test are also formed corresponding to the (front side) test terminals <b>62</b><i>h </i>(<b>621</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h</i>), that is, at opposite positions through a substrate. Among them, the front side test terminal <b>621</b><i>h </i>and back side test terminal <b>621</b><i>t </i>are also referred to as the first test terminals (the terminals connected making a pair), the front side test terminals <b>622</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h </i>and back side test terminals <b>622</b><i>t</i>-<b>625</b><i>t </i>are also referred to as the second test terminals (the terminals being disposed at positions opposing one another to form a pair, but not connected so as to form a pair).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The front side test terminal <b>621</b><i>h </i>and back side test terminal <b>621</b><i>t</i>, which are a pair of the first test terminals, are electrically connected to each other with a through-silicon via TSVT<b>1</b> for the test. On the other hand, the front side test terminal <b>622</b><i>h</i>, which is one of the second test terminals, is connected not to the back side test terminal <b>622</b><i>t </i>disposed at a position opposite to itself, but to the back side test terminal <b>625</b><i>t </i>with a through-silicon via TSVT<b>2</b>. The front side test terminal <b>623</b><i>h </i>is connected to the back side test terminal <b>622</b><i>t</i>, the front side test terminal <b>624</b><i>h </i>is connected to the back side test terminal <b>623</b><i>t</i>, and the front side test terminal <b>625</b><i>h </i>is connected to the back side test terminal <b>624</b><i>t</i>, with corresponding through-silicon vias TSVT<b>3</b>-<b>5</b>, respectively. That is, each front side test terminal is connected to the back side terminal disposed at a position corresponding to the next terminal. As described below, this formulation is intended for making a connection mode of the through-silicon vias TSVT<b>2</b>-<b>5</b> of the memory devices in a spiral manner (so that a relative horizontal position is changed when going upward, namely, to the next stage (layer) of the stack) when the memory devices <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> are stacked.</p>

For convenience, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is illustrated upside down as compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates the example in which the semiconductor chips are stacked facing downward, and, however, the present disclosure may be applied to a device in which the semiconductor chips are stacked facing upward. A substrate <b>10</b> of the semiconductor chip has a semiconductor substrate and a device layer including a multi-layered structure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The conductive line <b>61</b> is illustrated by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> in order to schematically indicate the electrical connections although the conductive line <b>61</b> is actually provided along the periphery (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) of the surface of the memory chip and therefore does not appear in the cross-sectional view.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The front side test terminals <b>621</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chips <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> are connected in common through the back side test terminals <b>621</b><i>t </i>of the chips in the next stage (on the down side). The front side test terminal of the lowest semiconductor chip <b>21</b> in the figure is open because there is no chip in the next stage.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The front side test terminals <b>622</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chips <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> are connected through the through-silicon vias TSVT<b>2</b>-<b>5</b>, shifting the terminal to the next. Giving an example concretely, the front side test terminal <b>625</b><i>h </i>of the top semiconductor chip <b>24</b> in the figure is electrically connected to the front side test terminal <b>624</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b> through the back side test terminal <b>625</b><i>t </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>23</b>, front side test terminal <b>622</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>23</b>, the back side test terminal <b>622</b><i>t </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>22</b>, the front side test terminal <b>623</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>22</b> and the back side test terminal <b>623</b><i>t </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>. In a similar way, the front side test terminal <b>625</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>23</b> is electrically connected to the front side test terminal <b>623</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>, and the front side test terminal <b>625</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>22</b> is electrically connected to the front side test terminal <b>622</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to the above structure focusing on the electrical connection relation of the conductive lines <b>61</b>, one ends of the conductive lines <b>61</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> (the ends on a side connected to the front side test terminal <b>621</b><i>h</i>) are connected to the front side test terminal <b>621</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b> in common. On the other hand, the other ends (the ends on a side connected to the front side test terminal <b>625</b><i>h</i>) are connected to the corresponding one of the front side test terminals <b>622</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>, respectively. Concretely, the other end of the conductive line <b>61</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b> is electrically connected to the front side test terminal <b>625</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>, the other end of the conductive line <b>61</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>22</b> is electrically connected to the front side test terminal <b>622</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>, the other end of the conductive line <b>61</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>23</b> is electrically connected to the front side test terminal <b>623</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>, and the other end of the conductive line <b>61</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>24</b> is electrically connected to the front side test terminal <b>624</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the above structure, by measuring the resistance between the front side test terminal <b>621</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b> and any one of the front side test terminals <b>622</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h </i>of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>, the existence of a crack in each of the semiconductor chips <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> can be checked even in the stacking state, that is, when there is a crack in the memory chip of any semiconductor chip in the stacking state, it can be identified which chip has the crack.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> illustrate a method of checking a crack of each semiconductor chip in the semiconductor device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates the crack check of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates the crack check of the semiconductor chip <b>24</b>. When the semiconductor chip <b>21</b> is checked for a crack, the resistance between the test terminal <b>621</b> and the test terminal <b>625</b> may be measured, and when the semiconductor chip <b>24</b> is checked for a crack, the resistance between the test terminal <b>621</b> and the test terminal <b>624</b> may be measured. In this way, even after stacked, each semiconductor chip can be individually checked for a crack.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this Example, because each of the group of the front side test terminals (<b>621</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h</i>) and the group of the back side test terminals (<b>621</b><i>t</i>-<b>625</b><i>t</i>) located in the positions opposite to the front side test terminals is arrayed along a straight line (linearly), namely in a row, the front side test terminal <b>622</b><i>h </i>has no test terminal at a next position on the opposite surface (back side) and therefore is connected to the back side test terminal <b>625</b><i>t </i>which is located at the other end on the opposite surface. However, these test terminals may be disposed in a ring-shaped manner, for example (not illustrated). In this case, each of the test terminals on the both surfaces can be connected to test terminal on the opposite surface, shifting to the next (one by one). When such semiconductor chips are stacked as illustrated above, the through-silicon vias TSVT<b>2</b>-<b>5</b> of the semiconductor chips are connected in a spiral manner as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although any one test terminal is regularly connected to the next test terminal on the opposite surface in this Example, the effect of the present disclosure may be also obtain even if the test terminal is regularly connected to a terminal positioned, by one or more test terminals away, on the opposite surface. However, because there is a disadvantage such that the structure becomes complex, it is preferred that the test terminal is connected to the test terminal disposed at a position next to the opposite terminal, which is simplest.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a modified example of a semiconductor device according to the present disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is a semiconductor device having support bumps <b>45</b> for mounting. The support bumps <b>45</b> for mounting are assigned to the first terminals for the crack check. The center bumps are often difficult to be used for the test because of determined ball assign. On the other hand, there is an advantage that a support ball(s) may be used as the test terminal for the crack check because it is not necessary to guarantee electric characteristics of the support ball.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a further modified example from the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a pad <b>46</b> is provided between support bumps <b>45</b> for the mounting and connected to the support bump to put the semiconductor device to the test from the pad <b>46</b>. When contact with the support bump <b>45</b> is difficult, and when the contact with support bump <b>45</b> has influence on the mounting, the contact with the support bump <b>45</b> is impossible for the test. In this case, it is possible to check a crack by contacting with the pad <b>46</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device according to Example 2 of the present disclosure. A selector <b>55</b> and third test terminals <b>626</b><i>h </i>and <b>626</b><i>t </i>(front and back) that are connected by a through-silicon via (TSV) through the semiconductor chip are provided in each of the semiconductor chips (memory devices) <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, and the selector <b>55</b> switches an output among a plurality of input signals corresponding to an output signal from a mode resister <b>47</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of each semiconductor chip having the selector itself. That is, it is possible to perform output of the selector <b>55</b> by changing setting of the mode resister <b>47</b> with a mode register set command.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a circuit block diagram of the semiconductor device according to Example 2.

The read/write-controlling circuit <b>12</b> controls reading operation and writing operation of the memory cell array <b>11</b> according to the clock signal CLK, command anal CMD and address signal ADD.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a (front side) first test terminal <b>621</b><i>h </i>and (front side) second test terminals <b>622</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h </i>disposed along a periphery of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>, this is illustrated for the purpose of clearly indicating the electrical connection of the semiconductor chip <b>21</b>. The (front side) first test terminal <b>621</b><i>h </i>and (front side) second test terminals <b>622</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h </i>are preferably disposed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> so that a part of a conductive line <b>61</b> for the crack check which is disposed along the periphery is made longer.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The test output controlling circuit <b>47</b> is a mode register, for example, and forms a test output controlling signal, which switches over the output of the selector <b>55</b>, corresponding to the command signal CMD and address signal ADD and supplies it to the selector <b>55</b>. The selector <b>55</b> electrically connects any one of the (front side) second test terminals <b>622</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h </i>with a (front side) third test terminal <b>626</b><i>h </i>corresponding to the test output controlling signal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a memory system in which the memory devices <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> and memory controller are stacked, the test terminal <b>621</b><i>h </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be used as a ground terminal, and the third test terminal <b>626</b><i>h </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be connected to one of terminals (<b>622</b><i>h</i>-<b>625</b><i>h</i>) that are used for ordinary operation through the selector <b>55</b>. According to this structure, the memory system can detect a crack of each semiconductor chip without increasing an external terminal (SB).

In this Example, a top chip <b>24</b>&#x2032; does not have a through-silicon via, which is different from other semiconductor chips <b>21</b>-<b>23</b>. It is unnecessary to provide through-silicon vias in the top chip <b>24</b>&#x2032; because the semiconductor chips <b>21</b>-<b>23</b> and <b>24</b>&#x2032; are stacked so that a surface on which a circuit <b>15</b> is formed in a downward-facing manner.
