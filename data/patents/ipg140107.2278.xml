<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to methods and compositions useful to stabilize anthocyanins and anthocyanidins.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Anthocyanins are water soluble pigments which are responsible for the attractive colors of many flowers, fruit and leaves. Generally, they can be extracted from plants by acidified alcoholic solvents and many are available commercially as food colorants. They are often supplied with malto dextrin as a diluent in a concentration suitable for inclusion in beverages or other foods such as cereals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Anthocyanidines, the aglyconic component of anthocyanins, have a basic structure as shown in Formula I.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="29.55mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US08623429-20140107-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typical examples are: cyanidin (hydroxylated at positions 3, 5, 7, 3&#x2032;, 4&#x2032;), delphinidin (hydroxylated at positions 3, 5, 7, 4&#x2032;, 5&#x2032;) and pelargonidin (hydroxylated at positions 3, 5, 7, 3&#x2032;). The hydroxyl groups are usually glycosylated (e.g., an anthocyanin) and/or methoxylated (e.g. malvidin is substituted at the 3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032; hydroxyl groups and paeonidin and petunidin are substituted at the 3&#x2032; hydroxyl group).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Anthocyanins are water-soluble glycosides of polyhydroxyl and polymethoxyl derivatives of 2-phenylbenzopyrylium or flavylium salts. Individual anthocyanins differ in the number of hydroxyl groups present in the molecule, the degree of methylation of these hydroxyl groups, the nature, number and location of sugars attached to the molecule and the number and the nature of aliphatic or aromatic acids attached to the sugars in the molecule. Hundreds of anthocyanins have been isolated and chemically characterized by spectrometric tools. Cyanidins and their derivatives are the most common anthocyanins present in vegetables, fruits and flowers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Anthocyanins share a basic carbon skeleton in which hydrogen, hydroxyl or methoxyl groups can be found in six different positions as noted above. In fruits and vegetables, six basic anthocyanin compounds predominate, differing both in the number of hydroxyl groups present on the carbon ring and in the degree of methylation of these hydroxyl groups. The identity, number and position of the sugars attached to the carbon skeleton are also variable; the most common sugars that can be linked to carbon-3, carbon-5 and, sometimes, carbon-7, are glucose, arabinose, rhamnose or galactose. On this basis, it is possible to distinguish monosides, biosides and triosides.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another important variable that contributes to the chemical structure of anthocyanins is the acylating acid that can be present on the carbohydrate moiety. The most frequent acylating agents are caffeic, ferulic, sinapic and p-coumaric acids, although aliphatic acids such as acetic, malic, malonic, oxalic and succinic acids can also occur. Up to three acylating acids can be present simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Due to their particular chemical structure, anthocyanins and anthocyanidins are characterized by an electron deficiency, which makes them very reactive toward reactive oxygen species (ROS), also known as free radicals; they are consequently considered to be powerful natural antioxidants.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Anthocyanins, due in part to the nature of their chemical structure, tend to be unstable and susceptible to degradation. Additionally, the stability of anthocyanins is effected by pH, storage over a period of months, storage temperature, presence of enzymes, light, oxygen, and the presence of proteins, flavonoids and minerals</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">More particularly, the bioavailability of anthocyanins is low due to their sensitivity to changes in pH. Anthocyanins are generally stable at pH values of 3.5 and below, and are therefore stable under stomach conditions. However, they degrade at higher pH values, such as those more typical for the intestinal tract (pH of 7) and thus beneficial absorption and nutritional value is greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, a need exists for a composition and/or method that provides stabilized anthocyanins.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention surprisingly provides stabile anthocyanin compositions, methods to prepare such compositions and also methods of use of such compositions to treat various afflictions. The present invention provides unique compositions of an anthocyanin and a stabilizing compound such that the combination of the two components provides that the anthocyanin does not readily undergo degradation. Up until the time of the invention, it was known that anthocyanins would degrade upon exposure to environmental stresses, such as air, light, proteins, or enzymes. More troublesome was the instability of anthocyanins in solutions having a neutral or basic pH.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Surprisingly, the present invention provides that use of cysteine in combination with an anthocyanin composition (whether it be an anthocyanidine or an anthocyanoside) helps to increase the delivery of the anthocyanin to a subject in need thereof by at least twice the amount relative to a subject that ingests an anthocyanin composition without the presence of cysteine. It has been surprisingly found that plasma concentration levels of the anthocyanin where the anthocyanin is delivered in the presence of cysteine after 4 hours is at least twice the plasma concentration of an anthocyanin delivered without the cysteine. Therefore, the present invention provides a method to increase the amount of bioavailable anthocyanin in a subject by administering to the subject an effective amount of an anthocyanin and cysteine. The administration can be by any means, but oral delivery is generally preferred. In one embodiment, the ratio of the anthocyanin to the cysteine is about 10 to about 1, on a weight basis.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one aspect, the present invention provides a stabilized anthocyanin extract composition that includes an anthocyanin extract and a stabilizing compound having at least one &#x2014;SH group. Suitable examples of stabilizing compounds include (reduced) glutathione, dihydrolipoic acid, cysteine, yeast extract and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although there are literally thousands of anthocyanin extracts, all of which should be considered included within the realm of this specification, suitable examples of anthocyanin extracts of particular interest include bilberry extract, blackcurrant extract, cranberry extract, black soybean extract, cowberry extract, blueberry extract and mixtures of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one aspect, the ratio of stabilizing compound to anthocyanin extract is about 0.1 to about 10, more particularly about 0.5 to about 5, and more particularly about 1 to about 1.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect, the stabilized anthocyanin extract composition is stabile toward degradation when exposed to an aqueous environment with a pH of about 2 or greater, such as a pH of about 3, of about 4, of about 5, pH of about 6, pH of about 7 pH of about 8, of about 9, of about 10, or about 11, of about 12 or even higher, e.g. 14.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In still another aspect, the stabilized anthocyanin extract is an anthocyanoside.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In still yet another aspect, the stabilized anthocyanin extract is an anthocyanidin.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In still other aspects of the invention, the stabilized anthocyanin extract includes one or more anthocyanosides that are glycosides of perlargonidin, peonidin, cyanidin, malvidin, petunidin, delphinidin.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention also pertains to methods of preparing the stabilized anthocyanin compositions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention further pertains to methods of treatment of various ailments by administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the stabilized anthocyanin compositions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Therefore, the present invention further provides bioavailable stabilized anthocyanin compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">While multiple embodiments are disclosed, still other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description. As will be apparent, the invention is capable of modifications in various obvious aspects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the detailed descriptions are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">where R<sub>1 </sub>through R<sub>7 </sub>provide representative examples of anthocyanidins.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The glycosylated forms of anthocyanins are more water soluble and stable than anthocyanidins. Anthocyanosides are classified by the number of glycosyl units they contain. Monoglycosides include one saccharidic moiety, which is primarily attached to the 3-hydroxyl group of the aglycon. Diglycosides generally contain two monosaccharides at the 3 and 5 hydroxy positions and occasionally at the 3 and 7 hydroxyl positions. Triglycosides have attachment generally where there are two units at the 3 position and one at the C-5 or C-7 position. Glycosylations at the 3&#x2032;, 4&#x2032; and/or 5&#x2032; positions are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The most common sugars of anthocyanins include the monosaccharides glucose, rhamnose, galactose, arabinose and xylose. The di- and trisaccharides found most often in anthocyanins are rutinose, sophorose, sambubiose and glucorutinose.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Anthocyanins can be acylated through one or more hydroxyls with a carboxylic acid. The acids are most commonly linked to the 6 position of the monosaccharide but the 2, 3 and 4 positions of the monosaccharides are also possible. Common aliphatic acids include malonic, acetic, malic, succinic, and oxalic acids. Common aromatic phenolic acids and aliphatic dicarboxylic acids include coumaric, acffeic, sinapic, ferulic, oxalic, malonic, malic, succinic and gallic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The term &#x201c;extract&#x201d; is intended to mean anthocyanin materials obtained from plant sources, such as leaves, twigs, bark, roots, stem, seeds, flowers, berries, fruit, for example, by routine isolation methods from suitable plants sources noted, but not limited to, those described herein. There are various methods for the extraction of anthocyanins known to those of skill in the art. Some of these methods are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,354;U.S. Pat. No. 5,200,186; U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,363; U.S. Pat. No. 4,211,577; U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,200 (each incorporated herein by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Examples of suitable anthocyanin-containing plants include, but are not limited to, fruits, vegetables, flowers and other plants selected from the group consisting of <i>Acer macrophyllum, Acer platanoides, acerola, Ajuga reptans</i>, apple, apricot, <i>Artict bramble</i>, avocado, banana, barberry, barley, <i>Begonia semperfiorens, Bellis perennis, Bletilla striata</i>, bilberry, black beans, black soybeans, black, blue and purple potatoes, blackberry, blueberry, bog whortleberry, boysenberry, buckwheat, cacao, <i>Camellia sinensis</i>, canarygrass, <i>Caucasian blueberry, Chimonanthus praecox</i>, celery, <i>Cerasus avium</i>, cherry, cherry laurel, chicory, chive, chokeberry, <i>Cornelian cherry</i>, cornflower, <i>cotoneaster</i>, cowberry, cranberry, crowberry, chrysanthemum, <i>Cynomorium coccineum, Dahlia variabilis</i>, danewort, deerberry, <i>Dendrobium</i>, dwarf dogwood, <i>Echinacea purpea</i>, eggplant, elderberry, fababean, <i>Fatsia japonica</i>, feijoa, fig, garlic, gerbera, ginseng, <i>Globe artichoke</i>, gooseberry, grapes, guava, hawthorn, hibiscus or roselle, <i>Hibiscus Sabdaiffa</i>, highbush blueberry, hollyhock, honeysuckle, <i>Ipomoea purpurea, Iris ensata, Java plum, Jerusalem artichoke, kokum, Laeliocattleya</i>, lentil, loganberry, lupine, lychee, maize, mango, mangosteen, maqui, <i>Matthiola incana</i>, meconopsis, <i>Metrosideros excelsa</i>, millet, mountain ash berry, mulberry, myrtle berry, olive, onion, orange, ornamental cherry, passion fruit, pea, peach, peanut, pear, <i>perilla</i>, petunia, <i>Phalaenopsis, Phalsa</i>, Pharbitis, Pineapple, pistachio, plum, pomegranate, <i>Phragmites australis</i>, purple carrot, quince, rabbiteye blueberry, radish, red and black currant, red and black raspberry, red cabbage, rice, rhubarb, rosehip, rye, saffron, sarracenia, sheepberry, <i>Sophronitis coccinea</i>, sorghum, sparkleberry, strawberry, <i>Fragada Vesca</i>, sugarcane, sunflower, sweet cherry, sweet potato, tamarillo, tamarind, taro, tart cherry, <i>Tulip greigii</i>, turnip, water lily, <i>Weigela</i>, wheat, wild rice, <i>Verbena hybrida</i>, yam and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Although there are literally thousands of anthocyanin extracts, all of which should be considered included within the realm of this specification, suitable examples of anthocyanin extracts of particular interest include bilberry extract, blackcurrant extract, cranberry extract, black soybean extract, cowberry extract, blueberry extract and mixtures of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Typically the extract is concentrated by various methods to provide a solution enriched in anthocyanins. For example, ultrafiltration can be used to remove unwanted components by molecular weight cut offs. The retentate from the filtration can be stored as a liquid or, for example, can then be further concentrated into a powder by spray drying, freeze drying, flash drying, fluidized bed drying, ring drying, tray drying, vacuum drying, radio frequency drying or microwave drying. Ultimately, the extract should contain at least 10% by weight anthocyanin content. Commercially available anthocyanins can be obtained from sources such as Artemis International, Fort Wayne, Ind. Commercially obtained anthocyanin extracts should contain at least 10% by weight anthocyanin content. The extracts, therefore, contain anthocyanin(s) and other plant materials such as other flavinoids, sugars, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Anthocyanin extracts can be further purified by one or more methods known in the art, such as chromatography, gel chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, crystallization, affinity chromatography, partition chromatography and the like. Identification of the particular anthocyanin(s) can be accomplished by methods know to those skilled in the art and include <sup>1</sup>H NMR, chemical degradation, chromatography and spectroscopy, especially homo- and heteronuclear two-dimensional NMR techniques for the characterization of the isolated anthocyanin compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The term &#x201c;purified&#x201d; or &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; is used in reference to the purification and/or isolation of one or more anthocyanins from an anthocyanin extract as described above. Again using conventional methods known in the art, various components of the anthocyanin extract can be separated into purified materials. In one aspect of the invention, the anthocyanin(s) of the extract are substantially purified and isolated by techniques known in the art. The purity of the purified compounds is generally at least about 90%, preferably at least about 95%, and most preferably at least about 99% and even more preferably at least about 99.9% (e.g. about 100%) by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In accordance with the present invention, the anthocyanin extract contains one or more anthocyanins and/or anthocyanidins selected from the group consisting of peonidin, cyanidin, pelargonidin, delphinldin, petunidin, malvidin, apigenindin, auratinidin, capensinidin, europinidin, hirsutidin, 6-hydroxycyanidin, luteolinidin, 5-methylcyanidin, pulchellidin, rosinidin, tricetnidin, derivatives and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the anthocyanins and anthocyanidins are selected from the group consisting of cyanidin, peonidin, malvidin, petunidin, delphinidin, their glycoside derivatives, and mixtures thereof. In yet another embodiment, the extract contains at least one cyanidin-based anthocyanin.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The term &#x201c;anthocyanin&#x201d; as used herein is intended to refer not only to monomeric anthocyanins, but also refers to dimeric and polymeric (i.e. containing from 3 to 20 anthocyanidin monomer residues) forms of anthocyanins and to leucoanthocyanidins (also known as flavan-3,4-diols). The anthocyanins can comprise substitutions (e.g. alkyl, alkoxy groups etc.) and in particular can be O-glycosylated, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The anthocyanin in the composition can be a single anthocyanin, or comprise a mixture of anthocyanins. In particular, the anthocyanin is selected from the group consisting of: malvidin, cyanidin, delphinidin, paeonidin, pelargonidin and petunidin, and glycosides thereof A typical example is malvin (malvidin diglucoside) chloride, which is commercially available in a purified form. Alternatively the anthocyanin can be obtained by extracting anthocyanin containing plants such as grape, black carrot, red cabbage, blackberry, blackcurrent, cranberry and the like as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The phrase &#x201c;stabilized anthocyanin composition&#x201d; as used herein is intended to mean that the anthocyanin, either as a glycoside (anthocyanoside) or as an aglycon (anthocyanidin), for example, at about 37&#xb0; C., pH=about 7.0, remains at least about 50% undegraded from the original percentage of anthocyanin for at least about 3.5 hours. Likewise, the phrase includes pH values of about 4, about 5, about 6 and about 8 with similar stability.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The term &#x201c;stabilizing compound&#x201d; as used herein is intended to include those compounds that have at least one &#x2014;SH group. Not to be limited by theory, it is believed that an interaction occurs between the thiol group and the anthocyanin such that the thiol containing group is oxidized (often to a disulfide, &#x2014;S&#x2014;S&#x2014;) and the anthocyanin receives a hydrogen atom, which is then later liberated.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Suitable examples of stabilizing compounds include yeast extract (e.g., beer yeast), dihydrolipoic acid, salts of dihydrolipoic acid such as amino acid salts, cysteine, derivatives of cysteine, such as N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, salts of glutathione, SH-proteinase such as papain, bromelain, ficin, ehymopapain and mixtures thereof, SH-metalloproteinases, peptides containing cysteine, peptides containing glutathioine, fermented oyster extract, fermented bean curd, thiolated chitosans, thiolated gelatins or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one aspect, the mole ratio of stabilizing compound to anthocyanin is between about 0.1 to about 10, more particularly between about 0.5 to about 5 and even more particularly about 1 to about 1.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Not to be limited by theory the following is an explanation of the surprising an unique findings with regard to the present invention. Anthocyanosides are susceptible to pH-shifts by forming colorless derivatives. The flavylium-cation and the quinonoidal-base are colored and the equilibria are not generally influenced with the presence of both species being pH-dependent [pH-value&#x3c;2]. (See Scheme 1) It is believed that this equilibrium is established very quickly and that the reaction is reversible. The &#x201c;attack&#x201d; of the water under appropriate conditions yields a series of colorless derivatives (carbinolbase, chalcone). This part of the reaction progresses slowly is and not normally reversible. The decolouration process begins at pH-values of about &#x3e;3.5. Prevention of the water attack by molecular protection provides stabilization of anthocyanosides as described throughout the specification.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Based on theory, known phenomenon of co-pigmentation (describing increased stability of anthocyanosides in presence of &#x201c;copigments&#x201d;) yields a bathochromic (&#x3bb; max shift towards higher wave length) and a hyperchromic (increase in absorption at &#x3bb; max for the same concentrations) effect. Hence, clarification of whether thiol-compounds were able to act as co-pigments was undertaken.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Based on theory, anthocyanosides are able to increase their stability by self-association. The higher the concentration, the more likely is the effect of self-association. Self-association occurs at concentrations of about &#x3e;0.0001 molar solution concentration. Self association may help mask the protective effects of thiol-compounds; hence the protective effects were tested at various concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Based on theory, co-pigmentation should yield a bathochromic (&#x3bb; max shift towards higher wave length) and a hyperchromic (increase in absorption at &#x3bb; max at the same concentration) shift.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The present studies based on UV-spectroscopy found that neither DHLA (dihydrolipoic acid) nor GSH (glutathione) yielded a bathochromic or a hyperchromic effect as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Therefore, increase in stability is most likely related to another mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The spectral properties of freshly dissolved cyanidin-3-O-glucosides (protected and unprotected) in terms of &#x3bb; max shifts for different pH-values were identical as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The stability of bilberry extract (various concentrations, molar concentrations expressed as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside) was investigated in presence/absence of GSH or DHLA by UV-spectroscopy measuring the absorption at the pH-dependent &#x3bb; max.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, the present investigations showed that anthocyanosides are protected against degradation by GSH (0.65 mmolar) and DHLA (1.44 mmolar) at all concentrations tested, especially at pH values&#x3e;5-6. The &#x3bb; max at the various pH tested did not differ between the unprotected and the protected solutions. Since it was observed that with cyanidin-glucoside no hyperchromic effect occurred, the stabilizing effect of thiol-containing protection agents is considered to be different from co-pigmentation.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The stability of bilberry extract at a 0.0001 molar concentration (expressed as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside) was investigated by UV-spectroscopy at different pH-values over time in absence/presence of DHLA (1.44 mmolar solution).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">These experiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A through 6D</figref>, demonstrate that DHLA protects anthocyanosides at those pH-values where unprotected anthocyanosides degrade quickly (pH&#x3e;5-6). Most interestingly, when fitting the data to statistical models (regression analysis) unprotected degradation kinetics fits to linear regression whereas DHLA protected degradation kinetics fits to exponential regression analysis. That points to a protection mechanism which builds up over time.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The degradation kinetics of selected anthocyanosides from bilberry extract (0.48 mmolar solution) was investigated over time by HPLC after incubation at pH=7 and 25&#xb0; C. in presence/absence of GSH (0.65 mmolar solution).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">At selected time points the peak area of Delphinidin-3-O-galactoside (very susceptible to degradation), Petunidin-3-O-galactoside (medium susceptibility) and Cyanidin-3-O-galactoside (rather stable) was checked by HPLC (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>). Stabilizing properties were observed in presence of GSH, again better fitted by exponential regression analysis. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the protection mechanism is different from co-pigmentation and involves a mechanism where the protective effect is built up over time.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Cyanidn-3-O-Galactoside (0.001 molar solution) was dissolved at pH=3.1 or pH=7.0 each with/without DHLA (1.44 mmolar solution). Replicate incubations were followed at 25&#xb0; C. over 3 days by HPLC.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the effect of DHLA is surprisingly long-lasting. After 3 days at pH=7.0 at 25&#xb0; C. about 47% of Cyanidn-3-O-Galactoside was recovered in presence of DHLA, whereas the unprotected sample yielded almost 0% of cyanidin-3-O-galactoside. Comparative figures for pH=3.1 were 95% and 61%, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The degradation kinetics of anthocyanosides from bilberry extract (0.48 mmolar solution) was investigated in presence/absence of protecting DHLA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) (1.44 mmolar solution) and GSH (0.65 mmolar solution) by HPLC (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The focus of the evaluation was whether the basic anthocyanidin skeleton is involved with the protection effect to some degree. When looking at the results obtained, it seemed plausible that the protection effect of thiol-compounds was inversely correlated with the susceptibility of unprotected degradation. The more susceptible the anthocyanidin skeleton was, the better was the protective effect of GSH or DHLA. A slightly better absolute effect for GSH was been observed.</p>

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As noted in the table above, there is evidence for a structure related effect of (a) degradation and (b) for a protective mechanism. First, the number of substitutions about the anthocyanin plays a role, and, second, within the same number of substitutions the presence of methoxy-groups influences the stability.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The most susceptible anthocyanidin is delphinidin, bearing 3 hydroxyl-groups at the B-ring. The most stable is peonidin, bearing 1 hydroxyl-group and 1 methoxy-group (superior to 2 hydroxyl-groups as in cyaniding).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The proposed newly discovered mechanism is believe to be related to the stabilization of the flavylium cation at pH=7.0. All compounds tested do bear carboxylic acid groups and free thiol-groups.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Cysteine has two anchor points with anthocyanosides. First, there is a strong interaction of the thiol-portion (probably tightly associated with the anthocyanidin at position 4 or even to the sugar part) and, second, the carboxylic acid function protects the cationic part.</p>

</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">A similar mechanism is proposed for DHLA. The presence of thiol groups is believed to anchor DHLA to the anthocyanidin so that the carboxylic function can help protect the molecule. Possibly, an increased effect of DHLA compared to cysteine might be allocated to a more stable &#x201c;association&#x201d; of two thiol groups when compared to the single thiol found in cysteine.</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The mechanism is considered to be related to a reaction cascade of the flavylium cation while serving as radical scavenger.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The redox potential of 2 R&#x2014;SH/R&#x2014;SS&#x2014;R compounds tested is lower than that of anthocyanosides. For example 2 GSH/GSSG=&#x2dc;&#x2212;0.22 V whereas the redox potential A-OH/A=O=&#x2dc;0.20-0.75 V (see below).</p>

Quinone-/Semiquinone structure (colored products, examples).
</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The stability of these (semi)quinines is believed to be related to the substitution pattern, as the quinone structure requires a 4&#x2032;-substitution. Once the quinone is formed, reversal of the reaction to the flavylium structure is less feasible. On the other hand, any substitution on 5&#x2032;-position hinders the formation of the semiquinone.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">That may explain why a 3&#x2032;-OH and 4&#x2032;-methoxy substituted structure appear to be most stable: It forms a semiquinone that cannot be attacked by water forming colorless products. Such a semiquinone may be more or less easily re-converted to the flavylium cation.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Anthocyanidins/Anthocyanosides (A-OH) are converted to semiquinones/quinones (A=O) by following reaction:

</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Such a mechanism would point to a 1:1 consumption in a way that 2 molecules anthocyanosides are able to form 1 molecule R&#x2014;SS&#x2014;R from 2 molecules R&#x2014;SH and are left as semiquinones. Alternatively 1 anthocyanoside molecule may form 1R&#x2014;SS&#x2014;R by being converted to the quinone.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">If no alternative reactions are taking place, following reaction cascade is reasonable:</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In a combination of R&#x2014;SH and anthocyanosides at neutral pH, primarily R&#x2014;SH is converted to R&#x2014;S&#xb0;.</p>

<p id="p-0144" num="0143">At pH=7, A=O is reconverted to A-OH by consumption of R&#x2014;SH and will then eventually degrade gradually as known.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Suitable examples of stabilizing compounds include yeast extract, dihydrolipoic acid, salts of dihydrolipoic acid such as amino acid salts, cysteine, derivatives of cysteine, such as N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, salts of glutathione, SH-proteinase such as papain, bromelain, ficin, ehymopapain and mixtures thereof, SH-metalloproteinases, peptides containing cysteine, peptides containing glutathioine, fermented oyster extract, fermented bean curd, thiolated chitosans, thiolated gelatins or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In one aspect, the mole ratio of stabilizing compound to anthocyanin extract is between about 0.1 to about 10, more particularly between about 0.5 to about 5 and even more particularly about 1 to about 1.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In another aspect, the stabilized anthocyanin extract composition is stabile toward degradation when exposed to an aqueous environment with a pH of about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, etc. through about 14, for example, a pH of 7 or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In still another aspect, the stabilized anthocyanin extract is an anthocyanoside.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In still yet another aspect, the stabilized anthocyanin extract is an anthocyanidin.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In still other aspects of the invention, the stabilized anthocyanin extract includes one or more anthocyanosides that are glycosidse of perlargonidin, peonidin, cyanidin, malvidin, petunidin, delphinidin.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The present invention also pertains to methods of preparing the stabilized anthocyanin compositions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The present invention provides that the stabilizing compound(s) can be admixed with the anthocyanin containing plant material during the extraction and/or manufacturing process, thereby reducing or eliminating the oxidative destruction of the anthocyanin that commonly occurs upon processing and even upon storage. For example one or more of the stabilizing compounds in the ratios generally described herein can be added into the extraction medium (solvent) during the extraction process as disclosed in US Patent Publication 2002/0018821, published Feb. 14, 2002 by Chrystele Soulier et al., the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Typically, the anthocyanin extract is mixed directly with the stabilizing compound. This can be accomplished by simply mixing, grinding, combining, etc. the two materials as solids or by dissolution in a solvent, such as water. Additional additives, such as carriers, vitamins, antioxidants, etc., as described herein below, can be added to the mixture by conventional methods.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In one embodiment, a red fruit extract containing anthocyanosides, is taken up in an aqueous solution and optionally treated with an &#x2014;SH stabilizing compound as described herein. The aqueous extract is cooled until it reaches a homogeneous temperature of less than 15&#xb0; C. The aqueous extract is filtered and is optionally treated with an &#x2014;SH stabilizing compound as described herein, the permeate obtained is recovered and loaded onto a macrocrosslinked polymeric resin. The resin is then rinsed with demineralized water, optionally treated with an &#x2014;SH stabilizing compound as described herein and then the resin obtained is eluted with an alcoholic eluting solution, which may optionally be treated with an &#x2014;SH stabilizing compound as described herein. The eluate obtained is concentrated, optionally treated with an &#x2014;SH stabilizing compound as described herein and then dried.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In another embodiment, the process of stabilization is carried out on an alcoholic red fruit extract obtained according to the following process. The pulp is first separated from the whole red fruit and the pulp is then brought into contact with an alcoholic extraction solution which can optionally contain an &#x2014;SH stabilizing compound as described herein. The solid phase is separated from the liquid phase and the liquid phase can be optionally treated with an &#x2014;SH stabilizing compound as described herein. The major portion of the residual alcohol contained in the liquid phase is evaporated under vacuum so as to obtain an alcoholic concentrate.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Advantageously, the solvent used for the alcoholic extraction is chosen from the group comprising methanol, ethanol, butanol and acetone.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In practice, the alcoholic extraction is carried out at room temperature in at least two successive steps, each lasting 20 minutes. The solvent is then evaporated off. In addition, it is also possible to carry out the extraction of the anthocyanosides not from the pulp alone, but from whole fruits.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">According to the invention, the process of stabilization can be carried out starting with extracts of fruits which are commercially available or with prepurified anthocyanoside extract, each provided in liquid or powdered form. In this case, the fruit extract or the prepurified extract can then be taken up, before the purification step, either with alcohol, in particular methanol, or with water and treated with an &#x2014;SH stabilizing compound as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In the process of purification of the invention, the cooling of the red fruit extract is advantageously carried out until the temperature of the extract is homogeneous and less than 10&#xb0; C., in particular, less than 5&#xb0; C., with the temperature being maintained for at least about twelve hours.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">With regard to the step of filtration of the aqueous extract or alcoholic extract, it may be carried out on a cellulose filter or a stainless steel gauze with a cut-off of between 0 and 100 micrometers or equivalent.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In order to further increase the titer and the concentration of stabilized anthocyanosides in the final extract, the alcoholic solution with which the stabilized anthocyanosides are eluted from the resin is an aqueous solution of ethanol whose ethanol concentration is between 10 and 90%, advantageously close to 40%.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The stabilized eluate obtained is concentrated at a controlled temperature in the region of 30&#xb0; C. and then freeze-dried or spray-dried so as to obtain a stabilized powder.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In one embodiment, for example, a concentrate of bilberry extract and L-cysteine hydrochloride are combined (9:1, w/w) and spray dried to afford a stabilized bilberry extract as a powder. In general, the bilberry extract to free cysteine ratio is approximately 10:1, w/w.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The present invention further pertains to methods of treatment of various ailments by administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the stabilized anthocyanin compositions described herein. Ailments include, the need for increased antioxidant capacity, arthrosclerosis, reduction of pain, inflammation. Reduction or the elimination of pain includes various forms of pain including arthritis, dysmenorrheal, headaches, joint pain, muscular pain, osteoarthritis, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts, retinopathy, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Therefore, the present invention further provides bioavailable stabilized anthocyanin compositions that are useful to treat various afflictions noted herein. The stabilized anthocyanin compositions can be administered by a number of methods, as discussed infra.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Surprisingly, the present invention provides that use of cysteine in combination with an anthocyanin composition (whether it be an anthocyanidine or an anthocyanoside) helps to increase the delivery of the anthocyanin to a subject in need thereof by at least twice the amount relative to a subject that ingests an anthocyanin composition without the presence of cysteine. It has been surprisingly found that plasma concentration levels of the anthocyanin where the anthocyanin is delivered in the presence of cysteine after 4 hours is at least twice the plasma concentration of an anthocyanin delivered without the cysteine. Therefore, the present invention provides a method to increase the amount of bioavailable anthocyanin in a subject by administering to the subject an effective amount of an anthocyanin and cysteine. The administration can be by any means, but oral delivery is generally preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In one embodiment, the ratio of the anthocyanin to the cysteine is about 10 to about 0.1, more particularly between about 10 to about 0.5, and even more particularly between about 10 to about lon a weight basis. It is important to note that without the use of cysteine, the bioavailability of the anthocyanin is dramatically decreased as noted in the examples described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The increased bioavailability an anthocyanin in the presence of cysteine is generally at least twice that the bioavailability of an anthocyanin alone after administration. Ideally, the bioavailability is increased by the inclusion of cysteine such that the bioavailability increases to 3, 4, 5, 10 and 20 times more than equivalent anthocyanins without the inclusion of cysteine. This is a surprising find.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The compositions of the invention can be incorporated into various foods, drinks, snacks, etc. In one aspect, the composition can be sprinkled onto a food product, prior to consumption. If sprinkled onto a food product, a suitable carrier such as starch, sucrose or lactose, can be used to help distribute the concentration of the stabilized anthocyanin composition making it easier to apply to the food product.</p>

<p id="p-0309" num="0309">Sample a) 60 mg bilberry extract [37% anthocyanosides] (0.048 mmol anthocyanosides expressed as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside) were added to a 100 ml flask and filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0), and stirred until dissolution was complete. A 1 ml sample was taken immediately and acidified with formic acid to pH=1.0 and analyzed by HPLC for the content of anthocyanosides (Fresh Sample). The remaining solution was kept for 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. (water bath) with stirring. Thereafter another sample (Blank sample), representing unprotected degradation, was taken and acidified.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0310">Sample b) 20 mg reduced L-glutathione (0.065 mmol) were added to a 100 ml flask with 60 ml sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and stirred until dissolution was complete. 60 mg bilberry extract [37% anthocyanosides] (0.048 mmol expressed as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside) were then added and the flask was filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and kept for 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. (water bath) with stirring.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0311">Sample c) 30 mg dihydrolipoic acid (0.144 mmol) were added to a 100 ml flask with 60 ml sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and stirred until dissolution was complete. 60 mg bilberry extract [37% anthocyanosides] (0.048 mmol expressed as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside) were then added and the flask was filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and kept for 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. (water bath) with stirring.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0312">After 4 hours, samples were taken and acidified immediately with formic acid to pH=1.0 and analyzed by HPLC for the content of anthocyanosides. Degradation is expressed as decrease in peak area of individual peaks (calculated as % left after 4 hours).</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0313">From the table below it was concluded that anthocyanosides are substantially more stable at pH=7.0 at 37&#xb0; C. in presence of either DHLA or GSH when compared to blank (unprotected) samples. After 4 hours, the blank sample showed that about 25% of residual anthocyanosides were observed whereas the protected samples yielded more than 60% residual anthocyanosides. The protective efficacy of 30 mg DHLA is comparable to 20 mg GSH. The protective efficacy seems to be related to the basic anthocyanin-skeleton exemplified by delphinidin glycosides which are less well protected when compared to cyanidin glycosides. For each individual anthocyanoside tested, a protective effect, e.g. more residual anthocyanosides when compared to blank samples, was observed.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0316" num="0316">Sample a) 60 mg bilberry extract [37% anthocyanosides] (0.048 mmol expressed as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside) were added to a 100 ml, filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and stirred until dissolution was complete. A 1 ml sample was immediately taken and acidified with formic acid to pH=1.0 and analyzed by HPLC for the content of anthocyanosides. The remaining solution was kept at 37&#xb0; C. (water bath) with stirring and additional 1 ml samples (Blank Samples), representing unprotected degradation, were sampled every 15 minutes. The samples were analyzed for selected anthocyanosides by HPLC.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0317">Sample b) 20 mg reduced L-glutathione (0.065 mmol) were added to a 100 ml flask with 60 ml sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and stirred until dissolution was complete. 60 mg bilberry extract [37% anthocyanosides] (0.048 mmol expressed as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside) were added and the flask was filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and kept at 37&#xb0; C.

The protective activity started immediately after dissolution and lasts for at least 4 hours as indicated by the comparative decay of the selected anthocyanosides over time. Again, the protective effect is believed to be related to the anthocyanin-skeleton exemplified by 65% residual delphinidin-3-O-Galactose, 67% residual petunidin-3-O-Galactose and 77% residual cyanidin-3-O-galactose after incubation for 4 h 30 min.

Samples were prepared as outlined below in HPLC Analytical Method. Test stability samples were immediately acidified (to block degradation) and injected undiluted following the detailed description provided below.
</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0322" num="0322">Sample a) 60 mg black currant extract [35% anthocyanosides] (0.037 mmol anthocyanosides expressed as cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside) were added to a 100 ml flask and filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and stirred until dissolution was complete. A 1 ml sample was taken immediately, acidified with formic acid to pH=1.0 and analyzed by HPLC for the content of anthocyanosides (Fresh Sample). The remaining solution was kept for 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. (water bath) with stirring. Thereafter samples (Blank sample), representing unprotected degradation, were taken and acidified.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0323">Sample b) 20 mg reduced L-glutathione (0.065 mmol) were added to a 100 ml flask with 60 ml sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and stirred until dissolution was complete. 60 mg black currant extract [35% anthocyanosides] (0.037 mmol anthocyanosides expressed as cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside) were then added and the flask was filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and kept for 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. (water bath) with stirring.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0324">Sample c) 20 mg dihydrolipoic acid (0.096 mmol) were added to a 100 ml flask with 60 ml sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and stirred until dissolution was completed. 60 mg black currant extract [35% anthocyanosides] (0.037 mmol anthocyanosides expressed as cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside) were added to the flask, filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and kept for 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. (water bath) with stirring.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0325">Sample d) 20 mg L-cysteine acid (0.165 mmol) were added to a 100 ml flask with 60 ml sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and stirred until dissolution was complete. 60 mg black currant extract [35% anthocyanosides] (0.037 mmol anthocyanosides expressed as cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside) were added to the flask, filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and kept for 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. (water bath) with stirring.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0326">After 4 hours samples were taken, acidified immediately with formic acid to pH=1.0 and analyzed by HPLC for the content of anthocyanosides. Degradation is expressed as decrease in peak area of individual peaks (calculated as % left after 4 hours).</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0327">From the table below it was determined that anthocyanosides are substantially more stable at pH=7.0 and 37&#xb0; C. in presence of DHLA, GSH or L-cysteine when compared to blank samples. After 4 hours, in the blank sample between 9.5-33.4% of residual anthocyanosides were observed whereas the GSH protected samples yielded 50.4-65.0% residual anthocyanosides. Comparative figures for DHLA were 36.7-38.9%. For each individual anthocyanosides tested a protective effect, e.g. more residual anthocyanosides when compared to blank samples, was observed.</p>

<p id="p-0339" num="0339">Samples were prepared as outlined below in HPLC Analytical Method. Test stability samples were immediately acidified (to block degradation) and injected undiluted following the detailed description provided below.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0340" num="0340">Sample a) 60 mg black currant extract [35% anthocyanosides] (0.037 mmol anthocyanosides expressed as cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside) were added to a 100 ml flask, filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and stirred until dissolution was complete. A 1 ml sample was taken immediately, acidified with formic acid to pH=1.0 and analyzed by HPLC for the content of anthocyanosides. The remaining solution was kept at 37&#xb0; C. (water bath) with stirring and 1 ml samples (Blank Samples), representing unprotected degradation, were taken every 15 minutes. The samples were analyzed for selected anthocyanosides by HPLC.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0341">Sample b) 20 mg reduced L-glutathione (0.065 mmol) were added to a 100 ml flask with 60 ml sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and stirred until dissolution was complete. 60 mg black currant extract [35% anthocyanosides] (0.037 mmol anthocyanosides expressed as cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside) were added, the flask was filled to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0) and kept for at 37&#xb0; C. (water bath) with stirring. Every 15 minutes 1 ml samples were taken and analyzed for selected anthocyanosides by HPLC.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0342">From the tables below it could was determined that anthocyanosides are substantially more stable at pH=7.0 and 37&#xb0; C. in presence of GSH when compared to blank samples. The protective activity starts immediately after dissolution and lasts for at least 4 hours as indicated by the comparative decay of the anthocyanosides over time. The protection efficacy may be dependent on the anthocyanin-skeleton, exemplified by the improved protection of cyanidin-glycosides when compared to delphinidin-glycosides. However, when comparing the blank to the protected sample, delphinidin-glycosides were substantially better protected than cyaniding-glycosides.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0343">For each individual anthocyanosides tested a protective effect, e.g. more residual anthocyanosides when compared to blank samples, was observed.</p>

<p id="p-0352" num="0352">From the table below it was determined that GSH did not protect well the free anthocyanin skeleton. The molar ratio between GSH and delphinidin or malvidin is higher than 2:1 indicating that the lack of activity is not related to a low concentration of GSH. The decay of the free anthocyanin is almost unaffected by the presence of GSH which is in contrast to the observations using anthocyanin-glycosides bearing the same skeleton.</p>

<p id="p-0361" num="0361">The protection effect is a parameter that is calculated by dividing the residual ratio of the protected sample by the residual ratio of a blank sample (with bilberry extract at selected pH values without reduced glutathione). The difference thus demonstrates the effect of reduced L-glutathione (GSH) of the stability of anthocyanins of bilberry extract over a pH range of between about 3 and about 11.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0362">It was noted that when the pH value increased, the degradation of the extract increased. In all pH values tested, the L-glutathione (GSH) protected the anthocyanins. Additionally, the Protection Effect increased with pH values. In alkaline environments, the GSH had a greater stabilizing effect as seen in the table above and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 8</heading>
<p id="p-0363" num="0363">Sample a) 60 mg GSH (0.192 mmol) were placed into a 100 ml flask, dissolved and filled up to volume with sodium phosphate buffer (5% [w/w], pH=7.0). The sample was kept with stirring at 37&#xb0; C. Samples were taken immediately after dissolution and after 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours of incubation. The samples were analyzed by HPLC for GSH and GSSG (representing the oxidized form of GSH).</p>

<p id="p-0365" num="0365">From the tables below it was determined that GSH was oxidized to GSSG in aqueous buffer solution (pH=7.0) at 37&#xb0; C. Addition of bilberry extract accelerated the oxidation of GSH to GSSG by a factor about 2 to about 3 suggesting that bilberry extract serves as partner for a redox reaction. Based on this result it was evident that the couple GSH/GSSG has a considerably low redox potential yielding oxidized GSSG and reduced anthocyanosides.</p>

<p id="p-0369" num="0369">Stability of Black Currant Extract</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0370">120 mg black currant extract/100 ml solution were incubated with 30 mg glutathione (GSH)/100 ml in buffered solution (pH=7.0) as the incubation medium used for CaCo-2 absorption tests.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0371">These investigations provide information on the stability/degradation of selected black currant lead-anthocyanosides in analytical solutions and in the incubation medium used for the CaCo-2 test in presence of glutathione.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0372">Delphindin-3-O-glucoside, (Dp-Glc), Delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside (Dp-Rut) and Cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside (Cn-Rut) were chosen for analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0373">These investigations showed that both delphinidin-glycosides investigated were more susceptible to degradation than cyanidin-rutinoside. Dp-glc was more susceptible than Dp-rut under the given conditions. All anthocyanosides investigated were slightly more stable in incubation medium resembling the ileal fluid than the buffered solution (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>). Most likely, the increase in stability is caused by the presence of putatively stabilizing ingredients in the complex medium (eventually re-cycling glutathione).</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0374">CaCo-2 cells were incubated with 120 mg black currant extract and 30 mg glutathione/100 ml medium at 37&#xb0; C. for up to 2 hours. At 30, 60 and 120 minutes, 3 wells were processed for analysis by collection of the incubation medium and extraction of the anthocyanosides absorbed into the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0375">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, all 3 anthocyanosides investigated were absorbed into CaCo-2 cells. The highest absorption was observed for Cn-Rut after 60 minutes of incubation. At this time point the recovery of anthocyanosides in CaCo-2 cells amounts to 2.5% of the concentration determined in the supernatant incubation medium. Most interestingly, the % uptake resembles the stability of the anthocyanosides in buffered medium and incubation medium (without cells). It was further observed that for all anthocyanosides the maximum absorption is seen after 60 minutes of incubation.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0376">60 mg bilberry extract&#xb1;30 mg glutathione/100 ml cell-free incubation media were held at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. Samples were analyzed prior or after the incubation period for 15 anthocyanosides present in bilberry extract.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0377">This investigation provided information on the basic stability of the anthocyanosides in incubation medium (pH=7.0) at the conditions applied during CaCo-2 testing. Secondly, the effect of glutathione on the stability is elucidated.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0378">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, all anthocyanosides were stabilized by glutathione. The most pronounced stabilization was observed for Dp-glycosides. This is of importance because Dp-glycosides are the most susceptible bilberry glucosides in terms of degradation at pH=7.0. From this analytical investigation it was determined that glutathione protects anthocyanosides from degradation at pH=7.0. Moreover it is noted that glutathione protects all anthocyanidin-structures present in bilberry.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0379">A detailed analysis of the protection reveals that a tendency between protective potency and chemical structure of anthocyanidin exists. Dp, the most susceptible structure, is stabilized to the greatest extent whereas the protective effect for the most stable structure (Cn) is comparably low. In summary all anthocyanosides studied degraded less than 25% at pH=7.0 during 1 hour at 37&#xb0; C. in presence of glutathione.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0380">CaCo-2 cells were incubated with 60 mg bilberry extract with/without 30 mg glutathione/100 m medium at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. Thereafter 3 wells were processed for analysis by collection of the incubation medium and extraction of the anthocyanosides absorbed into the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0381">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, all bilberry anthocyanosides studied were better absorbed in presence of glutathione. This points to a correlation of an increased absorption with the stabilization of anthocyanosides with glutathione. The most likely explanation is that the degree of absorption of anthocyanosides is dependent on the concentration of intact anthocyanosides in the incubation media. In other words, the absorption of anthocyanosides may be dependent on a concentration gradient between the outer and the inside of the cells (the higher concentration outside, the higher the absorption). As glutathione was shown to increase the stability of anthocyanosides outside the cells, absorption into the cells follows the theory proposed.</p>

<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 12</heading>
<p id="p-0446" num="0447">Product (Bilberry extract, Omnica GmbH (Hamburg) was adjusted to 37% (m/m) anthocyanosides. Based on an average content of 0.3-0.4% (m/m) of anthocyanosides in fresh bilberries, the extract at hand represented a 100:1 concentrate. The remaining 63% of the extract are represented in the majority by proteins and carbohydrates occurring in fresh berries. 500 mg bilberry extract and 500 mg bilberry extract with 50 mg L-Cysteine were combined to produce the bilberry/cysteine combo utilized below. Bilberry extract noted below is the product described above without the addition of cysteine.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0448">12 volunteers received bilberry extract for 7 consecutive days. After a 1 week wash-out period the same volunteers received Bilberry/Cysteine combo for 7 consecutive days.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0449">The design was a randomized, cross-over observation.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0450">Plasma samples were taken during each period on day 1 (prior to and 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 4 hours after treatment), 4 (prior to and 0.5 hours after treatment) and 7 ((prior to and 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 4 hours after treatment) of the corresponding treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0451">The main target of the study was to determine the plasma levels of the anthocyanins present in both formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0452">In a first run of analysis, all anthocyanins present in plasma were extracted by solid phase extraction and after collection hydrolyzed to yield the anthocyanidins. This procedure was chosen to provide information on the real absorption of bilberry anthocyanins from both formulations and to avoid erroneous conclusions due to metabolism of the compounds absorbed. Each metabolite (i.e. glucuronides) would not count as absorbed from the formulations although the efficacy resides in the anthocyanidin skeleton and not in a specific glycosidation pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0453">The analysis comprised HPLC with UV-detection at 540 nm. Quantification was based on external standardization with authentic anthocyanidin standards. The recovery of the method was estimated with delphinidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. These two bilberry anthocyanins were spiked to blank plasma, extracted and hydrolyzed in the same way as the study samples. It was shown that the recovery is &#x3e;95%. The stability of the study samples was confirmed by spiked blank plasma samples treated and stored exactly the same ways as the study samples.</p>
