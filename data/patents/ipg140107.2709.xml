<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to the treatment of viral infection and associated conditions, and more particularly to the treatment of retroviral infection and associated conditions, such as HIV infection and AIDS.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Retroviruses are small enveloped viruses that contain a diploid, single-stranded RNA genome, and replicate via a DNA intermediate produced by a virally-encoded reverse transcriptase, an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. Retroviruses include, for example, oncogenic viruses such as human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV-I, -II, -III), and feline leukemia virus as well as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2). HIV-1 is a member of the lentivirus family of retroviruses which contains a single-stranded RNA genome and is considered the major etiological agent involved in the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that as of the end of 2007 over 42 million people worldwide are infected and this number is growing. A great deal of effort to develop drugs against HIV has been centered around HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), HIV protease, and more recently viral entry.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous gene therapy clinical trials for the treatment of AIDS have been undertaken yielding mostly disappointing results, both in terms of viral load and of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells counts (Rossi, J. J., et al., 2007<i>. Nat Biotechnol </i>25:1444-54). In particular, while it is desirable that transgene-expressing cells survive and proliferate in the recipient patients, the opposite is often seen. For instance, following gene transfer of an anti-HIV ribozyme in hematopoietic stem cells, a 5-fold reduction in expression of the ribozyme was observed within 6 months (Mitsuyasu, R. T. et al., 2009<i>. Nat Med </i>15:285-92). Rapid elimination of productively HIV-1-infected lymphocytes is well-known (Coffin, J. M., 1995<i>. Science </i>267:483-9.) and results from the action of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and also from virus-related apoptosis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">None of the current AIDS treatments have proven to be totally effective in treating and/or reversing the disease. In addition, many of the compounds currently used to treat AIDS cause adverse side effects including low platelet count, renal toxicity and bone marrow cytopenia.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there continues to be a significant need for new therapeutic strategies for retroviral infections such as HIV infection and associated conditions such as AIDS.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Described herein are mutant or modified forms of TRIM5&#x3b1;, and uses thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">TRIM (tripartite motif) proteins form a family of dozens of members, most of them comprising a RING domain (spanning about residues 15-59 in human TRIM5&#x3b1;), a B-box domain (spanning about residues 90-132 in human TRIM5&#x3b1;) and a Coiled-coil domain (spanning about residues 130-241 in human TRIM5&#x3b1;), collectively referred to as RBCC domains. In addition to the RBCC motif, TRIM5&#x3b1; contains a C-terminal B30.2 (also called SPRY or PRYSPRY) domain spanning about residues 281-493 in human TRIM5&#x3b1;, the most variable domain of the protein (it contains 4 highly variable regions labeled v1 to v4, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), that play a role in restriction specificity (Perez-Caballero et al., 2005<i>. J Virol </i>79:8969-78). TRIM5&#x3b1; was isolated in 2004 as the factor governing the resistance of rhesus macaque monkeys to transduction by HIV-1 vectors. Restriction by TRIM5&#x3b1; is initiated by physical recognition of incoming retroviruses by TRIM5&#x3b1; proteins (Sebastian, S., and J. Luban. 2005<i>. Retrovirology </i>2:40; Stremlau, M., et al., 2006<i>. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>103:5514-9), which occurs within the first hours following virus entry (Perez-Caballero, D., et al., 2005<i>. J Virol </i>79:15567-72) and involves determinants present in the N-terminal domain of the capsid proteins which constitute the retroviral outer core structure (Hatziioannou, T., et al., 2004<i>. J Viro/</i>78:6005-12; Ikeda, Y., et al., 2004<i>. J Virol </i>78:11816-22; Owens, C. M., et al., 2004<i>. J Virol </i>78:5423-37). Following this initial contact, progression of the retroviral life cycle is impeded through several mechanisms. TRIM5&#x3b1;interferes with the uncoating process of retroviruses, thus preventing successful reverse transcription and transport to the nucleus of the viral genome. The proteasome is also involved and causes a decrease in retroviral cDNA accumulation in acutely infected cells (Anderson, J. L. et al., 2006<i>. J Virol </i>80:9754-60). TRIM5&#x3b1; proteins can seemingly self-ubiquitinate (Diaz-Griffero, F. et al., 2006<i>. Virology </i>349:300-15; Yamauchi, K., et al., 2008<i>. FEBS J </i>275:1540-55) and are rapidly degraded by the proteasome upon exposure to a restriction-sensitive virus (Rold, C. J., and C. Aiken. 2008. PLoS Pathog 4: e1000074). Lastly, TRIM5&#x3b1; interferes with the transport of post-entry retroviral complexes toward the nucleus, and this antiviral activity is independent from the one involving the proteasome (Campbell, E. M. et al., 2008<i>. J Cell Biol </i>180:549-61; Wu, X., et al., 2006<i>. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>103:7465-70).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Correspondence of amino acid positions described herein is frequently expressed in terms of the positions of the amino acids of the form of wild-type (or native) human TRIM5&#x3b1; set forth in SEQ ID NO: 24 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>). For example, the positions correspond to one or more of the amino acid arginine (Arg or R) set forth at positions 332 and 335 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, or the amino acid glycine set forth at position 330 in SEQ ID NO: 24 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>). A &#x201c;mutant&#x201d; or &#x201c;modified&#x201d; TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide as used herein refers to a polypeptide having TRIM5&#x3b1; activity, i.e., capable of recognizing motifs within the capsid proteins of retroviruses and interfering with viral replication (e.g., by interference with the uncoating process, modulation of proteasome-mediated degradation, and/or interference with the transport of post-entry retroviral complexes toward the nucleus), the polypeptide having a different amino acid from the wild-type protein at one or more positions, for example at position(s) 324, 328, 330, 333, 335, 336 and/or 337, as described more fully in the specification, in relation to the wild-type protein of SEQ ID NO: 24 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>). Therefore, amino acid numbering can be shifted in situations where the residues corresponding to the wild-type arginine residues noted herein are within a polypeptide of the present invention having TRIM5&#x3b1; activity, the polypeptide having for example more or fewer amino acids N-terminal to the region where these residues reside, relative to the wild-type, thereby resulting in different amino acid numbering relative to the positions of wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1;. As such, a position(s) within a polypeptide of the present invention may correspond to the wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1; arginine positions noted herein, but have different position numbers relative to the wild-type depending on their location within the polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The present inventors have shown that mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptides comprising a mutation at a residue corresponding to residue 324, 328, 330, 333, 335, 336 and/or 337 of the native human TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide inhibit lentivirus replication.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a TRIM5&#x3b1; mutant polypeptide, in which the amino acid residue corresponding to lysine (Lys or K) at position 324, isoleucine (Ile or I) at position 328, glycine (Gly or G) at position 330, glycine (Gly or G) at position 333, arginine (Arg or R) at position 335, tyrosine (Tyr or Y) at position 336 and/or glutamine (Gln or Q) at position 337 in SEQ ID NO: 24 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>) has been altered compared with wild-type/native human TRIM5&#x3b1;.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In another embodiment, the TRIM5&#x3b1; mutant polypeptide further comprises a further mutation, i.e. in which the amino acid residue corresponding to arginine (Arg or R) at position 332 in SEQ ID NO: 24 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>) has been altered compared with wild-type/native human TRIM5&#x3b1;. In an embodiment, the above-mentioned TRIM5&#x3b1; mutant polypeptide comprises an arginine to glycine (R332G) substitution.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a further embodiment, the above-mentioned TRIM5&#x3b1; mutant polypeptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>).</p>

In another embodiment, the mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide comprises a glycine to glutamic acid substitution at position 330 and arginine to glycine substitution at positions 332 and 335 (G330E/R332G/R335G).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The invention further provides a variant or fragment of the above-noted mutant TRIM5&#x3b1;polypeptide (e.g., a truncated form of the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide, a fusion or chimeric polypeptide comprising the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide, etc.), the variant or fragment comprising the above-noted mutations at positions corresponding to positions 324, 328, 330, 333, 335, 336 and/or 337, or at positions 335 and 332, noted above, the variant or fragment further having an activity similar to that of the above-noted mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide. Such a variant may for example be substantially identical to a polypeptide described herein (e.g., any of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, <b>6</b>D or <b>6</b>E).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptides of the present invention may also be in the form of a fusion protein comprising a polypeptide described herein having TRIM5&#x3b1; activity or a variant or fragment thereof and a further polypeptide sequence, for example incorporating a tag which may for example facilitate purification or detection of the mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide (e.g., a His<sub>6</sub>-tag, a FLAG tag or a GST-tag).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In an embodiment, the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide confers a higher/better resistance to lentivirus infection (e.g., shows higher inhibition of lentivirus replication) as compared to wild-type/native human TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide. In an embodiment, the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide confers a resistance to lentivirus infection that is at least about 2-fold higher, in further embodiments at least about 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold or 25-fold higher, relative to wild-type/native human TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide. In an embodiment, the above-mentioned resistance to lentivirus infection is measured using the assay described below.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In a further aspect, the present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding any of the above-mentioned polypeptides, or a homolog, fragment or variant thereof. The nucleic acid of the present invention includes those sequences that, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, encode the amino acid sequence of any of the TRIM5&#x3b1; mutant polypeptide described herein (e.g., any of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, <b>6</b>D or <b>6</b>E).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Mutagenesis can be performed utilizing any one of several techniques known to those of skill in the art (see for example, Jeff Braman, in In Vitro Mutagenesis Protocols, 2<sup>nd </sup>edition (2002), Humana Press, 304 pages), for example using an overlap extension PCR technique, as described below (see also Ho, S, N. et al., 1989. Gene 77:51-9). Moreover, kits for site-directed mutagenesis are commercially available, such as Quickchange&#x2122; Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from STRATAGENE&#xae;, GeneTailor&#x2122; Site-Directed Mutagenesis System from INVITROGEN&#xae;, Altered Sites&#x2122; in vitro Mutagenesis System from PROMEGA&#xae;. Also, the mutagenesis may be performed randomly, for example using a commercially available kit (Diversify&#x2122; PCR Random Mutagenesis kit, CLONTECH&#xae;), followed by a selection of the mutants have the desired activity, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The term &#x201c;TRIM5&#x3b1; activity&#x201d; as used herein refers to, for example, the reduction of retrovirus (e.g., lentivirus) replication. The activity of the mutant form of TRIM5&#x3b1; may for example be assessed in vitro by determining the replication of a given retrovirus in cells comprising/expressing the mutant, for example using the assay described in the examples below.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In another aspect of the invention, an isolated nucleic acid, for example a nucleic acid sequence encoding the above-mentioned TRIM5&#x3b1; mutant, or homolog, fragment or variant thereof, may further be incorporated into a vector, such as a recombinant expression vector (e.g., a eukaryotic expression vector, a viral expression vector). In an embodiment, the vector comprises transcriptional regulatory sequences or a promoter operably-linked to a nucleic acid comprising a sequence capable of encoding a mutant polypeptide of the invention. A first nucleic acid sequence is &#x201c;operably-linked&#x201d; with a second nucleic acid sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is placed in a functional relationship with the second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably-linked to a coding sequence if the promoter affects the transcription or expression of the coding sequence. Generally, operably-linked DNA sequences are contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein coding regions, in reading frame. However, since for example enhancers generally function when separated from the promoters by several kilobases and intronic sequences may be of variable lengths, some polynucleotide elements may be operably-linked but not contiguous. &#x201c;Transcriptional regulatory sequences&#x201d; or &#x201c;transcriptional regulatory elements&#x201d; are generic terms that refer to DNA sequences, such as initiation and termination signals, enhancers, and promoters, splicing signals, polyadenylation signals, etc., which induce or control transcription of protein coding sequences with which they are operably-linked.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Various genes and nucleic acid sequences of the invention may be recombinant sequences. Further, polypeptides or proteins of the invention may also be recombinant. The term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; means that something has been recombined, so that when made in reference to a nucleic acid the term refers to a molecule that is comprised of nucleic acid sequences that are joined together or produced by means of molecular biological techniques. The term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; when made in reference to a protein or a polypeptide refers to a protein or polypeptide molecule, which is expressed using a recombinant nucleic acid construct created by means of molecular biological techniques. The term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; when made in reference to a genetic composition refers to a gamete or progeny or cell or genome with new combinations of alleles that did not occur in the parental genomes. Recombinant nucleic acid constructs may include a nucleotide sequence which is ligated to, or is manipulated to become ligated to, a nucleic acid sequence to which it is not ligated in nature, or to which it is ligated at a different location in nature. Referring to a nucleic acid construct as &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; therefore indicates that the nucleic acid molecule has been manipulated using genetic engineering, i.e. by human intervention. Recombinant nucleic acid constructs may for example be introduced into a host cell by transformation. Such recombinant nucleic acid constructs may include sequences derived from the same host cell species or from different host cell species, which have been isolated and reintroduced into cells of the host species. Recombinant nucleic acid construct sequences may become integrated into a host cell genome, either as a result of the original transformation of the host cells, or as the result of subsequent recombination and/or repair events.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In accordance with the present invention, an isolated nucleic acid molecule, is a nucleic acid molecule that has been removed from its natural milieu (i.e., that has been subjected to human manipulation), its natural milieu being the genome or chromosome in which the nucleic acid molecule is found in nature. As such, &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; does not necessarily reflect the extent to which the nucleic acid molecule has been purified, but indicates that the molecule does not include an entire genome or an entire chromosome in which the nucleic acid molecule is found in nature. An isolated nucleic acid molecule can also include a specified nucleic acid sequence flanked by (i.e., at the 5&#x2032; and/or the 3&#x2032; end of the sequence) additional nucleic acids that do not normally flank the specified nucleic acid sequence in nature (i.e., heterologous sequences). Isolated nucleic acid molecules can include DNA, RNA (e.g., mRNA), or derivatives of either DNA or RNA (e.g., cDNA). Although the phrase &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; primarily refers to the physical nucleic acid molecule and the phrase &#x201c;nucleic acid sequence&#x201d; primarily refers to the sequence of nucleotides on the nucleic acid molecule, the two phrases can be used interchangeably, especially with respect to a nucleic acid molecule, or a nucleic acid sequence, being capable of encoding a protein. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention is produced using recombinant DNA technology (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, cloning) or chemical synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">&#x201c;Homology&#x201d; and &#x201c;homologous&#x201d; refers to sequence similarity between two polypeptides or two nucleic acid molecules. Homology can be determined by comparing each position in the aligned sequences. A degree of homology between nucleic acid or between amino acid sequences is a function of the number of identical or matching nucleotides or amino acids at positions shared by the sequences. As the term is used herein, a nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence is &#x201c;homologous&#x201d; to another sequence if the two sequences are substantially identical and the functional activity of the sequences is conserved (as used herein, the term &#x2018;homologous&#x2019; does not infer evolutionary relatedness). Two nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences are considered &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; if, when optimally aligned (with gaps permitted), they share at least about 50% sequence similarity or identity and/or if the sequences share defined functional motifs. In alternative embodiments, sequence similarity in optimally aligned substantially identical sequences may be at least 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% with any of the polypeptide or nucleic acid sequences of the invention. As used herein, a given percentage of homology between sequences denotes the degree of sequence identity in optimally aligned sequences. An &#x201c;unrelated&#x201d; or &#x201c;non-homologous&#x201d; sequence shares less than 40% identity, though preferably less than about 25% identity, with any of the polypeptide or nucleic acid sequences of the invention. &#x201c;Substantially complementary&#x201d; nucleic acids are nucleic acids in which the complement of one molecule is substantially identical to the other molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Optimal alignment of sequences for comparisons of identity may be conducted using a variety of algorithms, such as the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981<i>, Adv. Appl. Math </i>2: 482, the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, 1970<i>, J. Mol. Biol. </i>48: 443, the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, 1988<i>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>85: 2444, and the computerised implementations of these algorithms (such as GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis., U.S.A.). Sequence identity may also be determined using the BLAST algorithm, described in Altschul et al., 1990<i>, J. Mol. Biol. </i>215: 403-10 (using the published default settings). Software for performing BLAST analysis may be available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The BLAST algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence that either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighbourhood word score threshold. Initial neighbourhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Extension of the word hits in each direction is halted when the following parameters are met: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLAST program may use as defaults a word length (W) of 11, the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992<i>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>89: 10915-10919) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10 (or 1 or 0.1 or 0.01 or 0.001 or 0.0001), M=5, N=4, and a comparison of both strands. One measure of the statistical similarity between two sequences using the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. In alternative embodiments of the invention, nucleotide or amino acid sequences are considered substantially identical if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test sequences is less than about 1, preferably less than about 0.1, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">An alternative indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially complementary is that the two sequences hybridize to each other under moderately stringent, or preferably stringent, conditions. Hybridization to filter-bound sequences under moderately stringent conditions may, for example, be performed in 0.5 M NaHPO<sub>4</sub>, 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM EDTA at 65&#xb0; C., and washing in 0.2&#xd7;SSC/0.1% SDS at 42&#xb0; C. (see Ausubel, et al., (eds), 1989, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, Green Publishing Associates, Inc., and John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., New York, at p. 2.10.3). Alternatively, hybridization to filter-bound sequences under stringent conditions may, for example, be performed in 0.5 M NaHPO<sub>4</sub>, 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA at 65&#xb0; C., and washing in 0.1&#xd7;SSC/0.1% SDS at 68&#xb0; C. (see Ausubel, et al., (eds), 1989, supra). Hybridization conditions may be modified in accordance with known methods depending on the sequence of interest (see Tjjssen, 1993, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology&#x2014;Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, Part I, Chapter 2 &#x201c;Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid probe assays&#x201d;, Elsevier, N.Y.). Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5&#xb0; C. lower than the thermal melting point for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The recombinant expression vector of the present invention can be constructed by standard techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art and found, for example, in Sambrook et al. (1989) in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual; and Sambrook and Russell (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (3<sup>rd </sup>edition; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). A variety of strategies are available for ligating fragments of DNA, the choice of which depends on the nature of the termini of the DNA fragments and can be readily determined by persons skilled in the art. The vectors of the present invention may also contain other sequence elements to facilitate vector propagation. In addition, the vectors of the present invention may comprise a sequence of nucleotides for one or more restriction endonuclease sites. Coding sequences such as for reporter genes are well known to persons skilled in the art. In an embodiment, the vector further comprises one or more gene(s) of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">A recombinant expression vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence of the present invention may be introduced into a cell, e.g., a host cell, which may include a living cell capable of expressing the protein coding region from the defined recombinant expression vector. Accordingly, the invention also provides host cells containing the nucleic acid or recombinant expression vector of the invention. The terms &#x201c;host cell&#x201d; and &#x201c;recombinant host cell&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. Such terms refer not only to the particular subject cell, but also to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Vectors can be introduced into cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. The terms &#x201c;transformation&#x201d; and &#x201c;transfection&#x201d; refer to techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acid into a host cell, including calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, electroporation, microinjection and viral-mediated transfection. Suitable methods for transforming or transfecting host cells can for example be found in Sambrook et al. (supra), Sambrook and Russell (supra) and other laboratory manuals. Methods for introducing nucleic acids into mammalian cells in vivo are also known, and may be used to deliver the vector DNA of the invention to a subject for gene therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The above-mentioned nucleic acid may be delivered to cells in vivo using methods well known in the art such as direct injection of DNA, receptor-mediated DNA uptake, viral-mediated transfection or non-viral transfection and lipid-based transfection, all of which may involve the use of gene therapy vectors. Direct injection has been used to introduce naked DNA into cells in vivo (see e.g., Acsadi et al. (1991) <i>Nature </i>332:815-818; Wolff et al. (1990) <i>Science </i>247:1465-1468). A delivery apparatus (e.g., a &#x201c;gene gun&#x201d;) for injecting DNA into cells in vivo may be used. Such an apparatus may be commercially available (e.g., from BIORAD&#xae;). Naked DNA may also be introduced into cells by complexing the DNA to a cation, such as polylysine, which is coupled to a ligand for a cell-surface receptor (see for example Wu, G. and Wu, C. H. (1988) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>263:14621; Wilson et al. (1992) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>267:963-967; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,320). Binding of the DNA-ligand complex to the receptor may facilitate uptake of the DNA by receptor-mediated endocytosis. A DNA-ligand complex linked to adenovirus capsids which disrupt endosomes, thereby releasing material into the cytoplasm, may be used to avoid degradation of the complex by intracellular lysosomes (see for example Curiel et al. (1991) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>88:8850; Cristiano et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:2122-2126).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Defective retroviruses are well characterized for use as gene therapy vectors (for a review see Miller, A. D. (1990) <i>Blood </i>76:271). Protocols for producing recombinant retroviruses and for infecting cells in vitro or in vivo with such viruses can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds.) Greene Publishing Associates, (1989), Sections 9.10-9.14 and other standard laboratory manuals. Examples of suitable retroviruses include pLJ, pZIP, pWE and pEM which are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of suitable packaging virus lines include psiCrip, psiCre, psi2 and psiAm. Retroviruses have been used to introduce a variety of genes into many different cell types, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, myoblasts, hepatocytes, bone marrow cells, in vitro and/or in vivo (see for example Eglitis, et al., (1985) <i>Science </i>230:1395-1398; Danos and Mulligan (1988) <i>Proc.

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">For use as a gene therapy vector, the genome of an adenovirus may be manipulated so that it encodes and expresses a nucleic acid compound of the invention (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a TRIM5&#x3b1; variant), but is inactivated in terms of its ability to replicate in a normal lytic viral life cycle. See for example Berkner et al. (1988) <i>BioTechniques </i>6:616; Rosenfeld et al. (1991) <i>Science </i>252:431-434; and Rosenfeld et al. (1992) <i>Cell </i>68:143-155. Suitable adenoviral vectors derived from the adenovirus strain Ad type 5 d1324 or other strains of adenovirus (e.g., Ad2, Ad3, Ad7 etc.) are well known to those skilled in the art. Recombinant adenoviruses are advantageous in that they do not require dividing cells to be effective gene delivery vehicles and can be used to infect a wide variety of cell types, including airway epithelium (Rosenfeld et al. (1992) cited supra), endothelial cells (Lemarchand et al. (1992) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>89:6482-6486), hepatocytes (Herz and Gerard (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Adeno-associated virus (AAV) may be used as a gene therapy vector for delivery of DNA for gene therapy purposes. AAV is a naturally occurring defective virus that requires another virus, such as an adenovirus or a herpes virus, as a helper virus for efficient replication and a productive life cycle (Muzyczka et al. <i>Curr. Topics in Micro. and Immunol</i>. (1992) 158:97-129). AAV may be used to integrate DNA into non-dividing cells (see for example Flotte et al., (1992) <i>Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. </i>7:349-356; Samulski et al. (1989) <i>J. Virol. </i>63:3822-3828; and McLaughlin et al. (1989) <i>J. Virol. </i>62:1963-1973). An AAV vector such as that described in Tratschin et al. (1985) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>5:3251-3260 may be used to introduce DNA into cells (see for example Hermonat et al. (1984) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>81:6466-6470; Tratschin et al. (1985) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>4:2072-2081; Wondisford et al., (1988) <i>Mol. Endocrinol. </i>2:32-39; Tratschin et al. (1984) J. Virol. 51:611-619; and Flotte et al., (1993) <i>J. Biol.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In an embodiment, the above-mentioned expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Tissue-specific regulatory elements are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include lymphoid-specific promoters (Calame and Eaton (1988) <i>Adv. Immunol. </i>43:235-275), such as the promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore (1989) <i>EMBO J. </i>8:729-733) and immunoglobulins (Banerji, et al. (1983) <i>Cell </i>33:729-740; Queen and Baltimore (1983) Cell 33:741-748).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">General methods for gene therapy are known in the art. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,346 by Anderson et al., A biocompatible capsule for delivering genetic material is described in PCT Publication WO 95/05452 by Baetge et al. Methods of gene transfer into hematopoietic cells have also previously been reported (see Clapp, D. W., et al., Blood 78: 1132-1139 (1991); Anderson, <i>Science </i>288:627-9 (2000); and Cavazzana-Calvo et al., <i>Science </i>288:669-72 (2000)).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In an embodiment, the above-mentioned cell (host cell) is a bone marrow cell, such as a stem cell, in a further embodiment a pluripotent stem cell, in a further embodiment a multipotent stem cell, such as a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). As used herein, the term &#x201c;hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)&#x201d; means a population of primitive progenitor cells which can provide long term reconstitution of both myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages in a host when introduced thereinto. The hematopoietic stem cell, which may be isolated from bone marrow, blood, cord blood, fetal liver and yolk sac, is the progenitor cell that generates blood cells or following transplantation reinitiates multiple hematopoietic lineages and can reinitiate hematopoiesis for the life of a recipient. When transplanted into lethally irradiated subjects (e.g., animals, such as humans), hematopoietic stem cells can repopulate the erythroid, neutrophil-macrophage, megakaryocyte and lymphoid hematopoietic cell pool. Where the stem cells to be provided to a subject in need of such treatment are hematopoietic stem cells, they are most commonly obtained from the bone marrow of the subject (autologous) or a compatible donor (heterologous). Bone marrow cells can be easily isolated using methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Hematopoietic stem cells can also be obtained from blood products. A &#x201c;blood product&#x201d; as used in the present invention defines a product obtained from the body or an organ of the body containing cells of hematopoietic origin. Such sources include unfractionated bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood, liver, thymus, lymph and spleen. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that all of the aforementioned crude or unfractionated blood products can be enriched for cells having &#x201c;hematopoietic stem cell&#x201d; characteristics in a number of ways. For example, the blood product can be depleted from the more differentiated progeny. The more mature, differentiated cells can be selected against, via cell surface molecules they express. Unfractionated blood products can be obtained directly from a donor or retrieved from cryopreservative storage.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In another aspect, the present invention provides a cell population (e.g., a T cell population), organ or tissue expressing the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In another aspect, the present invention provides a transgenic non-human animal (e.g., a non-human mammal) comprising the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide/nucleic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The transgenic animals can be generated via a variety of methods. In some embodiments, embryonal cells at various developmental stages are used to introduce transgenes for the production of transgenic animals. Different methods are used depending on the stage of development of the embryonal cell. The zygote is the best target for micro-injection. In the mouse, the male pronucleus reaches the size of approximately 20 micrometers in diameter that allows reproducible injection of 1-2 picoliters (pl) of DNA solution. The use of zygotes as a target for gene transfer has a major advantage in that in most cases the injected DNA will be incorporated into the host genome before the first cleavage (Brinster et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>82:4438-4442, 1985). As a consequence, all cells of the transgenic non-human animal will carry the incorporated transgene. This will in general also be reflected in the efficient transmission of the transgene to offspring of the founder since 50% of the germ cells will harbor the transgene. U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191 describes a method for the micro-injection of zygotes. In other embodiments, retroviral infection is used to introduce transgenes into a non-human animal. In some embodiments, the retroviral vector is utilized to transfect oocytes by injecting the retroviral vector into the perivitelline space of the oocyte (U.S. Pat. No. 6,080,912). In other embodiments, the developing non-human embryo can be cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage. During this time, the blastomeres can be targets for retroviral infection (Janenich, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>73:1260, 1976). Efficient infection of the blastomeres is obtained by enzymatic treatment to remove the zona pellucida (Hogan et al., in Manipulating the Mouse Embryo, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. 1986). The viral vector system used to introduce the transgene is typically a replication-defective retrovirus carrying the transgene (Jahner et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>82:6927, 1985). Transfection is easily and efficiently obtained by culturing the blastomeres on a monolayer of virus-producing cells (Stewart et al., <i>EMBO J., </i>6:383, 1987). Alternatively, infection can be performed at a later stage. Virus or virus-producing cells can be injected into the blastocoele (Jahner et al., Nature 298: 623, 1982). Most of the founders will be mosaic for the transgene since incorporation occurs only in a subset of cells that form the transgenic animal. Further, the founder may contain various retroviral insertions of the transgene at different positions in the genome that generally will segregate in the offspring. In addition, it is also possible to introduce transgenes into the germline, albeit with low efficiency, by intrauterine retroviral infection of the midgestation embryo (Jahner et al., supra, 1982). Additional means of using retroviruses or retroviral vectors to create transgenic animals known to the art involve the micro-injection of retroviral particles or mitomycin C-treated cells producing retrovirus into the perivitelline space of fertilized eggs or early embryos (PCT International publication No. WO 90/08832, and Haskell and Bowen, <i>Mol. Reprod. Dev., </i>40: 386, 1995).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In other embodiments, the transgene is introduced into embryonic stem cells and the transfected stem cells are utilized to form an embryo. ES cells are obtained by culturing pre-implantation embryos in vitro under appropriate conditions (Evans et al., <i>Nature </i>292:154, 1981; Bradley et al., <i>Nature </i>309:255, 1984; Gossler et al., <i>Proc. Acad. Sci. USA </i>83:9065, 1986; and Robertson et al., <i>Nature </i>322:445, 1986). Transgenes can be efficiently introduced into the ES cells by DNA transfection by a variety of methods known to the art including calcium phosphate co-precipitation, protoplast or spheroplast fusion, lipofection and DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection. Transgenes may also be introduced into ES cells by retrovirus-mediated transduction or by micro-injection. Such transfected ES cells can thereafter colonize an embryo following their introduction into the blastocoel of a blastocyst-stage embryo and contribute to the germ line of the resulting chimeric animal (See, Jaenisch, <i>Science </i>240:1468, 1988). Prior to the introduction of transfected ES cells into the blastocoel, the transfected ES cells may be subjected to various selection protocols to enrich for ES cells which have integrated the transgene assuming that the transgene provides a means for such selection. Alternatively, the polymerase chain reaction may be used to screen for ES cells that have integrated the transgene. This technique obviates the need for growth of the transfected ES cells under appropriate selective conditions prior to transfer into the blastocoel.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In still other embodiments, homologous recombination is utilized to knock-out gene function or create deletion mutants (e.g., truncation mutants). Methods for homologous recombination are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,396.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In another aspect, the present invention provides an antibody specifically recognizing the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide. Specifically recognizing as used herein means that the antibody specifically binds to (interacts with) a mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide and displays no substantial binding or lower binding to other naturally occurring proteins, and more particularly to native/wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptides. The term antibody or immunoglobulin is used in the broadest sense, and covers monoclonal antibodies (including full-length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies, and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Antibody fragments comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally an antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2, and Fv fragments, diabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, single domain antibodies (e.g., from camelids), shark NAR single domain antibodies, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Antibody fragments can also refer to binding moieties comprising CDRs or antigen binding domains including, but not limited to, VH regions (VH, VH-VH), anticalins, PepBodies, antibody-T-cell epitope fusions (Troybodies) or Peptibodies. Additionally, any secondary antibodies, either monoclonal or polyclonal, directed to the first antibodies would also be included within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In general, techniques for preparing antibodies (including monoclonal antibodies and hybridomas) and for detecting antigens using antibodies are well known in the art (Campbell, 1984, In &#x201c;Monoclonal Antibody Technology: Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology&#x201d;, Elsevier Science Publisher, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and in Harlow et al., 1988 (in: Antibody A Laboratory Manual, CSH Laboratories). The term antibody as used herein encompasses polyclonal, monoclonal antibodies and antibody variants such as single-chain antibodies, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies and immunologically active fragments of antibodies (e.g., Fab and Fab&#x2032; fragments) which inhibit or neutralize their respective interaction domains in Hyphen and/or are specific thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (s.c.), intravenous (i.v.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of the relevant antigen (e.g., a mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide or a fragment thereof comprising the above-mentioned mutations(s)) with or without an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g., keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl<sub>2</sub>, or R<sup>1</sup>N&#x2550;C&#x2550;NR, where R and are different alkyl groups.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Animals may be immunized against the antigen (e.g., a mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide or a fragment thereof comprising the above-mentioned mutations(s)), immunogenic conjugates, or derivatives by combining the antigen or conjugate (e.g., 100 &#x3bc;g for rabbits or 5 &#x3bc;g for mice) with 3 volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with the antigen or conjugate (e.g., with &#x2155; to 1/10 of the original amount used to immunize) in Freund's complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Preferably, for conjugate immunizations, the animal is boosted with the conjugate of the same antigen, but conjugated to a different protein and/or through a different cross-linking reagent. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., <i>Nature, </i>256: 495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,204,023). Monoclonal antibodies may also be made using the techniques described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,025,155 and 6,077,677 as well as U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002/0160970 and 2003/0083293.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a rat, hamster or monkey, is immunized (e.g., as hereinabove described) to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the antigen used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>

The dosage will be adapted by the clinician in accordance with conventional factors such as the extent of the disease and different parameters from the patient. Typically, 0.001 to 1000 mg/kg of body weight/day will be administered to the subject. In an embodiment, a daily dose range of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, in a further embodiment of about 0.1 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, in a further embodiment of about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, in a further embodiment of about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, may be used. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial prophylactic and/or therapeutic response in the patient over time. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. For example, in order to obtain an effective mg/kg dose for humans based on data generated from rat studies, the effective mg/kg dosage in rat may be divided by six.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In another aspect, the present invention provides packages or kits comprising the above-mentioned polypeptide, nucleic acid, cell or composition together with a container. The kit may further comprises instructions for their use for preventing or treating lentivirus infection or disease. Kits can also provide buffers, excipients, as well as means for administering the polypeptide, nucleic acid, cell or composition to a subject.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The terms &#x201c;treating&#x201d; or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; as used herein refers to the application or administration of the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide, nucleic acid, cell or composition, to a subject having a lentivirus infection or symptom of infection and where the purpose is to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve, or affect the infection or any associated symptoms of the infection. The terms &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; or &#x201c;prevention&#x201d; as used herein refers to the application or administration of the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1;polypeptide, nucleic acid, cell or composition, to a subject that has been exposed to a lentivirus, or that is at risk of being exposed to the infection, or has a predisposition toward development of a lentivirus infection, where the purpose is to inhibit or stop the development of infection or associated symptoms, or to delay the onset or development of the infection or associated symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In another aspect, the present invention provides a method (in vivo or in vitro) for determining whether a subject has an increased resistance to lentivirus infection, said method comprising; determining, in a biological sample from said subject, the presence or absence (i) the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide; and/or (ii) the above-mentioned nucleic acid; wherein the presence of said mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide and/or nucleic acid is indicative that said subject has an increased resistance to lentivirus infection.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In another aspect, the present invention provides a kit for determining whether a subject has an increased resistance to lentivirus infection, said kit comprising means for detecting the presence or absence of (i) the above-mentioned mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide; and/or (ii) the above-mentioned nucleic acid encoding a mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide; together with a container. In an embodiment, such a kit may further comprise instructions for determining whether a subject has an increased resistance to lentivirus infection. &#x201c;Increased resistance&#x201d; as used herein refers to a better resistance (or decreased susceptibility/predisposition) to lentivirus infection as compared to a subject expressing a wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In an embodiment, the above-mentioned means for detecting the presence or absence of the mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide comprises a ligand (e.g., an antibody) specifically recognizing said mutant polypeptide (i.e. binding preferentially to the mutant TRIM5&#x3b1;polypeptide relative to a wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide). Such ligand may be labelled (e.g., with a fluorescent moiety) so as to facilitate the detection of the complex between the ligand and the mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide. In an embodiment, such a kit may further comprises reagents (buffers, enzymes) used for polypeptide detection, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or flow cytometry reagents.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In an embodiment, the above-mentioned means for detecting the presence or absence of a nucleic acid encoding a mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide comprises an oligonucleotide (a probe, a primer) binding (e.g., under stringent conditions) to said nucleic acid. Such oligonucleotide may be labelled (e.g., with a fluorescent or radioactive moiety) so as to facilitate the detection of the complex between the oligonucleotide and the nucleic acid. In an embodiment, the oligonucleotide binds to a region comprising the above-noted mutations, and thus binds preferentially to a mutant TRIM5&#x3b1; nucleic acid relative to a wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1; nucleic acid. In an embodiment, such a kit may further comprises reagents (buffers, enzymes) such as nucleic acid amplification reagents.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The determination can be carried out either as a DNA analysis according to well known methods, which include direct DNA sequencing of the normal and mutated TRIM5&#x3b1; gene, allele specific amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enabling detection of either normal or mutated TRIM5&#x3b1; sequence, or by indirect detection of the normal or mutated TRIM5&#x3b1;gene by various molecular biology methods including, e.g., PCR-single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP)-method or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Determination of the normal or mutated TRIM5&#x3b1; gene can also be done by using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-method, which is particularly suitable for genotyping large number of samples.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The determination can also be carried out at the level of RNA by analysing RNA expressed at tissue level using various methods. Allele specific probes can be designed for hybridization. Hybridization can be done, e.g., using Northern blot, RNase protection assay or in situ hybridization methods. RNA derived from the normal or mutated TRIM5&#x3b1; gene can also be analysed by converting tissue RNA first to cDNA and thereafter amplifying cDNA by an allele specific PCR-method and carrying out the analysis as for genomic DNA as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Alternatively, the determination can be carried out at the polypeptide level, for example using an immunoassay where a sample is contacted with an antibody capable of binding mutant or native TRIM5&#x3b1; polypeptide. Antibodies can be raised against normal or mutant TRIM5&#x3b1;polypeptide. The production of antibodies can be done in experimental animals in vivo to obtain polyclonal antibodies or in vitro using cell lines to obtain monoclonal antibodies, as described above. In an embodiment, the antibody is an antibody specifically recognizing a mutant TRIM5&#x3b1;polypeptide</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; as used herein refers to any living organism.

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Production of Retroviral Vectors.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">To produce replication-competent HIV-1, 293T cells plated at 80% confluency in 10-cm Petri dishes were transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI, Polysciences) with 10 &#x3bc;g of pNL4-3 or pNL-GFP, as previously described (Berube, J., et al., 2007<i>. Retrovirology </i>4:68). All other retroviral vectors were pseudotyped with a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV G) protein. To produce HIV-1<sub>TRIP-CMV-GFP</sub>, 293T cells were cotransfected with 10 &#x3bc;g of pTRIP<sub>CMV-GFP</sub>, 10 &#x3bc;g of p&#x394;R8.9 and 5 &#x3bc;g of pMD-G. To produce MLV vectors expressing GFP, 293T cells were similarly cotransfected with 10 &#x3bc;g of pCNCG, 10 &#x3bc;g of pCIG3 N or B, and 5 &#x3bc;g of pMD-G. HIV-2<sub>ROD-GFP </sub>and SIV<sub>mac-GFP </sub>vectors were produced by cotransfection of 10 &#x3bc;g of pROD<sub>Nef-GFP </sub>or pSIV<sub>mac-GFP </sub>respectively, and 5 &#x3bc;g of pMD-G. EIAV<sub>GFP </sub>were produced by cotransfection of 10 &#x3bc;g of pONY3.1, 10 &#x3bc;g of pONY8.0 and 5 &#x3bc;g of pMDG. Two days post-infection, the supernatants were collected, clarified by low speed centrifugation and stored in 1 ml aliquots at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Library Construction.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Random mutations were introduced into the 830.2 domain of TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>using the Diversify&#x2122; PCR Random Mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH&#xae;). Predefined experimental buffer conditions were tested in order to select the desired rate of one to two mutations per 600 bp. Buffer conditions #2 of the kit were used and consisted in an excess of dGTP combined with 160 &#x3bc;M of MnSO<sub>4</sub>. Error-prone PCR was performed using 100 ng of pMIP-TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>and the following primers: SPRY<sub>fwd</sub>, 5&#x2032;-ACAGATGTCCGACGCTACTGGGTT-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO: 1) and TRIM5<sub>rev</sub>, 5&#x2032;-TCCTGAATTCTTACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATC-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO: 2). DNA was amplified for 20 cycles (94&#xb0; C., 15 sec; 60&#xb0; C., 15 sec; 68&#xb0; C., 1 min). The rest of TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>was independently amplified with 20 units/ml of high fidelity replication Phusion&#x2122; enzyme from New England Biolabs (NEB) in 1&#xd7; High Fidelity (HF) buffer. Each PCR reaction contained 1 ng of pMIPTRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu</sub>, 0.2 mM of dNTP and 0.2 &#x3bc;M of each of the following oligonucleotides: TRIM5<sub>fwd </sub>(5&#x2032;-GTTCCTCGAGATGGCTTCTGGAATCCTGGTTAAT-3&#x2032;; SEQ ID NO: 3) and SPRY<sub>rev </sub>(5&#x2032;-AACCCAGTAGCGTCGGACATCTGT-3&#x2032;; SEQ ID NO: 4). PCR was carried out for 25 cycles (98&#xb0; C., 20 sec; 56&#xb0; C., 20 sec; 72&#xb0; C., 1 min). PCR products were cleaned of PCR reaction components using the QIAGEN QIAquick&#x2122; PCR purification kit. Aliquots (7 &#x3bc;l out of 50 &#x3bc;l) of each purified product were then mixed together to serve as templates in a second round of PCR, which used the TRIM5<sub>fwd </sub>and TRIM5<sub>rev </sub>oligonucleotides. DNA was amplified for 25 cycles (98&#xb0; C., 20 sec; 56&#xb0; C., 20 sec; 72&#xb0; C., 1 min) using the Phusion&#x2122; enzyme. The resulting PCR fragment was gel-purified (Qiagen QiaQuick&#x2122; kit), digested with XhoI and EcoR1 and ligated to pMIP cut with the same enzymes. <i>E. coli </i>DH5&#x3b1; were transformed with the ligation products, yielding a library of 24,600 clones. A number of colonies were used to start small liquid cultures in order to prepare DNA for sequencing of individual clones. The other colonies were harvested and mixed together in liquid LB medium, and an aliquot of this resuspension was used to start a 125-ml overnight culture. Plasmid DNA was purified using the Qiagen Midiprep&#x2122; kit and used to produce MLV-derived retroviral vectors. For this, 10 &#x3bc;g of the library DNA were mixed with 10 &#x3bc;g of pCI-Eco and 5 &#x3bc;g of pMD-G and this mixture was transfected using Polyethylenimine (PEI) in 293T cells plated at 80% confluence in a 10-cm plate. Two days later, the supernatant of this plate was collected, aliquoted and frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. To express the library in human TE671 cells, cells were plated in 6-well plates at 250,000 cells per well and infected in duplicates with various amounts of the mutant-library MLV vectors. Two days later, cells were treated with 2 &#x3bc;g/ml puromycin. This concentration of puromycin is relatively high, allowing most of the non-transduced cells to die in less than 24 hours. The day after puromycin was added, mortality was estimated visually, and only cultures in which the virus dose led to no more than 10% transduced cells were maintained. These cells were pooled and cultured in 10-cm plates. For the functional selection, cells at about 10% confluence in 10-cm plates were challenged three (3) consecutive times with a preparation of HIV-1<sub>TRIP-CMV-GFP</sub>. 5 ml of the undiluted GFP-expressing vector were used per plate and per infection, and infections were allowed to proceed for 16 h each. About a week later, cells were sorted by flow cytometry and GFP-negative cells (typically 1% of total intact cells) were plated at 1 cell/well in 96-well plates in DMEM-based culture medium supplemented with 10% conditioned medium (0.45 &#x3bc;m-filtered supernatant of confluent TE671 cells). The surviving clones were grown and challenged with HIV-1<sub>TRIP-CMV-GFP </sub>in 24-well plates as detailed below.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Retroviral vectors encoding wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu</sub>, TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>rh </sub>or mutants of TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>proteins were created using pMIP vector. Recombinant viruses were produced by cotransfecting 293T cells in 6-well plates with 2 &#x3bc;g of the appropriate pMIP construct, 2 &#x3bc;g of pCL-Eco and 1 &#x3bc;g of pMD-G. Two days later, supernatants were collected, cleared by low-speed centrifugation and used immediately. TE671 and SUP-T1 cells were plated at 125,000 cells per well in 6-well plates. The next day, supernatants were replaced with 2 ml of MIP-TRIM5&#x3b1; retroviral vectors or with the empty parental vector MIP as a control. Two days post-transduction, cells were placed in medium containing 0.5 &#x3bc;g/ml of puromycin (EMD Biosciences). Selection was allowed to proceed for 1 week, even though untransduced control cells were killed in 2-3 days. Expression of the transduced TRIM5&#x3b1; was analyzed by western blotting, using antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope (mouse monoclonal; SIGMA&#xae;) or actin (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Viral Challenges.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">For single-cycle infections of TE671 cells, 25,000 cells were seeded in 400 &#x3bc;l per well of 24-well plates. Cells were infected the next day with multiple doses of HIV-1<sub>TRIP-CMV-GFP</sub>, MLV-N<sub>GFP</sub>, MLV-B<sub>GFP</sub>, SIV<sub>mac-GFP</sub>, EIAV<sub>GFP </sub>or HIV-2<sub>ROD-GFP</sub>. Two days postinfection, adherent cells were trypsinized and fixed in 1% formaldehyde-PBS while T cells were simply treated with formaldehyde. For HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP </sub>infections, SUP-T1 cells were plated at 200,000 cells in 400 &#x3bc;l per well of 24-well plates and infected with a single dose (150 &#x3bc;l) of virus. To avoid the initiation of a second cycle of replication, cells were fixed at 36 h. All cells were subjected to FACS analysis on a Cytomics&#x2122; FC 500 MPL instrument (BECKMAN COULTER&#xae;) using MXP/CXP&#x2122; software. Based on light scatter profiles, only intact cells were included in the analysis. GFP-positive cells were gated and counted as a percentage of total intact cells.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">For spreading assays, 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>parental SUP-T1 cells were seeded in 2 ml of medium per well of 6-well plates. Cells were infected at low or high multiplicities of infection (M01) of HIV-1<sub>NL4-3 </sub>(15 &#x3bc;l and 1.5 ml of virus, respectively). 20 h post-infection, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min, washed once with culture medium, and resuspended in 1.5 ml of fresh medium. &#x2dc;1.0&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>of these infected cells were mixed with 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>SUP-T1 cells expressing wild-type or mutant TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>in 1 ml of medium per well of 12-well plates. Every 3 or 4 days, about two-thirds of each culture were harvested and cleared by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. Cultures were replenished with fresh medium while aliquots of cleared supernatant were preserved at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. After four weeks, reverse transcriptase activity was quantified with the EnzChek&#x2122; Reverse Transcriptase Assay Kit (INVITROGEN&#xae;) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using serial dilutions of recombinant reverse transcriptase (provided by the NIH AIDS Reagents Program) as a standard. RT assays were performed in black clear bottom microtiter plates (CORNING&#xae;) which were read in a Synergy&#x2122; HT Multi-Mode microplate reader (BIO-TEK&#xae;) at an emission wavelength of 520 nm and excitation of 480 nm.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Construction of the Human TRIM5&#x3b1; Mutant Library</heading>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">A human TRIM5&#x3b1; mutant library was constructed by error-prone PCR of the B30.2 domain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The frequency of mutations was within the desired range of 1-2 per clone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The mutations introduced were overwhelmingly (97%) substitutions, with a strong bias toward mutations at A/T residues (about 80%; see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), typical for this type of mutagenesis. Mutations were scattered all along the B30.2 domain of restriction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). Some regions, like the first variable region and the region between v3 and v4, appeared to be mutational hot-spots, and this seems to correlate partly with their high A/T content. Among 94 substitution analyzed, 34 (36%) were silent and 17 (18%) were present more than once (eight were present twice, and one was present 3 times). Thus, enrichment for particular point mutations, a recurring problem in PCR-based random mutagenesis, was relatively low in this screen by virtue of the PCR conditions used (high amount of template DNA, low number of cycles). No mutations were found in TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>h</sub>, regions upstream of the B30.2 domain. The library was retrovirally transduced into human TE671 cells. Untransduced cells were eliminated by puromycin treatment. Functional screening was done by infecting the library-expressing cells with large doses (typically leading to 99% infected cells) of an HIV-1 vector expressing GFP (HIV-1<sub>TRIP-CMV-GFP</sub>) then isolating cells that were GFP-negative and thus putatively resistant to HIV-1 infection. This approach is the same as the one described in Stremlau et al. (Stremlau M. et al., 2004. Nature 427:848-53). In a second step of functional selection, 108 GFP-negative cell clones were infected with 4 doses of the GFP-expressing HIV-1 vector, along with the control cells transduced with wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>or with the empty expression construct (pMIP). 40 of the clonal cell lines were found to show a 2-fold or more decrease in permissiveness to HIV-1 infection compared to cells transduced with wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>(some examples are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>). In a third step, transgenic TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>cDNAs were PCR-amplified from all of these clones and re-introduced into na&#xef;ve TE671 cells by retroviral transduction using the same MIP vector. These cells were again challenged with 4 doses of HIV-1<sub>TRIP-CMV-GFP</sub>, and it was found that only one cell line (clone 64) showed significant resistance to HIV-1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>). Therefore, it appears that the resistance to HIV-1 infection observed in the other 39 clonal cell lines from step two of functional screening was due to factors other than the expression of exogenous TRIM5&#x3b1;.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Transgenic TRIM5&#x3b1; in clone 64 contained the A1003G mutation (an adenine to guanine substitution at position 1003 in the human TRIM5&#x3b1; cDNA), resulting in an arginine to glycine substitution at position 335 of the human TRIM5&#x3b1; protein. It also had a silent mutation (A906C). Arg335 is located in the hypervariable region v1 of the B30.2 domain.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Mutation of the Arginine Residues at Position 332 and/or 335 Affects TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>Hu</sub>-Mediated Lentivirus Restriction</heading>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In order to explore the role of the arginine residues at positions 332 and 335 in the restriction range of TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu</sub>, a series of single mutants having amino acids substitutions at position 335, and double mutants having substitutions at positions 332 and 335, were generated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). First, to insure that R335G was the sole mutation in clone 64 causing the observed phenotypical change, the mutation was reintroduced in the parental plasmid. To investigate the possibility that increased restriction of HIV-1 was caused by a suppression of the positive charge at position 335, an arginine-to-lysine mutant (R335K) was also generated. Mutants having the basic-to-acidic mutations R335D and R335E were also constructed, as well as mutants in which R335 was replaced by hydrophobic residues, namely the aromatic phenylalanine (R335F) and the aliphatic leucine (R335L). An additional mutant lacking the Arg335 residue (&#x394;R335) was generated. Finally, the following mutants/double mutants were constructed: R332G, R332G/R335G and R332G/R335E. All mutated TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>were transduced into TE671 cells and into the lymphocytic T cell line SUP-T1, and expression was assessed by western blotting using an antibody recognizing the C-terminal FLAG tag. Among other similarly FLAG-tagged TRIM5&#x3b1; orthologues, the human version is notoriously difficult to detect. In fact, no signal for this protein is seen in western blots from two previously published studies. By optimizing the experimental conditions, we were able to detect all TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>h</sub>, mutants in TE671 cells (but not in SUP-T1) and all of them were found to migrate at the expected molecular weight (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Levels of expression seemed to vary between mutants, but this could be partly due to the nonlinear nature of the signal at such low efficiency of detection.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">All the cell lines generated were challenged with retroviral vectors derived from HIV-1, from other lentiviruses (HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus macaque strain 239, equine infectious anemia virus) and from the simpler retrovirus murine leukemia virus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and Table 1). The N-MLV and B-MLV Gag proteins differ by a few amino acids (Bock, M. et al., 2000. J Virol 74:7422-30), and amino acid 110 in the capsid domain determines the sensitivity of MLV to TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>h</sub>, and to Fv1, another restriction factor functionally (if not structurally) related to TRIM5&#x3b1;(Passerini, L. D. et al., 2006<i>. J Virol </i>80:2100-5, Towers, G. et al. 2000<i>. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>97:12295-9). N-MLV is targeted by TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>while B-MLV is not. All retroviral vectors expressed the enhanced GFP which thus served as a marker to quantitate the percentage of infected cells.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Overexpression of wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>slightly inhibited HIV-1 infection (less than 2-fold). All mutants caused a significant decrease in permissiveness to HIV-1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, top left panel, and Table 1). R332G and R335G both restricted HIV-1 by 10- to 20-fold. Clone 64 cDNA-expressed TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>also inhibited HIV-1 to the same extent, confirming that R335G was the only mutation in clone 64 having a role in the restriction. All other mutations decreased HIV-1 infection by at least 6-fold and by up to 35-fold, the mutant with the strongest effect being the double substitution R332G/R335G.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As also shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and Table 1, HIV-2 was significantly inhibited (10-fold) by overexpression of TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu</sub>. R332G caused an even greater (60-fold) inhibition of this virus, while R335L and R335F restricted HIV-2 only weakly. All other mutants had an HIV-2 restriction phenotype intermediate between wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>and the R332G mutant. Wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>weakly inhibited SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 (5-fold), and this restriction was abolished by introducing hydrophobic residues at position 335. A group of mutations that included R332G, R335G and the deletion of Arg335 decreased SIVmac239 replication by 10- to 20-fold, while R335E and the double mutation R332G/R335E had a more moderate effect. Thus, arginine 332 and 335 modulate the restriction of not only HIV-1 but also of other primate lentiviruses.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The effect of the constructs on the replication of EIAV and N-MLV, two viruses that are efficiently restricted by the human endogenous TRIM5&#x3b1;, was also tested. Overexpression of wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>inhibited both types of retroviral vectors. For N-MLV, the inhibition was greater at relatively high doses of viral input (e.g., 100 &#x3bc;l of virus) than at lower doses such as 25 &#x3bc;l. This is likely due to the effect of saturation of the restriction at high virus doses (Cowan, S., et al., 2002<i>. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>99:11914-9; Towers, G., et al., 2000<i>. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>97:12295-9): endogenous TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>h</sub>, is saturated by large amounts of incoming N-MLV capsids but overexpression of TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>h</sub>, restores restriction. EIAV replication was decreased by 5-fold by wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu</sub>. Several mutations (R332G, R335K, &#x394;R335) inhibited EIAV at significantly higher levels (up to 12-fold) while the double mutation R332G/R335G had a smaller effect (3-fold). Thus, arginine residues at positions 332 and 335 are also involved in the restriction of nonsimian lentiviruses.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Mutations at positions 332 and 335 had more modest effects on the restriction of the retrovirus N-MLV by TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and Table 1). For instance, in conditions in which TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>h</sub>, inhibited N-MLV infection in cells by 20- to 30-fold, some mutations (R335K, R332G/R335G) increased that inhibition by about 2-fold, while others decreased it by about 2-fold. Infection with a B-MLV vector was only marginally affected by most mutations at the two arginine residues, with the exception of R335G and R335K, which inhibited this virus by about 5-fold and 20-fold, respectively. All the other mutants behaved like the mock-transduced cells. These data show that Arg335 also influences the sensitivity of N-MLV and B-MLV to the restriction by TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu</sub>, but in a manner different from what is seen with lentiviruses: (i) unlike that of lentiviruses, restriction of N-MLV is not significantly affected by the introduction of hydrophobic residues at position 335; (ii) B-MLV is the only virus analyzed here that is specifically inhibited by the R335K mutation (i.e., R335K is the only mutant analyzed that significantly inhibits B-MLV).</p>

<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The level of protection conferred by TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>mutants was analyzed in the SUP-T1 T cell line. These cells were transduced with the various TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>constructs, and untransduced cells were eliminated by puromycin treatment. As shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, these cells were first challenged with the same HIV-1-derived vector (HIV-1<sub>TRIPCMV-GFP</sub>) that had been used in TE671 cells. TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>rh </sub>caused a decrease in permissiveness to HIV-1 of about 25-fold, thus significantly smaller than what is typically found in fibroblasts (100-fold or more). R332G and R335G both inhibited HIV-1 by about 8-fold, while R335K had no restrictive effect at all. Overall, mutants showed phenotypes similar to what had been found in TE671 cells. The two double-mutants restricted HIV-1 to nearly TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>rh </sub>levels, confirming that the mutations had combined effects.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The protection conferred by TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>mutants was assessed using the SUP-T1 cell lines with a version of the infectious HIV-1 clone NL4-3 expressing GFP in place of Nef. This virus enters the cells by virtue of its own envelope proteins instead of being pseudotyped with VSV-G. All but one of the viral proteins are encoded and expression of GFP allows the quantification of cells' permissiveness to HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP </sub>in a fashion similar to HIV-1<sub>TRIM-CMV-GFP</sub>. In this system, a group of mutants that included R335G, R335L, R335F, &#x394;R335 and R335D all decreased HIV-1 replication by about 10-fold, while R332G had a slightly smaller effect. Again, the two double-mutants inhibited HIV-1 the most efficiently (about 50-fold) and were nearly as restrictive as TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>rh</sub>.</p>

<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Mutation of the Arginine Residues at Position 332 and 335 Affects TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>Mediated HIV-1 Propagation Over Multiple Replication Cycles</heading>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The inhibition of HIV-1 propagation by the double-mutants upon multiple replication cycles was next tested. It has been recently shown that in in vitro T cell cultures, and probably in most instances in vivo, HIV-1 is transmitted from one cell to the next through virological synapses (Groot, F. et al., 2008<i>. Blood </i>111:4660-3; Haller, C., and O. T. Fackler. 2008<i>. Biol Chem </i>389:1253-60; Rudnicka, D. et al., 2009<i>. J Virol </i>83:6234-46) rather than via cell-free particles. This mode of transmission may result in different sensitivities of the incoming viruses to TRIM5&#x3b1;. It may also result in TRIM5&#x3b1; targeting susceptible retroviruses not just at post-entry stages but also at later stages of the retroviral life cycle (Richardson, M. W. et al., 2008<i>. J Virol </i>82:11117-28). The potency of the R332/R335 double-mutants in the context of cell to cell transmissions was determined. &#x201c;Classical&#x201d; virus spreading assays are initiated by adding cell-free virus on a culture of T cells. Under these conditions, the first round of entry events is thus mechanistically different from subsequent rounds. In order to assay virus spread in more consistent conditions, parental SUP-T1 cells were infected with HIV-1<sub>NL4-3 </sub>at low or high multiplicity of infections (MOIs). The next day, these cells were washed and then placed in culture at a ratio of 1:10 with the SUP-T1 cells expressing wild-type TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu</sub>, mutant TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>or TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>rh </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). Reverse transcriptase activity was measured in the supernatants of infected cells for 4 weeks following the initiation of the co-cultures. At low MOI (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, upper panel), viral replication peaked after 14 days of virus spread in control (mock-transduced) cells. HIV-1 replication in cells expressing exogenous TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>was slightly delayed, consistent with the small inhibition effect seen in other experimental settings. Spreading infections in cells expressing TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>rh</sub>, R332G/R335G and R332G/R335E TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>were all strongly delayed since no reverse transcriptase activity could be detected prior to day 24. The single-mutant R332G also caused a significant delay in replication (one week), but the inhibition was weaker as compared to the double-mutants. At a higher MOI (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, bottom panel), viral replication reached its peak earlier (10 days) in mock-transduced cells or in cells transduced with TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu</sub>, and the small restriction effect observed at low MOI with TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>overexpression was abolished. Also, replication in cells expressing the two double-mutants or expressing TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>d</sub>, was perhaps even more strongly delayed than at low MOI (approximately 14 versus 10 days).</p>

<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Additional mutagenic screens were performed to generate novel variants of TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>with HIV-1 restriction activity. Degenerated oligonucleotides were used and mutagenesis was limited to the first variable loop of the PRYSPRY domain. Specifically, TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>was submitted to PCR-mediated mutagenesis using a degenerated oligoDNA (v1mut) to introduce mutations in the v1 region. The sequence of the v1mut oligoDNA was: aga caa gtg agc tct CCg AAa CCa CAg ATa ATa TAt GGg GCa CGa GGg ACa AGa TAc CAg ACa TTt GTg AAt ttc aat tat tgt act (SEQ ID NO: 29). The 38 residues in capital letters are the ones that were selected for variation during the production of the oligoDNA at SIGMA-GENOSYS&#xae;. They span positions 967-1023 of the published TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>coding sequence (SEQ ID NO: 23), corresponding to the 323-341 region (PKPQIIYGARGTRYQTFVN) of the expected TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>translation product (SEQ ID NO:24). A 5% mutation rate at each of these 38 residues was requested.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The PCR products were ligated into the retroviral vector pMIP-TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>plasmid DNA, the same backbone vector used to construct the human TRIM5&#x3b1; mutant library described above. A 3,600 clones-rich pooled DNA library was constructed. This DNA was used to produce MIP-based retroviral vectors, similarly to what is described above. Human TE671 cells were transduced with the library and untransduced cells were eliminated. The transduced cells were subsequently challenged with a large dose of an HIV-1 vector expressing GFP. GFP-negative cells, potentially resistant to HIV-1, were isolated. Among these, 5 contained a mutated version of TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>hu </sub>that did confer partial resistance (about ten-fold) against HIV-1, as evidenced by re-cloning into TE671 cells. These 5 variants contained the mutations: Clone B1, P325U1328T/R332G/Q337E/T338P/Q337E; Clone B3, K324Q/Y336C/T338P; D3, P325/I328T/R332G/T334A/Q337E/T338P; E4, R332/Q337E; G4, I328S/Y329C/G330E/G333V/Q337V. Resistance against HIV-1 was explained in 3 of these 5 clones (B1, D3 and E4) by the presence of mutations at position 332. Resistance in the other two clones (B3 and G4) could be theoretically attributed to single mutations or to combinations of mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">pMIP-TRIM5&#x3b1;<sub>h</sub>, variants containing either one of each of the 8 mutations from clones B3 and G4 were constructed. TE671 cells were transduced with these constructions, and permissiveness to an HIV-1 vector carrying the GFP gene was tested as previously described. The results of this experiment are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. As can be seen, mutation G330E from clone G4 was the most restrictive, conferring a &#x2dc;10-fold resistance to HIV-1, similar to that conferred by the R332G mutation. Mutation Y336C from clone B3 conferred a &#x2dc;4-fold resistance to HIV-1, whereas mutations K324Q, Q337P, 1328S and G333V conferred a resistance of about 2- to 3-fold. Other substitutions at position 330 were tested (G330A, G330S and G330D), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Also, results from experiments in which the effect on HIV-1 restriction of mutation G330E combined with mutations at positions 332 and/or 335 are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
