<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a type of vertical overtravel stop for a MEMS microphone which does not incorporate the substrate and requires no dedicated insulation layer or special electrical measures to avoid electric shorts during an overtravel event.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Capacitive MEMS microphones are mechanically extremely sensitive devices. They need to operate in a very high dynamic range of 60-80 db ( 1/1000- 1/10000). To create a membrane which is sensitive enough to detect the lowest pressures (&#x2dc;1 mPa), it must be very compliant to pressure changes. At the same time, the membrane must withstand pressures in the range of several 10s of Pascals without being destroyed. This is typically achieved by clamping the membrane between overtravel stops (OTSs) in both directions. While an OTS towards the backplate (i.e., when the membrane is moving towards the backplate) is relatively easy to realize, the opposite direction (i.e., OTS towards the substrate, when the membrane is moving towards the substrate) either requires another dedicated layer or (typically) uses the substrate as the OTS.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a typical capacitive MEMS microphone <b>100</b>. The microphone <b>100</b> includes a backplate <b>105</b>, a membrane <b>110</b>, and a substrate <b>115</b>. The membrane <b>110</b> is coupled to the backplate <b>105</b> at point <b>120</b> (the membrane <b>110</b> is insulated from the backplate <b>105</b> as they are at different electrical potentials). Sound waves passing through the backplate <b>105</b> cause the membrane <b>110</b> to vibrate up (in the direction of arrow <b>125</b>) and down (in the direction of arrow <b>130</b>). To prevent the membrane <b>110</b> from traveling too far toward the backplate <b>105</b>, shorting the membrane <b>110</b> to the backplate <b>105</b>, overtravel stops (OTSs) <b>135</b> are provided at both ends of the membrane <b>110</b>. Each OTS <b>135</b> is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;an OTS toward the backplate.&#x201d; In addition, the substrate <b>115</b> itself provides a second OTS (&#x201c;an OTS toward the substrate&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">During microphone operation, a high bias voltage (e.g., 1 to 40 V) is typically applied between the membrane <b>110</b> and the backplate <b>105</b>. To avoid a short and potential destruction of the electronics, or the MEMS structure itself, series resistors or insulating layers on top of the OTS bumps are required. The use of series resistors requires careful design of the electronics, and the use of insulating layers increases the complexity/cost of the device significantly and may even be impossible due to process constraints. In addition, an insulating layer on top of the bumps is not an ideal solution as long as the membrane and the OTS bump are on different electrical potentials. In this case, electrostatic forces can decrease the pull-in voltage and/or provide sufficient force to keep the membrane <b>110</b> stuck to the backplate <b>105</b> after contact due to overload. Additional circuitry may be required to detect this and switch off the bias voltage to allow the membrane <b>110</b> to release from the backplate <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Creating the OTS towards the substrate is especially difficult. Due to processing tolerances during the backside processing, which typically incorporates a high rate trench, accommodations must be made to compensate for possible misalignment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows how the trench can vary from the frontside <b>200</b> to the backside <b>205</b>. To accommodate for the typical misalignment <b>210</b> between the frontside <b>200</b> and the backside <b>205</b>, the membrane <b>110</b> and the substrate <b>115</b> have a large, e.g., several microns, overlap. Additionally, the variation of the backside trench leads to a large variation at the deep end of the trench, and adds to the overall tolerances (several tens of microns). The accuracy of the backside trench can be improved at the cost of processing time. Longer processing increases the device's cost.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows another solution to this technical problem. A two-step backside trench <b>215</b> is used. This results in sufficient accuracy, but doubles the cost of this processing step.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Overlapping of the membrane <b>110</b> and the substrate <b>115</b> results in a significant and varying parasitic capacitance which directly influences the final sensitivity of the sensor element. Accordingly, it is important to keep the overlap of the membrane <b>110</b> and the substrate <b>115</b> to a minimum.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the invention provides a MEMS microphone. The MEMS microphone includes a membrane, a spring, and a first layer having a backplate, and a first OTS structure. The spring has a first end coupled to the membrane, and a second end mounted to a support. The first OTS structure is released from the backplate and coupled to a structure other than the backplate, and is configured to stop movement of the membrane in a first direction after the membrane has moved a predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment the invention provides a method of limiting the movement of a membrane. The method includes coupling the membrane to a spring, coupling the spring to a rigid structure, releasing a first OTS structure from a backplate, and coupling the first OTS structure to a structure other than the backplate. The first OTS structure prevents the membrane from moving more than a first distance in a first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment the invention provides a MEMS device. The MEMS device includes a moveable structure, a plurality of springs, and a first layer having a rigid structure, a first OTS structure, and a second OTS structure. Each spring has a first end coupled to the moveable structure, and a second end mounted to a support. The first OTS structure is released from the rigid structure and coupled to the moveable structure. The first OTS structure is configured to stop movement of the moveable structure away from the rigid structure after the moveable structure has moved a predetermined distance.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The invention allows the elimination of insulation on the OTS bumps. This reduces processing and costs of producing the MEMS microphone. The invention also addresses the OTS towards the substrate issues, removing the need for excess overlap and/or the use of a two-step backside trench. The result is a microphone that is more sensitive (due to reduced or eliminated parasitic capacitance from overlapping of the membrane and substrate) and less expensive (due to reduced processing tolerances and costs).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a prior-art MEMS spring suspended membrane <b>300</b>. The membrane <b>300</b> is supported by a plurality of springs <b>305</b>. The springs <b>305</b> are mounted to supports. In some constructions, the supports are part of the backplate layer. In other constructions, the supports are part of the substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the overlap of the substrate. Circles <b>325</b> and <b>330</b> represent variations in a backside trench due to processing tolerances. In order to ensure that the backside trench provides an OTS, the backside trench overlaps at least the springs <b>305</b> (circle <b>325</b>) and, depending on processing, the membrane <b>300</b> (circle <b>330</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a portion of a MEMS microphone. The microphone includes a spring suspended membrane <b>400</b> (i.e., a moveable structure) incorporating the invention. Similar to the prior-art membrane <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the membrane <b>400</b> is supported by a plurality of springs <b>405</b>. The springs <b>405</b> have a first end <b>408</b> mounted to a rigid structure via an insulation pad <b>410</b>. In the construction shown the springs <b>405</b> are mounted to a backplate <b>515</b> (i.e., a rigid structure). In other constructions, the springs <b>405</b> can be mounted to a substrate (i.e., a rigid structure). The springs <b>405</b> also have a second end <b>413</b> connected to the membrane <b>400</b>. A plurality of OTS structures <b>415</b> (which are part of a backplate layer) provide OTS toward the substrate and toward the backplate. In the construction shown, there are four springs <b>405</b> each mounted to the backplate via the insulation pads <b>410</b>. Circles <b>420</b> and <b>425</b> represent variations in a backside trench in the substrate due to processing tolerances. Because the OTS structures <b>415</b> provide the OTS toward the substrate, the backside trench is outside the springs <b>405</b> and membrane <b>400</b>. Therefore, there is little or no parasitic capacitance between the substrate and the membrane <b>400</b>, and tolerances can be looser when the backside trench does not function as the OTS.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, and <b>7</b> are more detailed views of a portion of the MEMS microphone. As shown in the figures, the OTS structures <b>415</b> include an OTS toward the substrate structure <b>500</b> and an OTS toward the backplate structure <b>505</b>. Both structures <b>500</b> and <b>505</b> are part of the backplate layer <b>510</b>, and are released from the backplate <b>515</b> (released refers to a process that disconnects the structures <b>500</b> and <b>505</b> from the backplate <b>515</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a side view showing the OTS toward the substrate structure <b>500</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a side view showing the OTS toward the backplate structure <b>505</b>. In other constructions, only the OTS toward the substrate structure <b>500</b> or the OTS toward the backplate structure <b>505</b> are used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the construction shown, the backplate <b>515</b> is adhered to the insulation pad <b>410</b> which is also adhered to the spring <b>405</b>. The OTS structures <b>500</b> and <b>505</b> each include a mounting pad <b>550</b> and an OTS bump <b>555</b>. The mounting pad <b>550</b> and the OTS bump <b>555</b> are formed during processing of the backplate layer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the mounting pad <b>550</b> has a first height <b>560</b> and the OTS bump <b>555</b> has a second height <b>565</b>. The second height <b>565</b> is less than the first height <b>560</b>, the difference in heights defining the distance the membrane <b>400</b> can move (e.g., a predetermined distance). The predetermined distance can be the same or different for the first and second OTS structures <b>500</b> and <b>505</b>. Thus, the predetermined distance can be a first distance for the first OTS structure <b>500</b> and a second distance for the second OTS structure <b>505</b>. In other constructions, an OTS bump is not provided. In such a construction, the OTS structure itself stops further movement of the membrane once the membrane has traveled a predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, in the OTS toward the backplate structure <b>505</b>, the mounting pad <b>550</b> is adhered to the spring <b>405</b>, and the OTS bump <b>555</b> is positioned above the membrane <b>400</b>. As the membrane <b>400</b> moves toward the backplate <b>515</b>, the membrane <b>400</b> contacts the OTS bump <b>555</b> before the membrane <b>400</b> can contact the backplate <b>515</b>. This prevents the membrane <b>400</b> from coming into contact with the backplate <b>515</b> and shorting out. Because the OTS toward the backplate structure <b>505</b> is released from the backplate <b>515</b>, and is mounted to the spring <b>405</b>, which is at the same electrical potential as the membrane <b>400</b>, the OTS bump <b>555</b> does not need to be insulated, and there are no electrical consequences when the membrane <b>400</b> comes into contact with the OTS bump <b>555</b>. In other constructions, the OTS structures are mounted to other structures (e.g., the substrate), rather than the springs or membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the OTS toward the substrate structure <b>500</b>, the mounting pad <b>550</b> is adhered to the membrane <b>400</b>, and the OTS bump <b>555</b> is positioned above the spring <b>405</b>. As the membrane <b>400</b> moves away from the backplate <b>515</b>, the membrane <b>400</b> pulls the OTS toward the substrate structure <b>500</b> down with it. When the membrane <b>400</b> has traveled a maximum desired distance, the OTS bump <b>555</b> comes into contact with the spring <b>405</b> stopping further movement of the membrane <b>400</b> away from the backplate <b>515</b>. This prevents the membrane <b>400</b> from moving too far. Again, because the OTS toward the substrate structure <b>500</b> is released from the backplate <b>515</b>, and is mounted to the membrane <b>400</b>, which is at the same electrical potential as the spring <b>405</b>, the OTS bump <b>555</b> does not need to be insulated, and there are no electrical effects when the OTS bump <b>555</b> comes into contact with the spring <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The construction shown uses layers that already exist in a MEMS microphone: a membrane layer, a backplate layer, a via layer (for electrical or mechanical) contacts, and a layer forming the OTS bumps. The OTSs in both directions are fully symmetrical, and use the same basic layout. It is not required that both sides of the OTS structure are on an electrically same node. However, putting both sides of the OTS structure on the electrically same node results in:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0029">No electrostatic forces at the OTS which otherwise could keep the membrane stuck to the backplate (electrostatic stiction). If the overtravel generating force disappears, the membrane will immediately release and go back to operating mode.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0030">No insulation layers required to have a safe design.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0031">Touching of the OTS will not overload the electronics because neither the capacitance nor resistance or leaks changes during touch.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0032">In addition, the invention applies to MEMS designs which attach a released/insulated part of a stationary layer (e.g., the backplate <b>515</b> in the above example) to a movable structure (e.g., the membrane <b>400</b> in the above example) to realize any functionally relevant structure. The OTS towards the backplate <b>515</b> also acts as a gap defining spacer or post. Thus, when a microphone is operated under conditions which pull the membrane <b>400</b>, by a high electrostatic force, the posts prevent the membrane <b>400</b> from moving too far during regular operation.</p>
