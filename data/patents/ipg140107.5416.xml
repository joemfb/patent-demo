<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods and systems for dynamic range control in an audio processing system are disclosed and may include controlling a dynamic range of an audio signal by expanding the dynamic range utilizing a dynamic expander, and dividing the audio signal into a plurality of frequency bands. Each of the bands may be individually compressed utilizing a multi-band compressor. A sum of the individually compressed frequency bands may be compressed utilizing a full-band compressor. The audio signal may be filtered utilizing a pre-emphasis filter, such as an infinite impulse response filter and may be divided into frequency bands utilizing one or more finite impulse response filters and/or delay modules. The dynamic expander may include adaptive thresholds and an envelope detector. Each of the frequency bands may be compressed utilizing syllabic compression in the multi-band compressor. The compressed sum of compressed plurality of bands may be processed utilizing an audio CODEC.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0087">For increased effective loudness, instead of increasing the gain, which may cause hard and/or soft clipping, overload the loudspeaker and cause nonlinear distortion, syllabic compression may be used to maintain the gain for nominal and low signal levels and to compress high level signals. Furthermore, since a loudspeaker may be more sensitive to low frequency overload, the signal may be split into low, medium, and high frequency bands. This enables varying levels of compression to be applied to different frequency bands. For example, more compression may be applied in the low frequency band to protect loudspeaker overload and/or less or no compression may be applied to high frequency bands. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an equal loudness curve, which may be unique to a user, may be utilized to configure the compression characteristics.</p>
