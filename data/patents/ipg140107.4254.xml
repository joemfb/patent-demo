<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is to be understood that the following description provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the disclosure. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. Moreover, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed interposing the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. Various features may be arbitrarily drawn in different scales for simplicity and clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a circuit diagram of a one-time programmable memory (OTP) cell <b>100</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. The OTP cell <b>100</b> has a fuse <b>110</b>, which can be a metal fuse or a polysilicon fuse, which can be made of salicided or non-salicided polysilicon. The fuse <b>110</b> is placed between a drain <b>120</b> of a programming transistor <b>150</b> and a voltage source <b>130</b>, which supplies a programming voltage, V<sub>PGM</sub>. The access of the voltage source <b>130</b> is controlled by a controlling transistor <b>170</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. Alternatively, the controlling transistor <b>170</b> is not needed. In some embodiments, the programming voltage is the supply voltage, V<sub>DD</sub>. The source <b>140</b> of the programming transistor <b>150</b> is connected to a ground <b>145</b> (or V<sub>SS</sub>). In addition, a read node (RN) <b>125</b> is placed between the fuse <b>110</b> and the controlling transistor <b>170</b>. Before fuse <b>110</b> is programmed (closed fuse <b>110</b>), the resistance of the fuse <b>110</b> is at the resistance of the conductive material used to make fuse <b>100</b> and is relatively low in comparison to the resistivity after fuse <b>110</b> is blown. As a result, RN <b>125</b> can read a voltage, which is a relatively low. The OTP memory cell <b>100</b> is considered to store a low logic level (a Low).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The fuse is programmed by switching ON the controlling transistor <b>170</b>. The controlling transistor <b>170</b> may be switched on (or turned on) by applying a signal BL (a zero volt) at gate <b>175</b> to allow fuse <b>110</b> to connect to the voltage source <b>130</b>. The programming transistor <b>150</b> is also switched on by applying a signal PG at the gate <b>160</b>. The signal PG applied is a voltage, a gate to source voltage V<sub>GS</sub>, that can turn on transistor <b>150</b>. When the transistor <b>150</b> is turned ON, a current I flows from voltage source <b>130</b> via transistor <b>170</b>, first to the drain <b>120</b> of transistor <b>150</b> and then to the source <b>140</b> of transistor <b>150</b>. Current I causes fuse <b>110</b> to heat up and blows fuse <b>110</b>. Fuse <b>110</b> is &#x201c;blown&#x201d; by melting, agglomeration, or other mechanisms. When a metal or polysilicon fuse is blown, the fuse become discontinuous and the resistance of the fuse increases. Therefore, after fuse <b>110</b> is blown, fuse <b>110</b> has a much higher resistance before it is blown. With the fuse blown, the OTP memory cell <b>100</b> is considered being programmed. After memory cell <b>100</b> is programmed, the voltage read by RN <b>125</b> is high due to high resistance of the fuse <b>110</b>. Therefore, the OTP memory cell <b>100</b> is considered to store a high logic level (a High).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a top view of the electrical fuse <b>110</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. Electrical fuse (or e-fuse) <b>110</b> has an anode <b>210</b> and a cathode <b>220</b>. The Anode <b>210</b> and the cathode <b>220</b> are connected by a fuse link <b>230</b>. The anode <b>210</b>, the cathode <b>220</b>, and the fuse link <b>230</b> may be made of a conductive material, such as metal, poly-silicide, or polysilicon, in accordance of some embodiments. Examples of metals that could be used to form e-fuse include, but are not limited to, Al, Al-alloy, Cu, Cu-alloy, etc. Examples of poly-silicides used to form e-fuse include, but are not limited to, CoSi<sub>2 </sub>(cobalt silicide), NiSi (nickel silicide), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Anode <b>210</b> is connected to an upper conductive layer <b>240</b> via contacts or vias (or contacts/vias) <b>245</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. The upper conductive layer <b>240</b> is connected to the voltage source <b>130</b>, which could supply the programming voltage, V<sub>PGM</sub>. Cathode <b>220</b> is connected to an upper conductive layer <b>250</b> via contacts or vias (or contacts/vias) <b>255</b>. The conductive layer <b>250</b> is connected to the drain <b>120</b>, of the programming transistor <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, the cathode <b>220</b> can be connected to the drain <b>120</b> directly without the upper conductive layer <b>250</b> and the contacts/vias <b>255</b>. The upper conductive layer <b>240</b> and the upper conductive layer <b>250</b> can be made of metal. The cathode <b>220</b> and the anode <b>210</b> are connected to each other via a fuse link <b>230</b>. The fuse link <b>230</b> has a width D<sub>1</sub>, which is much smaller than the width D<sub>2 </sub>of cathode <b>220</b> or the width D<sub>3 </sub>of anode <b>210</b>. D<sub>2 </sub>may be larger or smaller than D<sub>3</sub>. D<sub>2 </sub>may also be about the same as D<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The narrower fuse link <b>230</b> has a resistance, R, higher than the resistance of either the wider anode <b>210</b> or the wider cathode <b>220</b>. When the programming transistor <b>150</b> is turned ON, a current, I, flows from anode <b>210</b> to cathode <b>220</b> with the application of a V<sub>PGM </sub>at voltage source <b>130</b> (via the conductive layer <b>240</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Electrons flow in an opposite direction of the current I. Due to the higher resistance of the fuse link <b>230</b>, the fuse link <b>230</b> is heated due to the Joule effect. Equation (1) shows Joule's first law.

<br/>
Q represents the heat generated and t is the time passed. The heat generated in the fuse link <b>230</b> increases the temperature of the fuse link <b>230</b>, which is enclosed by dielectric layers. If the temperature of the fuse link <b>230</b> becomes high enough, the fuse link <b>230</b> may melt, which could result in a discontinuous fuse link <b>230</b> with increased resistance. As mentioned above, the increased resistance of the melted fuse link <b>230</b> could indicate that the e-fuse <b>110</b> has been programmed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a top view of a blown fuse link <b>230</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. The melting of the fuse link <b>230</b> results in a discontinuous fuse link <b>230</b>, which has a higher resistance compared to before the fuse link <b>230</b> is blown.
</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The e-fuse may also agglomerate at an elevated temperature. For example, if the e-fuse is made of poly-silicide, such as NiSi, or CoSi<sub>2</sub>, poly-silicide is less stable and may agglomerate at an elevated temperature. Poly-silicide agglomeration causes separation at the silicide grain boundaries, which may lead to local discontinuity and increased resistance of the fuse link locally. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a portion of the fuse link <b>230</b> before programming, in accordance with some embodiments. A polysilicon layer <b>270</b> is deposited on a substrate <b>205</b>. The polysilicon layer <b>270</b> may be doped or undoped. In some embodiment, substrate <b>205</b> includes a dielectric layer <b>265</b> that comes in contact with the polysilicon layer <b>270</b>. The top portion of the polysilicon layer <b>270</b> is converted into a poly-silicide layer <b>275</b>. The poly-silicide layer <b>275</b> is covered by a dielectric layer <b>280</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a portion of the fuse link <b>230</b> after programming, in accordance with some embodiments. Due to the Joule effect resulting from passing a current I on the fuse link <b>230</b>, the fuse link <b>230</b> generates heat and the temperature of the fuse link <b>230</b> increases. As mentioned above, poly-silicide is unstable at elevated temperature. As a result, the poly-silicide in the poly-silicide layer <b>275</b> agglomerates. The poly-silicide agglomeration results in separation of grain boundaries between silicide grains, such as grain <b>276</b> and grain <b>277</b>. The discontinuity of poly-silicide increases the resistance of the fuse link <b>230</b>. When the resistance of the fuse link <b>230</b> is increased to a certain level (defined by the specification), the e-fuse is considered programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Due to the relatively low resistance of poly-silicide, such as in a range from about 30 ohms (&#x3a9;) to about 300&#x3a9;, the programming current of poly-silicide e-fuse is in a range from about 10 mA to about 20 mA. However, for a liquid crystal display (LCD) driver integrated circuit (IC), the operating current is relatively low due to the LCD driver being mounted on a glass substrate and the LCD using pins for external connections. In some embodiments, the operating current for an LCD driver IC is less than about 10 mA. In some embodiments, the operating current for an LCD driver IC is equal to or less than about 3 mA. Therefore, the operating current for the LCD driver is lower than the current required for programming poly-silicide fuse. Consequently, the conventional poly-silicide e-fuse cannot be used by an LCD driver ICs for customizing LCD. Although a floating gate OTP memory cell can be programmed at low current, such as at around 1 mA, the processing sequence of a floating gate OTP memory cell is more complex and requires adjusting the logic process flow to accommodate the requirement of the floating gate OTP memory cell. In addition, after a floating gate OTP memory cell is programmed, the memory cell needs to be baked to ensure data retention. Therefore, using a floating gate OTP memory cell for applications with a low programming current is not desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Non-salicided polysilicon has a higher resistance than salicided polysilicon, such as between about 400&#x3a9; to about 4,000&#x3a9;, and can be considered a good candidate for such applications. With the higher resistance, the programming current may be lowered to less than about 10 mA. In order to increase the programming energy, the programming voltage (V<sub>PGM</sub>) needs to be higher. In some embodiments, the programming voltage V<sub>PMG </sub>is equal to or greater than 3.3 V. In some embodiments, the programming voltage V<sub>PMG </sub>is equal to or greater than 5.0 V. Due to the relatively high programming voltage V<sub>PGM</sub>, the programming transistor <b>150</b> for a non-salicided polysilicon fuse is an input/output (I/O) device (or transistor), not a core device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a top view of an electrical fuse <b>110</b>&#x2032; with a fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032;, in accordance with some embodiments. The electrical fuse <b>110</b>&#x2032; has an anode <b>210</b> and a cathode <b>220</b> connected to the fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032;. The anode and the cathode are both made of poly-silicide. Portions A and B of fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032; that connect to the cathode <b>220</b> and anode <b>210</b> are also made of poly-silicide. The remaining portion C of fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032; is made of non-salicided polysilicon. As mentioned above, non-salicided polysilicon has a higher resistance than poly-silicide and is suitable for low current applications. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a dielectric layer <b>260</b> covering the region C of fuse link <b>330</b> during silicide formation. The dielectric layer <b>260</b> prevents region C from having a silicide metal deposited, such as Co or Ni, which is used to form poly-silicide. As a result, the polysilicon in region C of fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032; is not salicided. In some embodiments, the dielectric layer <b>260</b> is formed by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. In some embodiments, the thickness of the dielectric layer is in a range from about 5 nm to about 200 nm.</p>

A poly-silicide layer <b>275</b> is formed on a polysilicon layer <b>270</b>, which is deposited on a dielectric layer <b>265</b> of a substrate <b>205</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows that the poly-silicide layer <b>275</b> is missing from region C of the fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows that when the programming transistor, such as transistor <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, connected to the cathode <b>220</b> is turned ON, a current I&#x2032; is applied across the electrical fuse <b>110</b>&#x2032; due to the voltage V<sub>PGM </sub>supplied at the anode <b>210</b>, in accordance with some embodiments. The current I&#x2032; causes the fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032; to heat up and to eventually melt a region D of the polysilicon region C of the fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032;, in accordance with some embodiments. As mentioned above, the electrical fuse <b>110</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> is covered by a dielectric layer <b>280</b> when the manufacturing of the integrated circuit (IC) is completed, in accordance with some embodiments. The dielectric layer <b>280</b> covering the electrical fuse <b>110</b>&#x2032; traps the heat (or energy) generated. The trapped heat increases the temperature of the fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032;. Region C of fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032; has a higher resistance compared to regions A and B, because it is not salicided. Therefore, region C would generate more heat, according to Joule's first law described above. As a result, region D of the region C of the polysilicon layer <b>270</b> is melted and becomes discontinuous. As a result, the electrical fuse <b>110</b>&#x2032; is blown (or programmed).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">However, as mentioned above, poly-silicide has a tendency to agglomerate at higher temperature. Poly-silicide agglomeration can lead to separation of silicide grain boundaries in regions A and/or B of fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032;, in accordance with some embodiments. Such separation of silicide grain boundaries could result in increased resistances in regions A and/or B of fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032;, which could consume energy intended to melt the polysilicon in region C. The poly-silicide agglomeration in regions A and/or B could significantly increases the resistances in regions A and/or B that there is not sufficient energy (or heat) for significant (or substantial) melting of the polysilicon layer <b>270</b> in region C. Instead, a significant amount of energy is consumed in heating the polysilicon layer <b>270</b> between separated silicide grain boundaries. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> shows poly-silicide agglomeration in regions A and/or B of electrical fuse <b>110</b>&#x2032;, in accordance with some embodiments. Grain boundary separation occurs in location <b>231</b> of region A and/or <b>232</b> of region B. The increased resistances at location <b>231</b> and/or location <b>232</b> would cause significant voltage drops across these two areas. In addition, the increased resistances at location <b>231</b> and/or location <b>232</b> would cause the polysilicon layer <b>270</b> under location <b>231</b> and/or location <b>232</b> to heat up and may even cause a partial melting of the areas. Since regions A and B are close to the cathode <b>220</b> an anode <b>210</b>, which have large poly-silicide areas and are highly conductive, the polysilicon layer <b>270</b> under the separated grain boundaries in regions A and/or B might not melt significantly, since the heat generated could be quickly dissipated via large areas of poly-silicide connected to regions A and B.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Due to the significant voltage drop(s) near locations <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>, and energy consumed near these locations, there might not be enough heat generated in region C of fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2032; to melt a portion of the polysilicon layer <b>270</b> in region C. In some embodiments, some small amount of melting in region D&#x2032; of the region C may occur, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. However, the melting of region D&#x2032; in region C becomes uncertain and uncontrollable, since it may or may not occur due to silicide agglomeration.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Blowing a fuse of an OTP should be precise and consistent, which makes e-fuse programming definite. Based on the discussion above, if the fuse link has portions that are salicided, the fuse-blowing operation might not be consistent. Therefore, it is desirable to form a polysilicon fuse with a fuse link completely not salicided. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> shows a top view of an electrical fuse <b>110</b>&#x2033; with a fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2033;, in accordance with some embodiments.

The function of dielectric layer <b>260</b>&#x2032; is similar to dielectric layer <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> shows that the width of the fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2033; is &#x201c;O&#x201d; and the length of the fuse link <b>230</b>&#x2033; is &#x201c;P&#x201d;, in accordance with some embodiments.
