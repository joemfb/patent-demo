<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-187015 filed with the Japan Patent Office on Jul. 6, 2006, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an image forming device, a control method of the image forming device, and a control program for the image forming device. In particular, the present invention relates to an image forming device capable of transmitting a document to another device, a control method of the image forming device, and a control program for the image forming device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, a network image formation system is configured by a connection of a plurality of image forming devices (such as MFPs (Multi Function Peripherals) on a network. Each image forming device includes a storage unit such as an HDD (Hard Disk Drive), and the storage unit can save documents including image data obtained by scanning, data created by application software, and the like. Further, each image forming device can transmit/receive document data to/from a designated address.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Data received by an image forming device is saved in a user's box indicated by an address. The box refers to a data storage space provided for each user in an HDD.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The box has a limited capacity; therefore, it is considered that a function of automatically deleting data after a lapse of a predetermined saving period of time is provided for the box.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, if the box has such an automatic deletion function, there is a possibility that an unread document is deleted. As a result, it is impossible to send a document to a receiver with reliability (there is occurred erroneous communication between a transmitter and a receiver).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In relation to such a technique, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 11-321046 discloses the following method. That is, if a job before printout is deleted, a printing device transmits a job retransmission request to a host device and, then, the host device retransmits job data to the printing device. According to this method, it is possible to print out retransmitted data.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-330737 discloses a printing device capable of allowing a transmitter of a print job to be cancelled to recognize that the print job will be deleted, and capable of notifying the transmitter of necessity that a print job must be retransmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2003-323276 discloses a job management method of discriminating a print job printed out normally and, then, registered as a job log in a printing device and a print job having a possibility of retransmission, and deleting an unnecessary print job with reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 11-306062 discloses a network system where a plurality of clients can access rewritable optical disc drives connected thereto via a server. Herein, the server manages a saving period of time of data to be recorded on an optical disc peculiar to a corresponding client, and automatically deletes unnecessary data in association with the management.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to solve the problems about automatic data deletion, it is considered that the following processes: (1) an unread document is not deleted, and (2) a reception-side device makes an inquiry whether a received document is deleted to a transmission-side device, must be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, if the method (1) is adopted, there arises a problem that if all saved documents are unread, a document cannot be newly received.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the other hand, if the method (2) is adopted, there arises a problem that both the reception-side device and the transmission-side device must have a control function of confirming whether or not data is deleted. In addition, there arises a problem that the reception-side device cannot make an inquiry if the transmission-side device is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As described above, both the methods (1) and (2) have a problem that reduction in erroneous communication and reduction in capacitive load of a box are not achieved together.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention is devised in order to solve the aforementioned problems. An object of the present invention is to provide an image forming device capable of efficiently transmitting a document, a control method of the image forming device, and a control program for the image forming device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to achieve this object, according to one aspect of the present invention, an image forming device includes: a transmission section transmitting a document to a reception-side device; a storage section storing the transmitted document; an acquisition section acquiring a status of the transmitted document from the reception-side device; and a retransmission section retransmitting the document stored in the storage section in accordance with the status acquired by the acquisition section when the document is deleted while being unread in the reception-side device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another aspect of the present invention, a control method of an image forming device includes: a transmission step of transmitting a document to a reception-side device; a storage step of storing the transmitted document; an acquisition step of acquiring a status of the transmitted document from the reception-side device; and a retransmission step of retransmitting the document stored in the storage step in accordance with the status acquired in the acquisition step when the document is deleted while being unread in the reception-side device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to still another aspect of the present invention, a control program for an image forming device allows a computer to execute: a transmission step of transmitting a document to a reception-side device; a storage step of storing the transmitted document; an acquisition step of acquiring a status of the transmitted document from the reception-side device; and a retransmission step of retransmitting the document stored in the storage step in accordance with the status acquired in the acquisition step when the document is deleted while being unread in the reception-side device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the present invention, if a document is deleted while being unread in a reception-side device, such a document can be retransmitted. Therefore, it is possible to provide an image forming device capable of efficiently transmitting a document, a control method of the image forming device, and a control program for the image forming device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

For example, if MFP <b>1</b> transmits document data D to MFP <b>2</b> and MFP <b>3</b>, an HDD of MFP <b>1</b> saves document data D for a predetermined period of time. In each of MFP <b>2</b> and MFP <b>3</b>, received document data D is saved in a box designated by MFP <b>1</b>. A user may receive notification that a corresponding MFP receives data through a PC connected to the network.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The received document data saved in the HDDs of MFPs <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> can be deleted by a reception-side user or can be automatically deleted after a lapse of a preset period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Even when received document data is unintentionally deleted or automatically deleted, the network image formation system automatically detects deletion of the data and determines whether or not the data must be retransmitted based on information such as a job history; thus, automatic retransmission of an unread document becomes possible. In this embodiment, a transmission-side MFP acquires information about a reception-side MFP, and appropriately determines whether or not data must be retransmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a procedure for transmitting a document.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference to the figure, when a user (transmission-side user) operates an MFP-A to thereby transmit a document to a specific user (reception-side user) having an MFP-B ((<b>1</b>) in the figure), the MFP-B notifies a PC of the reception-side user of reception of the document ((<b>2</b>) in the figure). The document is saved in a box for the reception-side user, and is held by the box until deletion by the reception-side user or automatic deletion ((<b>3</b>) in the figure).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The transmitted document is also saved in a box for the transmission-side user in the MFP-A ((<b>4</b>) in the figure). At predetermined timing, the MFP-A confirms a job history and a user history in the MFP-B ((<b>5</b>) in the figure). If the transmitted document is deleted while being unread, the document saved in the MFP-A is automatically retransmitted to the MFP-B.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">This process allows the reception-side user to read the document with reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Herein, retransmission timing of the document may be determined based on information obtained when the reception-side user has logged in. A fact of retransmission may be stated in a file name of a document file upon retransmission. Alternatively, the transmission-side user may notify the reception-side user of the fact of retransmission.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In (<b>1</b>) in the figure, if a document is transmitted to a plurality of users simultaneously, the aforementioned retransmission is performed for a user who deletes the document while being unread. Herein, the document saved in the MFP-A is automatically deleted after confirmation that all users have outputted (read) the document.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example that a document is transmitted from one MFP to another MFP. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the present invention can be effected also in a case that a document is transmitted from one box to another box in an MFP. More specifically, a document is saved in a transmission-side box upon transmission of the document to a reception-side box and, then, is retransmitted at predetermined timing under predetermined conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a configuration of an MFP.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to the figure, the MFP includes a network communication section <b>101</b> controlling network communication and performing document transmission/reception, a document creation section <b>103</b> creating a document from data obtained by scanning and the like, a document management section <b>105</b> managing a transmitted/received document, a user management section <b>107</b> managing a user, a command management section <b>109</b> managing a command, an address book management section <b>111</b> managing a reception-side address of a document, a box management section <b>113</b> managing a box for each user, a document history management section <b>115</b> managing a document history, a user history management section <b>117</b> managing a user history, an image input/output control section <b>119</b> controlling image input/output, a scanner section <b>121</b> scanning an original to thereby obtain image data, a printer section <b>123</b> forming an image on a sheet of paper, an HDD <b>125</b> including a plurality of boxes, and a memory <b>127</b> forming a storage region.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The screen displaying the list of the transmission jobs functions as a user interface for confirming a state of a transmitted document. More specifically, the screen displays a transmission ID, a name of a transmitted file, a reception-side user, a transmission result, and a reception state. As the reception state, there is displayed information whether a document is unread or deleted based on the user operation history and the document history.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Specifically, if &#x201c;Print&#x201d; or &#x201c;Get&#x201d;, which is details of an operation by a reception-side user, is recorded in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is determined that a document concerned is already read.

However, the present invention is applicable to a document created by a PC.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The present invention is applicable to transmission/reception of documents such as image data, data created by an application, text data, an e-mail massage, and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Effects of the Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the conventional art, if one image forming device transmits a document to another image forming device, an operation of one image forming device is completed at the time when another image forming device has received the document. Therefore, one image forming device cannot determine how a receiver treats the document thereafter, and cannot automatically retransmit the document in view of a status of the document. However, according to this embodiment, it is possible to automatically retransmit a document in an efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, this embodiment has an effect that a file can be retransmitted by judgment on a transmission side without a retransmission request on a reception side. Thus, it is possible to prevent such a situation that even when a retransmission request on a reception side is issued, a device on a transmission side is tuned off, so that retransmission cannot be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">This embodiment can adopt a conventionally used device as a reception-side device. Therefore, it is possible to reduce cost for system introduction.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Others)</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The present invention is effected for an image forming device including document transmission devices such as an MFP, a facsimile machine, a copying machine and a PC.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The processing in this embodiment may be executed by software or a hardware circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The present invention may provide a program executing the processing in this embodiment. Further, such a program may be provided to a user while being recorded in a recording medium such as a CD-ROM, a flexible disk, a hard disk, a ROM, a RAM or a memory card. In addition, such a program may be downloaded into a device via a communication line such as the Internet.</p>
