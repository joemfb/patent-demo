<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">To communicate with other devices in a wireless communication system, many wireless devices include demodulators. These demodulators are, for example, included in chip sets that enable wireless communication via one of several communication standards, such as Bluetooth, digital enhanced cordless telecommunication (DECT), radio frequency identification (RFID) communication or others. Since these chip sets are commonly used in cell phones, music players, proximity coupling devices (PCD) or proximity integrated circuit cards (PICC), it is desirable for the chip sets to be relatively compact and efficient, thereby providing low cost and high data rates.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">According to an embodiment of a demodulator, the demodulator includes a sampler and a trigger unit. The sampler is configured to sample a carrier signal based on a trigger signal to obtain a demodulated signal. The trigger unit is configured to detect a predefined amplitude value of the carrier signal and provide the trigger signal based on the detected predefined amplitude value, so that the carrier signal is sampled by the sampler with a predefined phase shift. The predefined phase shift is such that a phase shift to a zero crossing of the carrier signal or an extreme value of an amplitude of the carrier signal is larger than 30&#xb0; plus an integer multiple of 90&#xb0; and lower than 60&#xb0; plus the same integer multiple of 90&#xb0; in reference to the carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to an embodiment of a transceiver, the transceiver includes a sampler, a trigger unit and an oscillation unit. The sampler is configured to sample a carrier signal based on a trigger signal to obtain a demodulated signal.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following, the same reference numerals are partly used for objects and functional units having the same or similar functional properties and the description thereof with regard to a figure shall apply also to other figures in order to reduce redundancy in the description of the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a block diagram of a demodulator <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. The demodulator <b>100</b> comprises a sampler <b>110</b> and a trigger unit <b>120</b>. The trigger unit <b>120</b> is connected to the sampler <b>110</b>. The sampler <b>110</b> samples a carrier signal <b>102</b> based on a trigger signal <b>122</b> provided by the trigger unit <b>120</b> to obtain a demodulated signal <b>112</b>. The trigger unit <b>120</b> detects a zero crossing of the carrier signal <b>102</b> or an extreme value of an amplitude of the carrier signal <b>102</b>. Further, the trigger unit <b>120</b> provides the trigger signal <b>122</b> based on the detected zero crossing or the detected extreme value, so that the carrier signal <b>102</b> is sampled by the sampler <b>110</b> with a predefined phase shift in relation to the detected zero crossing or the detected extreme value. In some embodiments the predefined phase shift is larger than 30&#xb0; plus an integer multiple of 90&#xb0; and lower than 60&#xb0; plus the same integer multiple of 90&#xb0; in reference to the carrier signal <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">By sampling the carrier signal <b>102</b> with a predefined phase shift of 30&#xb0; to 60&#xb0; (plus an integer multiple of 90&#xb0;) from a detected zero crossing or a detected extreme value of the carrier signal, it may be guaranteed that the demodulated signal <b>112</b> may be obtained with a sufficient signal quality. Therefore, it may be sufficient to generate only one demodulated signal from the carrier signal <b>102</b> instead of an inphase signal and a quadrature phase signal. In this way, the hardware complexity and/or the costs of the demodulator may be significantly reduced compared with known demodulators. Further, no analog mixer and/or filter may be necessary for demodulating the carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A phase shift in reference to the carrier signal <b>102</b> means that the phase shift relates to a period of the carrier signal. For example, for a carrier signal with a period length of 12 ns, the sampling of the carrier signal <b>102</b> may be delayed by 1-2 nanoseconds, which corresponds to a 30&#xb0; to 60&#xb0; phase shift.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For illustrating possible detected zero crossings or extreme values as well as the region the carrier signal <b>102</b> is sampled due to the predefined phase shift, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic illustration <b>200</b> of the carrier signal <b>102</b>. For detecting zero crossings <b>224</b> and/or extreme values <b>226</b> (minimum and/or maximum) and possibly occurring DC portion (direct current) of the carrier signal <b>102</b> may be filtered out before the carrier signal <b>102</b> is provided to the trigger unit <b>120</b> or filtered out by the trigger unit <b>120</b> itself. The illustration shows two possible detected zero crossings <b>224</b> and three possible detected extreme values <b>226</b> (two minimum and one maximum). Due to the predefined phase shift of 30&#xb0;+/&#x2212;n*90&#xb0; to 60&#xb0;+/&#x2212;n*90&#xb0; (e.g., +210&#xb0; to +240&#xb0;, +120&#xb0; to +150&#xb0;, +30&#xb0; to +60&#xb0; or &#x2212;30&#xb0; to &#x2212;60&#xb0;, &#x2212;120&#xb0; to &#x2212;150&#xb0; or &#x2212;210&#xb0; to &#x2212;240), the carrier signal <b>102</b> is sampled by the sampler <b>120</b> between a zero crossing and an extreme value at a position with sufficient signal strength. In contrast to the concept of sampling the carrier signal at its extreme values, the proposed concept is, for example, able to obtain a demodulated signal <b>112</b> comprising inphase and quadrature phase portions with sufficient signal quality simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, the predefined phase shift may be equal to 45&#xb0; (plus n*90&#xb0;) in reference to the carrier signal <b>102</b> with a tolerance of +/&#x2212;5&#xb0; (or +/&#x2212;10&#xb0; or +/&#x2212;1&#xb0;).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With a 45&#xb0; phase shift (plus an integer multiple of 90&#xb0;) an inphase portion and a quadrature phase portion of the signal modulated onto the carrier signal <b>102</b> may be received with an equally good or equally bad signal quality, but it may be possible to use both of them. Depending on the application, only one or both signal portions (inphase signal and quadrature phase signal) may be necessary to obtain the transmitted information.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The sampler <b>110</b> may sample the carrier signal <b>102</b> with a sampling frequency equal to a frequency of the carrier signal <b>102</b> (in an unmodulated state) with a tolerance of 10% (or 20%, 5% or 1%) of the frequency of the carrier signal <b>102</b>. In other words, it may be sufficient to detect one zero crossing or one extreme value by the trigger unit <b>120</b> to trigger the sampler <b>110</b> according to the predefined phase shift and afterwards, the sampler <b>110</b> may sample the carrier signal <b>102</b> periodically with the frequency of the carrier signal <b>102</b>. Alternatively, the trigger unit <b>120</b> may detect zero crossings or extreme values periodically and trigger the sampler <b>110</b> accordingly. For this, the trigger unit <b>120</b> may detect zero crossings only at rising edges or only at falling edges or may detect only maxima or only minima of the carrier signal <b>102</b>. In this way, the carrier signal <b>102</b> may be sampled by the sampler <b>110</b> periodically one time per period of the carrier signal <b>102</b> with the predefined phase shift.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The frequency of the carrier signal may be known by the demodulator. For example, the demodulator may be part of an RFID reader. In this example, the RFID reader may transmit an unmodulated or modulated carrier signal to a RFID device, also called RFID tag, and the RFID device may modulate data to be transmitted to the RFID reader onto the carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sampler <b>110</b> and the trigger unit <b>120</b> may be, for example, independent hardware units or part of a signal processor or microcontroller.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments of the invention, the carrier signal <b>102</b> is modulated (amplitude and/or phase modulated), if data is transmitted by a transmitter using the carrier signal <b>102</b>, and unmodulated, if no data is transmitted by a transmitter using the carrier signal <b>102</b>. Therefore, the carrier signal <b>102</b> may comprise a modulated state or an unmodulated state. For such an application, the trigger unit <b>120</b> may be able to detect an unmodulated state of the carrier signal <b>102</b> and may detect the zero crossing of the carrier signal <b>102</b> or the extreme value of the amplitude of the carrier signal <b>102</b> based on the unmodulated carrier signal <b>102</b>. According to this detected zero crossing or extreme value, the trigger unit <b>120</b> triggers the sampler <b>110</b> by the trigger signal <b>122</b> with the predefined phase shift. In the modulated state, the carrier signal <b>102</b> may be sampled by the sampler <b>110</b> periodically without continuously repeated synchronization to further zero crossings or extreme values. In other words, a detection of a zero crossing or an extreme value and a corresponding triggering of the sampler <b>110</b> may not be done, if the carrier signal <b>102</b> is in a modulated state.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments according to the invention, the sampler <b>110</b> may comprise an analog-digital-converter (ADC). The ADC may sample the carrier signal <b>102</b> based on the trigger signal <b>122</b> to obtain a demodulated, digital signal <b>112</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a block diagram of an embodiment of a demodulator <b>300</b> using a sampler <b>110</b> with an ADC. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> indicates that the trigger unit <b>120</b> triggers the ADC <b>110</b> with a predefined phase shift of about 45&#xb0; (+/&#x2212;a tolerance of 0.1&#xb0;, 1&#xb0;, 5&#xb0; or 10&#xb0;). This may be done based on a clock signal <b>302</b> with a frequency of n times the frequency of an internal clock or the frequency of the carrier signal n&#xd7;f<sub>c</sub>. The ADC <b>110</b> may then be triggered by a trigger signal <b>122</b> with a frequency equal to the carrier frequency or to the frequency of the internal clock (oscillator) with a phase shift of +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; or +/&#x2212;135&#xb0; (considering tolerances mentioned above). The ADC <b>110</b> may generate a demodulated, digital signal <b>112</b> comprising portions of an inphase signal I and a quadrature signal Q contained by the carrier signal <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The ADC of the sampler <b>110</b> may be the only ADC of the demodulator <b>300</b> for sampling the carrier signal <b>102</b>, because it may be sufficient to obtain one demodulated signal <b>112</b> from the carrier signal <b>102</b> according to the described concept.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The trigger unit <b>120</b> may be implemented in various ways. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>to <b>4</b><i>d </i>show block diagrams of possible implementations of trigger units <b>120</b> according to embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It may be sufficient to use a predefined phase shift (PPS) between 30&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;, but an additional shift of an integer multiple of 90&#xb0; may have the same technical effect. Therefore, the predefined phase shift may be, for example, +/&#x2212;30&#xb0; to 60&#xb0;, +/&#x2212;120&#xb0; to 150&#xb0; or +/&#x2212;210&#xb0; to 240&#xb0; and so on. The integer multiple may be a positive integer, a negative integer or 0. For example, 30&#xb0;+/&#x2212;n&#xb7;90&#xb0;&#x3c;PPS&#x3c;60&#xb0;+/&#x2212;n&#xb7;90&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>shows an example of a trigger unit <b>120</b> comprising a phase detector <b>410</b> and a delay unit <b>440</b>. The phase detector <b>410</b> may detect a zero crossing or an extreme value of the amplitude of the carrier signal <b>102</b> and may provide the trigger signal <b>122</b> with a trigger pulse at the time the zero crossing or the extreme value is detected. The delay unit <b>440</b> may delay the trigger signal <b>122</b> according to the predefined phase shift, so that the sampler is triggered to sample the carrier signal by the delayed trigger pulse with the predefined phase shift. For example, the phase detector <b>410</b> may detect every zero crossing of a rising edge of the carrier signal <b>102</b> and provides a trigger pulse for each detected zero crossing. Alternatively, each maximum, each minimum or each zero crossing of a falling edge may be detected by the phase detector <b>410</b>. The delay unit <b>440</b> may be realized, for example, by delay buffers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>shows an alternative implementation of the trigger unit <b>120</b>. Again, the trigger unit <b>120</b> comprises a phase detector <b>410</b> and a delay unit <b>450</b>. The phase detector <b>410</b> detects the zero crossing or the extreme value and provides a trigger pulse to the delay unit <b>450</b> at the time the zero crossing or the extreme value is detected. The delay unit <b>450</b> delays a clock signal f<sub>c </sub><b>302</b> based on the trigger pulse provided by the phase detector <b>410</b> according to the predefined phase shift to obtain the trigger signal <b>122</b> (e.g., f<sub>c</sub>+45&#xb0;+n&#xb7;90&#xb0;) for the sampler, so that the sampler samples the carrier signal with the predefined phase shift.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The clock signal <b>302</b> may comprise the same frequency as the carrier signal <b>102</b> with a tolerance of 1% (or 0.1%, 5% or 10%) of the clock signal <b>302</b>, so that the sampler is triggered by the trigger signal <b>122</b> periodically to sample the carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Fittingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows two examples 500 for trigger signals <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b</i>. For example, if the clock signal <b>302</b> is a sine wave signal, the trigger signal <b>122</b><i>a </i>may also be a sine wave signal delayed by the predefined phase shift, so that, for example, a zero crossing <b>522</b> of the trigger signal <b>122</b><i>a </i>may trigger the sampler to sample the carrier signal <b>102</b>. This is indicated by the dashed line <b>122</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Triggering the sampler to sample the carrier signal <b>102</b> at the time of the zero crossing <b>522</b> of the trigger signal <b>122</b><i>a </i>yields a sample point <b>512</b> with a phase shift of about 45&#xb0; in reference to the carrier signal <b>102</b>. Alternatively, the clock signal <b>302</b> may be a digital signal (e.g., square wave signal) and the trigger signal <b>122</b><i>b </i>may comprise a rising edge or a falling edge with the predefined phase shift as indicated by the second dashed line <b>122</b><i>b</i>. In the shown example, the sampler may be triggered by the rising edge of the trigger signal <b>122</b><i>b </i>yielding the sample points <b>512</b> with about 45&#xb0; phase shift.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Alternatively, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c </i>shows a trigger unit <b>120</b> providing a trigger signal <b>122</b> based on a clock signal comprising a frequency equal to an integer multiple of the frequency of the carrier signal RF<sub>in </sub>(whit tolerances mentioned above).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one implementation example, the trigger unit <b>120</b> may comprise a phase detector and a counter. The phase detector detects the zero crossing or the extreme value of the carrier signal and may provide a reset pulse to the counter. The counter may count periodically a predefined number of count cycles and may be triggered by a clock signal <b>302</b> comprising a frequency equal to an integer multiple of the frequency of the carrier signal (n&#xd7;f<sub>c </sub>with n between 1 and 100 or more) with a tolerance of 1% (or 0.1%, 5%, or 10%) of the frequency of the clock signal. The predefined number of count cycles may be equal to the integer, the frequency of the carrier signal is multiplied with. The counter is reset by the reset pulse to start a new counting period at a reset value between 0 and the predefined number of count cycles depending on the predefined phase shift. The reset value and the predefined number of count cycles may be register values stored in a register. The counter may start a new counting period at a predefined start value, if no reset pulse is received. A counting period starts, for example, at a predefined start/stop value (e.g., 0 or 1) and ends at the predefined number of count cycles or vice versa. Further, the counter may provide the trigger signal with the trigger pulse after reaching the predefined number of count cycles or the start/stop value.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For illustration, a frequency of the clock signal being 16 times larger than the frequency of the carrier signal and a predefined phase shift of 45&#xb0; may be considered. Then, the counter counts periodically <b>16</b> count cycles, for example, from 1 to 16, from 0 to 15, from 15 to 0 or from 16 to 1. Since 45&#xb0; is &#x215b;<sup>th </sup>of a full period of the carrier signal, the counter starts, for example, at the reset value of 2 and counts to 0 (start/stop value) before providing a trigger pulse, since the predefined number of count cycles divided by 8 is equal to 2. After this, the counter may periodically count the number of predefined count cycles before providing the next trigger pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d </i>shows another implementation example for a trigger unit <b>120</b>. The trigger unit <b>120</b> comprises a phase detector <b>410</b>, a calibration unit <b>420</b> and a counter <b>430</b>. The phase detector <b>410</b> may be connected to the calibration unit <b>420</b> and the calibration unit <b>420</b> may be connected to the counter <b>430</b>. The counter <b>430</b> may be connected to the sampler, which is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d</i>. The phase detector <b>410</b> may detect a first zero crossing and a second zero crossing or a first extreme value and a second extreme value of the carrier signal <b>102</b> and may provide a first reset pulse at the time the first zero crossing or the first extreme value is detected and may provide a second reset pulse at the time the second zero crossing or the second extreme value is detected. For example, the phase detector <b>410</b> may detect each zero crossing of a rising edge of the carrier signal. The calibration unit <b>420</b> may determine a number of count cycles to be periodically counted by the counter <b>430</b> based on the first reset pulse, the second reset pulse and a clock signal. The clock signal may comprise a frequency equal to an integer multiple of the frequency of the carrier signal (with tolerance mentioned above). For example, the calibration unit <b>420</b> may count the clock cycles of the clock signal <b>302</b> between the first reset pulse and the second reset pulse resulting in the number of count cycles. The determined number of count cycles may be provided to the counter <b>430</b> as a reset value. The counter <b>430</b> may divide the number of count cycles by the integer, the frequency of the carrier signal is multiplied with, for the first counting period. After counting the divided number of count cycles, the counter <b>430</b> may provide a trigger pulse to the sampler. Afterwards, the counter <b>430</b> may count periodically the determined number of count cycles before providing a further trigger pulse to the sampler until a new determined number of count cycles is provided by the calibration unit <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The frequency of the clock signal <b>302</b> may be an integer multiple of a frequency of an internal oscillator providing a time base for the demodulator. The frequency of the oscillator may be equal to the frequency of the carrier signal (with tolerance mentioned above).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Optionally, the calibration unit <b>420</b> may be controlled by an enable/disable calibration signal. In this case, the calibration unit <b>420</b> determines a number of count cycles only if the enable/disable calibration signal comprising a value representing an enable state of the enable/disable calibration signal. For example, the calibration unit <b>420</b> may only receive an enable state of the enable/disable calibration signal, if the carrier signal is unmodulated, since a useful determination of the number of count cycles may only be possible, if the carrier signal is unmodulated (e.g., due to phase modulation of the carrier signal in the modulated state). For this, the trigger unit <b>120</b> may comprise a modulation detector for detecting a modulation state of the carrier signal and for providing the enable/disable calibration signal to the calibration unit <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Some embodiments according to the invention comprise a down sampler. The down sampler may obtain and provide a down sampled digital signal with a predefined bit rate based on the demodulated signal by selecting sample values from the demodulated signal with a down sampling frequency according to the predefined bit rate. In other words, the down sampler may reduce the amount of data provided by the sampler according to a predefined bit rate. For example, the predefined bit rate may relate to a bit rate of the signal modulated onto the carrier signal or a maximal bit rate of a signal modulated onto the carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, the modulated carrier signal may comprise a carrier frequency of 13.56 MHz often used by RFID applications. Then, for example, the carrier signal may be sampled by the sampler with a sampling frequency equal to this 13.56 MHz, so that the sampler outputs the modulated signal with the bit rate of 13.56 Mbit/sec. However, the data modulated onto the carrier signal may only comprise a low bit rate, for example, 848 kbit/sec. Therefore, it would be sufficient for the down sampler to select sample values from the demodulated signal with 848 kbit/sec. Alternatively, the sample values may be selected with twice the bit rate or a higher bit rate, for example, for reducing errors. Nevertheless, the amount of sampling data may be reduced by the down sampler. In other words, the predefined bit rate may be equal to a bit rate of a modulation of the carrier signal or an integer multiple of the modulation of the carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally, the demodulator may comprise a second down sampler. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a block diagram of a demodulator <b>600</b> with two down samplers according to an embodiment of the invention. The second down sampler <b>620</b> may obtain and provide a second down sampled signal <b>622</b> with the predefined bit rate based on the demodulated signal <b>112</b> by selecting sample values from the demodulated signal <b>112</b> different from the sample values selected by the first down sampler <b>610</b>. This may be done with the same down sampling frequency. In other words, the first down sampler <b>610</b> and the second down sampler <b>620</b> may select sample values from the demodulated signal <b>112</b> so that a time a sample value is selected by the first down sampler <b>610</b> and a time a sample value is selected by the second down sampler <b>620</b> comprise a down sampling time difference. This down sampling time difference of sample values selected by the first down sampler <b>610</b> and sample values selected by the second down sampler <b>620</b> may depend on the predefined bit rate. For example, the down sampling time difference may be equal to a quarter of the period of the signal modulated onto the modulated carrier signal. In other words, the first down sampled signal <b>612</b> of the first down sampler <b>610</b> and the second down sampled signal <b>622</b> of the second down sampler <b>620</b> may comprise a phase shift of, for example, 90&#xb0; in reference to the signal modulated onto the carrier signal. Alternatively, a phase shift between 0&#xb0; and 360&#xb0; may be realized. In this way, it may be guaranteed that one or both down samplers <b>610</b>, <b>620</b> may provide signal with sufficient signal quality. So, the problem of insufficient signal quality of a down sampled signal of a down sampler selecting sample values at a transition of the signal modulated onto the carrier signal from high to low or from low to high (resulting in intermediate values) may be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A down sampler may be, for example, an independent hardware unit or part of a computer, a digital signal processor or a microcontroller.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Some embodiments according to the invention relate to a demodulator comprising a means for sampling a carrier signal based on a trigger signal to obtain a demodulated signal and a means for detecting a zero crossing of the carrier signal or an extreme value of an amplitude of the carrier signal. Further, the demodulator comprises a means for providing the trigger signal based on the detected zero crossing or the detected extreme value, so that the carrier signal is sampled by the means for sampling the carrier signal with a predefined phase shift to the detected zero crossing or the detected extreme value. The predefined phase shift is larger than 30&#xb0; plus an integer multiple of 90&#xb0; and lower than 60&#xb0; plus the same integer multiple of 90&#xb0; in reference to the carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Some embodiments according to the invention relate to a demodulator comprising an analog-digital-converter (ADC) and a trigger unit. The ADC may sample a carrier signal in a modulated state based on a trigger signal to obtain a demodulated, digital signal. The trigger unit may detect a zero crossing of the carrier signal in an unmodulated state and may provide the trigger signal based on the detected zero crossing, so that the carrier signal is sampled by the ADC with a predefined phase shift of 45&#xb0; plus an integer multiple of 90&#xb0; relative to the detected zero crossing in reference to the carrier signal with a tolerance of 5&#xb0; (or 0.1&#xb0;, 1&#xb0; or 10&#xb0;).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The explanations regarding the trigger unit, the down sampler and others made above are equally applicable to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">After detecting the zero crossing, the trigger signal with a trigger pulse considering the predefined phase shift may be provided to the sampler. Afterwards, a trigger pulse may be provided periodically with the frequency of the carrier signal (with tolerances mentioned above). In this way, an unmodulated state of the carrier signal may be used to detect the zero crossing and to consider the predefined phase shift. Then, the carrier signal may be sampled periodically with the frequency of the carrier signal, especially when the carrier signal is in a modulated state.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Some embodiments according to the invention relate to a digital demodulation method for a demodulator for a contactless receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The described concept presents a new demodulation concept, for example, for a contactless proximity reader (PCD). The data transmission from proximity integrated circuit card (PICC) to PCD is called uplink and the term downlink denotes the opposite communication direction. Existing readers may handle data rates up to 848 kbit/sec in both communication directions, which are defined in the standard 14443 Type A/B. Data rates above 848 kbit/sec are called &#x201c;Very High Data Rates&#x201d; (VHDR). For this reason, also new modulation methods and coding schemes are designed. The proposed concept introduces a new demodulation scheme, which can handle the modulation methods and coding schemes, which are intended for very high data rates. The proposed receiver architecture, for example, of a PCD is also very versatile concerning different communication standards (i.e. ISO 15693, ISO 14443, ISO 18000-3 Mode 1 and Mode 2).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Data rates above 848 kbit/sec for contactless applications are not standardized. Currently, the maximum data rates are limited to 848 kbit/sec for both communication directions. The data transmission from PICC to PCD is based on a load modulation of the carrier signal. This technique causes basically an amplitude modulation and, additionally, a phase modulation of the received carrier signal. For the demodulation of such a modulated signal, usually an I/Q demodulator is used, which can detect the amplitude and phase information.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Existing contactless receivers have almost an analog fronted with fixed adjusted filter circuits. Therefore, the receiver has no ability to deal with high data rates or/and different modulation methods. An analog I/Q demodulator is used, whereas the received signal is mixed with the carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The described concept establishes a demodulator concept of a contactless receiver, which can handle different modulation/coding methods for very high data rates. Already standardized modulation and coding methods can be processed by the proposed demodulator. Today, analog to digital converters are able to operate at high sampling rates. Therefore, the load-modulated carrier signal can be directly converted by an ADC without any analog down conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The described concept may offer several advantages. For example, the hardware concept of the proposed demodulator (especially the analog front end) may be independent of the sub-carrier frequency and the modulation scheme, which offers a great advantage compared to other demodulator concepts. Further, the proposed solution may require no analog filter. In an (known) analog demodulator design, the filter must be adapted to the used sub-carrier frequency. Also, no digital filters may be necessary. A digital filter requires a higher sampling rate, i.e., needs a higher sample rate of the analog to digital converter. Additionally, no need of an analog mixer may be necessary. This task can be done by accordingly ADC sampling. Further, with the adaptive sampling scheme, the demodulator already outputs the baseband modulated sub-carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Some embodiments according to the invention relate to a transceiver comprising a demodulator according to the concept described above and an oscillator unit. The oscillator unit or carrier clock may provide an oscillator signal comprising a carrier frequency. The transceiver may be able to transmit a signal with the carrier frequency based on the oscillator signal and to receive the carrier signal in a modulated state or an unmodulated state.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The transceiver may, for example, be a transceiver of a mobile phone, a contactless proximity reader or another device for wireless communication applications.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a flow chart of a method <b>700</b> for demodulating a carrier signal according to an embodiment of the invention. The method <b>700</b> comprises detecting a zero crossing of the carrier signal or an extreme value of an amplitude of the carrier signal (Step <b>710</b>) and providing a trigger signal based on the detected zero crossing or the detected extreme value (Step <b>720</b>). Further, the method <b>700</b> comprises sampling the carrier signal based on the trigger signal to obtain a demodulated signal (Step <b>730</b>). The trigger signal is provided so that the carrier signal is sampled with a predefined phase shift to the detected zero crossing or the detected extreme value. The predefined phase shift is larger than 30&#xb0; plus an integer multiple of 90&#xb0; and lower than 60&#xb0; plus the same integer multiple of 90&#xb0; in reference to the carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a flow chart of a method <b>800</b> for demodulating a carrier signal according to another embodiment of the invention. The method <b>800</b> comprises detecting a zero crossing of the carrier signal in an unmodulated state (Step <b>810</b>) and providing a trigger signal based on the detected zero crossing (Step <b>820</b>). Further, the method <b>800</b> comprises sampling the carrier signal in a modulated state based on the trigger signal to obtain a demodulated, digital signal (Step <b>830</b>). The trigger signal is provided so that the carrier signal is sampled with a predefined phase shift of 45&#xb0; plus an integer multiple of 90&#xb0; relative to the detected zero crossing in reference to the carrier signal with a tolerance of 5&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Embodiments of the invention were described on the basis of a demodulator having a trigger unit for detecting a zero crossing of the carrier signal (0&#xb0; phase shift) or an extreme value of an amplitude of the carrier signal (90&#xb0; phase shift) and for providing the trigger signal based on the detected zero crossing or the detected extreme value so that the carrier signal is sampled by the sampler with a predefined phase shift to the detected zero crossing or the detected extreme value, wherein the predefined phase shift is larger than 30&#xb0; plus an integer multiple of 90&#xb0; and lower than 60&#xb0; plus the same integer multiple of 90&#xb0; in reference to the carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">However, the invention is not limited to such embodiments. Instead of the zero crossing of the carrier signal or the extreme value of an amplitude of the carrier signal any predefined amplitude value of the carrier signal may be used. In such a case the carrier signal is sampled by the sampler with a predefined phase shift, wherein the predefined phase shift is such that a phase shift to a zero crossing of the carrier signal or an extreme value of an amplitude of the carrier signal is larger than 30&#xb0; plus an integer multiple of 90&#xb0; and lower than 60&#xb0; plus the same integer multiple of 90&#xb0; in reference to the carrier signal. For example, assume a predefined value for the amplitude of the carrier signal where a phase shift of, e.g., 13&#xb0; exists. In such a case, the predefined phase shift would be between 17&#xb0; and 47&#xb0;. Thereby, the phase shift between the zero crossing of the carrier signal or the extreme value of an amplitude of the carrier signal is again between 30&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;.</p>
