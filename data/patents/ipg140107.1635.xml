<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to systems for offering products to casino players. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system for determining a product to offer to a casino player based on various variables relating to the product.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Casinos employ many systems designed to influence the behavior of casino players. These systems are designed to encourage behavior which is beneficial to the casinos. For example, in order to maximize an amount of time casino players spend actively gaming, casinos provide casino players with well-functioning gaming equipment, bright lighting, and free drinks at game machines and tables.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to encourage frequent and high-stakes gaming, casinos offer products to qualifying casino players for reduced prices. These products are offered to casino players who have met certain qualifying conditions, such as wagering more than a particular amount over a specified period of time, losing more than a particular amount per visit, or the like. For example, a manager of a casino identifies, using casino records, a casino player who loses an average of $5,000 each time he visits the casino. The casino manager then offers the casino player a hotel room and meals usable any time the casino player wishes, for no cost or at a substantially reduced cost. The products are offered under the assumption that maintaining the player as a customer is worth the cost to the casino of the offer. It should be noted that the product offers discussed herein comprise the offering of goods and/or services to casino players for free or for a certain price.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although the foregoing types of offers were originally reserved for &#x201c;high-rollers&#x201d;, casinos are now offering products to a wider range of casino players based on their gaming histories. These products are also offered under the assumption that maintaining a casino player as a customer is worth a cost of a particular product offered to the casino player. However, since it is impractical for a casino manager to manage product offers on a large scale, casinos have implemented automated systems for determining and distributing product offers to casino players.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These automated systems are designed so that casino offers are available to all casino players as a &#x201c;reward&#x201d; for frequent gaming, high wagers, or other behaviors. According to these systems, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,761,647 to Boushy, a casino player's gaming sessions are tracked using a tracking card, which is a card having a magnetic strip encoded with player information. In operation, a casino player slides the tracking card into a card reading device of a game machine prior to initiating a gaming session with the game machine. The game machine retrieves the player information encoded on the tracking card, collects gaming information during the gaming session, and transmits the gaming information and the player information to a central database so that the gaming information can be associated with the casino player. At periodic intervals, the database is analyzed to determine whether to offer a product to the casino player, what product to offer, and at what price.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In conventional systems, such as the one described in the article &#x201c;Getting Your Share Of Free Stuff&#x201d;, &#xa9;1997 Casino World Holdings, Ltd., the database analysis proceeds as follows. First, metrics are calculated based on the gaming information associated with a casino player, including an average amount per wager, a total amount wagered per session, an average loss per session, a total loss, a session theoretical win, or other gaming-related data. Next, the metrics are used to determine a product offer. In this regard, the central database stores tables which associate gaming metrics with specific product offers. For example, a database table may associate a discounted hotel room with a $25 to $50 average wager, a free hotel room with a $50 to $100 average wager, a free hotel room and meals with a $100 to $150 average wager, and so on. Therefore, at specified periods, a product is offered to a casino player based on the tables and on gaming information associated with the casino player. Alternatively, a casino player may be presented with the tables and also with metrics corresponding to the casino player's gaming history. In the latter case, the casino player approaches a casino representative to redeem an appropriate product.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although the conventional automated systems allow determination and management of product offers on a large scale, their static nature precludes easy adaptation to changes in the market for offered products. For example, hotel rooms, show tickets, and the like may be sold for one price during weekdays and four times that price during certain events, such as a championship boxing match, COMDEX, or other popular event. Accordingly, use of static tables often results in a situation in which an increase in a casino's profit resulting from a product offer is less than a profit which could have been realized by the casino by selling the product through conventional retail channels, such as a retail store, an online store, a catalog, a toll-free access number, or the like. As a result, a casino is unable to maximize a difference between an increase in the casino's profit resulting from a product offer and a profit which could have been realized by the casino through a conventional sale of the product.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, conventional systems do not consider wasted inventory in determining whether to offer a product to a casino player. Using the above example, hotel rooms are only offered to casino players wagering at least $50 on average. This rule does not change, even if a hotel room will be vacant on a particular night. Accordingly, no revenue is generated by the hotel room where revenue may have been generated by offering the hotel room to a casino player averaging less than $50 per wager.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the foregoing, what is needed is an efficient system for determining appropriate products to offer to a casino player in a manner which increases casino profit to a greater extent than conventional systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In consideration of the above needs, Applicants have discovered a system to determine a product to be offered to a casino player based on an approximate maximum price for which the product may be sold through a retail channel. Advantageously, the approximate maximum price can be used to determine an approximate profit which may be realized by selling the product through a retail channel. The approximate profit can be compared to a potential increase in a casino's profit due to offering the product to a casino player, and a product to offer can be thereby determined in a manner which maximizes casino profit with respect to the product.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, the present invention relates to identification of a product which may be offered to a casino player based on gaming activity of the casino player, and determination of an approximate maximum price for which the product may be sold through a retail channel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the present invention concerns reception of player data corresponding to gaming activity of a casino player, determination of an approximate maximum price for which the product may be sold through a retail channel, and determination to offer the product to the casino player based on the player data and on the price.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention also concerns a system to receive player data corresponding to gaming activity of a casino player, to identify a product to offer to the casino player based on the received player data and a first rule, and to determine a price for the product based on a second rule corresponding to the product.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With these and other advantages and features of the invention that will become hereinafter apparent, the nature of the invention may be more clearly understood by reference to the following detailed description of the invention, the appended claims and to the several drawings attached hereto.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">To ensure clarity of the following detailed description, set forth below are definitions of terms used herein. The scope of the present invention is not to be deemed limited by the definitions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Cash out: the act of converting casino credit to cash or tokens. For example, a cash out from a game machine may include receiving cash or tokens based on a number of credits stored in the machine, and a cash out from a casino may include receiving currency in exchange for credits, such as tokens or chips, honored by the casino.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Casino: an entity providing gaming activity to players. As used herein, a casino may be a single entity providing gaming, entertainment, accommodations, and meals, an arcade, a retail store providing game machines, a network proprietor providing game machines at several remote locations, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Casino Player: an individual or group of individuals participating in gaming activity at a casino.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Current Price: an approximate maximum price for which a product may be sold through a retail channel. A current price of a product may be different from a list price of the product, especially if demand for and/or supply of the product has changed since the list price was established.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Current Value: an approximate profit that may be obtained by selling a product through a retail channel. A current value may be obtained by subtracting a cost of a product from a current price of the product.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Game Machine: a machine operated by a casino player for gaming purposes. Examples include slot machines, video poker machines, video blackjack machines, and devices associated with table games such as blackjack, roulette, or craps.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">List Price: a price for which a product is offered for sale through a retail channel. In a brick-and-mortar retail environment, a list price may be a price printed on a price tag affixed to a product, a sale price of the product, or another price charged to customers for the product.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Offer Price: a price accompanying a product offer which must be paid by a casino player to receive the offered product. For example, a casino may offer a casino player, based on the casino player's gaming history, a one-night stay in a standard hotel room for a $10 offer price.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Product: any good or service that may be provided to a casino player. Examples include a hotel room, a buffet, a ticket to a show, and a plane ticket.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As a brief description of one embodiment of the invention, a hotel room for the current night is considered, the hotel room being owned by a casino and having a list price of $100. According to the embodiment, it is determined that the hotel room has a current price of $200. In other words, it is determined that an approximate maximum price for which the hotel room may be sold through a retail channel is $200, despite its $100 list price. Such a difference between the list price and the current price may be due to a popular event occurring around the current night, such as COMDEX or a heavyweight championship boxing match.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Based on player gaming data, it is determined that a first casino player will likely lose, if he spends the current night at the hotel, $300 more than he would otherwise lose to the casino. Therefore, it is determined that offering the hotel room to the casino player for free will likely result in $100 more profit for the casino than could be generated by selling the hotel room through a retail channel. Accordingly, if no other casino player is identified who would lose more than $300 as a result of the offer, the hotel room is offered to the first casino player. It should be noted that this brief description is not intended to define the scope of the invention, but rather to quickly familiarize the reader with some of the concepts set forth in more detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">System</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a casino system in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As shown, the casino system <b>100</b> includes a controller <b>200</b> in communication with game machines <b>300</b> to <b>340</b>. Although the communication media disposed between each of the game machines <b>300</b> to <b>340</b> and the controller <b>200</b> are represented as hard-wired direct connections, it should be understood that each of the game machines <b>300</b> to <b>340</b> may be connected to a network, such as a Local Area Network or a Wide Area Network, to which the controller <b>200</b> is also connected. Other networks which may be used in accordance with the present invention are a satellite-based network, a cellular network, an RF network, a telephone network, a cable television network, a fiber optic network, or any other network for transferring data between devices. Generally, it should be noted that the controller <b>200</b> may be in communication with hundreds or thousands of game machines, and that each game machine may be in communication with the controller <b>200</b> using any of the communication media described above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The controller <b>200</b> is operated by a casino and may be a computer server, such as a Sun&#xae; Solaris&#xae; server, providing a database server and a World Wide Web server. Multiple physical devices may be used to perform the functions of controller <b>200</b> according to the present invention, and some or all of these functions may also be performed manually.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of the game machines <b>300</b> to <b>340</b> may comprise a slot machine, a video poker machine, a video blackjack machine, or any other game machine with which a casino player can participate in gaming activity. Each game machine may also comprise a personal computer, such as those based on the Intel&#xae; Pentium&#xae; processor, a portable computer, a dedicated terminal, an internet kiosk, a personal digital assistant, a pager, a cellular phone, a pay phone, a video game, an automated teller machine, a watch, a vending machine, or any other device capable of providing gaming functionality and of transmitting and receiving data to and from the controller <b>200</b>. For example, in embodiments where the controller <b>200</b> includes a Web server for receiving requests for Web pages, for generating Web pages, and for transmitting Web pages over the World Wide Web, the game machine <b>300</b> may be a device capable of transmitting and receiving data over the World Wide Web.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Also in communication with the controller <b>200</b> is a product information system <b>400</b>, a hotel reservation system <b>410</b>, and an entertainment ticket service <b>420</b>. The product information system <b>400</b>, the hotel reservation system <b>410</b>, and the entertainment ticket service <b>420</b> provide product-related data to the controller <b>200</b>, and may be in communication with the controller <b>200</b> via any of the communication media described above with respect to the game machines <b>300</b> to <b>340</b>. As also discussed with respect to the game machines <b>300</b> to <b>340</b>, any number of additional devices may be connected to the controller <b>200</b> for providing product-related data to the controller <b>200</b> and/or to a casino player.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Those skilled in the art will understand that devices in communication with each other need not be continually transmitting data to each other. To the contrary, such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary, and may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time. For example, a device in communication with another device via the World Wide Web may not transmit data to the other device for weeks at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each of the product information system <b>400</b>, the hotel reservation system <b>410</b>, and the entertainment ticket service <b>420</b> may comprise a personal computer, a database server such as an IBM&#xae; AS/4000 server, or another system storing data relating to various products which may be offered to a casino player by a casino. As will be described in detail below, the controller <b>200</b>, according to one embodiment, utilizes received product-related data to determine an approximate maximum price for which the product may be sold through a retail channel. In another embodiment, the controller <b>200</b> utilizes product data such as availability of a product or demand for a product to determine a product to offer to casino players.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The product information system <b>400</b> may store product information corresponding to retail items such as casino-themed clothing and toys, rental items such as car rentals, travel services such as airplane tickets and limousine rentals, and food-related items such as buffets or the like. The stored information corresponding to each product in the product information system <b>400</b> may include a cost of the product, a number of units of the product currently available, a current price for which the product may be sold through a retail channel, a cost of the product, a current value of the product, a formula for deriving a current price of the product, a time by which a product must be sold before perishing (show time in a case of show tickets), or other information.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The hotel reservation system <b>410</b> may store data relating to hotel rooms, such as data concerning a current price for which a hotel room may be sold through a retail channel, costs incurred if a hotel room is not sold (marginal costs), demand, occupancy rates, and list prices (or &#x201c;rack rates&#x201d;). Similarly, the entertainment ticket service <b>420</b> includes data concerning available tickets to shows, such as a number of tickets available, a current price for which a ticket may be sold through a retail channel, costs incurred if a ticket is not sold (marginal costs), current ticket values, available seat locations, ticket list prices, ticket demand, and the like.</p>

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Player Database</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a tabular representation of a portion of the player database <b>265</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. As will be described in detail below, the data in the player database <b>265</b> is used in one embodiment of the invention to determine a product to offer to a casino player. The tabular representation includes a number of sample records, with fields associated with each record. Those skilled in the art will understand that the database <b>265</b> may include any number of records, and that each record may include fields in addition to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The fields of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> specify: i) a player identifier <b>266</b> which uniquely identifies a casino player; ii) a player name <b>267</b> of the individual casino player; iii) a session theoretical win <b>268</b>; iv) a session coin-in <b>269</b>; v) a year-to-date win <b>270</b>; vi) hotel guest information <b>271</b>; and vii) show ticket information <b>272</b>. In a case that several individuals are playing as a team, the names of the several individuals are listed under the player name <b>267</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The controller <b>200</b> may receive the information stored in the player database <b>265</b> from one or a combination of: a casino employee using the input device <b>230</b> and the display <b>240</b> of the controller <b>200</b>; surveys filled out by casino players; the product information system <b>400</b>; the hotel reservation system <b>410</b>; the entertainment ticket service <b>420</b>; the game machines <b>300</b> to <b>340</b>; and other sources. For example, the year-to-date win <b>270</b> corresponding to a casino player may be based on information received from several game machines used by the casino player during a current year.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The session theoretical win <b>268</b> associated with a casino player indicates a theoretical amount of money which should be won by the casino from the casino player during a gaming session. A gaming session is defined, in one embodiment, as a period of time during which a casino player is continuously or semi-continuously gaming. For example, a semi-continuous gaming session may be interrupted by short breaks for a rest, snacks or the like. In other embodiments, a gaming session is defined from the time a player tracking card is inserted into a game machine until a card is ejected therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The session theoretical win <b>268</b> may be calculated using a formula such as &#x201c;Session Theoretical Win=(Average Session Wager)(Number Of Wagers)(Casino Edge)&#x201d;. In this regard, a casino edge is a percentage of total money wagered by casino players that will be kept by the casino, on average. Many game machines can be programmed to provide a particular casino edge. In Las Vegas, typical casino edges for slot machines range from 2% to 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The session coin-in <b>269</b> associated with a casino player indicates an amount of money wagered by the casino player during a current gaming session, and the year-to-date win <b>270</b> indicates an amount won or lost by the casino from the casino player during a current year. Of course, although the tabular representation of the database <b>265</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes information relating to a session or a year, information stored in the database <b>265</b> may also relate to other events or time frames, such as a trip to a casino, a number of trips to one or more casinos, a number of trips to one or more casinos during a predefined number of days prior to a current date, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Examples of other gaming information which may be stored in the database <b>265</b> include alternate currency points earned by a casino player, such as casino credit applicable to product offers, a session win, which is a total amount of money that the casino wins from a casino player during a gaming session, a total length in time of a current session, a paid out jackpot value, or a number of consecutive wins or losses.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Other stored gaming information may include information regarding a casino player's gaming tendencies (e.g. doubling down, taking insurance, drawing to flushes, etc.), identification of other casino players associated with the casino player, information about gaming by the casino player during previous sessions, information about gaming by the casino player which does not occur at the casino (e.g. gaming at other casinos, lottery ticket purchases), and information specifying a frequency with which the casino player participates in gaming activity. Other gaming data which can be tracked and stored is known in the art, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,613,912, 5,761,647, and 6,003,014.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The hotel guest field <b>271</b> and the show ticket field <b>272</b> flag whether or not the casino player is a hotel guest of the casino or has show tickets, respectively. As described below, the hotel guest field <b>271</b> and the show ticket field <b>272</b> may be used to determine a product to offer to the casino player. In some embodiments, casino players may be offered hotel room or show ticket upgrades. In these embodiments, it is advantageous to include in the player database <b>265</b> an indication of the type of hotel room or specific show ticket possessed by the casino player.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The player database <b>265</b> may also include information about a casino player unrelated to gaming, including the casino player's general preferences, sporting events in which the casino player is interested, tourist activities in which the casino player is interested, and stores at which the casino player shops.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Product Database</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> illustrate a tabular representation of a portion of the product database <b>275</b>. The product database <b>275</b> includes data relating to products which may be offered to a casino player in accordance with the present invention. Each product represented in the tabular representation is associated with a record including several fields. The fields specify: i) a product identifier <b>276</b>; ii) a product description <b>277</b>; iii) product inventory <b>278</b>; iv) a list price <b>279</b>; v) a current price <b>280</b>; vi) a product cost <b>281</b>; vii) a current value <b>282</b>; and viii) a current price formula <b>283</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The data stored in the database <b>275</b> may be received from one or a combination of outside sources such as the product information system <b>400</b>, the hotel reservation system <b>410</b>, or the entertainment ticket service <b>420</b>, may be input to the controller <b>200</b> by a casino employee using the input device <b>230</b> and the display <b>240</b>, or may be received from other devices. In this regard, the data may be stored, in whole or in part, in the outside sources as well as or instead of in the data storage device <b>255</b>. The data may also be generated by the controller <b>200</b> based on historical trends or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment, the data stored in the product database <b>275</b> is updated in real time. For example, when a room is reserved at a casino hotel, the hotel reservation system <b>410</b> indicates to the controller <b>200</b> that the room has been reserved, and the controller <b>200</b> updates the product inventory <b>278</b> corresponding to the reserved hotel room. In another example, a hostess at a casino restaurant may use a computer terminal connected to the controller <b>200</b> to indicate to the controller <b>200</b> that the current price <b>280</b> of a lunch buffet is only $5.00, rather than a list price of $10.00, because no one is willing to pay the list price <b>279</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Generally, the product identifier <b>276</b> identifies a particular product which may be offered to a casino player, and the associated product description <b>277</b> provides a description of the product. The product inventory <b>278</b> indicates how many units of the product remain in the casino's inventory, and thereby reflects availability of the product. Of course, some products cannot be associated with a number of units in inventory (massage, gift certificates), and therefore the product inventory <b>278</b> of such products is deemed &#x201c;UNLIMITED&#x201d; in the product database <b>275</b>. As defined above, the list price <b>281</b> specifies a price for which the product is sold through conventional retail channels. For example, a person contacting a hotel to determine a price for a hotel room on a particular day is given the list price of the hotel room.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The current price <b>280</b> specifies an approximate maximum price for which a product may be sold through a retail channel. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the current price <b>280</b> is determined using an associated current price formula <b>283</b>, described below. The current price <b>280</b> is, according to one aspect of the invention, any price used to determine an approximate maximum profit which may be realized by selling the associated product through a retail channel. As will be described in detail below, this profit is used in some embodiments to determine whether or not to offer the associated product to a casino player based on the casino player's gaming activity.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">&#x201c;Current&#x201d;, as used in the term &#x201c;current price&#x201d; is not meant to imply a temporal requirement. For example, if it is determined that an approximate retail price for which a souvenir glass may be sold through a retail channel will rise from $10 to $20 in one week, the current price <b>280</b> of the souvenir glass may be determined to be either $10 or $20.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The current price <b>280</b> may be equal to the list price <b>279</b>, greater than the list price <b>279</b> if the casino determines that it may be able to sell the product through a retail channel for greater than the list price <b>279</b>, or less than the list price <b>279</b> if the casino determines that it may not be able to sell the product through a retail channel for the list price <b>279</b>. The current price <b>280</b> may also be less than, equal to, or greater than a market or &#x201c;spot&#x201d; price, or a transfer rate, which is a price charged by one unit of an entity, such as a hotel department of a casino resort, to another unit, such as a gaming department of the same casino resort.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The current price <b>280</b> may be determined based on availability of the product, demand for the product, a list price of the product, an inventory of the product, historical, current, or forecasted purchasing patterns relating to the product, or various time-dependent factors, such as the day of the week, a number of hours until an event, or the like. For example, a hotel room with a $100 list price <b>279</b> may be sold through a conventional retail channel for $200 on the night of a heavyweight championship boxing match, but for only $50 on a Tuesday in April. Accordingly, the current price <b>280</b> of the hotel room is $200 in the first instance and $50 in the second instance.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Availability of and/or demand for related products may be considered in determining the current price <b>280</b> of a product. For example, if availability of hotel rooms at a casino decreases due to renovations, a current price <b>280</b> for a hotel room at a nearby casino may increase. Also, in a case that demand for flights to Las Vegas decreases due to inclement weather, a current price <b>280</b> for hotel rooms at a Las Vegas casino may decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, determination of the current price <b>280</b> follows revenue management principles. Revenue management principles are known in the art, as described in the book <i>Revenue Management&#x2014;Hard Core Tactics For Market Domination</i>, by Robert G. Cross.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The product cost <b>281</b> indicates a cost to the casino of an associated product. In one embodiment, the product cost <b>281</b> is a cost which will be incurred by the casino if the associated product is provided, and, in another embodiment, the product cost <b>281</b> is a cost which will be incurred by the casino whether or not the product is provided to a casino player. As an example of the latter type of product cost <b>281</b>, a lunch buffet will cost a casino one amount regardless of how many meals are sold.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The current value <b>282</b> of a product is determined by subtracting an associated product cost <b>281</b> from an associated current price <b>280</b>. Accordingly, the current value <b>282</b> represents an approximate maximum profit which may be received by a casino by selling the product through a retail channel for the current price <b>280</b>. It should be noted that the current value <b>282</b> may be a negative value in a case that the product cost <b>281</b> is greater than the current price <b>280</b> for a particular product. The current value <b>282</b> may be represented in dollars or in alternate currency points established by the casino and usable to receive product offers.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As stated above, the current price formula <b>283</b> associated with a product is used to determine the current price <b>280</b> of the product. The current price formula <b>283</b>, according to one embodiment, incorporates revenue management principles to determine an approximate maximum price for which a product may be sold through a retail channel. The current price formula <b>283</b> may take into account any combination of factors, such as the list price <b>279</b> of the product, the product cost <b>281</b>, availability of the product as reflected by metrics such as the product inventory <b>278</b>, and/or product demand as reflected by metrics such as a number of sold out shows, a number of reserved hotel rooms, a number of unsold seats, and/or a current day of the week. As stated above, a current price <b>280</b> of a product may be determined based on demand for a different product. For example, the current price formula <b>283</b> associated with a hotel suite <b>277</b> is a function of a number of sold-out shows.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It should be noted that the current price formulae <b>283</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> are examples only, and that a current price formula <b>283</b> used in conjunction with the present invention may be significantly more complicated, in accordance with known revenue management principles.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Some possible products which may be represented in a database such as the database <b>275</b> include clothing, toys, hotel rooms, car rentals, theater tickets, movie tickets, airplane tickets, limousine rentals, taxi rides, free meals and preferred gaming services. While it is possible to offer any type of product to a casino player in accordance with the invention, the casino may offer those products that have low marginal costs or for which a current price <b>280</b> is easily determined.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Offer Determination Database</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a representation of a portion of the offer determination database <b>285</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The offer determination database <b>285</b> is used in one embodiment to select a product to offer to a casino player which maximizes a difference between an increase in the casino's profit due to the product offer and a profit attainable through sale of the product through a retail channel. The illustrated representation includes two tables <b>286</b> and <b>287</b>, each corresponding to a different casino player identified by an associated player identifier <b>266</b>. Included in each table <b>286</b> and <b>287</b> are records containing associated fields. The fields specify: i) a product identifier <b>276</b> identifying a product from the product database <b>275</b>; ii) a current value <b>282</b> associated with the product in the product database <b>275</b>; iii) an expected revenue from offer <b>288</b>; iv) an expected profit from offer <b>289</b>; and v) a difference <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The expected revenue from offer <b>288</b> associated with a product specifies an increase in casino revenue which is expected if the product is provided to the associated casino player. The increase is defined as an increase over the revenue which would be received from the casino player if the product was not provided. The increased revenue may include components such as money lost by the casino player during gaming, purchases of products by the casino player, and money lost by other casino players due to recommendations made by the casino player. In this regard, it should be noted that promotion of positive feelings toward a casino due to providing a product may result in increased revenue to the casino.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The expected revenue from offer <b>288</b> may be determined based on player gaming data and/or other player information. For example, the expected revenue from offer <b>288</b> associated with a hotel room may equal an average session theoretical win multiplied by an average number of sessions per day. In a case that a product is offered to the casino player for a certain monetary amount (the offer is not free), the monetary amount is added to the associated expected revenue from offer <b>288</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It should be noted that two expected revenues <b>288</b> associated with two different product identifiers <b>276</b> and a same casino player may not have a linear relationship. In this case, offering both products to the casino player would not be expected to generate revenue equal to the sum of the two expected revenues <b>290</b>. For example, an expected revenue generated by offering the products associated with product identifiers <b>276</b> &#x201c;P-12-23455&#x201d; and &#x201c;P-38-90782&#x201d; may be $115, rather than $125, the sum of associated expected revenues <b>288</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The expected profit from offer <b>289</b> associated with a product indicates an expected increase in profit received by the casino if the product is provided to the associated casino player. The expected profit from offer <b>289</b> may be determined by subtracting the product cost <b>281</b> from the expected revenue from offer <b>288</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Finally, the difference <b>290</b> specifies a difference between an expected increase in the casino's profit due to a product offer and an approximate profit attainable through sale of the product through a retail channel. Accordingly, the difference <b>290</b> is calculated, in one embodiment, by subtracting the current value <b>282</b> associated with the product from the associated expected profit from offer <b>289</b>. The difference <b>290</b> is a positive value if more profit is expected to be generated as a result of providing the product than as a result of selling the product through a retail channel, and the difference is negative if more profit will be generated as a result of selling the product through a retail channel. As described in detail below, use of the difference <b>290</b> enables a casino to determine a product to offer to a casino player which maximizes a difference between an increase in the casino's profit due to the product offer and an approximate maximum profit attainable through sale of the product through a retail channel.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Rules Database</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> illustrate a tabular representation of a portion of the rules database <b>295</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The tabular representation includes records corresponding to products, with each record specifying: i) a product description <b>277</b> as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>; ii) a product rule <b>296</b>; and iii) a price rule <b>297</b>. The rules database <b>295</b> may include records and fields in addition to those shown. Generally, the information in the rules database <b>295</b> is used to determine a product to offer to a casino player and an offer price which the casino player must pay for the offered product.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A product rule <b>296</b> is a conditional expression used to determine whether to offer an associated product to a casino player. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, a product rule <b>296</b> is a Boolean expression which may depend upon a wide variety of variables, such as a current value <b>282</b>, product inventory (of the associated product or of another product), player gaming data, and player-related data such as whether the casino player has a hotel room, whether the casino player wants to cash out, or whether the casino player enjoys musicals. The player gaming data and player-related data used to evaluate a product rule may come from any of the databases described above or from other sources, such as surveys or the like. If a product rule is evaluated as TRUE, the associated product is selected as a candidate for offering to a casino player. In one embodiment, the product rule <b>296</b> associated with a product is designed so that the rule <b>286</b> will be TRUE if an increase in a casino's profit due to offering the product will be greater than a profit which would result from selling the product through a retail channel.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The price rule <b>297</b> associated with a record includes data for determining an offer price for which to offer an associated product to a casino player. The price rule <b>297</b> may be a mathematical function depending on variables relating to casino player gaming data and/or product-related data. For example, the rules database <b>295</b> illustrates price rules <b>297</b> in which an offer price depends upon no variables (offer price is FREE), a current value <b>282</b> of an associated product, a product cost <b>281</b>, a session theoretical win <b>268</b>, and a list price <b>279</b>. Product offers having a free offer price are often referred to as complementaries, or &#x201c;comps&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The price rule <b>297</b> associated with a product may, in some circumstances, result in an offer price greater than a product cost <b>281</b>. Such an arrangement is advantageous because the casino receives a profit on the product if the offer is accepted and generates a profit as a result of an increase in gaming which results from the offer. A price rule <b>297</b> associated with a product may also result in an offer price less than a list price <b>279</b> of the product. This arrangement is advantageous because a casino player receiving the offer would perceive that his gaming activity resulted in a product discount, and would thereby be encouraged to increase his gaming activity. In addition, a price rule <b>297</b> may result in an offer price for a product which is less than the product cost <b>279</b>. While the casino risks losing money under such an arrangement, the product may nevertheless be offered under the assumption that the product offer will result in a net profit for the casino due to additional gaming revenues received by the casino (e.g. from increased gaming activity by the casino player) resulting from the offer.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In view of the foregoing, the product rule <b>286</b> and the price rule <b>287</b> provide a system by which a casino manager can easily manipulate which products are offered to a particular casino player and at what price, depending upon information such as a current value of a product, expected revenues resulting from an offer of the product, availability of the product, and/or demand for the product. The casino manager is thereby able to precisely control product offers with the intent that a difference between an increase in a casino's revenue due to offering the product and a cost to the casino of the product will be maximized.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Past Offer Database</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a tabular representation of a portion of the past offer database <b>305</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Generally, the past offer database <b>305</b> tracks, for each offer previously-made, the product that was offered, the casino player to whom the product was offered, the offer price of the product, the time and date of the offer, and the result of the offer. By tracking offers that have been made to casino players and a result of each offer, the controller <b>200</b> can better determine an appropriate product to offer to a casino player in the future. Each record in the past offer database <b>305</b> represents a single past offer, and includes: i) a product identifier <b>276</b>; ii) a player identifier <b>266</b>; iii) an offer price <b>306</b>; iv) a time of offer <b>307</b>; v) a result of offer <b>308</b>; and vi) resulting revenues <b>309</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The product identifier <b>276</b> identifies a product previously offered to a casino player, and the player identifier <b>266</b> identifies the casino player to whom the product was offered. The product identifier <b>276</b> and the player identifier <b>266</b> can be used to obtain information on the offered product and the casino player from the product database <b>275</b> and the player database <b>265</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The offer price <b>306</b> identifies a price for which the product was offered to the casino player identified by the player identifier <b>266</b>. In one embodiment, the offer price <b>306</b> is calculated using a price rule <b>297</b> from the rules database <b>295</b>. The time of offer <b>307</b> indicates the time and date on which the product was offered. The time and date may be determined using the clock <b>250</b> of the controller <b>200</b>, or may be transmitted to the controller <b>200</b> at the time the product is offered by a device in communication with the controller <b>200</b>. The result of offer <b>308</b> indicates whether the casino player accepted or rejected the offer.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The resulting revenues <b>309</b> associated with an offer are revenues accrued by the casino as a result of the associated offer. The resulting revenues <b>309</b> may be used to determine the expected revenue from offer <b>288</b> associated with a product and a casino player in the offer determination database <b>286</b>. Although resulting revenues <b>309</b> usually accrue after acceptance of an offer, it should be noted that resulting revenues <b>309</b> may also accrue as a result of a rejected offer. Accordingly, it may be advisable for a casino to offer a product which will not be accepted if the past offer database <b>305</b> indicates that associated resulting revenues <b>309</b> may accrue. In a case that the offer is rejected, the casino incurs no cost due to the offer and the resulting revenues <b>309</b> are entirely profit. To determine whether revenues have accrued as a result of an offer rejected by a casino player, the casino may ask the casino player at what time they would have stopped gaming if the offer had not been made. Any revenues accrued after the time can be attributed to the rejected offer.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As stated above, the past offer database <b>305</b> can be used to determine a product to offer to a casino player. For example, if the past offer database <b>305</b> shows that a particular casino player has accepted three previous offers for a $50.00 hotel room, a system according to the invention may be biased toward offering the same product to the casino player. In another example, if the past offer database <b>305</b> shows that 97% of all casino players reject an offer for a 50% discount on tickets to a particular show, the controller <b>200</b> may choose not to offer tickets to the particular show. In addition, if a particular casino player always accepts food-related offers and always rejects entertainment-related offers, the controller <b>200</b> may determine that food discounts are more highly valued by the casino player than entertainment-related offers. Therefore, in order to provide gaming incentive to the casino player, only food discounts will be offered to the casino player.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In a slightly more complex example, the controller <b>200</b> may use information stored in the past offer database <b>295</b> to determine that 82% of casino players who are guests of the casino hotel accept an offer for a 50% discount on tickets to a casino show, but only 29% of non-guest casino players accept the offer. Accordingly, the controller <b>200</b> can be programmed so as to offer the discounted tickets only to those casino players who are staying at the casino hotel. In this regard, the casino players staying at the casino hotel can be easily identified with reference to the player database <b>275</b>. Each of the foregoing examples may be implemented by formulating an appropriate product rule <b>296</b> incorporating variables related to past offer information.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Processes</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">I. Determination of Current Price</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart of process steps according to one embodiment of the present invention. In a case that the controller <b>200</b> performs the process steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the process steps may be embodied in hardware within the controller <b>200</b>, in processor-executable process steps stored on a computer-readable medium such as the data storage device <b>255</b> and executed by the processor <b>210</b>, in processor-executable process steps encoded in an electronic signal received by the controller <b>200</b> and executed by the processor <b>210</b>, or in any combination thereof. It should be noted that the process steps may be executed, wholly or in part, by processors located in several devices, such as one of the game machines <b>300</b> through <b>340</b>, the hotel reservation system <b>410</b>, and/or any other device in communication therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It should also be noted that each other flow chart of process steps described herein may be similarly embodied. In addition, the particular arrangement of elements in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, as well as in the flow charts discussed below, is not meant to imply a necessary order to the steps; embodiments of the present invention can be practiced in many different orders.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Briefly, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> process steps include identification of a product which may be offered to a casino player based on gaming activity of the casino player, and determination of an approximate maximum price for which the product may be sold through a retail channel. As a result, a product to offer can be determined in a manner which maximizes casino profit.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Initiation of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> process steps may be triggered in many ways in accordance with the present invention. For example, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> process steps may be executed periodically so as to continually update a current price <b>280</b> associated with each product in the product database <b>275</b>. Alternatively, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> process steps may be executed each time a casino player wins a prize amount, ends a gaming session, requests a cash out, or checks out of a casino hotel.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The process steps begin at step <b>801</b>, in which a product which may be offered to a casino player is identified. In one embodiment, the product is identified from among a plurality of products stored in the product database <b>275</b>. As mentioned above, the product-related data stored in the product database <b>275</b> may be input to the controller <b>200</b> by a casino employee using the input device <b>230</b> and the display <b>240</b>, or may be retrieved from the product information system <b>400</b>, the hotel reservation system <b>410</b>, the entertainment ticket service <b>420</b>, or another system.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, in step <b>802</b>, an approximate maximum price for which the product may be sold through a retail channel is determined. Such a price may be the current price <b>280</b> as defined above. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the approximate maximum price is determined based on demand for and/or availability of the product. In another embodiment, the approximate maximum price is determined in step <b>802</b> using a current price formula <b>283</b> associated with the product in the product database <b>275</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Generally, determination of an approximate maximum price for which a product may be sold through a retail channel advantageously assists a casino in determining a product to offer in a manner which maximizes casino profit. For example, a casino may choose not to offer a product having a determined price which is greater than an expected increase in revenue resulting from the offer. Similarly, a casino may choose to offer a product having the largest difference between an expected increase in revenue and an approximate maximum price determined in step <b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">II. Determination of a Product Offer</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart of processor-executable process steps according to one embodiment of the present invention. Briefly, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> process steps include reception of player data corresponding to gaming activity of a casino player, determination of an approximate maximum price for which a product may be sold through a retail channel, and determination to offer the product to the casino player based on the player data and on the approximate maximum price.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Initially, at step <b>901</b>, player data is received which corresponds to gaming activity of a casino player. It should be noted that the player data may be received in step <b>901</b> periodically, after a gaming session, in response to an event, or according to another schedule. For example, the player data may be received in step <b>901</b> in real time, in response to a request to cash out, or after detection of a casino player win of a prize amount.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As mentioned above, the player data may be received by the controller <b>200</b> from one of the game machines <b>300</b> to <b>340</b>, from a casino employee or the casino player using the input device <b>230</b> and the display <b>240</b>, or from other devices in communication with the controller <b>200</b>, such as the hotel reservation system <b>401</b>, a lottery ticket dispensing device or the like. The player data may include many types of data relating to gaming activity of the casino player, and is stored, in one embodiment, in the player database <b>265</b> of the controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Next, in step <b>902</b>, an approximate maximum price for which a product may be sold through a retail channel is determined for each of a plurality of products. The plurality of products may consist of products pre-selected by a casino manager or otherwise selected by the controller <b>200</b>. In another embodiment, the plurality of products may be those products for which associated information is stored in the product database <b>275</b>. An approximate maximum price for a product may be determined in step <b>902</b> as described above with respect to step <b>802</b>. The determined price of each of the plurality of products may then be stored in association with associated product information in the product database <b>275</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In step <b>903</b>, it is determined to offer one of the plurality of products to the casino player based on the player data and on the approximate maximum price of the one product determined in step <b>902</b>. Generally, the determination in step <b>903</b> is intended to maximize a difference between an increase in casino profit due to a product offer and an approximate maximum profit which could be realized by selling the product through a retail channel. In this regard, an appropriate table <b>286</b> or <b>287</b> of the offer determination database <b>285</b> may be used in step <b>903</b> to select a product having a product identifier <b>276</b> associated with a greatest difference <b>290</b>. In one embodiment, a difference <b>290</b> associated with a selected product in the table <b>286</b> is compared to a difference <b>290</b> associated with the selected product in the table <b>287</b> to determine whether to offer the product to the player associated with the table <b>286</b> or the table <b>287</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Of course, at least one expected revenue from offer <b>288</b> value and associated expected profit from offer <b>289</b> value must be stored in the appropriate table prior to selecting a product in step <b>903</b> based on the difference <b>290</b>. As described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the expected revenue from offer <b>288</b> may be determined based on player data stored in the player database <b>265</b> and/or the past offer database <b>305</b>, and the expected profit from offer <b>289</b> may be determined based on the expected revenue from offer <b>288</b>, the current price <b>280</b> (an approximate maximum price for which a product may be sold through a retail channel), and the product cost <b>281</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Many different factors and methods may be used in the determination of step <b>903</b>. In one example, it is determined to offer a product having a current value <b>282</b> (current price <b>280</b> less product cost <b>281</b>) which is less than a session theoretical win <b>268</b> corresponding to the casino player. In a case that more than one product has a current value <b>282</b> less than the session theoretical win <b>268</b>, stored information regarding the casino player's preferences may be considered to determine which of the more than one products would be most preferred by the casino player. It is desirable to offer a most-preferred product because an offer thereof is believed to provide a greatest incentive to the casino player to continue gaming, and thereby results in a greatest increase in casino profit.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In another embodiment, a product associated with a particular number of alternate currency points as a current value <b>282</b> is determined to be offered if the casino player has earned an equal or greater number of alternate currency points, and if the earned number of alternate currency points is not equal to or greater than a number of alternate currency points corresponding to a product having a greater current value <b>282</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">After it is determined to offer the one product to the casino player in step <b>903</b>, the product is offered to the casino player in step <b>904</b>. The offer may be transmitted from the controller <b>200</b> to the game machine <b>300</b> to <b>340</b> where the casino player is currently located, may be sent to the casino player's home address, may be sent to the casino player by electronic mail, or may be transmitted by telephone. The offer may be presented to the casino player by a casino employee, such as a dealer at a gaming table at which the casino player is currently located. The offer may also be output in step <b>904</b> to a beeper, a personal digital assistant, a casino intercom system, a computer, a television, or a casino kiosk used to present offers to casino players.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In a case that the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> process steps are triggered by an impending payment to be made to the casino player, the casino player may be offered a choice of taking the entire payment or of accepting the offer in exchange for all or part of the payment due. In this regard, the offer of step <b>904</b> may include an offer price to be paid by the casino player. For example, in a case that a casino player wins a prize amount at a game machine, the casino player may be offered a product in exchange for all or part of the prize amount. Also, in a case that a casino player presses the &#x201c;cash out&#x201d; button on a game machine, the casino player may be offered the one product in exchange for all or some of the credits stored in the machine. Moreover, a casino player may be offered the one product in step <b>904</b> in exchange for all or part of casino credits, such as chips or tokens, brought to a cashier window for exchange into currency.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In one embodiment of step <b>904</b>, the casino player is presented with the list price of the offered product. For example, the casino player is presented with the offer &#x201c;Congratulations! Press the &#x201c;1&#x201d; button to receive your $50.00 jackpot. Press the &#x201c;2&#x201d; button to receive $20.00 and a hotel room on the house (list price $100.00)&#x201d;. Such a presentation is believed to incent increased gaming because the casino player perceives that he is receiving a special deal on a desired product, and because he may continue to gamble on the day following his hotel stay. According to another embodiment, more than one product is determined to be offered to the casino player in step <b>903</b> and the offer in step <b>904</b> includes a choice of the more than one product.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The offer may also include conditions that must be fulfilled before the one product will be provided to the casino player. For example, the casino player may be required to perform a certain action, such as committing to a certain amount of future gaming, or a specific event must occur, such as a specified sporting event result or the like. Using the former example, a player may be penalized if the commitment to future gaming is not honored within a pre-specified time period.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Of course, the casino player may be presented with several of the alternative types of offers discussed above. For example, after winning a $100.00 prize amount for hitting a jackpot at a game machine <b>300</b>, the controller <b>200</b> may transmit the following offers to a casino player: (i) $100.00 cash; (ii) $50.00 cash and two tickets to a show; or (iii) $10,000.00 cash if the jackpot is hit again within one hour. Such a process is described in commonly-assigned co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/769,085, filed Dec. 18, 1996, entitled &#x201c;Slot Machine Advertising/Sales Method&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">It should be noted that step <b>904</b> may be delayed until a particular event occurs. For example, while a casino player is eating dinner, it may be determined that the casino player is to receive an offer for a free hotel room. However, according to this embodiment, the casino player can learn of the offer only if he returns to the casino floor and operates a game machine after finishing dinner. If this policy is known to casino players, the policy may encourage casino players to return to the gaming floor. It is desirable to encourage casino players to return to the gaming floor because further gaming may result.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In another embodiment, a casino player may be permitted to ask for more information about the one product after step <b>904</b> and before accepting the offer. For example, in a case that the offer is for two tickets to a show, the casino player may ask and receive additional information such as a time of the show, seat location, plot line, etc. Of course, this information may be included in the offer made in step <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">III. Rule-Based Determination of a Product Offer</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a flow chart of processor-executable process steps according to an embodiment of the present invention in which the rules database <b>295</b> is utilized. Generally, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> process steps include reception of player data corresponding to gaming activity of a casino player, determination of a product to offer to the casino player based on the received player data and a first rule, and determination of an offer price for the product based on a second rule associated with the product.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> process steps begin at step <b>1001</b>, in which player data corresponding to gaming activity of a casino player are received. Step <b>1001</b> may be executed in response to a particular event, or according to a particular schedule. For example, as described with respect to step <b>901</b>, the player data may be received in step <b>1001</b> in real time, in response to a request to cash out, or after detection of a casino player win.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As also described with respect to step <b>901</b>, the player data may be received by the controller <b>200</b> in step <b>1001</b> from one of the game machines <b>300</b> to <b>340</b>, from a casino employee or the casino player using the input device <b>230</b> and the display <b>240</b>, or from other devices in communication with the controller <b>200</b>. The player data may include many types of data relating to gaming activity of the casino player, and may be stored in the player database <b>265</b> of the controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In step <b>1002</b>, a product to offer to the casino player is determined based on the received player data and a first rule. In this regard, the rules database <b>295</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> includes a product rule <b>296</b> corresponding to each product therein which can be used in step <b>1002</b> to determine a product to offer to the casino player. As shown in the tabular representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the rule may be a function of received player data, such as an average session coin-in, a total player credit, a year-to-date win, or the like. The product rule <b>296</b> may also be a function of player information unrelated to gaming, such as preferences or the like, and information regarding past offers stored in the past offer database <b>305</b>. Generally, a product rule <b>296</b> is evaluated to determine if it is logically TRUE and, if so, a product associated with the rule is determined in step <b>1002</b> to be a product to offer to the casino player.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Next, in step <b>1003</b>, an offer price for the product is determined based on a second rule associated with the product. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the rules database <b>295</b> also includes a second rule corresponding to a product. The second rule, a price rule <b>297</b>, may also be a function of received player data, such as a session coin-in, a total player credit, a year-to-date win, or the like. The price rule <b>297</b> may also take into account player preferences, player history, and/or past offers stored in the past offer database <b>305</b>. In one embodiment, the price rule <b>297</b> is an equation which produces a price. Accordingly, appropriate values for each variable specified in a price rule <b>297</b> are substituted therein to determine an offer price for the product in step <b>1003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Finally, in step <b>1004</b>, the product is offered to the casino player for the determined offer price. The product may be offered using any of the offering mechanisms and methods described above with respect to step <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">It should be noted that the process steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> advantageously allow a casino to exert control over particular products which are offered and offer prices of the products based on changing and dynamic variables. As a result, a casino is able to determine a product to offer to a casino player which maximizes a difference between increased profit resulting from the product offer and a profit which would be realized through sale of the product through a retail channel.</p>
