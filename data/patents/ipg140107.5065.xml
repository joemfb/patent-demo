<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate distributing and/or utilizing a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifier (ID) that identifies a CSG corresponding to a base station and a CSG indication that distinguishes between the base station permitting access to members of the CSG and permitting access to members and non-members of the CSG. For instance, the CSG ID can uniquely identify the CSG corresponding to the base station. A mobile device can receive the CSG ID and the CSG indication from the base station. Further, the received CSG ID can be compared to CSG IDs included in an allowed CSG list to recognize whether the mobile device is a member or a non-member of the CSG. Moreover, a preference for selecting the base station as compared to a disparate base station can be generated as a function of the received CSG ID and CSG indication.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description relates generally to wireless communications, and more particularly to advertising and utilizing Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifiers (IDs) that signify corresponding CSGs of base stations and CSG indications that specify whether the base stations allow access to members of respective CSGs or members and non-members of respective CSGs in a wireless communication environment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as, for example, voice, data, and so on. Typical wireless communication systems can be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, . . . ). Examples of such multiple-access systems can include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and the like. Additionally, the systems can conform to specifications such as third generation partnership project (3GPP), 3GPP long term evolution (LTE), ultra mobile broadband (UMB), and/or multi-carrier wireless specifications such as evolution data optimized (EV-DO), one or more revisions thereof, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems can simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further, communications between mobile devices and base stations can be established via single-input single-output (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and so forth. In addition, mobile devices can communicate with other mobile devices (and/or base stations with other base stations) in peer-to-peer wireless network configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Heterogeneous wireless communication systems commonly can include various types of base stations, each of which can be associated with differing cell sizes. For instance, macro cell base stations typically leverage antenna(s) installed on masts, rooftops, other existing structures, or the like. Further, macro cell base stations oftentimes have power outputs on the order of tens of watts, and can provide coverage for large areas. The femto cell base station is another class of base station that has recently emerged. Femto cell base stations are commonly designed for residential or small business environments, and can provide wireless coverage to mobile devices using a wireless technology (e.g., 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) or Long Term Evolution (LTE), 1&#xd7; Evolution-Data Optimized (1&#xd7;EV-DO), . . . ) to communicate with the mobile devices and an existing broadband Internet connection (e.g., digital subscriber line (DSL), cable, . . . ) for backhaul. A femto cell base station can also be referred to as a Home Evolved Node B (HeNB), a Home Node B (HNB), a femto cell, or the like. Examples of other types of base stations include pico cell base stations, micro cell base stations, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Mobile devices are typically able to detect presence of one or more proximate base stations of various types (e.g., macro cell, micro cell, femto cell, pico cell, . . . ). Moreover, a particular base station can be selected to be accessed by a given mobile device. However, when the given mobile device is within vicinity of two or more base stations, conventional techniques oftentimes fail to enable the given mobile device to effectively identify which base station to prefer for selection (e.g., to camp on, register with, access, . . . ). Conventional selection approaches can be detrimentally impacted by some base stations permitting access by substantially any mobile device and disparate base stations allowing access by authorized mobile device(s) to the exclusion of unauthorized mobile device(s). Moreover, common selection techniques can be problematic when preferential billing arrangements are leveraged where certain base stations permit access by substantially any mobile device, while a subset of these mobile devices are preferentially billed as compared to other mobile devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with one or more embodiments and corresponding disclosure thereof, various aspects are described in connection with distributing and/or utilizing a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifier (ID) that identifies a CSG corresponding to a base station and a CSG indication that distinguishes between the base station permitting access to members of the CSG and permitting access to members and non-members of the CSG. For instance, the CSG ID can uniquely identify the CSG corresponding to the base station. A mobile device can receive the CSG ID and the CSG indication from the base station. Further, the received CSG ID can be compared to CSG IDs included in an allowed CSG list to recognize whether the mobile device is a member or a non-member of the CSG. Moreover, a preference for selecting the base station as compared to a disparate base station can be generated as a function of the received CSG ID and CSG indication.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to related aspects, a method is described herein. The method can include receiving an advertised Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifier (ID) that identifies a CSG corresponding to a base station. Further, the method can include receiving an advertised Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifier (ID) that identifies a CSG corresponding to a base station. Moreover, the method can comprise identifying whether the advertised CSG ID matches one or more CSG IDs included in an allowed CSG list.

Moreover, the computer-readable medium can include code for causing at least one computer to identify whether the advertised CSG ID matches one or more CSG IDs included in an allowed CSG list. Still yet, the computer-readable medium can include code for causing at least one computer to generate a preference for selecting the base station as compared to a disparate base station when the advertised CSG indication specifies that the base station permits access to the members and the non-members of the CSG and the advertised CSG ID matches at least one of the one or more CSG IDs included in the allowed CSG list.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Yet another aspect relates to an apparatus that can include a receiving component that obtains an advertised Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifier (ID) that identifies a CSG corresponding to a base station and an advertised CSG indication that differentiates between the base station permitting access to members of the CSG and permitting access to members and non-members of the CSG. Moreover, the apparatus can include a comparison component that evaluates whether the advertised CSG ID matches a CSG ID included in an allowed CSG list. The apparatus can further comprise a preference generation component that generates a preference for selecting the base station as compared to a disparate base station when the advertised CSG indication specifies that the base station permits access to the members and the non-members of the CSG and the advertised CSG ID of the base station matches the CSG ID included in the allowed CSG list.</p>

The method can include transmitting a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifier (ID) that identifies a CSG pertaining to a base station. Further, the method can include transmitting a CSG indication that distinguishes between the base station permitting access to members of the CSG and permitting access to the members and non-members of the CSG.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used in this application, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;module,&#x201d; &#x201c;system&#x201d; and the like are intended to include a computer-related entity, such as but not limited to hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component can be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components can communicate by way of local and/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets, such as data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a terminal, which can be a wired terminal or a wireless terminal. A terminal can also be called a system, device, subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile, mobile device, remote station, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, terminal, communication device, user agent, user device, or user equipment (UE). A wireless terminal can be a cellular telephone, a satellite phone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, a computing device, or other processing devices connected to a wireless modem. Moreover, various aspects are described herein in connection with a base station. A base station can be utilized for communicating with wireless terminal(s) and can also be referred to as an access point, a Node B, an Evolved Node B (eNode B, eNB), a femto cell, a pico cell, a micro cell, a macro cell, a Home Evolved Node B (HeNB), a Home Node B (HNB), or some other terminology.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is intended to mean an inclusive &#x201c;or&#x201d; rather than an exclusive &#x201c;or.&#x201d; That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase &#x201c;X employs A or B&#x201d; is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase &#x201c;X employs A or B&#x201d; is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The techniques described herein can be used for various wireless communication systems such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), single carrier-frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) and other systems. The terms &#x201c;system&#x201d; and &#x201c;network&#x201d; are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system can implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), CDMA2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. Further, CDMA2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system can implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system can implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE and GSM are described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; (3GPP). Additionally, CDMA2000 and Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB) are described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project 2&#x201d; (3GPP2). Further, such wireless communication systems can additionally include peer-to-peer (e.g., mobile-to-mobile) ad hoc network systems often using unpaired unlicensed spectrums, 802.xx wireless LAN, BLUETOOTH and any other short- or long-range, wireless communication techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) utilizes single carrier modulation and frequency domain equalization. SC-FDMA has similar performance and essentially the same overall complexity as those of an OFDMA system. A SC-FDMA signal has lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) because of its inherent single carrier structure. SC-FDMA can be used, for instance, in uplink communications where lower PAPR greatly benefits access terminals in terms of transmit power efficiency. Accordingly, SC-FDMA can be implemented as an uplink multiple access scheme in 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) or Evolved UTRA.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Various aspects or features described herein can be implemented as a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques. The term &#x201c;article of manufacture&#x201d; as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media. For example, computer-readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strips, etc.), optical disks (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD), etc.), smart cards, and flash memory devices (e.g., EPROM, card, stick, key drive, etc.). Additionally, various storage media described herein can represent one or more devices and/or other machine-readable media for storing information. The term &#x201c;machine-readable medium&#x201d; can include, without being limited to, wireless channels and various other media capable of storing, containing, and/or carrying instruction(s) and/or data.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wireless communication system <b>100</b> is illustrated in accordance with various embodiments presented herein. System <b>100</b> comprises a base station <b>102</b> that can include multiple antenna groups. For example, one antenna group can include antennas <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, another group can comprise antennas <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, and an additional group can include antennas <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. Two antennas are illustrated for each antenna group; however, more or fewer antennas can be utilized for each group. Base station <b>102</b> can additionally include a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, etc.), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Base station <b>102</b> can communicate with one or more mobile devices such as mobile device <b>116</b> and mobile device <b>122</b>; however, it is to be appreciated that base station <b>102</b> can communicate with substantially any number of mobile devices similar to mobile devices <b>116</b> and <b>122</b>. Mobile devices <b>116</b> and <b>122</b> can be, for example, cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld communication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, and/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system <b>100</b>. As depicted, mobile device <b>116</b> is in communication with antennas <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, where antennas <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> transmit information to mobile device <b>116</b> over a forward link <b>118</b> and receive information from mobile device <b>116</b> over a reverse link <b>120</b>. Moreover, mobile device <b>122</b> is in communication with antennas <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, where antennas <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> transmit information to mobile device <b>122</b> over a forward link <b>124</b> and receive information from mobile device <b>122</b> over a reverse link <b>126</b>. In a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, forward link <b>118</b> can utilize a different frequency band than that used by reverse link <b>120</b>, and forward link <b>124</b> can employ a different frequency band than that employed by reverse link <b>126</b>, for example. Further, in a time division duplex (TDD) system, forward link <b>118</b> and reverse link <b>120</b> can utilize a common frequency band and forward link <b>124</b> and reverse link <b>126</b> can utilize a common frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each group of antennas and/or the area in which they are designated to communicate can be referred to as a sector of base station <b>102</b>. For example, antenna groups can be designed to communicate to mobile devices in a sector of the areas covered by base station <b>102</b>. In communication over forward links <b>118</b> and <b>124</b>, the transmitting antennas of base station <b>102</b> can utilize beamforming to improve signal-to-noise ratio of forward links <b>118</b> and <b>124</b> for mobile devices <b>116</b> and <b>122</b>. Also, while base station <b>102</b> utilizes beamforming to transmit to mobile devices <b>116</b> and <b>122</b> scattered randomly through an associated coverage, mobile devices in neighboring cells can be subject to less interference as compared to a base station transmitting through a single antenna to all its mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It is contemplated that base station <b>102</b> can be any type of base station (e.g., macro cell base station, micro cell base station, pico cell base station, femto cell base station, . . . ). Each mobile device <b>116</b>, <b>122</b> can generate a preference for selecting a respective target base station (e.g., base station <b>102</b>, disparate base station (not shown), . . . ). According to an illustration, various access control approaches can be leveraged by mobile devices <b>116</b>, <b>122</b> (e.g. operator controlled approach, user and operator controlled approach, . . . ). Following this illustration and as described herein, base station <b>102</b> can broadcast information to aid mobile devices <b>116</b>, <b>122</b> in cell selection. The broadcasted information, for instance, can include a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifier (ID) (e.g. CSG identity, . . . ) that identifies a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) associated with base station <b>102</b>. Moreover, the broadcasted information can include a CSG indication that distinguishes between base station <b>102</b> permitting access to only members of the CSG and permitting access to both members and non-members of the CSG. Additionally or alternatively, base station <b>102</b> can employ signaling and/or error codes to efficiently handle cell reselection. Further, signaling and/or an application can be utilized to provision respective allowed CSG lists in mobile devices <b>116</b>, <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Base station <b>102</b> can be a CSG base station, a hybrid base station, or an open base station. A CSG base station refers to a base station with restricted association accessible by members of a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) (e.g., non-accessible by non-members of the CSG, . . . ). A CSG base station can also be referred to as a closed base station. A CSG is a set of base stations that share a common access control list of mobile devices. Further, a CSG base station can advertise a corresponding CSG ID, which specifies the CSG corresponding to the CSG base station. An open base station refers to a base station with no restricted association. For instance, an open base station can forgo advertising a CSG ID. Moreover, a hybrid base station can advertise a CSG ID, yet can allow access to both members and non-members of the CSG associated with the CSG ID. For example, a hybrid base station can support preferential billing for members over non-members. According to another example, a hybrid base station can provide priority to members over non-members (e.g. if there is a shortage of resources, then non-members can be dropped prior to members, . . . ). By way of a further example, a hybrid base station can supply a higher level of Quality of Service (QoS) to members versus non-members. It is contemplated, however, that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the aforementioned examples.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A CSG ID is a binary based identifier associated with a subscriber group. The CSG ID can be used to identify a subscriber group (e.g., CSG, . . . ) associated with a CSG base station or a hybrid base station, and can be utilized to support restricted association for a CSG base station. The CSG ID can uniquely identify the CSG associated with the CSG base station or hybrid base station; however, the claimed subject matter is not so limited. Further, the CSG ID associated with a base station typically is not based on an Internet Protocol (IP) address. Further, it is contemplated that more than one base station can share a common CSG ID; however, the claimed subject matter is not so limited. By way of another example, subnets can be used for the CSG ID to enable multiple CSG IDs for an enterprise/hotel while still allowing a single CSG ID for provisioning and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">From a perspective of mobile devices <b>116</b>, <b>122</b>, a CSG base station (e.g., base station <b>102</b>, . . . ) can be a home base station, a guest base station, or an alien base station. A home base station refers to a CSG base station which mobile device <b>116</b>, <b>122</b> is authorized to access. A guest base station refers to a CSG base station which mobile device <b>116</b>, <b>122</b> is temporarily authorized to access. Further, an alien base station refers to a CSG base station which mobile device <b>116</b>, <b>122</b> is not authorized to access.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Moreover, from a standpoint of a CSG base station (e.g. base station <b>102</b>, . . . ), each mobile device <b>116</b>, <b>122</b> can be a home mobile device, a guest mobile device or an alien mobile device. A home mobile device refers to a mobile device authorized for access. Moreover, a guest mobile device refers to a mobile device temporarily authorized for access. Further, an alien mobile device refers to a mobile device not authorized for access.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrated is a system <b>200</b> that supports access control for Closed Subscriber Groups (CSGs) in a wireless communication environment. System <b>200</b> includes a target base station <b>202</b> that can transmit and/or receive information, signals, data, instructions, commands, bits, symbols, and the like. Moreover, system <b>200</b> can include any number of disparate base station(s) <b>204</b>, which can be substantially similar to target base station <b>202</b>. Target base station <b>202</b> can communicate with a mobile device <b>206</b> via the forward link and/or reverse link. Mobile device <b>206</b> can transmit and/or receive information, signals, data, instructions, commands, bits, symbols, and the like. Moreover, although not shown, it is contemplated that any number of mobile devices similar to mobile device <b>206</b> can be included in system <b>200</b>. Further, it is contemplated that target base station <b>202</b> and disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> can each be any type of base station (e.g., femto cell base station, pico cell base station, micro cell base station, macro cell base station, . . . ).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to an example, target base station <b>202</b> can be a CSG base station, a hybrid base station, or an open base station. For instance, if target base station <b>202</b> is a CSG base station or a hybrid base station, then target base station <b>202</b> can be associated with a CSG, and the CSG can be identified by a CSG ID. The CSG can be uniquely identified by the CSG ID, for example. According to another example, the CSG can be uniquely identified by the CSG ID in an operator network. Pursuant to another illustration, disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> can include CSG base station(s), hybrid base station(s), and/or open base station(s). Following this illustration, disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> that are CSG base station(s) or hybrid base station(s) can be associated with respective CSG(s), and each of the respective CSG(s) can correspond to respective CSG ID(s).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Target base station <b>202</b> can further include an identity advertising component <b>208</b> and a mode publicizing component <b>210</b>. Identity advertising component <b>208</b> can transmit a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifier (ID) that identifies a CSG corresponding to target base station <b>202</b>. Identity advertising component <b>208</b> can send the CSG ID over a downlink. The CSG ID transferred over the downlink can be utilized by mobile device <b>206</b> to recognize whether it is a member or a non-member of the CSG corresponding to target base station <b>202</b>. According to an example, an open CSG ID can be defined for an open base station (e.g., if target base station <b>202</b> is an open base station, . . . ), and the open CSG ID can be advertised by identity advertising component <b>208</b> (e.g., target base station <b>202</b> advertising the open CSG ID can be preferred over disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> lacking an advertised open CSG ID, . . . ); further, every user can be a member of a CSG corresponding to the open CSG ID. By way of another example, a hybrid base station (e.g., if target base station <b>202</b> is a hybrid base station, . . . ) can use an open CSG ID or a unique CSG ID, which can be disseminated by identity advertising component <b>208</b>. Following this example, every user can be a member of a CSG associated with the open CSG ID, while a subset of users can be a member of a CSG corresponding to the unique CSG ID. It is to be appreciated, however, that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the aforementioned examples.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moreover, mode publicizing component <b>210</b> can transmit a CSG indication over the downlink. The CSG indication can distinguish between target base station <b>202</b> being a CSG base station and a hybrid base station. Further, the CSG indication yielded by mode publicizing component <b>210</b> can signify whether target base station <b>202</b> permits access to only members of the CSG associated with the advertised CSG ID sent by identity advertising component <b>208</b> or both members and non-members of the CSG associated with the advertised CSG ID transmitted by identity advertising component <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to an example, a system information block type 1 message (SIB1) for target base station <b>202</b> can include informational elements (IEs) related to the CSG ID and the CSG indication (e.g., SIB1 can be yielded by identity advertising component <b>208</b> and mode publicizing component <b>210</b>, . . . ). The CSG ID (e.g., CSG identity, . . . ) can be an identity of the CSG within a primary Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) the cell (e.g., target base station <b>202</b>, . . . ) belongs to. The CSG ID IE can be present in a CSG cell. Moreover, the CSG ID IE can be present in a hybrid cell. Further, the CSG indication can be a Boolean value. If the CSG indication is set to true, then a mobile device (e.g., mobile device <b>206</b>, . . . ) is only allowed to access the cell if the CSG ID matches an entry in the whitelist (e.g., an allowed CSG list <b>218</b> described herein, that the mobile device has stored.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, it is contemplated that SIB1 can include another IE (e.g., CSG-included, . . . ) that indicates whether or not a CSG ID is present; however, the claimed subject matter is not so limited. By way of another example, SIB3 for target base station <b>202</b> can include the IEs pertaining to the CSG ID and the CSG indication; yet, the claimed subject matter is not limited to the foregoing example.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to a further example, it is contemplated that identity advertising component <b>208</b> can advertise more than one CSG ID for target base station <b>202</b>. For instance, a primary CSG ID can be advertised in a system information block type 1 message (SIB1), while secondary CSG IDs for target base station <b>202</b> can be included in a new SIBx (e.g., which can be rarely sent, . . . ). It is to be appreciated, yet, that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the foregoing (e.g., identity advertising component <b>208</b> can advertise one CSG ID for target base station <b>202</b>, . . . ).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Although not shown, it is further contemplated that disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> can include an identity advertising component similar to identity advertising component <b>208</b> of target base station <b>202</b> and/or a mode publicizing component similar to mode publicizing component <b>210</b> of target base station <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Mobile device <b>206</b> can include a receiving component <b>212</b>, a comparison component <b>214</b>, and a preference generation component <b>216</b>. Receiving component <b>212</b> can obtain the advertised CSG ID that identifies the CSG corresponding to target base station <b>202</b> and the advertised CSG indication that differentiates between target base station <b>202</b> being a CSG base station and hybrid base station. Further, the advertised CSG indication can distinguish between target base station <b>202</b> permitting access only to members of the CSG identified by the advertised CSG ID and permitting access to both members and non-members of the CSG identified by the advertised CSG ID. Receiving component <b>212</b> can similarly obtain advertised CSG ID(s) and advertised CSG indication(s) from one or more disparate base station(s) <b>204</b>. It is to be appreciated, however, that one or more of disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> can lack an association with a respective CSG; thus, such disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> lacking an association with corresponding CSG(s) can forgo advertising respective CSG ID(s) and CSG indication(s).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Comparison component <b>214</b> can evaluate whether the advertised CSG ID obtained by receiving component <b>212</b> from target base station <b>202</b> matches a CSG ID included in an allowed CSG list <b>218</b>. Moreover, comparison component <b>214</b> can analyze whether the advertised CSG ID(s) collected by receiving component <b>212</b> from disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> match CSG ID(s) included in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, preference generation component <b>216</b> can generate a preference for selecting target base station <b>202</b> (or one of disparate base station(s) <b>204</b>) as a function of the advertised CSG ID(s) and advertised CSG indication(s). By way of example, preference generation component <b>216</b> can yield the preference for selecting target base station <b>202</b> as compared to disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> when the advertised CSG indication from target base station <b>202</b> specifies that target base station <b>202</b> is a hybrid base station (e.g., permits access to both members and non-members of a CSG associated with the advertised CSG ID, . . . ) and the advertised CSG ID of target base station <b>202</b> matches the CSG ID included in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>. Following this example, preference generation component <b>216</b> can generate the preference for selecting target base station <b>202</b> rather disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> that lack an association with respective CSG(s) (e.g., CSG ID(s) fail to be obtained by receiving component <b>212</b> from such disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> lacking association with respective CSG(s), . . . ). Moreover, pursuant to the foregoing example, preference generation component <b>216</b> can yield the preference for choosing target base station <b>202</b> in comparison to disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> with received CSG ID(s) that lack match(es) in allowed CSG list <b>218</b> as recognized by comparison component <b>214</b>. According to another example, preference generation component <b>216</b> can provide the preference to select target base station <b>202</b> when the advertised CSG indication obtained from target base station <b>202</b> specifies that target base station <b>202</b> permits access to members of the CSG (e.g., identified by the advertised CSG ID received from target base station <b>202</b>, target base station <b>202</b> is a CSG base station, . . . ) and the advertised CSG ID matches at least one of the CSG IDs included in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>. Following the aforementioned example, target base station <b>202</b> can be preferred to disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> associated with disparate CSG indication(s) which signify that disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> permit access to members and non-members of CSG(s) specified by corresponding advertised CSG ID(s) (e.g. a CSG base station can be preferentially chosen over a hybrid base station by preference generation component <b>216</b>, . . . ). It is to be appreciated, however, that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the aforementioned examples.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to another illustration, preference generation component <b>216</b> can generate the preference for selecting target base station <b>202</b> as a function of a billing model. The billing model can include differing billing levels. For instance, home zone billing can be utilized where a preferential billing arrangement is utilized when mobile device <b>206</b> connects to a particular base station (e.g., target base station <b>202</b>, CSG base station, hybrid base station associated with a CSG in which mobile device <b>206</b> is a member, . . . ). In accordance with an example, a CSG base station can be preferred to other base stations; hence, mobile device <b>206</b> can be preferentially billed when connected to the CSG base station versus other base stations (e.g., open base station, hybrid base station, . . . ). By way of other examples, various billing models can be utilized in connection with open base stations. For example, mobile device <b>206</b> can be preferentially billed when connected to any open femto cell base station (e.g., open HeNB, open HNB, . . . ) over other base stations (e.g., macro cell base stations, micro cell base stations, . . . ). Pursuant to a disparate example, no billing preference can be leveraged in connection with any open femto cell base station versus other base stations. According to a further example, a hybrid base station can permit access by both members and non-members of an associated CSG, yet members can receive preferred billing versus non-members.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The preference for selecting target base station <b>202</b> yielded by preference generation component <b>216</b> can be utilized for various purposes. For instance, mobile device <b>206</b> can camp on target base station <b>202</b> for idle mode based upon the preference for selecting target base station <b>202</b>. Moreover, mobile device <b>206</b> can register with target base station <b>202</b> based upon the preference for selecting target base station <b>202</b>; accordingly, mobile device <b>206</b> can register with target base station <b>202</b> to enable receiving pages there from. Further, mobile device <b>206</b> can access target base station <b>202</b> as a function of the preference for selecting target base station <b>202</b> (e.g., mobile device <b>206</b> can camp on target base station <b>202</b> and access target base station <b>202</b> thereafter in response to a page or to initiate data transmission, . . . ). It is to be appreciated, however, that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the foregoing illustrations.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To support the aforementioned examples, system <b>200</b> can enable differentiating between a macro cell base station and a femto cell base station. Moreover, system <b>200</b> can facilitate differentiating between hybrid base stations; thus, mobile device <b>206</b> can recognize whether it is a member of a CSG associated with a particular hybrid base station. Further, system <b>200</b> can enable prioritizing selection of base stations to access (e.g., preference generation component <b>216</b> can prefer to select a CSG base station associated with a CSG in which mobile device <b>206</b> is a member versus any hybrid base station, a hybrid base station associated with a CSG in which mobile device <b>206</b> is a member versus a hybrid base station associated with a CSG in which mobile device <b>206</b> is a non-member, an open femto cell base station versus a macro cell base station, . . . ).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, system <b>200</b> can employ a mixed deployment of base stations (e.g., target base station <b>202</b>, disparate base station(s) <b>204</b>, . . . ) where some base stations are hybrid and other base stations are closed. Moreover, system <b>200</b> can support dynamic switching of a base station (e.g., target base station <b>202</b>, one or more of disparate base station(s) <b>204</b>, . . . ) between hybrid operation and CSG operation.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Allowed CSG list <b>218</b> (e.g., whitelist, . . . ) can be stored in memory (not shown) of mobile device <b>206</b>. According to another example (not shown), allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can be retained upon a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) or Universal SIM (USIM) associated with mobile device <b>206</b>. Allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can also be retained in a network (e.g., managed by a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) (not shown) along with other subscriber profile information, leveraged by an MME (not shown) to accept or reject access, . . . ) as described herein to enforce access control. Allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can be used to manage cell selection preferences, and can include a set of authorized CSG IDs that a subscriber (e.g., associated with mobile device <b>206</b>, . . . ) is authorized to use. Allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can identify base stations (e.g. closed, hybrid, open, . . . ) that a certain user is allowed to access and/or prefers to access (e.g., for access control and/or special billing purposes, . . . ). For instance, allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can include a CSG ID of a hybrid base station if mobile device <b>206</b> prefers to access a hybrid base station associated with a CSG with which it is a member as compared to a hybrid base station corresponding to a CSG with which it is a non-member. Further, allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can comprise a CSG ID of closed base station(s). An ordering of CSG IDs in allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can indicate priority (e.g., CSG IDs can be stored in allowed CSG list <b>218</b> in priority order, . . . ). Additionally, base stations with an entry in allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can be preferred to other base stations not included in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to another illustration, allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can include CSG ID entries of suitable cells. Allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can be created based on CSG IDs provisioned. Pursuant to a further example, it is contemplated that a blacklist can be used to complement allowed CSG list <b>218</b> (e.g. blacklist used for roaming, . . . ); however, the claimed subject matter is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is contemplated that allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can be operator controlled or operator and user controlled. In the operator controlled approach, an operator can retain control of allowed CSG list <b>218</b>, and a subscriber can be prohibited from adding or deleting entries in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>. With a single point of control, the operator controlled approach can offer simplicity in management by mitigating conflicts. Further, with the operator controlled approach, since allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can include base stations of interest to mobile device <b>206</b>, autonomous search procedures to discover base stations need not be specified. In contrast, for the operator and user controlled approach, a subscriber can add and remove entries from allowed CSG list <b>218</b>. Such user control associated with the operator and user controlled approach can offer flexibility in access control while providing synchronization between allowed CSG list <b>218</b> retained by mobile device <b>206</b> and the network (e.g., HSS, MME, . . . ).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to an example, allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can be operator controlled (e.g., network controlled, . . . ). Following this example, if mobile device <b>206</b> successfully selects a base station (e.g., target base station <b>202</b>, . . . ) not included in allowed CSG list <b>218</b> (e.g., via manual selection, . . . ), then mobile device <b>206</b> can refrain from adding the selected base station to allowed CSG list <b>218</b>. By way of another illustration, if mobile device <b>206</b> fails when selecting a base station (e.g., target base station <b>202</b>, . . . ) included in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>, then mobile device <b>206</b> can refrain from removing the selected base station from allowed CSG list <b>218</b> and can start a configurable timer to avoid reselecting such base station. According to a further example, if mobile device <b>206</b> includes a signature field for allowed CSG list <b>218</b> in a Tracking Area Update (TAU) request and service request, the network can update allowed CSG list <b>218</b> if the signature field is out of date. In accordance with another example, a network can page mobile device <b>206</b> based on an allowed CSG list corresponding to a last signature received (e.g., last known local copy of allowed CSG list <b>218</b> retained by mobile device <b>206</b> can be used for paging, . . . ). Following this example, selection of an alien base station by mobile device <b>206</b> during idle mode can be mitigated, and the network can page mobile device <b>206</b> when a version of the allowed CSG list retained by the network changes (e.g., if a Tracking Area Identifier (TAI) of a base station is in the current TAI list of mobile device <b>206</b>, . . . ).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">By way of another example, allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can be operator and user controlled, and hence, mobile device <b>206</b> can control allowed CSG list <b>218</b>.

By way of another illustration, if mobile device <b>206</b> fails when selecting a base station (e.g., target base station <b>202</b>, . . . ) included in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>, then mobile device <b>206</b> can remove the selected base station from allowed CSG list <b>218</b> (e.g., depending upon a reject cause, . . . ). According to a further example, if mobile device <b>206</b> includes a signature field for allowed CSG list <b>218</b> in a TAU request and service request, then the network can update allowed CSG list <b>218</b> if the signature field is out of date and the network can also page mobile device <b>206</b> when a version of the allowed CSG list retained by the network changes.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, illustrated is a system <b>300</b> that utilizes CSGs in connection with access control in a wireless communication environment. System <b>300</b> includes target base station <b>202</b> and mobile device <b>206</b>. Target base station <b>202</b> include identity advertising component <b>208</b>, which advertises a CSG ID that identifies a CSG associated with target base station <b>202</b> to mobile device <b>206</b> (and/or disparate mobile device(s) (not shown)), and mode publicizing component <b>210</b>, which conveys a CSG indication that distinguishes between target base station <b>202</b> permitting access to members of the CSG and permitting access to the members and non-members of the CSG to mobile device <b>206</b> (and/or disparate mobile device(s)). For instance, the CSG indication can signify that target base station <b>202</b> is a CSG base station when the CSG indication specifies that target base station <b>202</b> permits access to members of the CSG (e.g., and target base station <b>202</b> is associated with a unique CSG ID disseminated by identity advertising component <b>208</b>, . . . ). Moreover, the CSG indication can signify that target base station <b>202</b> is a hybrid base station when the CSG indication specifies that target base station <b>202</b> permits access to both members and non-members of the CSG.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, mobile device <b>206</b> can include receiving component <b>212</b>, comparison component <b>214</b>, and preference generation component <b>216</b>. Receiving component <b>212</b> can acquire the advertised CSG ID and CSG indication from target base station <b>202</b>. The advertised CSG ID can identify the CSG corresponding to target base station <b>202</b>. Moreover, the advertised CSG indication can distinguish between target base station <b>202</b> permitting access to members of the CSG and permitting access to members and non-members of the CSG. Moreover, comparison component <b>214</b> can recognize whether the advertised CSG ID matches one or more CSG IDs included in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>. Moreover, preference generation component <b>216</b> can generate a preference for selecting target base station <b>202</b> based upon the advertised CSG ID and advertised CSG indication.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Mobile device <b>206</b> can further include memory <b>302</b> which can retain allowed CSG list <b>218</b>. Additionally or alternatively, it is contemplated that allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can be stored upon a SIM or a USIM associated with mobile device <b>206</b>. Memory <b>302</b> can be either volatile memory or nonvolatile memory, or can include both volatile and nonvolatile memory. By way of illustration, and not limitation, nonvolatile memory can include read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM), electrically programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), or flash memory. Volatile memory can include random access memory (RAM), which acts as external cache memory. By way of illustration and not limitation, RAM is available in many forms such as synchronous RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM), enhanced SDRAM (ESDRAM), Synchlink DRAM (SLDRAM), and direct Rambus RAM (DRRAM). Memory <b>302</b> of the subject systems and methods is intended to comprise, without being limited to, these and any other suitable types of memory.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Target base station <b>202</b> can further include a mode transition component <b>304</b> that switches target base station <b>202</b> (e.g., HeNB, HNB, . . . ) between CSG operation and hybrid operation. Accordingly, mode publicizing component <b>210</b> can adjust the CSG indication sent over a downlink as a function of the mode employed by target base station <b>202</b> as controlled by mode transition component <b>304</b>. By way of illustration, it is possible that operators can deploy base stations with hybrid access or CSG access as a default, and can permit subscribers to turn access control on or off at a later time. It is thus possible that in a deployment that some base stations are hybrid and some base stations are closed. To support the mixed mode deployment, target base station <b>202</b> can include an indication (e.g., CSG indication yielded by mode publicizing component <b>210</b>, . . . ) of whether it is operating in closed mode or hybrid mode in system information.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to an illustration, mode transition component <b>304</b> can switch target base station <b>202</b> from CSG to hybrid operation. While in hybrid mode, the CSG indication can be set to 0 (rather than 1). Further, mode transition component <b>304</b> can switch target base station <b>202</b> from hybrid to CSG operation, and hence, the CSG indication can be set to 1. It is to be appreciated, however, that the CSG indication can be set to 1 (or some other value) to signify hybrid operation and 0 (or some other value) to specify CSG operation.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although a hybrid access base station (e.g., target base station <b>202</b>, . . . ) can provide access to any subscriber, it can provide special home zone billing to base station owners. In order to support the prioritization of a hybrid base station for its owner, a CSG ID can be assigned to the base station. Further, allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can include the following: a set of authorized CSG IDs belong to closed base stations that the subscriber is authorized to use; and a set of CSG IDs belong to hybrid base stations that the subscriber prefers due to special billing plans.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, illustrated is an example call flow diagram <b>400</b> for access control at a CSG cell. For instance, signaling can be effectuated between a mobile device (e.g., mobile device <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, access initiation component <b>306</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, . . . ), a base station (e.g., target base station <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one of disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an HeNB, request forwarding component <b>308</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, . . . ), and a Mobility Management Entity (MME) as part of a Tracking Area Update (TAU) procedure. At <b>402</b>, a mobile device can detect a change to a disparate Tracking Area (TA). At <b>404</b>, the mobile device initiates the TAU procedure by sending a TAU Request message together with an indication of a selected network to the base station. At <b>406</b>, the base station can derive a MME from a Globally Unique Temporary Identity (GUTI) and from the indicated selected network. Further, the base station can forward the TAU Request message to the MME along with a CSG ID of the base station. At <b>408</b>, the MME can check whether an allowed CSG list that is included in subscription data of the mobile device included the CSG ID of the base station by utilizing the CSG ID of the serving cell provided with the TAU Request message. If the CSG ID does not match an entry in the allowed CSG list, then the MME rejects the network access initiated by the mobile device (not shown). Alternatively, if the CSG ID matches an entry in the allowed CSG list, the MME can send a TAU Accept message to the mobile device at <b>410</b>. Further, optionally at <b>412</b>, if a GUTI or Non-Access Stratum (NAS) security algorithm is included in the TAU Accept message, then the mobile device can acknowledge the received message by returning a TAU Complete message to the MME.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the case of a rejected tracking area update operation due to the CSG ID of the CSG cell not being in the allowed CSG list of the mobile device as recognized at <b>408</b>, the MME can return a reject message to the mobile device. The reject message can include a cause value #25 (e.g., CSG not allowed in this Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), . . . ) and an S1 connection can be released. Further, upon returning to idle, the mobile device can remove the CSG ID of the CSG cell from the allowed CSG list if present.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to another example, location registration can be effectuated utilizing Location Area Code (LAC)/Routing Area Code (RAC) based registration. To support CSG based access control, each CSG can belong to a unique LAC/RAC. On selection of target base station <b>202</b>, target base station <b>202</b> can perform location registration when target base station <b>202</b> belongs to a new LAC. It is to be appreciated, however, that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the aforementioned example.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Various examples are presented below. It is to be appreciated that these examples are for illustration purposes, and the claimed subject matter is not limited to the following examples. Further, many of the below examples relate to generation of a preference, selection and/or access of an HeNB; it is contemplated, however, that these examples can be extended to selection and/or access of other types of base stations (e.g., HNBs, macro cell base stations, micro cell base stations, pico cell base stations, . . . ).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">By way of example, mobile device <b>206</b> (e.g., a cell selection component (not shown), preference generation component <b>216</b>, . . . ) can enable selecting (or reselecting) to access target base station <b>202</b> manually based upon user input in response to a displayed ranking of detected base stations (e.g., target base station <b>202</b> and disparate base station(s) (not shown), . . . ). For instance, the displayed ranking of detected base stations can include an indication of whether each of the detected base station permits access to members of a CSG or permits access to members and non-members of the CSG. Pursuant to an illustration, manual HeNB selection or reselection can be effectuated by mobile device <b>206</b>. In manual HeNB (re)selection, mobile device <b>206</b> can scan and present a list of HeNB Identifiers (HeNB IDs) for detected HeNBs. An HeNB ID (e.g. Home Node B Name, . . . ) is a text based identifier associated with a corresponding CSG ID and used for manual cell selection. Thus, pursuant to an example, a target HeNB (e.g., target base station <b>202</b>, . . . ) can be associated with a given HeNB ID. Moreover, the HeNB ID can be unique in a manner that a login ID is unique. The HeNB ID can be sent via SIBn and/or can be configured by a user in combination with OAM; however, the claimed subject matter is not so limited. Further, the list displayed by mobile device <b>206</b> can be presented in the following order. HeNB IDs of cells whose CSG IDs are included in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>, if any, can be listed in the same order specified in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>. If more than one HeNB shares the same CSG ID and if their HNB IDs are identical, then mobile device <b>206</b> can display the HeNB with the best radio frequency (RF) quality. Further, if more than one HeNB shares the same CSG ID and if their HeNB IDs differ from each other, then mobile device <b>206</b> can display the HeNB IDs belonging to the common CSG in an order of their RF quality (from best to worst). Thereafter, the list can include other HeNB IDs, in order of RF quality (from best to worst), including closed HeNBs that are not present in allowed CSG list <b>218</b>. Inclusion of other HeNB IDs not included in allowed CSG list <b>218</b> allows a user to attempt (re)selection of an HeNB in the event that allowed CSG list <b>218</b> stored by mobile device <b>206</b> (e.g., in memory <b>302</b>, . . . ) fails to be synchronized with a version of the allowed CSG list retained in the network. Such desynchronization can result from delay or temporary failure in updating allowed CSG list <b>218</b> retained by mobile device <b>206</b>. Moreover, as part of manual selection, mobile device <b>206</b> can indicate whether HeNB is hybrid or closed. Mobile device <b>206</b> additionally can display availability of macro coverage and/or relative signal strengths (e.g., signal bars, . . . ) along with the HeNB IDs to aid the user in the selection decision. Upon user selection of an HeNB, mobile device <b>206</b> can attempt reselection of the chosen HeNB. Note that depending on channel condition, mobile device <b>206</b> may fail to remain on the selected HeNB. After manual selection, automatic (re)selection rules can apply as part of idle mode procedures and can result in (re)selection of a different HeNB. Moreover, if no HeNB is detectable, the manual selection process can end and mobile device <b>206</b> can remain on a current cell.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">An HeNB can broadcast an HeNB ID in free text format. Mobile device <b>206</b> can display the HeNB ID when camping on the cell where it is broadcast. Further, the HeNB ID can be configurable by an administrator of the HeNB. Moreover, the HeNB ID can be associated with the stored CSG IDs.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">By way of further example, CSG HeNBs can be identified by a CSG ID for manual selection and provisioning. CSG HeNBs advertising the same CSG ID can have different HeNB IDs. Further, the HeNB ID need not be heard by mobile device <b>206</b> for restricted association. Rather, the HeNB ID typically is used for display purposes and manual selection. Moreover, the HeNB ID can be sent out very rarely (e.g., order of seconds, . . . ). Such example can yield advantages related to not needing to hear the HeNB ID to decide to handover in idle or connected state. However, the aforementioned example can result in difficulty associated with provisioning a number manually. Moreover, CSG IDs can be unable to be used to support registration for an enterprise model.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to another example, automatic base station selection (or reselection) can be effectuated by mobile device <b>206</b> (e.g., a cell selection component (not shown), preference generation component <b>216</b>, . . . ). For instance, mobile device <b>206</b> can perform automatic HeNB selection or reselection; however, the claimed subject matter is not so limited. In automatic HeNB (re)selection, mobile device <b>206</b> can effectuate the following. HeNBs (e.g., identified by an HeNB indicator in SIB11 transmitted by a serving cell, . . . ) can be discovered, and CSG indicators and CSG IDs corresponding to the detected HeNBs can be recognized. The HeNB indicator can differentiate HeNBs from macro eNBs in a neighbor list, and can be set for an entire carrier frequency dedicated for HeNB deployment. Upon recognition of the CSG indicators and the CSG IDs pertaining to the detected HeNBs, measured cells can be ranked. Further, closed HeNBs not in allowed CSG list <b>218</b> can be removed from the ranking without restricting their frequencies of operation. Moreover, a highest ranked cell can be reselected.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary communication system <b>500</b> that enables deployment of access point base stations (e.g. femto cell base stations, . . . ) within a network environment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, system <b>500</b> includes multiple femto cell base stations, which can also be referred to as access point base stations, Home Evolved Node B units (HeNBs), Home Node B unit (HNB), femto cells, or the like. The femto cell base stations (HeNBs <b>510</b>), for example, can each be installed in a corresponding small scale network environment, such as, for example, in one or more user residences <b>530</b>, and can each be configured to serve associated, as well as alien, mobile device(s) <b>520</b>. Each HeNB <b>510</b> is further coupled to the Internet <b>540</b> and a mobile operator core network <b>550</b> via a DSL router (not shown) or, alternatively, a cable modem (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Although embodiments described herein use 3GPP terminology, it is to be understood that the embodiments may be applied to 3GPP (Re199, Re15, Re16, Re17) technology, as well as 3GPP2 (1&#xd7;RTT, 1&#xd7;EV-DO Re10, RevA, RevB) technology and other known and related technologies. In such embodiments described herein, the owner of HeNB <b>510</b> can subscribe to mobile service, such as, for example, 3G mobile service, offered through the mobile operator core network <b>550</b>, and mobile device <b>520</b> can be capable to operate both in a macro cellular environment via a macro cell base station <b>560</b> and in a residential small scale network environment. Thus, HeNB <b>510</b> can be backward compatible with any existing mobile device <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It is contemplated that HeNBs <b>510</b> can include CSG HeNB(s), hybrid HeNB(s), and/or open HeNB(s). HeNBs <b>510</b> can each advertise a respective CSG ID and CSG indication; however, it is contemplated that an open HeNB need not disseminate an associated CSG ID and CSG indication (e.g., since the open HeNB can lack an association with a CSG, . . . ). Moreover, mobile device <b>520</b> can receive the advertised CSG IDs and CSG indications. For instance, mobile device <b>520</b> can compare the received CSG IDs with CSG IDs included in an allowed CSG list associated therewith. When a received CSG ID matches a CSG ID included in the allowed CSG list, mobile device <b>520</b> is recognized to be a member of a CSG identified by the matching CSG ID. Further, mobile device <b>520</b> can determine whether an HeNB <b>510</b> is a CSG HeNB or a hybrid HeNB based upon the CSG indication. Moreover, mobile device <b>520</b> can generate a preference for selecting one of HeNB <b>510</b> as compared to a disparate base stations (e.g., other HeNBs <b>510</b>, macro cell base station <b>560</b>, . . . ) as a function of the received CSG ID and received CSG indication.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, illustrated is an example system <b>600</b> that provides Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) support in a wireless communication environment. System <b>600</b> depicts an example architecture model that can be utilized in conjunction with an HeNB <b>602</b> (e.g., HeNBs <b>510</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, target base station <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, disparate base station(s) <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, . . . ). It is contemplated, however, that disparate architecture models are intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims. For instance, although not shown, it is contemplated that differing architectures that support utilization of CSGs with a HNB, a macro cell base station, or any other type of base station is intended to fall within the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to an illustration, HeNB <b>602</b> can be located on a user's premises; however, the claimed subject matter is not so limited. HeNB <b>602</b> can provide Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) eNB functions as well as functions to support HeNB authentication, HeNB registration, and HeNB configuration through Operation and Maintenance (OAM).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">HeNB <b>602</b> can communicate directly or indirectly with various nodes of a core network (e.g., Evolved Packet Core (EPC), . . . ) in system <b>600</b>. For instance, the nodes of the core network can include a Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW) <b>604</b>, a Serving Gateway (SGW) <b>606</b>, a Mobility Management Entity (MME) <b>608</b>, and a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) <b>610</b>. Although not shown, it is contemplated that system <b>600</b> can include more than one PGW <b>604</b>, SGW <b>606</b>, MME <b>608</b>, and/or HSS <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">PGW <b>604</b> can interface with external Packet Data Network(s) (PDN(s)) such as, for instance, the Internet <b>612</b> and/or an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) <b>614</b>. Moreover, although not depicted, PGW <b>604</b> can additionally or alternatively interface with an Intranet or any disparate PDN(s). PGW <b>604</b>, for example, can handle address allocation, policy enforcement, packet classification and routing, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">SGW <b>606</b> is associated with a user plane and is an anchor point for mobility. SGW <b>606</b> points to a serving base station (e.g., HeNB <b>602</b>, disparate HeNB, differing eNB, . . . ) of a user (e.g., employing a mobile device <b>616</b>, . . . ). Thus, upon handing off to a differing base station, SGW <b>606</b> can repoint to the differing base station. Further, SGW <b>606</b> can enable data to be routed to the appropriate base station (e.g., HeNB <b>602</b>, . . . ) serving mobile device <b>616</b> at a given time.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">MME <b>608</b> is associated with a control plane. MME <b>608</b> can support control plane signaling for mobility, Quality of Service (QoS) initialization, user authentication, and the like. Further, HSS <b>610</b> can store various subscription information such as, for instance, phone numbers, profiles, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">System <b>600</b> includes various interfaces between nodes. For instance, an S6a interface can connect MME <b>608</b> and HSS <b>610</b> and an S5/S8 interface can connect SGW <b>606</b> and PGW <b>604</b>. Further, an S1-U interface can connect HeNB <b>602</b> and SGW <b>606</b>, an S11 interface can couple SGW <b>606</b> and MME <b>608</b>, and an S1-MME interface can connect HeNB <b>602</b> and MME <b>608</b>. Additionally, PGW <b>604</b> can connect to PDN(s) (e.g., Internet <b>612</b>, IMS <b>614</b>, . . . ) via respective SGi interfaces, and HeNB <b>602</b> and mobile device <b>616</b> can be coupled via an E-UTRA-Uu interface. Moreover, MME <b>608</b> can be associated with an S10 interface.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">HSS <b>610</b> can also directly or indirectly connect to CSG provisioning network elements, namely a CSG administration server <b>618</b> and a CSG list server <b>620</b>. CSG administration server <b>618</b> can support CSG administration functions, which can be utilized to manage a list of subscribers for a CSG (e.g., access control list for the CSG, . . . ). For example, an owner of HeNB <b>602</b> can interact with CSG administration server <b>618</b> via an interface (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI), website, . . . ) to add or remove a user from being included in a CSG associated with HeNB <b>602</b>. Based upon such changes, CSG administration server <b>618</b> can update HSS <b>610</b> to adjust subscription information for the user as modified.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, CSG list server <b>620</b> provides UE CSG provisioning functionality utilized to manage an allowed CSG list (e.g., whitelist (WL), . . . ) for mobile device <b>616</b> (and/or any disparate mobile device(s) (not shown)). CSG list server <b>620</b> can inform mobile device <b>616</b> that it is a member of a particular group (e.g., particular CSG, . . . ). Further, when a subscription is updated by CSG administration server <b>618</b>, HSS <b>610</b> can store subscription information corresponding to the update. Moreover, updating the subscription information in HSS <b>610</b> can trigger a message to be transferred to CSG list server <b>620</b>, which can cause CSG list server <b>620</b> to utilize an Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA-DM) process to downlink the modified subscription information to mobile device <b>616</b>. Hence, CSG list server <b>620</b> can enable synchronizing the subscription information retained by HSS <b>610</b> and mobile device <b>616</b> (e.g., stored in memory of mobile device <b>616</b>, retained on a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) or a Universal SIM (USIM) associated with mobile device <b>616</b>, . . . ).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Various logical network protocol functions between mobile device <b>616</b> and core network elements can be effectuated in system <b>600</b> to support CSG. The logical network protocol functions, for instance, can include UE CSG provisioning functions, access control functions, mobility management functions, and CSG administration functions.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">UE CSG provisioning functions can manage the allowed CSG list for mobile device <b>616</b>. The allowed CSG list is a list of CSG IDs; mobile device <b>616</b> is able to access CSG cells that have a CSG ID included in the allowed CSG list. The allowed CSG list can be stored in the network in order to perform access control and stored by mobile device <b>616</b> to enable selecting a cell to be accessed. The allowed CSG list in the network can be permanently stored in HSS <b>610</b>, and retrieved by MME <b>608</b> for access control during attach, detach, service request, and tracking area updating procedures. The allowed CSG list at mobile device <b>616</b> can be stored on a USIM for such mobile device <b>616</b> or memory of mobile device <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Access control functions can ensure that a mobile device has a valid subscription at a CSG where it performs an access. MME <b>608</b> can perform access control for mobile device <b>616</b> accessing the network through an CSG cell during attach, detach, service request, and tracking area updating procedures. Further, MME <b>608</b> can include a reject cause value in a Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling response upon recognizing that mobile device <b>616</b> is not allowed in the CSG for attach, service request, and/or tracking area updating procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Further, mobility management functions can be used to keep track of a current location of mobile device <b>616</b>. The location of mobile device <b>616</b> in idle state can be known by the network on a Tracking Area list granularity. Thus, when in idle state, mobile device <b>616</b> can be paged in all cells of the Tracking Area list received at a last Tracking Area Update.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Moreover, CSG administration functions can manage the list of subscribers for a CSG. The CSG administration function can be hosted by an operator or a third party. For instance, a single list can control the HeNBs for a CSG. Further, HeNBs advertising the same CSG ID can have a single list of subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As noted above, HSS <b>610</b> can permanently retain CSG subscription information. Further, the CSG subscription information can be retrieved by MME <b>608</b> during an attach procedure or tracking area updating procedure as part of a subscription profile of mobile device <b>616</b>. MME <b>608</b> can utilize the retrieved CSG subscription information to perform access control. For instance, MME <b>608</b> can perform access control since access control is a NAS level procedure, and MME <b>608</b> is the NAS endpoint in the core network. Further, MME <b>608</b> can obtain and store a copy of an allowed CSG list for mobile device <b>616</b> (e.g., the allowed CSG list can be retained as part of the user's subscription information, . . . ). Moreover, MME <b>608</b> can know a CSG ID of a CSG cell where mobile device <b>616</b> is performing the access in order to effectuate access control.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Although described herein as being performed at the NAS, it is contemplated that access control for CSGs can be implemented at an Access Stratum (AS). Access control at the AS can be implemented in a Radio Network Controller (RNC) function in HeNB <b>602</b> (or in a related function in an HeNB-Gateway (not shown)). It is to be appreciated, however, that the claimed subject matter is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Additional examples related to CSG utilization in general are set forth below. It is contemplated that these examples are presented for illustration purposes, and the claimed subject matter is not limited by these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">According to an example, cell selection/reselection to CSG cells need not require the network to provide neighbor cell information to a mobile device. Neighbor cell information can be provided to help a mobile device in specific cases such as, for instance, where the network attempts to trigger the mobile device to search for CSG cells. Thus, CSG base stations can be excluded from being advertised in neighbor lists of other base stations. The mobile device can be expected to independently measure attributes of the serving and neighboring cells. Further, for inter-frequency neighboring cells, carrier frequencies can be indicated. Moreover, an open base station can be advertised in a CSG base station neighbor list. It can be useful for a mobile device to know neighboring base stations for registration if the mobile device provides a Tracking Area Identifier (TAI) list when it registers. A TAI can be a paging and registration equivalent to a Location Area Identifier (LAI), many cells can have the same TAI, and cells with the same TAI can page a mobile device (e.g., base stations with the same TAI can be managed by the same group of MMEs, . . . ). Further, during Automatic Neighbor Relationship (ANR), a determination can be effectuated to identify whether a neighbor is restricted, hybrid, or open, as well as whether it is part of a common CSG.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Moreover, cells can be associated with Physical Cell Identifiers (PCIDs). PCID reuse can be collision free and confusion free. Collision free can refer to the PCID being unique in an area that a cell covers, while confusion free can refer to a cell not having two or more neighboring cells with the same PCID. To provide for the foregoing, the PCID space can be partitioned (e.g., not necessarily equally). In particular, overlay (e.g. macro network, . . . ) and underlay (e.g. femto network, pico network, . . . ) base stations can have different PCID spaces. The underlay base station that chooses a bad PCID can less adversely affect overlay base stations. Further, partition sizes can vary by geographic region (e.g., urban versus rural, . . . ) or be specified. Moreover, mobile devices need not be aware of partitions unless they are used to optimize handoffs.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">By way of another example related to cell reselection, a base station can indicate restricted association in SIB1. Following this example, a CSG ID and a CSG indication can be included in SIB1. SIB1 can further include the PLMN, which can be read for cell selection. Utilization of the foregoing can allow a mobile device to identify whether a base station is restricted, hybrid or open, and whether the base station is suitable for the mobile device. Further, the mobile device can confirm that the CSG ID of a CSG base station is in an allowed CSG list before effectuating idle state handoff (e.g., mobile device can register at the CSG base station if necessary, . . . ). Moreover, idle state hand-out procedures (e.g., CSG base station to open base station, . . . ) can be similar to procedures employed for transitioning from open base station to open base station.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">A further example relates to connected state procedures. A base station can indicate restricted association in SIB1 by using a CSG ID and a CSG indication. Conventionally, SIB1 may not be heard until after access; yet, failed access attempts at CSG cells can be mitigated by a mobile device reviewing SIB1. The mobile device can confirm that a CSG ID of a CSG base station is in an allowed CSG list before access. The mobile device can confirm the CSG ID using measurement gaps to hear before a handover command or before access after the handover command. Moreover, connected state hand-out procedures (e.g., CSG base station to open base station, can be similar to open base station to open base station procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A CSG base station can be associated with various characteristics. For instance, a CSG base station can be deployed on a single frequency or multiple frequencies (e.g., CSG base station/hybrid base station/open base station frequencies can overlap, . . . ). Further, a CSG base station can broadcast sufficient information so that a mobile device can determine that it is a CSG base station, and whether it is a home, guest, or alien base station without access the CSG base station. Moreover, a CSG base station can determine whether a mobile device is a home, guest, or alien mobile device when it attempts access. The CSG base station can support guest mobile device usage, can allow a mobile device to access for emergency services, and alien mobile devices can be rejected in a manner that can cause them not to try to access again. Moreover, a mobile device can determine whether a CSG base station is a home, guest, or alien base station without performing an access. The mobile device can be provisioned with a list of allowed home and guest base stations. The mobile device may not be required to distinguish between a home and guest base station. Further, the mobile device typically should not try to access an alien base station (e.g. other than emergency services, . . . ). Moreover, the mobile device commonly should not camp on the alien base station while in idle state (e.g., unless the alien base station is allowed to page the mobile device, . . . ). The mobile device can have a list of home and guest base stations, which can be independent of PLMN identities.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A CSG base station can support varying types of association. For instance, full association can be provided for home or guest mobile devices at a CSG base station. Such mobile devices with full association can camp on and be paged in idle state and can set up a call/session from the CSG base station (e.g. attach, . . . ). Further, for an alien mobile device at a CSG base station, signaling association or restricted association can be supported. Signaling association (e.g., semi-open, . . . ) can allow a mobile device to camp on and be paged in idle state (e.g., but not access, . . . ) and/or access the alien base station for NAS and/or Radio Resource Control (RRC) control plane signaling (e.g., manage interference in order to access another base station, . . . ). Further, with restricted association, a mobile device typically does not access the alien base station and typically does not camp on such base station in idle state.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>, methodologies relating to advertising and/or employing Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) related information in a wireless communication environment are illustrated. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance with one or more embodiments, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, illustrated is a methodology <b>700</b> that facilitates employing advertised Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) related information in a wireless communication environment. At <b>702</b>, an advertised Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifier (ID) that identifies a CSG corresponding to a base station can be received. The CSG ID, for instance, can uniquely identify the CSG corresponding to the base station. By way of further example, the CSG ID can uniquely identify the CSG corresponding to the base station in an operator network. At <b>704</b>, an advertised CSG indication that distinguishes between the base station permitting access to members of the CSG and permitting access to members and non-members of the CSG can be received. According to an illustration, the advertised CSG indication can signify that the base station is associated with a CSG cell, which restricts services to only members of the CSG, when the base station is identified to permit access to the members of the CSG. Further, the advertised CSG indication can signify that the base station is associated with a hybrid cell, which permits services to both members and non-members of the CSG, when the base station is recognized to permit access to the members and the non-members of the CSG. Moreover, a hybrid cell can provide higher Quality of Service (QoS) to the members compared to the non-members. According to another example, the base station can be differentiated from a macro cell base station (e.g., Evolved Node B, Node B, . . . ), where the base station is one of a Home Evolved Node B (HeNB) or a Home Node B (HNB).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">At <b>706</b>, an identification can be effectuated as to whether the advertised CSG ID matches one or more CSG IDs included in an allowed CSG list. At <b>708</b>, a preference for selecting the base station as compared to a disparate base station can be generated when the advertised CSG indication specifies that the base station permits access to the members and the non-members of the CSG and the advertised CSG ID matches at least one of the one or more CSG IDs included in the allowed CSG list. By way of further example, the preference for selecting the base station as opposed to a differing base station can be generated when the advertised CSG indication specifies that the base station permits access to the members of the CSG and the advertised CSG ID matches at least one of the one or more CSG IDs included in the allowed CSG list. Following this example, the differing base station can be associated with a differing CSG indication which identifies that the differing base station permits access to the members and the non-members of the CSG. In accordance with another illustration, the preference for selecting the base station can be generated as a function of a billing model. For instance, the billing model can provide different billing levels to the members of the CSG versus the non-members of the CSG.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Further, the preference for selecting the base station can be utilized to camp on the base station for idle mode, register with the base station, access the base station, and the like. According to an example, the base station can be automatically selected for access based at least in part upon the preference. Alternatively, the base station can be manually selected for access based upon user input in response to a displayed ranking of detected base stations. For instance, the displayed ranking of detected base stations can include an indication of whether the base station permits access to the members of the CSG or permits access to the members and the non-members of the CSG.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Moreover, cell selection priority can be managed based upon an ordering of the one or more CSG IDs included in the allowed CSG list. By way of example, the one or more CSG IDs included in the allowed CSG list can be controlled by an operator. In accordance with another example, the one or more CSG IDs included in the allowed CSG list can be controlled by an operator and/or a user; thus, a CSG ID can be added to the allowed CSG list and/or a CSG ID can be removed from the CSG list.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, illustrated is a methodology <b>800</b> that facilitates advertising Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) related information in a wireless communication environment. At <b>802</b>, a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) Identifier (ID) that identifies a CSG pertaining to a base station can be transmitted. For instance, the CSG ID can uniquely identify the CSG pertaining to the base station. By way of another example, the CSG ID can uniquely identify the CSG pertaining to the base station in an operator network. At <b>804</b>, a CSG indication that distinguishes between the base station permitting access to members of the CSG and permitting access to the members and non-members of the CSG can be transmitted. The CSG ID and the CSG indication can be sent over the downlink. By way of example, the CSG ID and the CSG indication can be included in a system information block type 1 message (SIB1); however, it is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not so limited. Further, the CSG indication can signify that the base station is associated with one of a CSG cell or a hybrid cell. Moreover, a CSG cell can restrict services to only members of the CSG and a hybrid cell can permit services to both the members and the non-members of the CSG. According to an example, a hybrid cell can provide preferred Quality of Service (QoS) to the members versus the non-members of the CSG upon receiving an access from a mobile device. Additionally or alternatively, a hybrid cell can support different billing levels for the members versus the non-members of the CSG upon receiving an access from a mobile device. In accordance with another aspect, an indication that distinguishes the base station from a macro Node B or Evolved Node B can be broadcasted (e.g., if the base station is a Home Evolved Node B (HeNB) or a Home Node B (HNB), . . . ). Pursuant to another example, the base station can switch between CSG operation and hybrid operation. Further, a mobile device can be identified as being a member or a non-member of the CSG when providing services to the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">It will be appreciated that, in accordance with one or more aspects described herein, inferences can be made regarding distributing and/or utilizing CSG related information in a wireless communication environment. As used herein, the term to &#x201c;infer&#x201d; or &#x201c;inference&#x201d; refers generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system, environment, and/or user from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic&#x2014;that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.</p>
