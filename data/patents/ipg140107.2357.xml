<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of materials containing silicon, notably metallosilicate materials and more precisely aluminosilicate materials, with hierarchical and organized porosity within the microporosity and mesoporosity domains. It also relates to the preparation of these materials that are obtained by means of the synthesis technique referred to as aerosol synthesis.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">New synthesis strategies allowing to obtain materials of well-defined porosity in a very wide range, from microporous materials to macroporous materials to hierarchical porosity materials, i.e. having pores of several sizes, have known a very large development within the scientific community since the mid-90s (G. J. de A. A. Soler-Illia, C. Sanchez, B. Lebeau, J. Patarin, <i>Chem. Rev., </i>2002, 102, 4093). In particular, considerable work has been done on the development of materials having a microporosity of zeolitic nature and a mesoporosity so as to simultaneously benefit from the catalytic properties specific to zeolites and from the catalytic and especially the textural properties of the mesoporous phase.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A technique that is commonly used to generate materials having such biporosity consists in directly creating mesopores within zeolite crystals by subjecting the zeolite to a steam-hydrothermal treatment, also referred to as steaming. Under the effect of this treatment, the mobility of the tetrahedric atoms that make up the framework of the zeolite is increased to such an extent that some of these atoms are extracted from the network, which causes formation of amorphous zones that can be cleared to give way to mesoporous cavities (A. H. Jansen, A. J. Koster, K. P. de Jong, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2002, 106, 11905). The formation of such cavities can also be obtained by subjecting the zeolite to an acid treatment (H. Ajot, J. F. Joly, J. Lynch, F. Raatz, P. Caullet, <i>Stud. Surf. Sci. Catal., </i>1991, 62, 583). These methods however have the drawback of making part of the zeolite partly amorphous and of modifying the properties thereof through variation of the chemical composition. In any case, the mesoporosity thus introduced allows to eliminate or at least to limit diffusion limitation problems encountered in microporous materials, mesopores having much greater diffusion factors than micropores and thus allowing access to the active sites of the zeolites (P. B. Weisz, <i>Chemtech, </i>1973, 3, 498).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">More recently, much work has been done on the elaboration of mixed mesostructured/zeolite materials, mesostructured materials affording the additional advantage of a perfectly organized and calibrated porosity in the mesopore range.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It can be briefly reminded here that mesostructured materials are conventionally obtained via synthesis methods referred to as soft chemistry methods that consist in bringing together, in an aqueous solution or in polar solvents, inorganic precursors with structuring agents, generally molecular or macromolecular surfactants, ionic or neutral. Control of electrostatic interactions or of interactions through hydrogen bonds between the inorganic precursors and the structuring agent jointly linked with hydrolysis/condensation reactions of the inorganic precursor leads to a cooperative assembly of the organic and inorganic phases generating micellar aggregates of surfactants of uniform size controlled within an inorganic matrix. Clearance of the porosity is then obtained by surfactant elimination, which is conventionally carried out by means of chemical extraction processes or by thermal treatment. Depending on the nature of the inorganic precursors and of the structuring agent used, and on the operating conditions applied, several families of mesostructured materials have been developed, such as the M41S family obtained using quaternary ammonium salts as the structuring agent (J. S. Beck, J. C. Vartuli, W. J. Roth, M. E. Leonowicz, C. T. Kresge, K. D. Schmitt, C. T.-W. Chu, D. H. Olson, E. W. Sheppard, S. B. McCullen, J. B. Higgins, J. L. Schlenker, <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>1992, 114, 27, 10834) or the SBA family obtained using three-block copolymers as the structuring agent (D. Zhao, J. Feng, Q. Huo, N. Melosh, G. H. Fredickson, B. F. Chmelka, G. D. Stucky, <i>Science, </i>1998, 279, 548).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several synthesis techniques allowing elaboration of such mixed mesostructured/zeolite materials have thus been listed in the open literature. A first synthesis technique consists in synthesizing in a first stage a mesostructured aluminosilicate material according to the conventional methods described above, then, in a second stage, in impregnating this material with a structuring agent commonly used in the synthesis of zeolitic materials. A suitable hydrothermal treatment leads to a zeolitization of the amorphous walls of the initial mesostructured aluminosilicate (K. R. Koletstra, H. van Bekkum, J. C. Jansen, <i>Chem. Commun., </i>1997, 2281; D. T. On, S. Kaliaguine, <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., </i>2001, 40, 3248; D. T. On, D. Lutic, S. Kaliaguine, <i>Micropor. Mesopor. Mater., </i>2001, 44, 435; M. J. Verhoef, P. J. Kooyman, J. C. van der Waal, M. S. Rigutto, J. A. Peters, H. van Bekkum, <i>Chem. Mater., </i>2001, 13, 683; S. Kaliaguine, D. T. On, U.S. Pat. No. 6,669,924B1, 2003). A second synthesis technique consists in bringing together a colloidal solution of zeolite seeds (also referred to as protozeolitic entities) and a surfactant commonly used to create a mesostructuration of the final material. The basic idea here is to simultaneously generate the elaboration of an inorganic matrix of organized mesoporosity and the growth, within this matrix, of zeolite seeds so as to ideally obtain a mesostructured aluminosilicate material with crystallized walls (Z. Zhang et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>2001, 123, 5014; Y. Liu et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>2000, 122, 8791). A variant of these two techniques consists in starting from a mixture of aluminium and silicon precursors in the presence of two structuring agents, one likely to generate a zeolitic system and the other likely to generate a mesostructuration. This solution is then subjected to two crystallization stages under variable hydrothermal treatment conditions, the first stage leading to the formation of the mesoporous structure of organized porosity and the second stage leading to the zeolitization of the amorphous walls (A. Karlsson, M. St&#xf6;cker, R. Schmidt, <i>Micropor. Mesopor. Mater., </i>1999, 27, 181; L. Huang, W. Guo, P. Deng, Z. Xue, Q. Li, <i>J. Phys., Chem. B, </i>2000, 104, 2817). All of these synthesis methods have the drawback of damaging the mesostructure and thus to lose the advantages thereof in cases where growth of the zeolite seeds or zeolitization of the walls is not perfectly controlled, which makes these techniques delicate to implement.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It can be noted that it is also possible to directly elaborate composite mesostructured/zeolite materials so as to take advantage of the catalytic properties specific to each one of these phases. This can be done through thermal treatment of a mixture of a zeolite seed solution and of a mesostructured aluminosilicate seed solution (P. Prokesova, S. Mintova, J. Cejka, T. Bein, <i>Micropor. Mesopor. Mater., </i>2003, 64, 165) or through growth of a zeolite layer at the surface of a presynthesized mesostructured aluminosilicate (D. T. On, S. Kaliaguine, <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., </i>2002, 41, 1036).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To the exclusion of the mesoporous zeolitic materials obtained through post-treatment of a zeolite, we note that, from an experimental point of view, all these materials are obtained by direct precipitation of inorganic precursors in the presence or not of structuring agents within an aqueous solution or in polar solvents, this stage being in most cases followed by one or more ripening stages in an autoclave. The elementary particles usually obtained exhibit no regular shape and they are generally characterized by a size ranging between 200 and 500 nm, and often well above 500 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the case of non-zeolitic mesostructured materials, it is possible to achieve cooperative self-assembly of the structuring agent with the inorganic precursors hydrolyzed and condensed at various degrees of advancement by progressive evaporation of a solution of these reactants whose structuring agent concentration is below the critical micellar concentration (c<sub>mc</sub>) known to the person skilled in the art, which leads to either the formation of mesostructured films in the case of deposition on a substrate (dip-coating technique), or to the formation of a mesostructured powder after atomization of the solution (aerosol technique). By way of example, patent U.S. Pat. No. 6,387,453 discloses the formation of mesostructured organic-inorganic hybrid films using the dip-coating technique; besides, these authors have used the aerosol technique to elaborate purely silicic mesostructured materials (C. J. Brinker, Y. Lu, A. Sellinger, H. Fan, <i>Adv. Mater., </i>1999, 11, 7).</p>

In the description hereafter, analysis of the X rays is carried out on powder with a reflection diffractometer equipped with a rear monochromator, using copper radiation (wavelength 1.5406 &#x212b;). The peaks usually observed in diffractograms corresponding to a given value of angle 2&#x3b8; are associated with the inter-reticular distances d<sub>(hkl) </sub>characteristic of the structural symmetry of the material, ((hkl) being the Miller indices of the reciprocal network) by the Bragg relation: 2 d<sub>(hkl)</sub>*sin(&#x3b8;)=n*&#x3bb;. This indexing then allows to determine the cell parameters (abc) of the direct network, the value of these parameters depending on the hexagonal, cubic or vermicular structure obtained. For example, the low-angle X-ray diffractogram of a mesostructured material, whose microporous and crystallized matrix walls of each spherical particle consist of ZSM-5 type aluminosilicate zeolite entities, obtained according to the first material preparation method of the invention using TEOS as the silicic precursor, Al(O<sup>s</sup>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>as the aluminic precursor, TPAOH as the structuring agent and the particular block copolymer known as poly(ethylene oxide)<sub>106 </sub>poly(propylene oxide)<sub>70</sub>-poly(ethylene oxide)<sub>106 </sub>(PEO<sub>106</sub>-PPO<sub>70</sub>-PEO<sub>106 </sub>or F127) as the surfactant, shows a correlation peak exhibiting perfect resolution, corresponding to the correlation distance between pores d characteristic of a vermicular type structure and defined by the Bragg law: 2 d*sin(&#x3b8;)=n*&#x3bb;.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The wide-angle X-ray diffraction technique (values of angle 2&#x3b8; ranging between 5&#xb0; and 70&#xb0;) allows to characterize a crystallized solid defined by the repetition of a unit pattern or elementary cell on the molecular scale. As for low-angle X-ray diffraction, the peaks observed in diffractograms corresponding to a given value of angle 2&#x3b8; are associated with the inter-reticular distances d<sub>(hkl) </sub>characteristic of the structural symmetry (symmetries) of the material, ((hkl) being the Miller indices of the reciprocal network) by the Bragg relation: 2 d (hkl)*sin(&#x3b8;)=n*&#x3bb;. This indexing then allows to determine the cell parameters (abc) of the direct network. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction analysis is thus well suited for structural characterization of the zeolitic entities that make up the crystallized wall of the matrix of each elementary spherical particle that the material according to the invention consists of. In particular, it allows to know the diameter of the micropores of the zeolitic entities. For example, the wide-angle X-ray diffractogram of a mesostructured material, whose microporous and crystallized matrix walls of each spherical particle consist of ZSM-5 type aluminosilicate zeolite entities, obtained according to the first material preparation method of the invention using TEOS as the silicic precursor, Al(O<sup>s</sup>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>as the aluminic precursor, TPAOH as the structuring agent and the particular block copolymer known as poly(ethylene oxide)<sub>106</sub>-poly(propylene oxide)<sub>70</sub>-poly(ethylene oxide)<sub>106 </sub>(PEO<sub>106</sub>-PPO<sub>70</sub>-PEO<sub>106 </sub>or F127) as the surfactant, exhibits the wide-angle diffractogram associated with the Pnma symmetry group (No. 62) of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The value of the angle obtained in the X-ray diffractogram allows to go back to the correlation distance d according to the Bragg law: 2 d*sin (&#x3b8;)=n*&#x3bb;. The values of the cell parameters a, b, c (a=20,1 &#x212b;, b=19,7 &#x212b; and c=13,1 &#x212b;) obtained for the zeolitic entity characterization are coherent with the values obtained for a ZSM-5 (MFI structural type) zeolite known to the person skilled in the art (&#x201c;<i>Collection of simulated XRD powder patterns for zeolites&#x201d;, </i>4<sup>th </sup>revised Edition, 2001, M.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Nitrogen volumetric analysis, which corresponds to the physical adsorption of nitrogen molecules in the porosity of the material via a progressive pressure increase at constant temperature, provides information on the particular textural characteristics (pore diameter, porosity type, specific surface area) of the material according to the invention. In particular, it allows to know the total value of the micropore and mesopore volume of the material. The shape of the nitrogen adsorption isotherm and of the hysteresis loop can give information about the presence of the microporosity linked with the zeolitic entities making up the crystallized walls of the matrix of each spherical particle of the material according to the invention and about the nature of the mesoporosity. Quantitative analysis of the microporosity of the material according to the invention is carried out from the &#x201c;t&#x201d; (Lippens-De Boer method, 1965) or the &#x201c;&#x3b1;<sub>s</sub>&#x201d; (method provided by Sing) methods that correspond to transforms of the initial adsorption isotherm as described in &#x201c;<i>Adsorption by powders and porous solids. Principles, methodology and applications</i>&#x201d; written by F. Rouquerol, J. Rouquerol and K. Sing, Academic Press, 1999. These methods allow in particular to obtain the value of the micropore volume characteristic of the microporosity of the material according to the invention, as well as the specific surface area of the sample. The reference solid used is a LiChrospher Si-1000 silica (M. Jaroniec, M. Kruck, J. P. Olivier, <i>Langmuir, </i>1999, 15, 5410). By way of example, the nitrogen adsorption isotherm of a mesostructured material whose microporous and crystallized matrix walls of each spherical particle consist of ZSM-5 type aluminosilicate zeolite entities, obtained according to the first material preparation method of the invention using TEOS as the silicic precursor, Al(O<sup>s</sup>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>as the aluminic precursor, TPAOH as the structuring agent and the particular block copolymer known as poly(ethylene oxide)<sub>106</sub>-polypropylene oxide)<sub>70</sub>-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO<sub>106</sub>-PPO<sub>70</sub>-PEO<sub>106 </sub>or F127) as the surfactant, exhibits a great adsorption jump in the P/P0 low values range (where P0 is the saturated vapour pressure at temperature T), followed by a plateau with a very slight slope over a wide pressure range, characteristic of a microporous material and, for the higher P/P0 values, a type IV isotherm and a type H1 hysteresis loop, the associated pore distribution curve being representative of a mesopore population of uniform size centered in the 1.5-30 nm range. As regards the mesostructured matrix, the difference between the value of the mesopore diameter &#x3c6; and the correlation distance between mesopores d defined by low-angle X-ray diffraction as described above allows to obtain quantity e where e=d&#x2212;&#x3c6; and is characteristic of the thickness of the crystallized walls of the mesostructured matrix of the material according to the invention. Similarly, curve V<sub>ads</sub>(ml/g)=f(&#x3b1;<sub>s</sub>) obtained via the aforementioned &#x3b1;<sub>s </sub>method is characteristic of the presence of microporosity within the material and it leads to a micropore volume value ranging between 0.01 and 0.4 ml/g. Determination of the total micropore and mesopore volume and of the micropore volume as described above leads to a mesopore volume value for the material according to the invention ranging between 0.01 and 1 ml/g.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis is also a commonly used technique for characterizing the organized mesoporosity of the material according to the invention. It allows formation of an image of the solid studied, the contrasts observed being characteristic of the structural organization, the texture, the morphology or the chemical composition of the particles observed, and the resolution of the technique reaches 0.2 nm maximum. In the description hereafter, the TEM photos are obtained from michrotome sections of the sample in order to visualize a section of an elementary spherical particle of the material according to the invention. For example, the TEM images obtained for a mesostructured material the microporous matrix walls of each spherical particle of which consist of ZSM-5 type aluminosilicate zeolite entities obtained according to the first material preparation method of the invention using TEOS as the silicic precursor, Al(O<sub>s</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>as the aluminic precursor, TPAOH as the structuring agent and the particular block copolymer known as poly(ethylene oxide)<sub>106</sub>-poly(propylene oxide)<sub>70</sub>-poly(ethylene oxide)<sub>106 </sub>(PEO<sub>106</sub>-PPO<sub>70</sub>-PEO<sub>106 </sub>or F127) as the surfactant, exhibit spherical elementary particles having a vermicular mesostructure, the matter being defined by the dark zones. Analysis of the image also allows to obtain parameters d, &#x3c6; and e characteristic of the mesostructured matrix defined above. Analysis of the image also allows to visualize the presence of zeolitic entities that make up the walls of the material according to the invention.</p>
