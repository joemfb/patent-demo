<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of lithium anodes for use in electrochemical cells. More particularly, the present invention pertains to an anode for use in an electrochemical cell comprising an anode active layer comprising lithium metal in contact with a multilayer structure comprising three or more layers interposed between the anode active layer and a non-aqueous electrolyte. The present invention also pertains to methods of forming such anodes, electrochemical cells comprising such anodes, and methods of making such cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Throughout this application, various publications, patents, and published patent applications are referred to by an identifying citation. The disclosures of the publications, patents, and published patent specifications referenced in this application are hereby incorporated by reference into the present disclosure to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There has been considerable interest in recent years in developing high energy density batteries with lithium containing anodes. Lithium metal is particularly attractive as the anode of electrochemical cells because of its extremely light weight and high energy density, compared for example to anodes, such as lithium intercalated carbon anodes, where the presence of non-electroactive materials increases weight and volume of the anode, and thereby reduces the energy density of the cells, and to other electrochemical systems with, for example, nickel or cadmium electrodes. Lithium metal anodes, or those comprising mainly lithium metal, provide an opportunity to construct cells which are lighter in weight, and which have a higher energy density than cells such as lithium-ion, nickel metal hydride or nickel-cadmium cells. These features are highly desirable for batteries for portable electronic devices such as cellular phones and laptop computers where a premium is paid for low weight. Unfortunately, the reactivity of lithium and the associated cycle life, dendrite formation, electrolyte compatibility, fabrication and safety problems have hindered the commercialization of cells with lithium anodes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The separation of a lithium anode from the electrolyte of the cell is desirable for reasons including the prevention of dendrites during recharging, reaction with the electrolyte, and cycle life. For example, reactions of lithium anodes with the electrolyte may result in the formation of resistive film barriers on the anode. This film barrier increases the internal resistance of the battery and lowers the amount of current capable of being supplied by the battery at the rated voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many different solutions have been proposed for the protection of lithium anodes including coating the lithium anode with interfacial or protective layers formed from polymers, ceramics, or glasses, the important characteristic of such interfacial or protective layers being to conduct lithium ions. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,460,905 and 5,462,566 to Skotheim describe a film of an n-doped conjugated polymer interposed between the alkali metal anode and the electrolyte. U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,187 to Skotheim and U.S. Pat. No. 5,961,672 to Skotheim et al. describe an electrically conducting crosslinked polymer film interposed between the lithium anode and the electrolyte, and methods of making the same, where the crosslinked polymer film is capable of transmitting lithium ions. U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,765 to Bates describes a thin layer of a lithium ion conducting ceramic coating between the anode and the electrolyte. Yet further examples of interfacial films for lithium containing anodes are described, for example, in: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,387,479 and 5,487,959 to Koksbang; U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,975 to De Jonghe et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,434,021 to Fauteux et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,434 to Kawakami et al.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A single protective layer of an alkali ion conducting glassy or amorphous material for alkali metal anodes, for example, in lithium-sulfur cells, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,094 to Visco et al. to address the problem of short cycle life.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Despite the various approaches proposed for methods for forming lithium anodes and the formation of interfacial or protective layers, there remains a need for improved methods, which will allow for increased ease of fabrication of cells, while providing for cells with long cycle life, high lithium cycling efficiency, and high energy density.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The anode of the present invention for use in an electrochemical cell comprises: (i) a first anode active layer comprising lithium metal; and (ii) a multi-layer structure in contact with a surface layer of the first anode active layer; wherein the multi-layer structure comprises three or more layers, wherein each of the three or more layers comprises a layer selected from the group consisting of single ion conducting layers and polymer layers. In one embodiment, the multi-layer structure comprises four or more layers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The anode active layers of the present invention may further comprise a layer of a temporary protective material in contact with a surface of the first anode active layer, and interposed between the anode active layer and the multilayer. Examples of temporary protective layers include, but are not limited to temporary metal layers, and intermediate layers formed from the reaction of a gaseous material with the lithium surface, such as plasma CO<sub>2 </sub>treatments. The temporary metal layer is capable of forming an alloy with lithium metal or is capable of diffusing into lithium metal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The anodes may further comprise a substrate, wherein the substrate is in contact with a surface of the first layer on the side opposite to the multi-layer structure, or temporary protective layer.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The difficulties encountered by the reactivity of a lithium anode surface of, for example, a Li/S electrochemical cell during storage or cycling, may, according to the present invention, be solved by the use of an anode comprising a multi-layer structure. The multi-layer structure of the anode allows passage of lithium ions while acting as a barrier to other cell components more effectively, than single or dual layer interfacial films.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One aspect of the present invention pertains to an anode for use in an electrochemical cell, wherein the anode comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">(i) a first anode active layer comprising lithium metal; and</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">(ii) a multi-layer structure in contact with a surface of the first layer; wherein the multi-layer structure comprises three or more layers, wherein each of the layers comprises a single ion conducting layer or a polymer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The anode of the electrochemical cells of the present invention may further comprise an intermediate layer between the first anode active layer comprising lithium and the multilayer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Anode Active Layers</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first layer of the anode of the present invention comprises lithium metal as the anode active material. In one embodiment of the anodes of the present invention, the first anode active layer of the anode is lithium metal. The lithium metal may be in the form of a lithium metal foil or a thin lithium film that has been deposited on a substrate, as described below. If desirable for the electrochemical properties of the cell, the lithium metal may be in the form of a lithium alloy such as, for example, a lithium-tin alloy or a lithium aluminum alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The thickness of the first layer comprising lithium may vary from about 2 to 200 microns. The choice of the thickness will depend on cell design parameters such as the excess amount of lithium desired, cycle life, and the thickness of the cathode electrode. In one embodiment, the thickness of the first anode active layer is in the range of about 2 to 100 microns. In one embodiment, the thickness of the first anode active layer is in the range of about 5 to 50 microns. In one embodiment, the thickness of the first anode active layer is in the range of about 5 to 25 microns. In another embodiment, the thickness of the first anode active layer is in the range of about 10 to 25 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The anodes of the present invention may further comprise a substrate, as is known in the art, in contact with a surface of the first anode active layer on the side opposite to that of, for example, the multi-layer structure, intermediate or temporary metal layer. Substrates are useful as a support on which to deposit the first layer comprising the anode active material, and may provide additional stability for handling of thin lithium film anodes during cell fabrication. Further, in the case of conductive substrates, these may also function as a current collector useful in efficiently collecting the electrical current generated throughout the anode and in providing an efficient surface for attachment of the electrical contacts leading to the external circuit. A wide range of substrates are known in the art of anodes. Suitable substrates include, but are not limited to, those selected from the group consisting of metal foils, polymer films, metallized polymer films, electrically conductive polymer films, polymer films having an electrically conductive coating, electrically conductive polymer films having an electrically conductive metal coating, and polymer films having conductive particles dispersed therein. In one embodiment, the substrate is a metallized polymer film. Examples of polymer films include, but are not limited to, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), 1,4-cyclohexanedimethylene terephthalate, polyethylene isophthalate, and polybutylene terephthalate.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Another aspect of the anodes of the present invention pertains to methods to deposit in-situ on a substrate anode-active layers comprising lithium co-deposited with a gaseous material, such as, for example, CO<sub>2 </sub>or acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one aspect of the anode of the present invention, the multi-layered structure of the present invention may be placed in direct contact with a surface of the first anode active layer comprising lithium. In another embodiment of the present invention, it may be desirable for the anode active layer to further comprise an intermediate layer interposed between a surface of the first anode active layer and a surface of the multi-layered structure. Such intermediate layers may, for example, comprise a temporary protective metal layer, or a layer formed from the reaction of CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, or other reactive gaseous material with the lithium surface to provide either a temporary protective material layer or a permanent interfacial protective layer.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The difficulties encountered by the reactivity of a lithium surface during deposition of, for example, anode stabilizing layers (ASL), may, according to the present invention, be solved by depositing over the lithium surface prior to coating or depositing such a stabilizing or other layer, a layer of a temporary protective material, such as, for example, a temporary protective metal. The temporary protective material layer acts as a barrier layer to protect the lithium surface during deposition of other anode layers, such as during the deposition of the multi-layer structure of the present invention. Suitable temporary protective material layers include, but are not limited to, temporary metal layers. Further, the temporary protective layer may allow transportation of the lithium films from one processing station to the next without undesirable reactions occurring at the lithium surface during assembly of cells, or for solvent coating of layers onto the anode.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment of the anode of the present invention, a layer of a temporary protective material may be placed in contact with the first anode active layer comprising lithium metal on the side of the anode active layer facing the multi-layer structure. In one embodiment, the temporary protective material is a temporary metal layer. The temporary protective metal is selected for its ability to form an alloy with, dissolve into, blend with, or diffuse into the lithium metal of the first layer comprising lithium metal. In one embodiment, the metal of the temporary protective layer is selected from the group consisting of copper, magnesium, aluminum, silver, gold, lead, cadmium, bismuth, indium, gallium, germanium, zinc, tin, and platinum. In a preferred embodiment the metal of the temporary protective metal layer is copper.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The thickness of the temporary protective metal layer interposed between the first anode active layer and the multi-layer structure or other layer of the anode is selected to provide the necessary protection to the layer comprising lithium, for example, during subsequent treatments to deposit other anode or cell layers, such as interfacial or protective layers. It is desirable to keep the layer thickness as thin as possible while providing the desired degree of protection so as to not add excess amounts of non-active materials to the cell which would increase the weight of the cell and reduce its energy density. In one embodiment of the present invention, the thickness of the temporary protective layer is about 5 to 500 nanometers. In one embodiment of the present invention, the thickness of the temporary protective layer is about 20 to 200 nanometers. In one embodiment of the present invention, the thickness of the temporary protective layer is about 50 to 200 nanometers. In one embodiment of the present invention, the thickness of the temporary protective layer is about 100 to 150 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">During subsequent storage of an anode of this invention, comprising the first anode active layer and the temporary protective metal layer, or during storage of an electrochemical cell into which an anode of this invention is assembled, or during electrochemical cycling of the cell comprising an anode of the present invention, the temporary protective metal layer is capable of forming an alloy with, dissolving into, blending with, or diffusing into the lithium metal to yield a single anode active layer comprising lithium metal. Lithium metal is known to alloy with certain metals as described herein, and has further been observed to diffuse or alloy with thin layers of certain other metals such as, for example, copper. The interdiffusion or alloying can be assisted by heating the anode assembly. Further it has been found that alloying or diffusion of the temporary protective metal layer and lithium can be slowed or prevented by storage of the anode at low temperatures, such as at or below 0&#xb0; C. This feature may be utilized in the method of preparing anodes of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to another aspect of the present invention an intermediate layer may be formed on a surface of an anode active layer comprising lithium from the reaction of CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, or other reactive gaseous material, such as, for example, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, with the lithium surface. In one embodiment of the anode of the present invention, the intermediate layer is a plasma CO<sub>2 </sub>treatment layer. In one embodiment, the plasma CO<sub>2 </sub>treatment layer is interposed between the first anode active layer and the multi-layered structure of the anode.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Such layers may be formed by treating the surface of the anode active layer, such as a lithium foil or a lithium film on a substrate, or may be formed at the time of vacuum deposition of lithium vapor on a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an alternative approach, an interfacial layer may be formed during the vacuum deposition of lithium films on a substrate by co-depositing in situ lithium vapor and a reactive gaseous material. Such a co-deposition may result in an anode active layer <b>80</b> comprising lithium <b>15</b> and a reaction product of the reactive gas and lithium <b>100</b> on a substrate <b>70</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment of the present invention; the anode comprises: (a) an anode active layer comprising lithium metal co-deposited in-situ with one or more gaseous materials; and (b) a substrate. Suitable gaseous material include, but are not limited to, said one or more materials are selected from the group consisting of carbon dioxide, acetylene, nitrogen, ethylene, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons. Suitable substrates include those selected from the group consisting of metal foils, polymer films, metallized polymer films, electrically conductive polymer films, polymer films having an electrically conductive coating, electrically conductive polymer films having an electrically conductive metal coating, and polymer films having conductive particles dispersed therein. In one embodiment, anode further comprises a multi-layered structure in contact with a surface of the anode active layer, on the side opposite to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Embodiments may be envisaged in which Li/CO<sub>2</sub>/Li/CO<sub>2</sub>/Li layers, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, are built up by successive passes of the anode through the equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The thickness of the intermediate or temporary protective layer, if present as a discrete layer, is selected to provide the necessary protection to the layer comprising lithium, for example, during subsequent treatments to deposit other anode or cell layers, such as interfacial or protective layers. It is desirable to keep the layer thickness as thin as possible while providing the desired degree of protection so as to not add excess amounts of non-active materials to the cell which would increase the weight of the cell and reduce its energy density. Preferably, the thickness of the intermediate or temporary protective layer is about 5 to 500 nanometers, and more preferably is about 20 to 200 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Methods to treat the anode active layer comprising lithium are not limited to vapor or vacuum deposition techniques, and may include treatment with reactive materials in the liquid or fluid state. For example, the surface of the anode active layer comprising lithium may be treated with supercritical fluid CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although it is preferred to interpose the reactive intermediate layer between the anode active layer and the multi-layer structure, or to directly deposit the multi-layered structure on the anode active layer formed by the co-deposition of lithium vapor and a reactive gaseous material, in some instances an anode of the co-deposited anode active layer or of the anode active layer and intermediate layer may be used directly in electrochemical cells without the multilayered structure and may be beneficial to cell performance.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The anodes or anode active layers of the present invention, further comprising a temporary metal layer or other intermediate layer, such as CO<sub>2 </sub>or SO<sub>2 </sub>induced layers, are especially desirable when an interfacial layer of some type is desired between the lithium surface and the electrolyte. For example, when a single ion conducting layer is desired at the lithium interface, it is preferable to deposit this directly on the lithium surface. However, the precursors to or components of such an interfacial layer may react with lithium to produce undesirable by-products or result in undesirable changes in the morphology of the layers. By depositing a temporary protective metal layer or other intermediate layer on the lithium surface prior to depositing the interfacial layer such as the multi-layer structure of the present invention, side reactions at the lithium surface may be eliminated or significantly reduced. For example, when an interfacial film of a lithium phosphorus oxynitride, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,765 to Bates, is deposited in a nitrogen atmosphere by sputtering of Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>onto a lithium surface, the nitrogen gas may react with lithium to form lithium nitride (LiN<sub>3</sub>) at the anode surface. By depositing a layer of a temporary protective metal, for example, copper over the lithium surface, the interfacial layer may be formed without the formation of lithium nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Multi-Layered Structure</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The anodes of the present invention may comprise one or more single ion conducting layers or one or more polymer layers in contact with a surface of the first anode active layer, as described herein. Such combinations of single ion conducting or polymer layers that result in a total of three or more layers are referred to herein as &#x201c;multi-layered structures&#x201d;. In the case of an intermediate layer, such as a temporary protective material layer, on the first anode active layer the multi-layer structure may not be in direct contact with the first anode active layer comprising lithium metal, but in contact with the intermediate layer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment of the present invention, where such an intermediate layer is present, the anode comprises a third layer, which third layer is in contact with a second or intermediate layer, on the side opposite to the first anode active layer, where the first anode active layer comprises lithium metal. In one embodiment, the second or intermediate layer is a temporary protective metal layer. This third layer may function as an interfacial layer, for example, as an anode stabilizing or as an anode protective layer between the anode active layer and the electrolyte of the cell. In one embodiment, the third layer is a single ion conducting layer. In one embodiment, the third layer comprises a polymer. Other types of interfacial or protective layers may also be deposited as a third layer, as are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The thickness of the third layer of the anode of the present invention may vary over a wide range from about 5 nanometers to about 5000 nanometers, and is dependent on the thickness of the layer required to provide the desired beneficial effect of the layer while maintaining properties needed for cell construction such as flexibility and low interfacial resistance. In one embodiment, the thickness of the third layer is in the range of about 10 nanometers to 2000 nanometers. In one embodiment, the thickness is in the range of about 50 nanometers to 1000 nanometers. In one embodiment, the thickness is in the range of about 100 nanometers to 500 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The anode of the present invention may further comprise a fourth layer in contact with a surface of the third layer on the side opposite to the anode active layer or intermediate layer. A fourth layer may be desirable when the components of the third layer, which functions to stabilize or protect the anode active layer comprising lithium, may be unstable to components present in the electrolyte. This fourth layer should be conductive to lithium ions, preferably nonporous to prevent penetration by electrolyte solvents, compatible with electrolyte and the third layer, and flexible enough to accommodate for volume changes in the layers occurring during discharge and charge. The fourth layer should further be insoluble in the electrolyte. As the fourth layer is not directly in contact with the lithium layer, compatibility with metallic lithium is not necessary. Examples of suitable fourth layers include, but are not limited to, organic or inorganic solid polymer electrolytes, electrically and ionically conducting polymers, and metals with certain lithium solubility properties. In one embodiment, the fourth layer comprises a polymer layer, wherein the fourth layer is in contact with the third layer on the side opposite to said second layer. In one embodiment, the polymer of the fourth layer is selected from the group consisting of electrically conductive polymers, ionically conductive polymers, sulfonated polymers, and hydrocarbon polymers. Further examples of suitable polymers for use in the fourth layer of the present invention are those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/399,967, now U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Multi-layer structures of the present invention possess properties superior to those of the individual layers which comprise the multi-layer. Each of the layers of the multi-layer structure, for example, the single ion conducting layers, the polymer layers, and the metal alloy layers, possess desirable properties but at the same time possess certain undesirable properties. For example, single ion conducting layers, especially vacuum deposited single ion conducting layers, are flexible as thin films but as they become thicker grow defects, such as pinholes and rougher surfaces. Metal alloy layers, for example, may block liquid and polysulfide migration, and are very ductile and flexible in thin film form but may interdiffuse with lithium and are electron conducting. Polymer layers and especially crosslinked polymer layers, for example, can provide very smooth surfaces, add strength and flexibility, and may be electron insulating. In the multi-layer structures of the present invention comprising three or more layers comprising one or more single ion conducting layers and one or more polymer layers, and optionally one or more metal alloy layers, it is possible to obtain essentially defect free structures. For example, a crosslinked polymer layer deposited over a single ion conducting layer may smooth the surface and thereby minimize defects in subsequent single ion conducting layers deposited upon it. The crosslinked polymer layer may be viewed as decoupling defects in layers on either side of it. Although the multi-layer structures consisting of three layers are effective in defect reduction of the anode interfacial layer, additional benefit may be gained from four or more layers. The benefits of a defect free layer or structure include efficient exclusion of undesirable species from the lithium surface, which can lead to dendrite formation, self discharge, and loss of cycle life. Other benefits of the multi-layer structure include an increased tolerance of the volumetric changes which accompany the migration of lithium back and forth from the anode during the cycles of discharge and charge of the cell, and improved robustness to withstand stresses during manufacturing processes.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0125">In another aspect of the present invention, the anode active layer comprising lithium may be formed by co-depositing in-situ lithium with one or more gaseous materials onto a substrate. The term &#x201c;co-deposited,&#x201d; as used herein, pertains to a process in which gaseous material or reaction products of gaseous material and lithium, are deposited in-situ onto a substrate with lithium. Co-deposition may be different from first depositing and cooling a lithium film and then post-treating by depositing another layer or reacting with another gaseous material. The term &#x201c;gaseous material,&#x201d; as used herein, pertains to a material which is in the form of a gas under the conditions of temperature and pressure at which the deposition occurs. For example, a material may be a liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, but be in gaseous form under conditions of vapor deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0126">In one embodiment of the present invention, lithium vapor from the deposition source is co-deposited on the substrate in presence of a gaseous material. In one embodiment, lithium vapor from a deposition source is co-deposited on a substrate in the presence of a material from a plasma or from an ion gun. In one embodiment, lithium vapor from the deposition source is condensed onto the substrate and the deposited lithium immediately treated with a gaseous material. In one embodiment, lithium vapor from the deposition source is co-deposited on the substrate in presence of a gaseous material and the deposited lithium immediately treated with a gaseous material. In another embodiment of the present invention, the method employs multiple depositions of lithium vapor, each co-deposited in the presence of a gaseous material by means of multiple passes of the substrate by the deposition source.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0127">Suitable gaseous materials include but are not limited to carbon dioxide, acetylene, nitrogen, ethylene, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons. Suitable materials for co-deposition from a plasma source include, but are not limited to, carbon dioxide, acetylene, nitrogen, ethylene, sulfur dioxide, hydrocarbons, alkyl phosphate esters, alkyl sulfite esters, and alkyl sulfate esters. Preferred gaseous materials are carbon dioxide and acetylene. Most preferred gaseous material is carbon dioxide. The amount of gaseous material co-deposited with the lithium may vary over a wide range. Preferably the amount of the gaseous material co-deposited with the lithium is between 0.2% and 5.0% by weight of the lithium. Higher amounts of gaseous material may result in undesirable insulative deposits of carbonaceous materials on the lithium surface.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0128">The anode active layers formed by the co-deposition in-situ of lithium and a gaseous material may be deposited by methods such as, for example, physical deposition methods and plasma assisted deposition methods. The co-deposition of the gaseous material may be accomplished, for example, by introduction of the gaseous material adjacent to the lithium source in the deposition chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0129">While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that co-deposition of lithium with gaseous material, for example carbon dioxide or acetylene, incorporates carbonaceous material in and/or on the deposited lithium. Carbon dioxide can form a number of products upon reaction with lithium. For example, Zhuang et al., in Surface Science, 1998, 418, 139-149, report that the interaction of carbon dioxide with clean lithium at 320&#xb0; K produces a mixture of species including elemental carbon, a limited amount of CO22- (carbonate), and O2- (oxide). It is noted that the exact composition and ratio of products is temperature dependent. The co-deposition processes of lithium and carbon dioxide may produce a lithium layer with a surface layer comprising elemental carbon, oxide, and carbonate. The co-deposition processes of lithium and carbon dioxide may produce a lithium layer in which elemental carbon, oxide, and carbonate are intimately dispersed or the co-deposition process may produce both intimately dispersed elemental carbon, oxide, and carbonate and a surface layer comprising these components.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0130">The co-deposition process(es) provide suitable methods for the formation of a surface layer formed on the first anode active layer comprising lithium from the reaction of, for example CO<sub>2</sub>, which is interposed between the multi-layer structure and the first anode active layer comprising lithium.</p>

After drying and calendering, the coated cathode active layer thickness was about 15-18 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0206">A coating mixture comprising 86 parts by weight (solid content) of DISPAL 11N<sup>7</sup>-12 (a trademark for boehmite sol available from CONDEA Vista Company, Houston, Tex.), 6 parts by weight (solid content) of AIRVOL 125 (a trademark for polyvinyl alcohol polymer available from Air Products, Inc., Allentown, Pa.), 3 parts by weight of polyethylene oxide (900,000 MW from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wis.) and 5 parts by weight polyethylene oxide dimethylether, M-250, (Fluka Chemical Company, Ronkonkoma, N.Y.) in water was prepared. This coating mixture was coated directly on the cathode active layer above, followed by drying at 130&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0207">A 5% by weight solution of a 3:2 ratio by weight of CD 9038 (a tradename for ethoxylated bisphenol A diacrylate, available from Sartomer Inc., Exton, Pa.) and CN 984 (a tradename for a urethane acrylate available from Sartomer Inc., Exton, Pa.) was prepared by dissolving these macromonomers in ethyl acetate.

<p id="p-0201" num="0208">An anode for making small flat cells was made from commercial 50 &#x3bc;m lithium foil.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0209">Small flat cells were made by the method of Example 7 from the separator coated cathode and lithium foil but using 0.3 g of electrolyte.

<heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 14</heading>
<p id="p-0206" num="0213">A vacuum web coating system located in a dry room, having an unwind drive, liquid cooled drum, load cell rollers for controlling tension, a rewind drive, and two deposition zones, was loaded with an anode substrate of 23 &#x3bc;m PET metallized on one side with 100 nm of copper. The chamber was evacuated to 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>Torr. Lithium was deposited on to the substrate by first heating a thermal evaporation Li source to 550&#xb0; C. to allow significant evaporation, and then starting the web drive at 1.2 feet per minute. The lithium evaporation was allowed to stabilize to give an 8 &#x3bc;m coating of lithium on the copper of the substrate layer (PET/Cu/Li). The DC magnetron sputtering source zone, positioned after the lithium source, was brought up to 2.4 mTorr while bringing the lithium evaporation zone only up to 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>torr. The sputtering source was given 2 kW power and copper was deposited on top of the lithium layer to a thickness of either 120, 60 or 30 nm to give a composite anode of PET/Cu/Li/Cu. The web was removed from the coating system in the dry room.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0214">A PET/Cu/Li/Cu composite anode, with a 120 nm temporary copper protective layer and a comparative PET/Cu/Li anode were tested for reactivity to isopropyl alcohol by placing a sample in a dish and covering it with alcohol. While the lithium without the copper temporary protective coating reacted quickly, the temporary protective copper coated lithium was observed not to significantly react.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0215">Visual observations of lithium/Cu layers showed that lithium with a 120 nm temporary copper protective layer was stable for storage overnight under vacuum at room temperature. When this sample was heated in an oven at about 90&#xb0; C., the pink coloration of the copper layer disappeared as the copper and lithium layers inter-diffused, alloyed, or mixed. A similar sample placed in a freezer at about &#x2212;15&#xb0; C. still retained its pink color after 11 months. Samples with copper layers of 30 or 60 nm of copper were less stable, with the copper coloration disappearing after storage overnight.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 15</heading>
<p id="p-0209" num="0216">Three copper protected lithium anodes were formed by coating copper onto the lithium surface of a PET/copper/lithium anode structure as described in Example 14. The thickness of the coated copper layers on the outer surface of the lithium were 30, 60 and 120 nanometers. The copper protected lithium anodes were stored at room temperature overnight.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0217">Small flat cells were assembled from the copper protected lithium anodes (PET/copper/lithium/copper) or uncoated PET/copper/lithium anodes as a control, with a cathode prepared by coating a mixture of 75 parts of elemental sulfur (available from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wis.), 15 parts of a conductive carbon pigment PRINTEX XE-2 (a trademark for a carbon pigment available from Degussa Corporation, Akron, Ohio), and 10 parts of PYROGRAF-III (a tradename for carbon filaments available from Applied Sciences, Inc., Cedarville, Ohio) dispersed in isopropanol onto one side of a 17 micron thick conductive carbon coated aluminum foil substrate (Product No. 60303 available from Rexam Graphics, South Hadley, Mass.). After drying, the coated cathode active layer thickness was about 30 microns and the loading of sulfur in the cathode active layer was 1.07 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The electrolyte was a 1.4 M solution of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, (lithium imide, available from 3M Corporation, St. Paul, Minn.) in a 40:55:5 volume ratio mixture of 1,3-dioxolane, dimethoxyethane, and tetraethyleneglycol divinylether. The porous separator used was 16 micron E25 SETELA (a trademark for a polyolefin separator available from Tonen Chemical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan, and also available from Mobil Chemical Company, Films Division, Pittsford, N.Y.). The active area of the cathode and anode in the small flat cells was 25 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0218">The assembled cells were stored for 2 weeks at room temperature during which the impedance was periodically measured. The high frequency impedance (175 KHz) was found to be equal for both the control cells and the cells with copper protected lithium surfaces, irrespective of the thickness of the copper protective layer, and was representative of the conductivity of the electrolyte in the porous Tonen separator, about 10.9 ohm Cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0219">Initial measurements of the low frequency impedance (80 Hz) was observed to be different for the control and copper protected lithium anodes, and was dependent on the thickness of the copper protective layer and storage time. Storage time measurements showed that the cells with a 30 nm copper protective layer had a impedance 20% higher than the control cell, while the impedance was 200% higher for cells with 60 nm copper protective layers and 500% higher for cells with 120 nm copper protective layers. The impedance for fresh control cells was around 94 ohm cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0220">During storage of the cells with copper protected lithium, the impedance decreased and became equal to that of the control cells in two days for cells for 30 nm Cu, in 5 days for cells with 60 nm Cu, and in 14 days for cells with 120 nm Cu protective layers.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0221">After storage, all cells were discharged at a current density of 0.4 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and a voltage cutoff 1.25 V. The delivered capacities were found to be equal for the control cells and the cells with temporary copper protective layers, showing that the temporary Cu layers disappeared in about two weeks and did not prevent electrochemical cycling or reduce the cell performance.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0222">While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific and general embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.</p>
