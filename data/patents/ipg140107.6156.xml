<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A multi-tenant collaborative review service that facilitates collaborative review of a review target artifact set. The service is multi-tenant in that it provides common functions and infrastructure that are available across multiple tenants supported by the review service. Furthermore, the review service is extensible in that it provides an extensibility point into which tenant-specific functions may be incorporated into the review service. For each one or more of the tenants, the corresponding review target artifact set is distributed such that a tenant-accessible subset of the artifact set is maintained uniquely accessible by the corresponding tenant, and such that a centralized service subset of the review target artifact set is maintained remote from the corresponding tenant.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Computer systems and services have revolutionized the way people live, work, and do business. The operation of such systems and services are directed, in large part, by computer software. Computer software is often generated by computer programmers drafting source code (i.e., a computer program). That source code is ultimately compiled or interpreted into machine readable code prior to and/or at execution time.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As the functionality of such computing systems and services has increased, computer programs have become ever more complex. Many computer programs are too complex to be authored by any one person. Accordingly, computer programs are often collaboratively authored by a team of computer programmers. In order to facilitate collaborative authoring of computer programs, a variety of helpful conventional collaborative authoring programs exist. For instance, such tools often permit the team to move from one version of the code to the next, until a final version of the code is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition to being more complex to author, the software should be carefully reviewed for each version of the code. Accordingly, collaborative review programs also exist. Thus, while collaborative authoring programs permit changes to be made in order to move from one version of the code to the next, collaborative review programs enable detailed review of each version of the code so as to understand and plan the changes that should be made in the next phase of authoring.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At least one embodiment described herein relates to a multi-tenant collaborative review service that performs a method for facilitating collaborative review of a review target artifact set that includes a primary goal component of review. As an example, the primary goal component may be a source code document. The service is multi-tenant in that it provides common functions that are available across multiple tenants supported by the review service. Furthermore, the review service is extensible in that it provides an extensibility point into which tenant-specific functions may be incorporated into the review service. For each of one or more of the tenants, the corresponding review target artifact set is distributed such that a tenant-accessible subset of the review target artifact set is maintained uniquely accessible by the corresponding tenant, and such that a centralized service subset of the review target artifact set is maintained remote from the corresponding tenant.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, the distribution of this review target artifact set is done to preserve the confidentiality of the tenant such that sensitive data that is proprietary to the tenant is left accessible only to the tenant, while less sensitive or non-sensitive data may be remote from the tenant, perhaps local to the review service. In some embodiments, when certain types of changes are made to the review target artifact set (e.g., perhaps the addition of a comment to a discussion thread), at least some of the other members of the tenant are notified in real-time. Thus, a multi-tenant collaborative and extensible review service is described.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with embodiments described herein, a multi-tenant collaborative review service is described. The service facilitates collaborative review of at least one review target artifact set for each of multiple tenants. Each review target artifact set includes a primary goal component that is under review. As an example, the primary goal component may be a source code document. The review service is extensible in that it provides an extensibility point into which tenant-specific functions may be incorporated into the review service. Thus, though there may be common functions available to all tenants, tenants are still permitted a unique experience for each tenant. For each one or more of the tenants, the corresponding review target artifact set is distributed such that a tenant-accessible subset of the review target artifact set is uniquely accessible by the corresponding tenant, and such that a centralized service subset of the review target artifact set is maintained remote from the corresponding tenant. This distribution may be done to preserve confidences of the tenant. First, some introductory discussion regarding computing systems will be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Then, the embodiments of the collaborative review service will be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 7</figref>. Finally, an example client-side experience will be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">First, introductory discussion regarding computing systems is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Computing systems are now increasingly taking a wide variety of forms. Computing systems may, for example, be handheld devices, appliances, laptop computers, desktop computers, mainframes, distributed computing systems, or even devices that have not conventionally been considered a computing system. In this description and in the claims, the term &#x201c;computing system&#x201d; is defined broadly as including any device or system (or combination thereof) that includes at least one physical and tangible processor, and a physical and tangible memory capable of having thereon computer-executable instructions that may be executed by the processor. The memory may take any form and may depend on the nature and form of the computing system.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A computing system may be distributed over a network environment and may include multiple constituent computing systems. For instance, a service (such as a web service) is often a computing system that is distributed over a network. An example of the service is the review service described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in its most basic configuration, a computing system <b>100</b> typically includes at least one processing unit <b>102</b> and memory <b>104</b>. The memory <b>104</b> may be physical system memory, which may be volatile, non-volatile, or some combination of the two. The term &#x201c;memory&#x201d; may also be used herein to refer to non-volatile mass storage such as physical storage media. If the computing system is distributed, the processing, memory and/or storage capability may be distributed as well. As used herein, the term &#x201c;module&#x201d; or &#x201c;component&#x201d; can refer to software objects or routines that execute on the computing system. The different components, modules, engines, and services described herein may be implemented as objects or processes that execute on the computing system (e.g., as separate threads).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the description that follows, embodiments are described with reference to acts that are performed by one or more computing systems. If such acts are implemented in software, one or more processors of the associated computing system that performs the act direct the operation of the computing system in response to having executed computer-executable instructions. An example of such an operation involves the manipulation of data. The computer-executable instructions (and the manipulated data) may be stored in the memory <b>104</b> of the computing system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Computing system <b>100</b> may also contain communication channels <b>108</b> that allow the computing system <b>100</b> to communicate with other computing systems over, for example, network <b>110</b>. The computing system may also include a display <b>112</b> that may display one or more user interfaces that a user of the computing system may interface with. For instance, if the computing system <b>100</b> were a client computing system, a user may interact with the computing system using the display <b>112</b>. The display may, for example, display portions of the review target artifact set to the client. Applications that run on the client computing system are also referred to herein as &#x201c;client-side applications&#x201d;. In the context of a review application, the client-side application may be responsible for displaying the portions of the review target artifact set, receiving updates regarding the review target artifact set from the review service, interpreting user input, notifying the review service of certain types of user input, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments described herein may comprise or utilize a special purpose or general-purpose computer including computer hardware, such as, for example, one or more processors and system memory, as discussed in greater detail below. Embodiments described herein also include physical and other computer-readable media for carrying or storing computer-executable instructions and/or data structures. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer system. Computer-readable media that store computer-executable instructions are physical storage media. Computer-readable media that carry computer-executable instructions are transmission media. Thus, by way of example, and not limitation, embodiments of the invention can comprise at least two distinctly different kinds of computer-readable media: computer storage media and transmission media.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Computer storage media includes RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A &#x201c;network&#x201d; is defined as one or more data links that enable the transport of electronic data between computer systems and/or modules and/or other electronic devices. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a transmission medium. Transmissions media can include a network and/or data links which can be used to carry or desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, upon reaching various computer system components, program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures can be transferred automatically from transmission media to computer storage media (or vice versa). For example, computer-executable instructions or data structures received over a network or data link can be buffered in RAM within a network interface module (e.g., a &#x201c;NIC&#x201d;), and then eventually transferred to computer system RAM and/or to less volatile computer storage media at a computer system. Thus, it should be understood that computer storage media can be included in computer system components that also (or even primarily) utilize transmission media.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data which, when executed at a processor, cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. The computer executable instructions may be, for example, binaries, intermediate format instructions such as assembly language, or even source code. Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the described features or acts described above. Rather, the described features and acts are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations, including, personal computers, desktop computers, laptop computers, message processors, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, mobile telephones, PDAs, pagers, routers, switches, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed system environments where local and remote computer systems, which are linked (either by hardwired data links, wireless data links, or by a combination of hardwired and wireless data links) through a network, both perform tasks. In a distributed system environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a collaborative environment <b>200</b> that includes a multi-tenant collaborative review service <b>201</b> that facilitates collaborative review of a primary goal component. The review service <b>201</b> may be performed by a computing system, or multiple interacting computing systems. Such computing systems may, for example, be structured as described above for the computing system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The review service <b>201</b> may be a software solution that is performed using a computer program product having one or more computer-readable storage media having thereon computer-executable instructions that are structured such that, when executed by the processor(s) of the computing system, cause the computing system to operate the review service or its portion of the review service.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The review service <b>201</b> is multi-tenant, each tenant having members that collaboratively review one or more corresponding primary goal components. For instance, one tenant may collaboratively review one component of a software package, another tenant may collaboratively review another component of the software package, and so forth. That said, confidentiality is preserved between tenants using mechanisms described hereinafter. Accordingly, one tenant may be from one company, and another may be from another company that is working on an entirely unrelated project. Furthermore, since the primary goal component for each tenant may be different, each tenant may be working on different kinds of primary goal components. For instance, one tenant might be working on source code text, while another tenant might be working on a design document, while yet another might be working on a word processing document.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the review service <b>201</b> is illustrated as serving three tenants <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> and <b>213</b>. However, the ellipses <b>214</b> represent that the review service <b>201</b> may represent as few as one tenant to as many as thousands of tenants, or more, with no theoretical upper bound. However, there are preferably at least two tenants to take full advantage of the multi-tenant and extensibility features of the collaborative review service <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there are three members <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> and <b>223</b> of the tenant <b>211</b> as represented by the dashed-lined box. In addition there are three members <b>223</b>, <b>224</b> and <b>225</b> of the tenant <b>212</b> as represented by the dotted-lined box. Note how member <b>223</b> is a member of two tenants <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>, as occasionally a member may be working on two different teams. Finally, there are two members <b>226</b> and <b>227</b> of the tenant <b>213</b> as represented by the intermittent dotted-dashed lined box.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A member may be a human being that is a member of a team corresponding to the tenant, in which case the member may use a client computing system (including perhaps a client-side application) to interface with the review service. Alternatively, the member may be an automated analysis process performed by a computing system that has artificial intelligence capable of (and properly authorized to) perform a review. In one example, suppose that an author has published an iteration (or a version) of a source code document. Suppose further that the source code has an unreferenced variable or a variable with a name that does not match the standard naming conventions. An annotations function (an example of an automated analysis process) might find the unreferenced variable, perform some calculation to determine that this variable should be annotated, and add some comment to a discussion thread corresponding to this variable</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The memberships illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are of course just an example. A tenant may have any number of members, and sometimes the membership dynamically changes. For instance, if the tenant corresponded to a software development team that was working on a piece of source code, a new hire to that team would be added as a member of that corresponding tenant.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each tenant <b>211</b> through <b>213</b> has their own data store <b>231</b> through <b>233</b> respectively. While these data stores <b>231</b> through <b>233</b> may be local to each corresponding tenant <b>211</b> through <b>213</b>, respectively, that need not be the case. Nevertheless, regardless of where the data store is, the data stores <b>231</b> through <b>233</b> are uniquely accessible by the corresponding tenant <b>211</b> through <b>213</b>. In this description and in the claims, the corresponding data store is &#x201c;uniquely accessible&#x201d; to the corresponding tenant in that entities that are not members of that tenant are not given access to the corresponding data store unless with the specific permission of the tenant. The review service maintains a high level of confidentiality between tenants by keeping the most sensitive tenant data on the corresponding tenant data store (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;tenant-accessible data&#x201d; or a &#x201c;tenant-accessible subset&#x201d;), and may maintain less sensitive data, or completely non-sensitive data at a location remote from the tenant and more accessible to the review service <b>201</b> (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;centralized service data&#x201d; or a &#x201c;centralized service subset&#x201d;). For instance, such less sensitive or non-sensitive data may be maintained at a data store <b>260</b> that is accessible to the review service <b>201</b>. However, even though the data located at the data store <b>260</b> is less sensitive, the review service <b>201</b> may still impose security on access to such data providing protection so that such data is only provided to the corresponding tenant that owns that data.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The review service <b>201</b> includes common function(s) <b>202</b> that represent one or more functions that are common across all of the tenants <b>211</b> through <b>213</b>. For instance, suppose that tenants <b>211</b> through <b>213</b> each correspond to a software development team, and that the primary goal component for each tenant is source code text. The common function(s) might include functions that would apply regardless of the development team. Perhaps these are functions that may be helpful to software development teams regardless of the preferences of the tenant. As an example, the common functions <b>202</b> might include a change tracking function, a versioning function, a notification function, a discussion thread function, statistics functions, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For instance, the statistics function might track statistics such as 1) how many and which members are actively working on reviewing the primary goal component, 2) how much time has elapsed since anyone or a particular member has commented on the primary goal component, 3) who has signed-off on the primary goal component, 4) the average length of time between the time that members start reviewing until the time that they sign-off on the primary goal component, 5) the average time between the time that the review service receives notice of a change to the review target artifact set (described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and the time that this change is distributed to other members of the tenant, 6) the processing, memory and other resources used to service a particular tenant, and so forth. The review service <b>201</b> may perform any other desired statistics as well using the information provided to it.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The fact that the review service is multi-tenant and provides common functions across all tenants allows multiple tenants to use the review service, rather than forcing each tenant to find their own collaborative review mechanism. Still, the experience of each tenant is separated from the experience of other tenants such that the appearance to each tenant is that the review service is helping just them. Accordingly, the review service is an efficient way of facilitating collaborative review for multiple tenants.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The review service <b>201</b> also includes tenant-specific functions <b>240</b> that may be incorporated into the review service. These tenant-specific functions <b>240</b> may each apply to only a subset of the tenants <b>211</b> through <b>213</b>. In a simple example, the tenant-specific functions <b>240</b> includes three tenant-specific functions <b>241</b> through <b>243</b>, though ellipses <b>244</b> represent that that there may be other numbers of tenant-specific functions. Any given tenant may have one or more tenant-specific functions applied to them. In some case, there might be a tenant that is just to have the common functions <b>202</b> applied, with no tenant-specific functions. As a specific example, perhaps tenant-specific function <b>241</b> may be applied only to tenant <b>211</b>, tenant-specific function <b>242</b> may be applied only to tenant <b>212</b>, and tenant-specific function <b>243</b> may be applied only to tenant <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Tenant-specific functions are functions that maybe do not apply across all of the tenants <b>211</b> through <b>213</b>, but may apply specifically to the objectives and preferences of the team. As an example, one team might use sign-offs, whereas another may not. In that case, the sign-off function might be applied to tenant <b>211</b>, but not tenants <b>212</b> and <b>213</b>. Another example is a policy function. For instance, one tenant might require two sign-offs to mark a review as complete, while another may require only one. Even though both tenants might use the same policy function, they may have different configurations or thresholds. Another tenant may have certain preferences with respect to how revisions are shown when comparing versions of the primary goal component. One might prefer to show added text in one way (e.g., highlighted yellow), while another might prefer another mechanism (e.g., underlining). These preferences may also be expressed as part of the tenant-specific functions. In one embodiment, the tenant-specific functions <b>241</b> through <b>243</b> are each hierarchically structured documents, such as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents. However, the tenant-specific functions might alternatively be plug-in code, or any other mechanism that is recognized by the review service <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As previously mentioned, the server-side functions <b>240</b> are provided to facilitate tenant-specific functionality. There may also be client-side functions as well that collaborate with the common functions <b>202</b> and/or with the tenant-specific functions <b>240</b> to provide further customization for each tenant.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The review service <b>201</b> provides an application programming interface <b>250</b> that the tenants <b>211</b> through <b>213</b> may use to communicate with the review service <b>201</b>. For instance, one specific example is that the tenants <b>211</b> through <b>213</b> may communicate with the review service <b>201</b> for purposes of modifying tenant-specific functions <b>240</b> that apply to the corresponding tenant. For example, the tenant may add a tenant-specific function to the tenant-specific functions <b>240</b>, or perhaps modify or replace one of the tenant-specific functions. The tenant may also set user preferences, customization, or to set other configuration data that is offered by the common functions <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a review target artifact set <b>300</b> that is presented to show the various components that support the collaboration experience for each tenant. Thus, since each tenant has a different primary goal component, each tenant will use a different review target artifact set <b>300</b>. The review target artifact set <b>300</b> includes authored data <b>310</b>. The authored data includes the primary goal component <b>311</b>, but also includes secondary components <b>312</b> that comment on the primary goal component <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The primary goal component <b>311</b> is actually the subject of the collaboration. The primary goal component <b>311</b> may include text, images, icons, or any other renderable component, or combinations thereof. For instance, the primary goal component might be a text document such as a source code document, a design document, or some other type of word processing document.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The secondary components <b>312</b> of the authored data are authored data (e.g., other text) that is in support of the collaborative review of the primary goal component <b>312</b>. As an example, the secondary components <b>312</b> may be discussion threads that correspond to a region of the primary goal component <b>311</b>. This region may be a word, partial line, any number of lines, or any other portion of the primary goal component <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">More specifically, suppose that the primary goal component <b>311</b> were source code text, there might be a thread highlighting a branching statement that includes some discussion about what the conditions of the branching statement should be. There might be multiple contributors to that discussion thread with multiple members of the tenant weighing in on the question.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another portion of the source code, there may be an integer declaration of a variable. There might be a corresponding discussion thread regarding that declaration concerning the issue of whether the integer declaration should really be a floating point declaration and the discussion of some circumstances in which it may be more accurate for that variable to take on a fractional value. Thus, using such discussion threads, multiple minds can gather concerning a very focused issue in the primary goal component. In one embodiment, such discussion threads are updated substantially in real-time. This allows for consolidated and efficient gathering of thoughts of team members regarding various portions of the primary goal component.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Some discussion threads may be design oriented. For instance, perhaps a reviewer has commented regarding whether an identified class is cohesive, and/or perhaps has unnecessary coupling to a particular component.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Some discussion threads may be logic oriented. For instance, a reviewer may comment regarding some consequences to the execution of the code (e.g., the system will crash) if a particular parameter value (e.g., a negative value) is passed into the identified method.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Some discussion threads may be stylistically oriented. For instance, a reviewer might comment that an identified portion of the code may read better if the code were to be modified in some way.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Some discussion threads may be general or give some type of constructive feedback. For instance, a reviewer might give praise for a fix to some identified region of code, or may perhaps compliment on how well a region of code is drafted on short notice.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The review target artifact set <b>300</b> also includes metadata <b>320</b>, which is tenant-specific metadata regarding the primary goal component <b>311</b> or regarding other administrative tenant-specific matters. The types of such metadata <b>320</b> are not limited, but could be, for example, sign-off data, member status data, tenant membership data, preference data, customization data, primary goal component information such as creation date and size, and so forth. For instance, the member status data may include a status of a review of the primary goal component such as (but not limited to): whether the reviewer has started the review, is in the process of reviewing, is waiting for the author(s), or has signed-off on the review.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The review service <b>201</b> maintains confidentiality of each tenant by distributing the review target artifact set <b>300</b> appropriately between the data store of the tenant (e.g., data store <b>231</b> of tenant <b>211</b>) and the data store <b>260</b> of the review service <b>201</b>, as previously mentioned. The tenant itself may specify, as part of their preferences, which data is permitted to reside where, or which data they consider to be too sensitive to store at the review service. For instance, perhaps some of the authored data <b>310</b> is located at the tenant, and some of the authored data <b>310</b> is located at the review service.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, most of or all of the primary goal component <b>311</b> remains in the tenant data store, whereas other secondary components <b>312</b> of the authored data <b>310</b> (such as the discussion thread data) may be stored remotely at the review service data store <b>260</b>. In addition, perhaps the metadata <b>320</b> also may be stored at the review service data store <b>260</b>. The metadata <b>320</b> may further include other pointers or references that the review service <b>201</b> may use to properly notify the tenant of changes such that the client interfaces may be updated accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Such pointers and references are particularly useful as the review service <b>201</b> may not have a copy of the primary goal component itself, but may still need to direct the client that the member is using to the appropriate location. For instance, though the review service may not actually have a copy of a source code document that is under review, the review service may have a copy of a discussion thread, and may have a correlation of that discussion thread with a particular address (e.g., line number, column number range) within the source code text. As another example, if the client wants to compare two versions of the primary goal component, the review service may be able to direct the client to the appropriate storage locations for those two versions.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a method <b>400</b> for facilitating collaborative review of a primary goal component. The method <b>400</b> includes providing common functions (act <b>401</b>) that are available across a plurality of tenants supported by the review service. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, such primary functions could be, for example, the common function(s) <b>202</b>. The method <b>400</b> also includes providing an extensibility point (act <b>402</b>) into which tenant-specific functions may be incorporated into the review service. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the extensibility point may be the API <b>250</b> or any other mechanism that would allow tenant-specific functions to be available to the review service <b>201</b>. The review service then executes a real-time review service using the common functions and the tenant-specific functions (act <b>403</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The &#x201c;real-time&#x201d; review service causes, in at least some instances, each of at least some members of the tenant to be updated when a change has occurred to the primary goal component or the secondary components of the authored data. As an example, suppose a tenant member adds a comment to a discussion thread regarding a portion of the primary goal component. The review service may identify that this has occurred, and make a decision to notify each member of the tenant (that is authoring and/or reviewing the primary goal component) of the change immediately. That way, each relevant review member of the tenant may see the new comment as soon as the review service is able to notify them. In some cases, this may take as little as a few seconds, or even a fraction of a second, perhaps even leading to a real-time two way conversation held through the review service with focus on a particular portion of the primary goal component. On the client machine, that discussion thread may be visually associated with the corresponding portion of the primary goal component to which the discuss thread is related.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">This notification may be made directly to a client application assuming that the reviewer has a client-side application open that renders the change. However, the change may also be transmitted alternatively or additionally by e-mail, thereby allowing even those reviewers who do not have the client-side application open to be notified of the change. However, the principles described herein are not limited to the manner in which the reviewers are notified, nor to the number of reviewers that are notified in particular ways.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a method <b>500</b> for the review service to respond to notification of modification to facilitate selective real-time updating of client machines across the reviewers on the tenant. In this method, the review service is configured to update at least some of members of a corresponding tenant when one of the tenant-specific metadata <b>320</b> and authored data <b>310</b> is updated.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The review service receives a notification of the update (act <b>501</b>) to the target review artifact set corresponding to a tenant. The review service then updates the tenant-specific metadata or centralized service data (act <b>502</b>) as appropriate. In order to do this, the review service <b>201</b> may execute one or more of the common functions <b>202</b>, and may also execute any tenant-specific functions <b>240</b> that apply to the corresponding tenant.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For instance, suppose that the client receives a notification (hereinafter called the &#x201c;comment example notification&#x201d;) in which a comment is appended to an existing discussion thread regarding a particular portion of a source code document. The review service would thereby update the thread discussion stored at the review service. As a second example, suppose that the client receives a notification (hereinafter called the &#x201c;sign-off example notification&#x201d;). In that case, the review service would update the metadata corresponding to the source code document to reflect the new sign-off status.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The review service then determines if member(s) of corresponding tenant are to be notified of change in real-time (decision block <b>503</b>). If there is to be such a real-time notification (&#x201c;Yes&#x201d; in decision block <b>503</b>), then the relevant member(s) of the tenant (e.g., those who are collaboratively reviewing the corresponding primary goal component) are so notified (act <b>504</b>). The form of the notification may include any information that would be helpful to the client machine in rendering an update to the member. The formulation of this notification may be performed in response to the review service <b>201</b> executing one or more of the common functions <b>202</b> and/or one or more of the tenant-specific functions <b>240</b> corresponding to the tenant.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the comment example notification, each member of a review team might be notified of updates in the discussion thread. The notifications back to the client may cause the client to reflect the notification in appropriate ways. For instance, in this case, as the user navigates to the portion of the primary goal component that corresponds to the discussion thread, the discussion thread may appear with the new comment visually emphasized. In this or other cases, another visualization may appear on the client to let each reviewer know as new comments are added to the discussion threads associated with the primary goal component.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the sign-off example notification, a sign-off can be a significant event, as it indicates that a team member of the tenant considers the primary goal component in final form. Thus, each team member might be notified of this particular event. The client machine may be made to reflect this sign-off status.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If the review service determines that no such notification should be made in real-time (&#x201c;No&#x201d; in decision block <b>503</b>), then the review service may determine whether any notification should occur at all (decision block <b>505</b>). If there is to be a notification, but just not a real-time notification (&#x201c;Yes&#x201d; in decision block <b>505</b>), then the notification may be queued for later delivery (act <b>506</b>). Alternatively, when there is notification, the notification is immediate and not queued, and is sent to the client-side application, or may be sent by e-mail. In this embodiment, the reviewer would either have the client-side application opened, or would just see the e-mail notification, in which case there would be no need for separate queuing of the notification. Regardless, if there is also not a need for any notification at all (&#x201c;No&#x201d; in decision block <b>505</b>), no further action is taken (act <b>507</b>). The criteria for determining when to send a notification and what to include in the notification may be set by the tenant to customize the experience and/or to support tenant-specific functions. The determination of whether to notify the other members of the tenant, which members to notify, and what should be included in the notification may be determined by execution of one or more of the common methods <b>202</b> and/or one or more of the tenant-specific methods <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a method <b>600</b> for facilitating tenant-unique collaborative review of a primary goal component using a collaborative multi-tenant review service. As previously mentioned, the application programming interface <b>250</b> or another mechanism may be used to modify the tenant-specific functions <b>240</b>. The application programming interface <b>250</b> may also be used to set tenant or user preference or customization settings. Upon receiving an instruction to modify the tenant-specific functions (act <b>601</b>) (e.g., through an application programming interface <b>250</b>), the review service automatically modifies the tenant-specific functions (act <b>602</b>). Such modification may, for example, include adding a tenant-specific function to the tenant specific functions, or perhaps modifying or replacing a tenant-specific function.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Accordingly, a multi-tenant collaborative review system has been described that allows for separation of the collaborative review experience by tenant in both access to data, and also in the overall functional experience. For efficiency, multiple tenants may thus be served by a single review service that also offers common functions across all (or at least a significant portion of) the tenants.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates one very specific embodiment <b>700</b> of the collaborative environment <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Here, the clients <b>710</b> includes clients <b>711</b> through <b>715</b> are a variety of different types of client demonstrating that the principles described herein are not limited to a particular client type. In the illustrated case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, client <b>711</b> is a standalone graphical user interface client that installs an application when a user clicks on a link, client <b>712</b> is a command line review client, client <b>713</b> is a command line project client, client <b>714</b> is an application-specific client that is specific to the collaborative service, and client <b>715</b> is another custom client.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The data store <b>720</b> represents the local tenant store, which may be controlled using Access Control techniques. In addition to the service extensions represented by tenant-specific functions <b>240</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there may be extensibility on the client-side as well as represented by the client side extensions <b>731</b>, <b>732</b> and <b>733</b>. Although not necessary, the clients <b>710</b> also may have access to an ACTIVE DIRECTORY&#xae; <b>740</b> for storing configuration information. Alternatively or in addition, the Active Directory may be used to lookup reviewer or author information. The service extensions <b>750</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> represent examples of the tenant-specific functions <b>240</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this case, the service extension <b>750</b> includes a dashboard service <b>751</b> that provides a dashboard-based user interface control to the client. The dashboard service <b>751</b> has access to a database <b>752</b>. The dashboard service <b>751</b> is a client endpoint that the user can leverage to see what outstanding reviews require their attention/input.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The services <b>760</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an example of the review service <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this case, the common functions of the review service include a discovery service <b>761</b>, a review service <b>762</b>, and a project service <b>763</b>. The services <b>760</b> have access to project configuration files <b>771</b> and review metadata <b>772</b>. In one embodiment, the services <b>760</b> and the service extensions <b>750</b> are authored using WINDOWS&#xae; Communication Foundation (WCF). E-mail notifications from the services <b>760</b> may be made via the e-mail server.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> illustrate example user interfaces that represent user interfaces for client-side applications. These examples demonstrate an example client experience when notified of an updated to the target review artifact set. In the illustrated cases, the primary goal component is a source code document, of which lines <b>906</b> through <b>929</b> are shown. Understanding that these are just examples, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> will now be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a differential view user interface <b>800</b> that includes a code view area <b>801</b> that shows a differential view comparing multiple versions of the code referred to herein as an &#x201c;original version&#x201d; and a &#x201c;revised version&#x201d;. The user interface <b>800</b> also includes a file selection area <b>802</b>, a reviewer status area <b>803</b>, and a comment view area <b>804</b>. The file selection area <b>802</b> lists several code files that could be reviewed, with file <b>821</b> being selected. The selected code file <b>821</b> is displayed in the code view area <b>801</b>. Since the code under review is much larger than can be displayed in the code view area (as would most often be the case), the code view area <b>801</b> has several navigation aids. For instance, the code view area <b>801</b> has a vertical scroll bar <b>815</b> and a horizontal scroll bar <b>816</b>, which are activated to be in use whenever the vertical scope and horizontal scope, respectively, of the code exceed that illustrated in the code view area <b>801</b>. The code view area <b>801</b> also has position reference indicators <b>817</b> and <b>818</b> that represent the current vertical position of the viewable code within the entire scope of the code. In particular, reference indicator <b>817</b> represents the position of the viewable code within the original version of the code, and reference indicator <b>818</b> represents the position of the viewable code within the revised version of the code.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The use of a differential view allows the review to quickly ascertain the differences between different versions of the code, so that they can focus more deeply on specific changes made between versions. The principles described herein are not limited to the manner of visualization or the actual visualization itself of the differences between versions of the code. However, the use of color is one of an infinite variety of ways in which differentiation could be visualized.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">That said, the use of color is avoided in this patent application. Instead, areas marked with rightward facing hashed boxes are used instead of red highlighting in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (but such areas will be still be referred to herein as being &#x201c;red-highlighted&#x201d; with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Furthermore, areas marked with leftward facing hashed boxes are used instead of yellow highlighting in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (but such areas will still be referred to as being &#x201c;yellow-highlighted&#x201d; with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Areas marked with underlining in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are used instead of green highlighting in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (but such areas will still be referred to as being &#x201c;green-highlighted&#x201d; with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Areas marked with dots are used instead of pink highlighting in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (but such areas will still be referred to as being &#x201c;pink-highlighted&#x201d; with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the code view area compares two versions of the code called herein an original version, and a revised version. Lines that are entirely highlighted in red (with rightward facing hash marking in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) are lines that have been entirely removed in the current version compared to the reference version. Lines that have both red portions (right hashing) and pink portions (dotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) are lines in which there have been removals made, but in which the red portions (right hashing) are the specific portions removed. Lines that are entirely highlighted in green (underlining in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) are lines that have been entirely added in the current version compared to the reference version, although there are no examples of such lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Lines that have both yellow portions (left hashing) and green portions (underlined) are lines in which there have been additions made, but in which the green portions (left hashing) are the specific portions added.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The differential view user interface <b>800</b> also illustrates a reviewer status area <b>803</b> and a comments area <b>804</b>. The reviewer status area <b>803</b> allows a reviewer to select a control <b>831</b> to indicate that the reviewer has signed off on the current version of the code. The control <b>832</b> allows the reviewer to recall a prior sign-off on the code. The control <b>833</b> permits the reviewer to instant message with others on the review team.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The comments area <b>804</b> permits a different view on the comments that are displayed in the code view area <b>801</b>. However, as there are no comments displayed in the code view area <b>801</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there are likewise no comments displayed in the comments area <b>804</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a differential view user interface <b>800</b> that includes revision marking or some other visualization that compares versions of the displayed code.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a differential view user interface <b>900</b> that is similar to the user interface <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In fact, the differential view user interface <b>900</b> may be the same user interface as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, except that now comments have been added to the code and associate with a specific portion of the code (in this case, line <b>912</b> of the code). The comments decoration <b>901</b> includes a discussion thread that may include comments from multiple commenters. It is this discussion thread that may be updated when the reviewing computing system notifies the client-side application that a new comment has been added to the discussion thread. The comments decoration <b>901</b> also may include a visualization (in this case drop down box <b>902</b>) that indicates a status of comments decoration (in this case, the status of the discussion thread). As another example, the status visualization might indicate a severity of the comments decoration. In the case of the thread status drop down box <b>902</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an active status indicates that that the thread has been created by a reviewer, but the subject of the discussion thread has not yet been addressed by the author. A pending status indicates that the author agrees with the reviewer, but has not yet applied a fix. A resolved status indicates that the author has fixed the issue or answered the reviewer's question. A &#x201c;wontfix&#x201d; status indicates that the author does not agree with the suggestion of the discussion thread, and hence the author provided an explanation of their point of view and marked the thread as &#x201c;won't fix&#x201d;. A closed status indicates that the author and reviewer confirm the fix.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The comments area <b>804</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is slightly different as compared to the comments area <b>804</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in its content. The comments area <b>804</b>&#x2032; now has a different view on all of the displayed comments in the code view area <b>801</b>&#x2032;.</p>
