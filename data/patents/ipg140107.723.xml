<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to lock cylinder assemblies. More particularly, the present invention relates to lock cylinder assemblies that may be reprogrammed without removing the cylinder plug. Most particularly, the present invention relates to a master keying system and method for programmable lock cylinder assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 71A through 71C</figref> show a typical pin tumbler cylinder <b>510</b>. The cylinder <b>510</b> consists of a shell <b>512</b> having a rotatable plug <b>513</b> within. The plug <b>513</b> has an axially extending keyway <b>514</b>, which accepts key <b>515</b>. A series of cuts <b>516</b> are placed on the upper edge of key <b>515</b>. Within the shell <b>512</b> and plug <b>513</b> are a plurality of pins <b>520</b> and springs <b>521</b>. Pins <b>520</b> are comprised of at least two segments, a bottom pin <b>520</b><i>a </i>and a top pin or driver <b>520</b><i>b</i>. When a cylinder has been pinned for master keying, one or more master pins <b>520</b><i>c </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 71D and 71E</figref>) are used in each pin stack. The depths of the cuts <b>516</b> on the key <b>515</b> are called bittings and typically are numbered from 0 to 9. With no key <b>515</b> inserted in the cylinder <b>510</b>, the top pins <b>520</b><i>b </i>and bottom pins <b>520</b><i>a </i>are forced by the springs <b>521</b> down into the plug <b>513</b>. The top pins <b>520</b><i>b </i>are then partially in the shell <b>512</b> and partially in the plug <b>513</b>, forming an obstacle that keep the plug <b>513</b> from turning, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71A</figref>. When a proper key <b>515</b> is inserted into the cylinder <b>510</b>, the bitting depth of the cuts <b>516</b> brings the top of each of the bottom pins <b>520</b><i>a </i>exactly to the surface of the plug <b>513</b>, forming a shear line <b>524</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71B</figref>. With the tops of the bottom pins <b>520</b><i>a </i>aligned with the shear line <b>524</b>, the key <b>515</b> and the plug <b>513</b> can be turned. When an incorrect key <b>515</b> is inserted, one or more of the top and bottom pins <b>520</b><i>b</i>, <b>520</b><i>a </i>will not align with the shell <b>512</b> surface to form the shear line <b>524</b>, thereby preventing rotation of the key <b>515</b> and plug <b>513</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 71D and 71E</figref> illustrate a typical cylinder <b>510</b> which has been pinned for master keying. The term &#x201c;master keyed&#x201d; usually denotes that each individual cylinder is operated by two or more different keys. The key that normally opens only one cylinder or keyed alike group of cylinders is called a change key. The key that opens all the cylinders in a group or series is called a master key. An example of a simple master key system would be in a small office building. There would be an individual change key for each office door, and there would be a master key to operate all office doors. The essential difference between an ordinary pin tumbler cylinder and a master keyed cylinder is the use of master pins <b>520</b><i>c</i>. A master pin is an additional top pin, usually shorter, which is inserted between the bottom pin <b>520</b><i>a </i>and the top pin <b>520</b><i>b</i>. In each pin chamber where a master pin <b>520</b><i>c </i>is located, a second shear position is created. The cylinder can be operated at either shear position. Thus, different key bittings can be used for each position where there is a master pin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71D</figref> shows a master keyed cylinder <b>510</b> with a change key <b>515</b> inserted and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71E</figref> shows the same master keyed cylinder <b>510</b> with a master key <b>515</b> inserted. In both figures, the pins <b>520</b> have aligned to form a shear line <b>524</b>, thereby permitting the key <b>515</b> and plug <b>513</b> to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When reprogramming a lock cylinder <b>510</b> using a traditional cylinder design, the user is required to remove the cylinder plug <b>513</b> from the cylinder body <b>512</b> and replace the appropriate pins <b>520</b> so that a new key can be used to unlock the cylinder <b>510</b>. This typically requires the user to remove the cylinder mechanism from the lockset and then disassemble the cylinder to some degree to remove the plug <b>513</b> and replace the pins <b>520</b>. This requires a working knowledge of the lockset and cylinder mechanism and is usually only performed by locksmiths or trained professionals. Additionally, the process usually employs special tools and requires the user to have access to pinning kits to interchange pins <b>520</b> and replace components that can get lost or damaged in the reprogramming process.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In at least one aspect, the present invention provides a master key system for a reprogrammable lock cylinder with at least one first master pin and one second master pin.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Although the invention is illustrated and described herein with reference to specific embodiments, the invention is not intended to be limited to the details shown. Rather, various modifications may be made in the details within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims and without departing from the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The following are definitions of a few common master keying terms:</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Master key system is any keying arrangement that has two or more levels of keying.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Change key is a key that operates only one cylinder or one group of keyed alike cylinders in a keying system.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Bitting is the number(s) which represent the dimensions of the key cut(s) on a key.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Key bitting array is a matrix (graphic) display of all possible bittings for change keys and master keys as related to the top master key.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Levels of keying are the divisions of a master key system into hierarchies of access. Level 1 is the lowest level and consists only of change keys. The highest level is the top master key that operates all locks in the master key system.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">MACS is maximum adjacent cut specification, or the maximum allowable difference between adjacent cut depths.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Cross keying is the deliberate process of combinating a cylinder (usually in a master key system) to two or more different keys which would not normally be expected to operate it together.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Master key is a key which operates all the master keyed locks or cylinders in a group, each lock or cylinder usually being operated by its own change key.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Page master key is the master key for all combinations listed on a page in the standard progression format.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Block master key is the master key for all combinations listed as a block in the standard progression format.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Horizontal group master key is the master key for all combinations listed in all blocks in a line across the page in the standard progression format.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Vertical group master key is the master key for all combinations listed in all blocks in a line down a page in the standard progression format.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Row master key is the master key for all combinations listed on the same line across a page in the standard progression format.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Grand master key is a key which operates two or more separate groups of locks, which are each operated by a different master key.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Sequence of progression is the order in which bitting positions are progressed to obtain change key combinations, typically either a 1 step, using a one increment difference between bittings of a given position, or 2 step progression, using a two increment difference between bittings of a given position.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Standard progression format is a systematic method of listing and relating all change key combinations to all master key combinations in a master key system. The listing is divided into segments known as blocks, horizontal groups, vertical groups, rows, and pages, for levels of control.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The master keying system and method of the present invention is useable with programmable lock cylinder assemblies having various configurations. For example, in the embodiments described below, the lock cylinder assemblies include selectively engagable rack pins and tongue pins. U.S. Pat. No. 7,322,219 discloses another programmable lock cylinder using racks engagable with modified pins. U.S. Pat. No. 6,119,495 describes a programmable lock cylinder using wafers and differently configured split pin assemblies. U.S. Pat. No. 7,047,778 describes a programmable lock cylinder using pivotal tumbler members. The master keying system and method of the present invention is useable with any programmable lock cylinder having at least two distinct master pins positional within the lock cylinder. The master pins may be racks, pins, tumblers, wafers or any other lock cylinder locking member having at least two unlocking bitting positions.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">An illustrative programmable lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> useable with the master keying system and method of the invention is illustrated and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-28</figref> and <b>56</b>-<b>63</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, the programmable lock assembly <b>10</b> generally comprises a lock housing <b>20</b> and a cylinder plug <b>40</b>. The lock housing <b>20</b> includes a body <b>22</b> defining a generally tubular opening <b>24</b> extending the length thereof. The tubular opening <b>24</b> is configured to receive the cylindrical body <b>42</b> of the cylinder plug <b>40</b> and may include a shoulder <b>26</b> about the opening <b>24</b> which engages a flange <b>44</b> on one end of the cylinder plug <b>40</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cylinder plug <b>40</b> preferably extends out the opposite end of the housing <b>20</b> and is configured for connection to an output mechanism (not shown) for transmitting force from the cylinder plug <b>40</b> to one or more elements connected to the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b>. The output mechanism can take a number of different forms, including without limitation, a lever, drive shaft, coupling, cam, or other element mounted to the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b>. The present lock cylinder assembly may be utilized in any desired application. In the illustrated embodiment, a snap ring <b>30</b> engages a groove <b>46</b> in the cylinder body <b>42</b> to retain the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> in the assembled state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>, the housing body <b>22</b> includes a pair of tapered groove <b>25</b> and <b>27</b> extending along the inside surface of the opening <b>24</b>. As explained in greater detail hereinafter, a sidebar <b>80</b> extends from the cylinder plug <b>40</b> and engages the tapered groove <b>25</b> to maintain the cylinder plug <b>40</b> rotationally locked relative to the housing <b>20</b> unless a proper key is positioned in the keyway <b>39</b> of the cylinder plug <b>40</b>. The tapered groove <b>27</b> facilitates reprogramming of the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b>, as described in more detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</figref>, the housing body <b>22</b> may include a plurality of through bores <b>29</b> which align with rack pin bores <b>41</b> of the cylinder plug <b>40</b> when the cylinder plug <b>40</b> is positioned in a home position. The through bores <b>29</b> are configured to receive a portion of an associated rack pin <b>60</b>, as described hereinafter, to further maintain the cylinder plug <b>40</b> rotationally locked relative to the housing <b>20</b> unless a proper key is positioned in the keyway <b>39</b> of the cylinder plug <b>40</b>. Desirably, through bores <b>29</b> are provided on the upper and lower surfaces, in the illustrated orientation, such that the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> may be provided with upper and lower rack pins, if desired, for operation with a key having teeth on its upper and lower surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>-<b>8</b>, the rack pin bores <b>41</b> extend substantially parallel to the keyway <b>39</b> of the cylinder plug <b>40</b>. Each rack pin bore <b>41</b> is configured to receive and guide the axial movement of a rack pin <b>60</b>. Each rack pin bore <b>41</b> desirably extends completely through the cylinder plug <b>40</b> such that the associated rack pin <b>60</b> may be configured to be moved upward or downward into engagement with an associated through bore <b>29</b>, however, such is not required. Alternatively, the rack pin bores <b>41</b> may only extend from one surface of the cylinder plug body <b>42</b>, or may even be completely internal within the cylinder plug body <b>42</b> such that the rack pins do not extend from the cylinder plug <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>, a sidebar opening <b>48</b> extends through a side surface of the cylinder body <b>42</b> in communication with the rack pin bores <b>41</b>. The sidebar opening <b>48</b> is sized to receive a sidebar <b>80</b> such that a tapered portion <b>84</b> of the sidebar <b>80</b> is radially extendable from the cylinder plug <b>40</b>. In the home position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the tapered portion <b>84</b> extends from the cylinder plug <b>40</b> and is engaged in the tapered groove <b>25</b> to rotationally lock the cylinder plug <b>40</b> relative to the housing <b>20</b>. One or more springs <b>86</b> are positioned between a rail portion <b>82</b> of the sidebar <b>80</b> and internal portions <b>49</b> of the cylinder body <b>42</b> to bias the sidebar radially outward.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The sidebar <b>80</b> is prevented from being moved radially inward, and thereby unlocking the lock, by the rack pins <b>60</b> unless a proper key is positioned in the keyway <b>39</b>. An exemplary non-master rack pin <b>60</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The exemplary rack pin <b>60</b> includes an elongate body <b>62</b> generally having a width slightly less than the width of an associated rack pin bore <b>41</b> such that the rack pin <b>60</b> is axially movable therein. In the present embodiment, an end <b>68</b> of the rack pin <b>60</b> has a reduced width and is configured to be received in a corresponding housing through bore <b>29</b>. The rack pin <b>60</b> includes a plurality of engagement passages <b>66</b> which facilitate programming of the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> as will be described in more detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The rack pin <b>60</b> also includes a sidebar notch <b>64</b> configured to receive the rail portion <b>82</b> of the sidebar <b>80</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the rack pin body <b>62</b> generally has a thickness such that the rack pin body <b>62</b> contacts the sidebar rail portion <b>82</b> and prevents radial movement of the sidebar <b>80</b>. When a proper key <b>150</b> is inserted in the keyway <b>39</b>, the rack pin <b>60</b> is moved axially, as described below, such that the sidebar notch <b>64</b> is aligned with the sidebar rail portion <b>82</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. With each rack pin <b>60</b> so aligned, the sidebar <b>80</b> is movable radially inward. In the present embodiment, the sidebar <b>80</b> does not automatically move radially inward, but instead is biased radially outward as explained above. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, with the proper key <b>150</b> inserted, the rack pins <b>60</b> are disengaged from the through bores <b>29</b> and the sidebar notches <b>64</b> are properly aligned, such that rotation of the key <b>150</b> causes the tapered portion <b>84</b> of the sidebar <b>80</b> to ride up the tapered groove <b>25</b> as the sidebar rail portion <b>82</b> is received in the notches <b>64</b>. The lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> is in an unlocked condition such that the cylinder plug <b>40</b> is rotatable relative to the housing <b>20</b>. Rotation of the cylinder plug <b>40</b> actuates the output mechanism. When the key <b>150</b> is rotated back to the home position, the sidebar <b>80</b> automatically extends radially into engagement with the tapered groove <b>25</b>. When the key <b>150</b> is removed, the rack pins <b>60</b> return to the home position wherein the notch <b>64</b> is no longer aligned with the sidebar rail portion <b>82</b> and the sidebar <b>80</b> is prevented from moving radially inward.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56-63</figref>, the master key capability is achieved utilizing a master locking sidebar <b>80</b>&#x2032; and master rack pins <b>60</b>A&#x2032; and <b>60</b>B&#x2032;, either alone or in combination with non-master rack pins <b>60</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the master locking sidebar <b>80</b>&#x2032; includes a tapered portion <b>84</b> and a rail portion <b>82</b>&#x2032;. In the present embodiment, the rail portion <b>82</b>&#x2032; is segmented rather than a continuous rail. The rail portion <b>82</b>&#x2032; has a height A and is configured to be received in notches <b>64</b>&#x2032; in the rack pins <b>60</b>A&#x2032; and <b>60</b>B&#x2032;. Master bar tongues <b>88</b> are provided along the sidebar <b>80</b>&#x2032; and are configured to align with the engagement passages <b>66</b>&#x2032; in the master rack pins <b>60</b>A&#x2032; and <b>60</b>B&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, master rack pin <b>60</b>A&#x2032; includes a body <b>62</b> with a sidebar notch <b>64</b>A&#x2032; configured to receive the sidebar rail portion <b>82</b>&#x2032;. The master rack pin <b>60</b>A&#x2032; also includes a series of engagement passages <b>66</b>&#x2032; configured to receive the tongue pin tongues <b>92</b> as in the previous embodiment and to also receive the master bar tongues <b>88</b>. The height of the notch <b>64</b>A&#x2032; is equal to the rail portion height A plus the height X of one of the engagement passages <b>66</b>&#x2032;. As such, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59 and 60</figref>, the rail portion <b>82</b>&#x2032; will be received in the notch <b>64</b>&#x2032; based on two different key configurations, one being one bitting away from the other.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, master rack pin <b>60</b>B&#x2032; includes a body <b>62</b> with a sidebar notch <b>64</b>B&#x2032; configured to receive the sidebar rail portion <b>82</b>&#x2032;. The master rack pin <b>60</b>B&#x2032; also includes a series of engagement passages <b>66</b>&#x2032; configured to receive the tongue pin tongues <b>92</b> as in the previous embodiment and to also receive the master bar tongues <b>88</b>. The height of the notch <b>64</b>A&#x2032; is equal to the rail portion height A plus the height <b>2</b>X of two of the engagement passages <b>66</b>&#x2032;. However, to prevent the toothing of rack pin <b>60</b>A&#x2032; from also working in rack pin <b>60</b>B&#x2032;, the passage <b>66</b>&#x2032; two above the notch <b>64</b>B&#x2032;, is blocked by a blocker <b>67</b> therein. As such, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 61 and 62</figref>, the rail portion <b>82</b>&#x2032; will be received in the notch <b>64</b>&#x2032; based on two different key configurations, one being two bittings away from the other, however, it will not be receivable based on only one bitting difference as the master bar tongue <b>88</b> will contact the blocker <b>67</b>. Other variations in the size and bitting arrangement may also be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Operation of the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> will be described with reference to non-master rack pins <b>60</b> and non-master sidebar <b>80</b>, but generally operates in the same manner with the master rack pins <b>60</b>A&#x2032; and <b>60</b>B&#x2032; and the master locking sidebar <b>80</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">To facilitate axial movement of the rack pins <b>60</b> in response to an inserted key, each rack pin <b>60</b> is associated with a tongue pin <b>90</b> which extends perpendicular to the rack pin <b>60</b> across the keyway <b>39</b>. Each tongue pin <b>90</b> includes a tongue <b>92</b> that is selectively engagable with one of the engagement passages <b>66</b> of the rack pin <b>60</b> through an opening <b>65</b> in the back of the rack pin <b>60</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>). In the present embodiment, the engagement passages <b>66</b> have a serrated configuration and the tongues <b>92</b> have a corresponding inverted triangular configuration, however, other complementary configurations may also be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the present embodiment, a spring <b>78</b> or the like extends between a top cover <b>70</b> and the respective tongue pin <b>90</b> to bias the tongue pin <b>90</b> downward. When the tongue pin <b>90</b> is engaged with a corresponding rack pin <b>60</b>, the spring <b>78</b> thereby biases the rack pin <b>60</b> toward the locked position wherein the rack pin end <b>68</b> extends into the housing though bore <b>29</b> and the notch <b>64</b> is not aligned with the sidebar rail portion <b>82</b>. The present top cover <b>70</b> includes an inward spring mount <b>74</b> depending from its body <b>72</b> for each spring <b>78</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the cylinder body <b>42</b> desirably includes a spring bore <b>43</b> for each spring <b>78</b> and mount <b>74</b> and a channel <b>45</b> configured to receive the top cover body <b>72</b>. The spring bores <b>43</b> may be formed integrally with the rack pin bores <b>41</b> as illustrated. The top cover <b>70</b> also includes a depending portion <b>76</b> configured to cover and retain a reset actuator <b>120</b> positioned within a cavity <b>47</b> of the cylinder body <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the present embodiment, a re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> is utilized to control the selective engagement between the tongue <b>92</b> and the engagement passage <b>66</b>, as described in more detail below. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> includes a plurality of shaft portions <b>102</b>, each configured to be received in an alignment notch <b>94</b> of a corresponding tongue pin <b>90</b>. A tapered bar <b>104</b> extends perpendicular from the shaft portions <b>102</b> and is connected thereto by bridging members <b>106</b>. The cylinder body <b>42</b> includes a plurality of vertical slots <b>51</b>, each configured to receive a corresponding shaft portion <b>102</b> with a tongue pin <b>90</b> engaged therewith. Each vertical slot <b>51</b> terminates in a horizontal slot <b>53</b> configured to receive a corresponding bridging member <b>106</b> and thereby guide radial movement of the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b>. A horizontal opening <b>50</b> extends through the side of the cylinder body <b>42</b> and is in communication with the vertical slots <b>51</b> such that the tapered bar <b>104</b> may extend radially outwardly from the cylinder plug <b>40</b>. A plurality of springs <b>108</b> or the like are positioned between the cylinder body <b>42</b> and the tapered bar <b>104</b> such that the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> is biased radially outward.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, during normal operation, the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> is maintained in a radially inward position such that each tongue <b>92</b> of the tongue pins <b>90</b> remains engaged with the intended engagement passage <b>66</b> of the corresponding rack pin <b>60</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>, a reset actuator <b>120</b> is engagable between the cylinder body <b>42</b> and the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> to maintain the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> in this radially inward, normal operation mode. The reset actuator <b>120</b> includes an actuator body <b>122</b> with a reset contact <b>124</b> depending therefrom. A front face of the actuator body <b>122</b> includes two bores <b>126</b> and <b>128</b>. Each bore <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> is configured to receive a post <b>103</b> extending rearward from rearward most shaft portion <b>102</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). In the normal operating mode, the post <b>103</b> is received in inward bore <b>126</b>, as shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and thereby maintains the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> in the radially inward, normal operating position. A spring <b>130</b> or the like engages a mount <b>132</b> on the rear side of the actuator body <b>122</b> and biases the reset actuator <b>120</b> toward the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b>, thereby maintaining the post <b>103</b> engaged within the bore <b>126</b> unless an proper reset key <b>150</b>&#x2032; is positioned in the keyway <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref>, the present embodiment of the invention utilizes two distinct types of keys, namely a user key <b>150</b> and a reset key <b>150</b>&#x2032;. Both keys <b>150</b>, <b>150</b>&#x2032; include a plurality of teeth and notches <b>152</b>, but the reset key <b>150</b>&#x2032; includes a protruding tip <b>154</b>&#x2032; compared to the tapered tip <b>154</b> of the user key <b>150</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, during normal operation, a user inserts a user key <b>150</b> and the tapered tip <b>154</b> remains clear of the actuator reset contact <b>124</b>. The actuator <b>120</b> remains biased by the spring <b>130</b> toward the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b>, thereby maintaining the post <b>103</b> engaged within the bore <b>126</b>. As such, the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> is maintained in the inward position and each tongue <b>92</b> remains engaged with the previously programmed engagement passage <b>66</b>. A user can insert a proper user key <b>150</b> which will engage the tongue pins <b>90</b> which in turn will move the rack pins <b>60</b> axially such that the rack pin notches <b>64</b> are aligned with the sidebar rail portion <b>82</b>. The lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> may be utilized in a normal manner as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">If a user desires to reprogram the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> without disassembling the lock cylinder assembly, the user may insert a proper reset key <b>150</b>&#x2032;. Insertion of the reset key <b>150</b>&#x2032; will cause the protruding tip <b>154</b>&#x2032; to engage the actuator reset contact <b>124</b> and thereby disengage the post <b>103</b> from the bore <b>126</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 17</figref>. As explained below, reprogramming of the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> requires rotation of the cylinder plug <b>40</b>. As such, inserting an improper key, even if such engages the actuator reset contact <b>124</b>, will not allow reprogramming because the improper key will not properly move the rack pins <b>60</b> and the cylinder plug <b>40</b> will not be rotatable.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Having generally described the components of the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b>, reprogramming thereof will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-28</figref>. To reprogram the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b>, the user inserts a current reset key <b>150</b>A&#x2032; into the keyway as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-19</figref>. By &#x201c;current&#x201d;, it is meant that the reset key <b>150</b>A&#x2032; has a tooth and notch <b>152</b> configuration which matches the currently programmed configuration of the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b>. When the current reset key <b>150</b>A&#x2032; is inserted, the key <b>150</b>A&#x2032; engages each of the tongue pins <b>90</b> and moves the respective rack pins <b>60</b> to the unlock position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> wherein each notch <b>64</b> is aligned with the sidebar rail portion <b>82</b>. The protruding tip <b>154</b>&#x2032; of current reset key <b>150</b>A&#x2032; also engages the actuator reset contact <b>124</b> and thereby disengages the reset actuator <b>120</b> from the post <b>103</b>. Even though the reset actuator <b>120</b> is disengaged, the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> remains inward, and thereby maintains each tongue <b>92</b> engaged with the respective engagement passage <b>66</b>, because the tapered bar <b>104</b> is in contact with the inside surface of the housing opening <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The current reset key <b>150</b>A&#x2032; is then rotated in the direction of arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. While clockwise rotation is illustrated in the present embodiment, the invention is not limited to such. For example, the tapered groove <b>27</b> may be positioned in the upper right quadrant of the housing body <b>22</b>, in which case the plug cylinder <b>40</b> would be rotated counter-clockwise for reprogramming, or in any other desired position. As with normal operation, the sidebar tapered portion <b>84</b> rides up the tapered groove <b>25</b> as the sidebar rail portion <b>82</b> is received in the notches <b>64</b>. Rotation of the key and cylinder plug <b>40</b> in the direction of arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is continued until the tapered bar <b>104</b> is aligned with the tapered groove <b>27</b> in the housing <b>20</b>. The springs <b>108</b> bias the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> radially outward as the tapered bar <b>84</b> enters the tapered groove <b>27</b>. As the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> moves radially outward, each tongue pin <b>90</b> is also moved in the direction of arrow C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> such that the tongues <b>92</b> disengage from the respective engagement passages <b>66</b>. The rack pins <b>60</b> stay aligned with the sidebar <b>80</b> based on the engagement of the rail portion <b>82</b> in each of the notches <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, the current reset key <b>150</b>A&#x2032; is removed whereby the top springs <b>78</b> bias the tongue pins <b>90</b> to a lower most position wherein the tongues <b>92</b> are not aligned with any of the engagement passages <b>66</b>. Additionally, when the current reset key <b>150</b>A&#x2032; is removed, the actuator reset contact <b>124</b> is no longer engaged and the spring <b>130</b> biases the reset actuator <b>120</b> toward the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b>. With the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> in the outward reprogram position, the post <b>103</b> engages in the outer bore <b>128</b>, thereby locking the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> in such outward reprogram position. This prevents a user from insert a regular user key (non-reset key) and trying to return the cylinder plug <b>40</b> to the home position. Additionally, because the tongues <b>92</b> do not align with any engagement passages, a user would not be able to insert an object into the keyway to try to bypass the reset actuator <b>120</b> as the tongues <b>92</b> would contact the body <b>62</b> of the rack pins <b>60</b> and prevent the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> from moving inward.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">To complete the reprogramming, it is necessary for the user to insert a new reset key <b>150</b>B&#x2032; as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>. By &#x201c;new&#x201d;, it is meant that the reset key <b>150</b>B&#x2032; has a tooth and notch <b>152</b> configuration which matches the configuration of the intended or new user key to which the lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> is to be programmed. When the new reset key <b>150</b>B&#x2032; is inserted, each of the tongue pins <b>90</b> is moved to a desired position relative to a respective rack pin <b>60</b>. Additionally, the protruding tip <b>154</b>&#x2032; of the new reset key <b>150</b>B&#x2032; engages the actuator reset contact <b>124</b> and disengages the reset actuator <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The new reset key <b>150</b>B&#x2032; is rotated in the reverse direction, as indicated by arrow D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, which causes the tapered bar <b>104</b> to ride up the tapered groove <b>27</b> and move the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> radially inward. As the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> moves radially inward, the tongue pins <b>90</b> move in the direction indicated by arrow E, thereby engaging each tongue <b>92</b> with a corresponding engagement passage <b>66</b> based on new reset key <b>150</b>B&#x2032; tooth and notch <b>152</b> configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Once the cylinder plug <b>40</b> is returned to the home position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the key <b>150</b>B&#x2032; is removed. Upon removal, the reset actuator <b>120</b> is biased toward the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> such that post <b>103</b> is received in bore <b>126</b>, thereby locking the re-combinating sidebar <b>100</b> and the associated tongue pins <b>90</b> in position. The reprogrammed lock cylinder assembly <b>10</b> may thereafter be operated in a normal manner with user keys <b>150</b> having the new configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">A programmable lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention is illustrated and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-55</figref>. Operation of the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> will be described with reference to non-master rack pins <b>60</b> and non-master sidebar <b>80</b>, but generally operates in the same manner with the master rack pins <b>60</b>A&#x2032; and <b>60</b>B&#x2032; and the master locking sidebar <b>80</b>&#x2032;. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-38</figref>, the programmable lock assembly <b>210</b> generally comprises a lock housing <b>220</b> and a cylinder plug <b>240</b>. The lock housing <b>220</b> includes a body <b>222</b> defining a generally tubular opening <b>224</b> extending the length thereof. The tubular opening <b>224</b> is configured to receive the cylindrical body <b>242</b> of the cylinder plug. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the cylinder plug <b>240</b> preferably extends out the opposite end of the housing <b>220</b> and is configured for connection to an output mechanism (not shown) for transmitting force from the cylinder plug <b>240</b> to one or more elements connected to the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b>. The output mechanism can take a number of different forms, including without limitation, a lever, drive shaft, coupling, cam, or other element mounted to the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b>. The present lock cylinder assembly may be utilized in any desired application. In the illustrated embodiment, a snap ring <b>230</b> engages a groove <b>246</b> in the cylinder body <b>242</b> to retain the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> in the assembled state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 37</figref>, the housing body <b>222</b> includes a pair of tapered grooves <b>225</b> and <b>227</b> extending along the inside surface of the opening <b>224</b>. As in the previous embodiment, a sidebar <b>280</b> extends from the cylinder plug <b>240</b> and engages the tapered groove <b>225</b> to maintain the cylinder plug <b>240</b> rotationally locked relative to the housing <b>220</b> unless a proper key is positioned in the keyway <b>239</b> of the cylinder plug <b>240</b>. The tapered groove <b>227</b> facilitates reprogramming of the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b>, as described in more detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 38</figref>, the housing body <b>222</b> may include a plurality of through bores <b>229</b> which align with rack pin bores <b>241</b> of the cylinder plug <b>240</b> when the cylinder plug <b>240</b> is positioned in a home position. The through bores <b>229</b> are configured to receive a portion of an associated rack pin <b>60</b>, as described hereinafter, to further maintain the cylinder plug <b>240</b> rotationally locked relative to the housing <b>220</b> unless a proper key is positioned in the keyway <b>239</b> of the cylinder plug <b>240</b>. Desirably, through bores <b>229</b> are provided on the upper and lower surfaces, in the illustrated orientation, such that the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> may be provided with upper and lower rack pins, if desired, for operation with a key having teeth on its upper and lower surfaces. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 36A</figref> illustrate an alternative cylinder plug <b>240</b>&#x2032; including a radial opening <b>340</b> on each side of the keyway <b>239</b>. The radial openings <b>340</b> are aligned with the sidebar openings <b>243</b>, <b>248</b>, as described below, and are configured to receive antidrill plates <b>342</b>. The antidrill plates <b>342</b> are desirably manufactured from a harder material which prevents drilling through the cylinder plug <b>240</b> to access either of the sidebars <b>280</b>, <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29</figref>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>, the rack pin bores <b>241</b> extend substantially parallel to the keyway <b>239</b> of the cylinder plug <b>240</b>. Each rack pin bore <b>241</b> is configured to receive and guide the axial movement of a rack pin <b>60</b>. The rack pins <b>60</b> are substantially the same as the rack pins <b>60</b> of the previous embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Each rack pin bore <b>241</b> desirably extends completely through the cylinder plug <b>240</b> such that the associated rack pin <b>60</b> may be configured to be moved upward or downward into engagement with an associated through bore <b>229</b>, however, such is not required. Alternatively, the rack pin bores <b>241</b> may only extend from one surface of the cylinder plug body <b>242</b>, or may even be completely internal within the cylinder plug body <b>242</b> such that the rack pins do not extend from the cylinder plug <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29</figref>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>, a sidebar opening <b>248</b> extends through a side surface of the cylinder body <b>242</b> in communication with the rack pin bores <b>241</b>. The sidebar opening <b>248</b> is sized to receive a sidebar <b>280</b> such that a tapered portion <b>284</b> of the sidebar <b>280</b> is radially extendable from the cylinder plug <b>240</b>. In the home position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the tapered portion <b>284</b> extends from the cylinder plug <b>240</b> and is engaged in the tapered groove <b>225</b> to rotationally lock the cylinder plug <b>240</b> relative to the housing <b>220</b>. One or more springs <b>286</b> are positioned between a rail portion <b>282</b> of the sidebar <b>280</b> and internal portions <b>249</b> of the cylinder body <b>242</b> to bias the sidebar radially outward.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The sidebar <b>280</b> is prevented from being moved radially inward, and thereby unlocking the lock, by the rack pins <b>60</b> unless a proper key is positioned in the keyway <b>239</b>. The rack pins <b>60</b> of the present embodiment have the same configuration as the exemplary rack pin <b>60</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, but may have other configurations. As explained above, each rack pin <b>60</b> also includes a sidebar notch <b>64</b> configured to receive the rail portion <b>282</b> of the sidebar <b>280</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the rack pin body <b>62</b> generally has a thickness such that the rack pin body <b>62</b> contacts the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b> and prevents radial movement of the sidebar <b>280</b>. When a proper key <b>350</b> is inserted in the keyway <b>239</b>, the rack pin <b>60</b> is moved axially, as described below, such that the sidebar notch <b>64</b> is aligned with the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. With each rack pin <b>60</b> so aligned, the sidebar <b>280</b> is movable radially inward. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</figref>, an alternative sidebar <b>280</b>&#x2032; is illustrated. The alternative sidebar <b>280</b>&#x2032; operates in the same manner, but includes a chamfer <b>283</b> along the inner edge of the rail <b>282</b>&#x2032;. The chamfer <b>283</b> aids receipt of the sidebar <b>280</b>&#x2032; in the sidebar notches <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the present embodiment, the sidebar <b>280</b> does not automatically move radially inward, but instead is biased radially outward as explained above. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, with the proper key <b>350</b> inserted, the rack pins <b>60</b> are disengaged from the through bores <b>229</b> and the sidebar notches <b>64</b> are properly aligned, such that rotation of the key <b>350</b> causes the tapered portion <b>284</b> of the sidebar <b>280</b> to ride up the tapered groove <b>225</b> as the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b> is received in the notches <b>64</b>. The lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> is in an unlocked condition such that the cylinder plug <b>240</b> is rotatable relative to the housing <b>220</b>. Rotation of the cylinder plug <b>240</b> actuates the output mechanism. When the key <b>350</b> is rotated back to the home position, the sidebar <b>280</b> automatically extends radially into engagement with the tapered groove <b>225</b>. When the key <b>350</b> is removed, the rack pins <b>60</b> return to the home position wherein the notch <b>64</b> is no longer aligned with the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b> and the sidebar <b>280</b> is prevented from moving radially inward.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">To facilitate axial movement of the rack pins <b>60</b> in response to an inserted key, each rack pin <b>60</b> is associated with a tongue pin <b>290</b> which extends perpendicular to the rack pin <b>60</b> across the keyway <b>239</b>. Each tongue pin <b>290</b> includes a tongue <b>292</b> that is selectively engagable with one of the engagement passages <b>66</b> of the rack pin <b>60</b> through an opening <b>65</b> in the back of the rack pin <b>60</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>). In the present embodiment, the engagement passages <b>66</b> have a serrated configuration and the tongues <b>292</b> have a corresponding inverted triangular configuration, however, other complementary configurations may also be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the present embodiment, each tongue pin <b>290</b> has a circular body portion <b>294</b> opposite the tongue <b>292</b>. The circular body portion <b>294</b> is configured to be received in a corresponding circular bore <b>310</b> of the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> as described hereinafter. The corresponding circular configurations guide the tongue pins <b>290</b> as they move up and down in the bores <b>310</b>. Other corresponding shapes other than circular may also be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>, a detent <b>295</b> is provided in each circular body portion <b>294</b> and is configured to receive a spring <b>278</b> or the like extends between a top cover <b>270</b> and the respective tongue pin <b>290</b> to bias the tongue pin <b>290</b> downward. When the tongue pin <b>290</b> is engaged with a corresponding rack pin <b>60</b>, the spring <b>278</b> thereby biases the rack pin <b>60</b> toward the locked position wherein the rack pin end <b>68</b> extends into the housing though bore <b>229</b> and the notch <b>64</b> is not aligned with the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>, an alternative configuration of the top cover <b>270</b>&#x2032; is illustrated. The top cover <b>270</b>&#x2032; includes notches <b>271</b> configured to receive corresponding projections <b>313</b> on the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b>&#x2032;. To secure the top cover <b>270</b>&#x2032;, the projections <b>313</b> may be staked to the cover <b>270</b>&#x2032;. The top cover <b>270</b>&#x2032; also includes a rounded central portion <b>272</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the cylinder body <b>242</b> desirably includes an open area <b>243</b> configured to receive the body of the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> which includes the bores <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the present embodiment, the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> is utilized to control the selective engagement between the tongue <b>292</b> and the engagement passage <b>66</b>, as described in more detail below. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29</figref>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> and <b>37</b>, the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> includes a body portion <b>302</b> which defines the bores <b>310</b>. A key contact surface <b>311</b> is provided between each adjacent pair of the bores <b>310</b>, the key contact surfaces <b>311</b> spaced from the body portion <b>302</b> such that a sidebar keyway <b>312</b> is defined between the contact surfaces <b>311</b> and the body portion <b>302</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The tongue pins <b>290</b> extend across the sidebar keyway <b>312</b> such that they are engaged when a key <b>350</b> is inserted therein. A tapered bar <b>304</b> extends perpendicular from the body portion <b>302</b> opposite the bores <b>310</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>, the tapered bar <b>304</b>&#x2032; of alternative re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b>&#x2032; does not extend the length thereof, but instead is provided in two segments. Guide members <b>306</b> extend from each end of the body portion <b>302</b> and are configured to be received in guide slots <b>251</b> in the cylinder body <b>242</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>). Positioning of the guide members <b>306</b> in the respective guide slots <b>251</b> guides radial movement of the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b>. The tapered bar <b>304</b> extends radially outwardly from the open area <b>243</b> of the cylinder plug <b>240</b>. A spring <b>308</b> or the like is positioned within each guide slot between the cylinder body <b>242</b> and the tapered bar <b>304</b> such that the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> is biased radially outward.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, during normal operation, the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> is maintained in a radially inward position by engagement of the tapered bar <b>304</b> with the inside surface <b>224</b> of the housing <b>220</b>. In the radially inward position, each tongue <b>292</b> of the tongue pins <b>290</b> remains engaged with the intended engagement passage <b>66</b> of the corresponding rack pin <b>60</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>, even if a user key <b>350</b> is inserted into the keyway <b>239</b> and the cylinder plug <b>230</b> is rotated, for example, to a position where the tapered bar <b>304</b> is circumferentially aligned with the tapered groove <b>227</b>, contact of the key contact surfaces <b>311</b> of the sidebar <b>300</b> against the shank of the user key <b>350</b> prevents the sidebar <b>300</b> from moving radially outward, thereby maintaining the sidebar <b>300</b> in the normal operation mode. As will be described in more detail hereinafter, the reset key <b>350</b>&#x2032; has a thinned shank portion, such that a clearance is defined between the key shank <b>351</b>&#x2032; and the key contact surfaces <b>311</b> and the sidebar <b>300</b> is free to be urged radially outward, thereby disengaging the tongue pins <b>290</b> from the rack pins <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29</figref>, <b>36</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>, a reset actuator <b>320</b> is positioned between the cylinder plug <b>240</b> and the sidebar <b>300</b> and is configured to maintain the sidebar <b>300</b> in a radially outward position during resetting. The reset actuator <b>320</b> includes an actuator body <b>322</b> with a reset contact <b>324</b> extending therefrom. An upper surface of the actuator body <b>322</b> includes a block <b>326</b> configured to engage a portion of the sidebar <b>300</b>. A post <b>328</b> extends from the actuator body <b>322</b> and is configured to receive a spring <b>330</b> or the like such that the reset actuator <b>320</b> is spring biased within a groove in the plug cylinder <b>240</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</figref>, an alternative reset actuator <b>320</b>&#x2032; is illustrated and includes a stabilizing leg <b>327</b> extending opposite to the post <b>328</b> to stabilize the reset actuator <b>320</b>&#x2032;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 53</figref>, the sidebar body portion <b>302</b> includes a notch <b>303</b> which defines a radially inner shoulder <b>305</b> and a radially outer shoulder <b>307</b>. The block <b>326</b> engages the inner shoulder <b>305</b> when the sidebar <b>300</b> is locked in the resetting position as will be described. The spring <b>330</b> or the like biases the actuator <b>320</b> to this position once the cylinder plug <b>240</b> has been rotated to the reset position by an appropriate reset key and the sidebar <b>300</b> has been moved radially outward. The reset actuator <b>320</b> is biased toward engagement with the inner shoulder <b>305</b> until a proper reset key <b>350</b>&#x2032; is positioned in the keyway <b>239</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45-47</figref>, the present embodiment of the invention utilizes two distinct types of keys, namely a user key <b>350</b> and a reset key <b>350</b>&#x2032;. Both keys <b>350</b>, <b>350</b>&#x2032; include a plurality of teeth and notches <b>352</b>, but the reset key <b>350</b>&#x2032; includes a protrusion <b>354</b> adjacent where the key shank <b>351</b>&#x2032; meets the key head <b>353</b>. Additionally, as explained above, the shank <b>351</b> of the user key <b>350</b> is thicker compared to the shank <b>351</b>&#x2032; of the reset key <b>350</b>&#x2032; such that the user key <b>350</b> does not allow the sidebar <b>300</b> to move radially outward. Additionally, due to the thicker shank <b>351</b> of the user key <b>350</b>, the key contact surface <b>311</b> will block entry of a user key <b>350</b> when the cylinder plug <b>240</b> is in the reset position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Having generally described the components of the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b>, normal operation and reprogramming thereof will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37-55</figref>. The lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref> in an originally assembled configuration with each tongue pin <b>290</b> engaged with a respective rack pin <b>60</b> such that a key biting is defined for each rack pin <b>60</b>. In the locked position shown, the springs <b>278</b> bias the tongue pins <b>290</b>, and thereby the rack pins <b>60</b> to a lower position wherein the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b> is misaligned with the rack pin notches <b>64</b>. As such, the sidebar tapered portion <b>284</b> engages the tapered groove <b>225</b> and the rack pin body portions <b>62</b> engage the housing bores <b>229</b>, thereby preventing rotation of the cylinder plug <b>240</b> relative to the housing <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">To operate the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> in normal operation, an appropriate user key <b>350</b> is inserted into the keyway <b>239</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39 and 40</figref>. As the user key <b>350</b> is inserted, the teeth and notches <b>352</b> engage the respective tongue pins <b>290</b>, thereby raising the rack pins <b>60</b> to an unlocked position wherein the notches <b>64</b> are all aligned with the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b> and the rack pin body portions <b>62</b> are disengaged from the housing bores <b>229</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The user then turns the user key <b>350</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>. Since the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b> is aligned with the notches <b>64</b>, the sidebar tapered portion <b>284</b> rides up the tapered groove <b>225</b> as the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b> is received in the notches <b>64</b>. The plug cylinder <b>240</b> is freely rotated relative to the housing <b>220</b>. As explained above, even if the plug cylinder <b>240</b> is rotated such that the tapered bar <b>304</b> is circumferentially aligned with the tapered groove <b>227</b>, contact of the key contact surfaces <b>311</b> of the sidebar <b>300</b> against the shank <b>351</b> of the user key <b>350</b> prevents the sidebar <b>300</b> from moving radially outward, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. As such, the tongue pins <b>290</b> are maintained in engagement with the rack pins <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">If a user desires to reprogram the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> without disassembling the lock cylinder assembly, the user may insert a proper reset key <b>350</b>&#x2032; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. As explained below, reprogramming of the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> requires rotation of the cylinder plug <b>240</b>. As such, inserting an improper key, i.e. one not having the proper biting, will not allow reprogramming because the improper key will not properly move the rack pins <b>60</b> and the cylinder plug <b>240</b> will not be rotatable.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">To reprogram the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b>, the user inserts a current reset key <b>350</b>A&#x2032; into the keyway. By &#x201c;current&#x201d;, it is meant that the reset key <b>350</b>A&#x2032; has a tooth and notch <b>352</b> configuration which matches the currently programmed configuration of the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b>. When the current reset key <b>350</b>A&#x2032; is inserted, the key <b>350</b>A&#x2032; engages each of the tongue pins <b>290</b> and moves the respective rack pins <b>60</b> to the unlock position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> wherein each notch <b>64</b> is aligned with the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b>. The current reset key <b>350</b>A&#x2032; is then rotated in the direction of arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. While counterclockwise rotation is illustrated in the present embodiment, the invention is not limited to such, as illustrated above. As with normal operation, the sidebar tapered portion <b>284</b> rides up the tapered groove <b>225</b> as the sidebar rail portion <b>282</b> is received in the notches <b>64</b>. Rotation of the key and cylinder plug <b>240</b> is continued until the tapered bar <b>304</b> is aligned with the tapered groove <b>227</b> in the housing <b>220</b>. The springs <b>308</b> bias the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> radially outward as the tapered bar <b>304</b> enters the tapered groove <b>227</b>. As the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> moves radially outward, each tongue pin <b>290</b> is also moved in the direction of arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> such that the tongues <b>292</b> disengage from the respective engagement passages <b>66</b>. The rack pins <b>60</b> stay aligned with the sidebar <b>280</b> based on the engagement of the rail portion <b>282</b> in each of the notches <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49 and 50</figref>, the current reset key <b>350</b>A&#x2032; is removed whereby the top springs <b>278</b> bias the tongue pins <b>290</b> to a lower most position wherein the tongues <b>292</b> are not aligned with any of the engagement passages <b>66</b>. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, when the current reset key <b>350</b>A&#x2032; is removed, the reset actuator <b>320</b> is no longer engaged by the protrusion <b>354</b> of the reset key <b>350</b>&#x2032; and the spring <b>330</b> biases the reset actuator <b>320</b> such that the actuator block <b>326</b> engages the inner shoulder <b>305</b>, thereby maintaining the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> in the radially outward, reprogram position. As explained above, a user is prevented from inserting a regular user key (non-reset key) and trying to return the cylinder plug <b>240</b> to the home position by the sidebar key contacting surfaces <b>311</b> extending within the keyway <b>239</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>. Additionally, because the tongues <b>292</b> do not align with any engagement passages, a user would not be able to insert an object into the keyway to try to bypass the reset actuator <b>320</b> as the tongues <b>292</b> would contact the body <b>62</b> of the rack pins <b>60</b> and prevent the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> from moving inward.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">To complete the reprogramming, it is necessary for the user to insert a new reset key <b>350</b>B&#x2032; as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52 and 53</figref>. By &#x201c;new&#x201d;, it is meant that the reset key <b>350</b>B&#x2032; has a tooth and notch <b>352</b> configuration which matches the configuration of the intended or new user key to which the lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> is to be programmed. When the new reset key <b>350</b>B&#x2032; is inserted, each of the tongue pins <b>290</b> is moved to a desired position relative to a respective rack pin <b>60</b>. Additionally, the protrusion <b>354</b> of the new reset key <b>350</b>B&#x2032; engages the actuator reset contact <b>324</b> and disengages the reset actuator block <b>326</b> from the inner shoulder <b>305</b>, instead aligning the block <b>326</b> with the outer shoulder <b>307</b>. Accordingly, the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> is free to move radially inward.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The new reset key <b>350</b>B&#x2032; is rotated in the reverse direction, as indicated by arrow C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, which causes the tapered bar <b>304</b> to ride up the tapered groove <b>227</b> and move the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> radially inward. As the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> moves radially inward, the tongue pins <b>290</b> move in the direction indicated by arrow D, thereby engaging each tongue <b>292</b> with a corresponding engagement passage <b>66</b> based on new reset key <b>350</b>B&#x2032; tooth and notch <b>352</b> configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Once the cylinder plug <b>240</b> is returned to the home position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, the key <b>350</b>B&#x2032; is removed. Upon removal, the reset actuator <b>320</b> remains received within notch <b>303</b> against the outer shoulder <b>307</b> with the re-combinating sidebar <b>300</b> maintained in the radially inward position by contact of the tapered bar <b>304</b> against the housing inside surface <b>224</b>. The reprogrammed lock cylinder assembly <b>210</b> may thereafter be operated in a normal manner with user keys <b>350</b> having the new configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Having described illustrative reprogrammable lock cylinder assemblies useable with the current invention, the master keying system and method of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64-70</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">To determine the available master keys, change keys and rekeys for a given master key system, the present invention utilizes a bitting list generator to calculate all of the available key cuts for the system. The bitting list generator is preferably a computer operated system which starts with a key bitting array (KBA) <b>430</b> and calculates all of the available key cuts based on the intended sequence of progression (SOP). An acceptable bitting list generator is a spreadsheet which is configured to calculate each key cut based on the KBA <b>30</b> and SOP and to identify any cuts which violate the MACS. Any other system capable of performing the necessary calculations and coordination of data may alternatively be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">An illustrative KBA <b>430</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>. The KBA <b>430</b>, as well as the resultant output, are typically in the form of a sequence of numerical digits which correspond to key cut depths, however, various random symbols are used in the Figures as a specific KBA and corresponding key cuts are not necessary for an understanding of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">A user enters a desired KBA <b>430</b> into the bitting list generator following general master keying rules and the intended SOP. In the illustrated KBA <b>430</b>, the user begins by entering the top master key (TMK) cut sequence <b>432</b>. The user will then check the KBA <b>430</b> to be sure the necessary sequencing rules have been adhered to, for example, there are no digits from the TMK <b>432</b> in the Progression Possibilities <b>434</b>, that the Progression Possibilities <b>434</b> increment by a given number, and that the SOP <b>436</b> uses digits that do not reoccur. These are the requirements for this given master key system, but each master key system can have its own requirements in accordance with known master keying principals.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Once the KBA <b>430</b> has been entered, the bitting list generator calculates and outputs one or more arrays of all of the available key cuts and master key combinations using a standard progression format. For example, the standard progression format may list the available key cuts divided into segments known as blocks, horizontal groups, vertical groups, rows, and pages, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>, for levels of control. Other output means may alternatively be utilized and the invention is not limited to the illustrative page master described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>, an illustrative page master <b>450</b> for the KBA <b>430</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> is shown. The page master <b>450</b> includes each change key cut <b>451</b> that is available under the page master key cut <b>453</b>. Additional master key cuts may also be available for the given page master <b>450</b>. For example, there may be a master key cut <b>454</b> for each vertical group <b>452</b>. In each vertical group <b>452</b> of this illustrated page master <b>450</b>, twelve change key cuts <b>451</b> are available. This means that four cuts, as indicated by an *, in each of these groups <b>452</b> violates the MACS, and therefore, is identified as an unavailable change key cut. Additionally, a master key cut <b>456</b> is identified for each horizontal group <b>458</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the first three horizontal groups <b>458</b> has a respective master key cut <b>456</b>, but the fourth horizontal group <b>458</b>&#x2032; does not have an available master key cut as indicated by the * next to the master key cut <b>456</b>&#x2032; which violates the MACS.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The page master <b>450</b> also shows higher level master key cuts, for example, a master key cut <b>455</b> that will operate all of the key cuts on page master <b>450</b> for page one as well as page masters <b>450</b> for pages two through four. Another master key cut <b>457</b> operates all of the key cuts on page master <b>450</b> for page one as well as page masters <b>450</b> for pages two through sixteen. A third master key cut <b>459</b>, for the TMK, operates all of the key cuts on page master <b>450</b> for page one as well as page masters <b>450</b> for pages two through sixty-four. With this single page master <b>450</b>, a user would be able to create a six level master key system with the change key cuts <b>451</b> as level 1, the vertical group and horizontal group master key cuts <b>454</b>, <b>456</b> as level 2, the page master key cut <b>453</b> as level 3, the page one through four master key cut <b>455</b> as level 4, the page one through sixteen master key cut <b>457</b> as level 5, and the TMK master key cut <b>459</b> as level 6.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In addition to generating all of the change key cuts <b>451</b> and master key cuts <b>453</b>, <b>454</b>, <b>455</b>, <b>456</b>, <b>457</b> and <b>459</b>, the generator calculates and displays a plurality of rekey matrices <b>500</b>, each rekey matrix <b>500</b> corresponding to a block of change key cuts, and a plurality of master pin matrices <b>550</b>, each master pin matrix <b>550</b> also corresponding to a block of change key cuts. Within each rekey matrix <b>500</b>, a rekey cut <b>501</b> corresponds to a respective change key cut <b>451</b>. Similarly, within each master pin matrix <b>550</b>, a master pin sequence <b>551</b> corresponds to each change key cut <b>451</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The master pin sequence <b>551</b> represents which master pin should be positioned in each position of the cylinder assembly. For example, in the master keying system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64-70</figref>, three different master pins (A, B and C) are illustrated, however, other master pin configurations may be utilized. Additionally, the system is not limited to three distinct master pins, but may include less than or more than three master pin configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Additionally, while the master key system described in the current example includes six master pins, the system is not limited to such and may include some non-master pins. The number of distinct master pins and percentage of master pins within a given cylinder assembly will determine the number of master key cuts available. The current KBA and the SOP are utilized with a cylinder having six master pins which are all used for master keying. Under such a system, the bitting list generator will generate sixty-four page masters <b>450</b>. The number of page masters <b>450</b> will vary depending upon the set up of the cylinder and the configuration of the standard progression format. More or fewer page masters <b>450</b> may be generated as well as the particular number and arrangement of segments on each page master <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">To generate the master pin matrices <b>550</b>, the system compares a given change key cut <b>451</b> to a corresponding master key cut. The master key cuts <b>453</b>, <b>454</b>, <b>455</b>, <b>456</b>, <b>457</b> and <b>459</b> are used for comparison as each master key cut <b>453</b>, <b>454</b>, <b>455</b>, <b>456</b>, <b>457</b> and <b>459</b> must be achievable with the given master sequence <b>551</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>, an example of the generation of two master sequences <b>551</b>&#x2032; and <b>551</b>&#x2033; is illustrated by comparing the respective change cuts <b>451</b>&#x2032;, <b>451</b>&#x2032; to the vertical group master <b>454</b> and the page master <b>453</b>. Examination of the remaining master key cuts <b>455</b>, <b>456</b>, <b>457</b> and <b>459</b> would show that each also is achievable with the master sequence <b>551</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Starting with change key cut <b>451</b>&#x2032;, the first bitting <b>451</b>A is compared to page master cut bitting <b>453</b>A and differs thereto by N bites while first bitting <b>451</b>A is the same as the vertical group bitting <b>454</b>A. In the illustrated embodiment, the first master rack pin <b>551</b>A is configured to work with bittings equal to or within N bite of change key bitting. As such, the first master pin <b>551</b>A will be represented by an &#x201c;A&#x201d; in the master sequence <b>551</b>&#x2032;. Comparing the second bitting <b>451</b>B to page master cut bitting <b>453</b>B and vertical group bitting <b>454</b>B, the bitting is the same for each, and therefore, the second master pin <b>551</b>B will also be represented by an &#x201c;A&#x201d; in the master sequence <b>551</b>&#x2032;. The comparison is made for each of the bittings <b>451</b>C-<b>451</b>F and an appropriate representation of each master pin <b>551</b>C-<b>551</b>F in the master sequence <b>551</b>&#x2032; is determined. For master sequence <b>551</b>&#x2032;, master pins <b>551</b>A-<b>551</b>C is a master pin having only a N bite difference and is therefore represented by an &#x201c;A&#x201d; in each of these positions of the sequence <b>551</b>&#x2032; while master pins <b>551</b>D-<b>551</b>F is a master pin having a P bite difference and is therefore represented by a &#x201c;C&#x201d; in each of these positions of the sequence <b>551</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">This comparison is done for each change key cut <b>451</b> to determine a master sequence <b>551</b> for each. Looking at the third bitting <b>451</b>C&#x2032; of change key cut <b>451</b>&#x2033;, the bitting is O away from both the master cut bitting <b>453</b>C and vertical group bitting <b>454</b>C. In the illustrated embodiment, second master rack pin <b>551</b>B is configured to work with bittings equal to or having a O bite difference with respect to the change key bitting. As such, the third master pin <b>551</b>C&#x2032; will be represented by a &#x201c;B&#x201d; in the master sequence <b>551</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The rekey matrices <b>550</b> represent the rekey cut <b>501</b> for each corresponding change key cut <b>451</b>. The rekey matrices <b>550</b> may be established in a one-to-one manner such that each rekey cut <b>501</b> corresponds identically to the respective change key cut <b>451</b>. However, knowing the master sequence <b>551</b> for each change key cut <b>451</b>, the system of the present invention allows the number of rekeys to be minimized by using a single rekey cut <b>501</b> for multiple change key cuts. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>, while rekey cut <b>501</b>&#x2032; corresponds identically to change key cut <b>451</b>&#x2032; and rekey cut <b>501</b>&#x2033; corresponds identically to change key cut <b>451</b>&#x2033;, the rekey cut <b>501</b>&#x2033;&#x2032; is configured to operate both change key cut <b>451</b>&#x2033;&#x2032; and change key cut <b>451</b>&#x2033;&#x2033;. The system determines such by comparing the change key cuts <b>451</b>&#x2033;&#x2032;, <b>451</b>&#x2033;&#x2033; with the respective master sequences <b>551</b>&#x2033;&#x2032;, <b>551</b>&#x2033;&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, it is seen that each master sequence <b>551</b> repeats multiple times within the master pin matrices <b>550</b>. The number of times a given master sequence <b>551</b> repeats is dependent upon the KBA, the SOP, the number of master pins utilized and the number of distinct master pins. In the illustrated embodiment, each master sequence <b>551</b> repeats eight times on eight different pages of the master key system. On the illustration of page 1 of the master system, the master sequence <b>551</b> of A-A-A-C-C-C is repeated eight times as indicated by the solid line rectangles. Similarly, the master sequence <b>551</b> of B-A-B-B-C-C is repeated eight times as indicated by the dashed line rectangles. In this example, a similar eight times repeat of the A-A-A-C-C-C master sequence <b>551</b> is also found on 7 other pages of the master key system. As such, in the present system, the A-A-A-C-C-C master sequence <b>551</b> is repeated sixty-four times. Similarly, the master sequence <b>551</b> of B-A-B-B-C-C is repeated sixty-four times within the master key system.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">As explained in more detail below, each repeat of a given master sequence <b>551</b> represents another change key cut <b>451</b> to which the cylinder assembly may be reprogrammed to without removing the cylinder assembly. This means that a given cylinder assembly under this master keying system can be changed sixty-three times from its original combination. Furthermore, since the repeats occur over different pages within the master keying system, a cylinder assembly can be rekeyed to a different master key hierarchy. For example, if a cylinder assembly is originally keyed to a change key cut on page 1 of the master key system, it would be part of the hierarchy including the vertical and horizontal group master keys, the page 1 master key, the page 1-4 master key, the page 1-16 master key and the TMK. If the cylinder is rekeyed to a change key cut having the same master sequence on page 43, the rekeyed cylinder would be part of the hierarchy including the new vertical and horizontal group master keys, the page 43 master key, the page 41-44 master key, the page 33-48 master key and the TMK.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Having explained generation of the illustrative page master <b>450</b>, rekeying of a cylinder assembly having an initial change key cut <b>451</b>X to a new change key cut will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 69-70</figref>. First, the current change key cut <b>451</b>X is identified within the master key system. The corresponding rekey cut <b>501</b>X is identified in the rekey matrices <b>550</b>. A reset key X having the rekey cut <b>501</b>X is positioned in the lock cylinder and is rotated to a reset position as described above. The reset key X is removed from the cylinder and the cylinder assembly is ready for a new reset key Y to be inserted. In utilizing the system with other configurations of reprogrammable cylinders, other steps in the rekeying process may be carried out accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">To identify the possible new change key cut, the master sequence <b>551</b>X corresponding to change key cut <b>451</b>X is identified. The cylinder assembly can be rekeyed to any change key cut having the same master sequence as master sequence <b>551</b>X, namely, A-A-A-C-C-C. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref>, a master sequence <b>551</b>Y is identified within the same master pin matrix <b>550</b>. Change to the corresponding change key cut <b>451</b>Y allows the cylinder assembly to work with all of the same master key cuts. If maintaining the same master hierarchy is not desired, a different change key cut <b>451</b> with the master sequence <b>551</b> of A-A-A-C-C-C may alternatively be chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Once the desired change key cut <b>451</b>Y is identified, the corresponding rekey cut <b>501</b>Y is identified from the rekey matrices <b>500</b>. A reset key Y having the rekey cut <b>501</b>Y, namely, &#x3e;-#-%-&#x3c;-&#x26;-!, is positioned in the lock cylinder and is rotated to the original cylinder position as described above. The reset key Y is removed from the cylinder and the cylinder assembly is reprogrammed for use with a key having the change key cut <b>501</b>Y of &#x3e;-#-%-&#x3c;-&#x26;-!. In utilizing the system with other configurations of reprogrammable cylinders, other steps in the rekeying process may be carried out accordingly.</p>
