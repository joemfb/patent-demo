<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a middle- or large-sized battery module having an electrode terminal connecting member and an insulating joint member, and, more particularly, to a middle- or large-sized battery module having a structure in which two or more plate-shaped secondary battery cells (&#x2018;battery cells&#x2019;) are arranged in a lateral direction thereof, wherein the battery cells have electrode terminals arranged in the same direction, plate-shaped electrode terminal connecting members to electrically connect the battery cells to one another are electrically connected to oriented surfaces of the electrode terminals of the battery cells, each of the electrode terminal connecting members is provided at a top and/or bottom thereof with a coupling structure to interconnect electrode terminal connecting members, and at least one end of an insulating joint member coupled in the coupling structure is supported by a module case.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, a secondary battery, which can be charged and discharged, has been widely used as an energy source for wireless mobile devices. Also, the secondary battery has attracted considerable attention as a power source for electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), which have been developed to solve problems, such as air pollution, caused by existing gasoline and diesel vehicles using fossil fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a result, kinds of applications using the secondary battery are being increased owing to advantages of the secondary battery, and hereafter the secondary battery is expected to be applied to more applications and products than now.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Small-sized mobile devices use one or several battery cells for each device. On the other hand, middle- or large-sized devices, such as vehicles, use a middle- or large-sized battery module having a plurality of battery cells electrically connected with one another because high power and large capacity are necessary for the middle- or large-sized devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The size and weight of the battery module is directly related to the receiving space and power of the corresponding middle- or large-sized device. For this reason, manufacturers are trying to manufacture small-sized, light-weight battery modules. Furthermore, devices, which are subject to a large number of external impacts and vibrations, such as electric bicycles and electric vehicles, require stable electrical connection and physical coupling between components constituting the battery module. In addition, a plurality of battery cells are used to accomplish high power and large capacity, and therefore, the safety of the battery module is regarded as important.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Preferably, the middle- or large-sized battery module is manufactured so as to have as small a size and weight as possible. For this reason, a prismatic battery or a pouch-shaped battery, which can be stacked with high integration and has a small weight to capacity ratio, is usually used as a battery cell of the middle- or large-sized battery module. Especially, much interest is currently focused on the pouch-shaped battery, which uses an aluminum laminate sheet as a sheathing member, because the weight of the pouch-shaped battery is small, and the manufacturing costs of the pouch-shaped battery are low.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to connect pouch-shaped batteries in series and/or in parallel to one another, electrode terminals of the respective batteries are electrically connected to one another via an electrode terminal connecting member. In this case, however, separation between the electrode terminals of the respective batteries and the electrode terminal connecting member may occur, or the electrode terminal connecting member may be dislocated, due to external force, such as vibration and external impact or twist caused by expansion of the batteries, with the result that a short circuit of the battery module may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to prevent the occurrence of the short circuit, therefore, there has been proposed a structure in which the electrode terminal connecting member is mounted to the battery cells via a predetermined insulating member. In this case, however, an additional member is needed, and, in addition, the member must be mounted to the battery cells, with the result that the overall size of the battery module is increased, and the structure of the battery module is complicated. Furthermore, such a structure secures only stable mounting of the electrode terminal connecting member to the battery cells but does not provide a structural stability of the battery module.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the present invention has been made to solve the above problems, and other technical problems that have yet to be resolved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Specifically, it is an object of the present invention to provide a battery module having a structure that is capable of safely and easily achieving electrical connection and mechanical coupling between battery cells, thereby improving productivity and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is another object of the present invention to provide a battery module having a structure that is capable of preventing dislocation of an electrode terminal connecting member and battery cells due to external force or internal force, thereby preventing the occurrence of a short circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a battery module having an improved structural stability such that the battery module can be used in a severe condition.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a middle- or large-sized battery module having a structure in which two or more plate-shaped secondary battery cells (&#x2018;battery cells&#x2019;) are arranged in a lateral direction thereof, wherein the battery cells have electrode terminals arranged in the same direction, plate-shaped electrode terminal connecting members to electrically connect the battery cells to one another are electrically connected to oriented surfaces of the electrode terminals of the battery cells, each of the electrode terminal connecting members is provided at a top and/or bottom thereof with a coupling structure to interconnect electrode terminal connecting members, and at least one end of an insulating joint member coupled in the coupling structure is supported by a module case.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When external impact is applied to the battery module, or the battery cells are expanded or twisted during the operation of the battery module, as previously described, the coupling regions between the electrode terminals and the electrode terminal connecting members are separated and/or the electrode terminal connecting members or the battery cells may dislocated, with the result that a short circuit of the battery module may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the other hand, the middle- or large-sized battery module includes a specific structure to couple the electrode terminal connecting members. When the battery cells are deformed due to external impact applied to the battery module or other causes, therefore, it is possible to effectively prevent dislocation of the electrode terminal connecting members and the battery cells, thereby preventing the occurrence of a short circuit. Also, the insulating joint member to connect the electrode terminal connecting members to one another is supported by the module case, in which the battery cells are mounted, thereby improving structural stability of the battery module.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The plate-shaped battery cells may be secondary batteries each having a small thickness, a relatively large width, and a relatively large length enough to minimize the total size of the secondary batteries when secondary batteries are stacked in the lateral direction so as to constitute a battery module. In a preferred example, each of the battery cells may be configured such that an electrode assembly is mounted in a battery case formed of a laminate sheet including a metal layer and a resin layer in a sealed state. More specifically, each of the battery cells may be configured such that an electrode assembly is mounted in a pouch-shaped case formed of an aluminum laminate sheet, and a pair of electrode terminals protrudes from one end of the case. The secondary battery having the above structure may also be referred to as a pouch-shaped battery cell.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each of the electrode terminal connecting members may be configured in various structures. In a preferred example, each of the electrode terminal connecting members may include a plate-shaped member body configured to be disposed on electrode terminals of the battery cells which are arranged in the lateral direction thereof, the plate-shaped member body having a predetermine thickness, a left-wing connection part extending from the plate-shaped member body such that the electrode terminals of the left-side battery cells are connected to the left-wing connection part to achieve electrical connection in series or in series and in parallel between the battery cells, and a right-wing connection part extending from the plate-shaped member body such that the electrode terminals of the right-side battery cells are connected to the right-wing connection part to achieve electrical connection in series or in series and in parallel between the battery cells, the left-wing connection part may be provided with slits, corresponding to shapes of the electrode terminals of the battery cells, through which the plate-shaped electrode terminals of the respective battery cells (&#x2018;battery cell electrode terminals&#x2019;) are inserted, and the right-wing connection part may be provided with slits, corresponding to shapes of the battery cell electrode terminals, through which the battery cell electrode terminals are inserted, and, during electrical connection, the battery cell electrode terminals may be inserted through the slits of the left- and right-wing connection parts, may be bent such that the battery cell electrode terminals come into tight contact with a top of the electrode terminal connecting member, and then the battery cell electrode terminals may be coupled to the electrode terminal connecting member by welding.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">That is, in the middle- or large-sized battery module including two or more battery cells arranged in the lateral direction thereof, the left-wing connection part may be connected to cathode terminals or anode terminals (&#x2018;left-side electrode terminals) located at the left side of the battery cells, and the right-wing connection part may be connected to cathode terminals or anode terminals (&#x2018;right-side electrode terminals) located at the right side of the battery cells. As a result, the battery cells arranged in the lateral direction thereof are electrically connected in series to one another in regular sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also, the left-wing connection part and the right-wing connection part have the slits through which the electrode terminals of the respective battery cells are inserted. Consequently, the battery cell electrode terminals are inserted through the respective slits, are bent, and are then connected to the electrode terminal connecting member by welding, thereby achieving electrical connection between the electrode terminals of the battery cells. Also, the electrode terminals of the battery cells, disposed adjacent to the electrode terminal connecting member in a tight contact manner, are effectively connected to one another, and the assembly process is easily carried out. In addition, the electrode terminal connecting member serves as a kind of coupling member to interconnect the battery cells, thereby providing high structural stability and high coupling strength at coupling regions between the battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, the number of the slits may be changed depending upon the number of the battery cells constituting the battery module. When the number of battery cells constituting a battery module is frequently changed for small quantity batch production, therefore, it is possible to easily change the number of the slits so as to easily correspond to the change in number of the battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Generally, each of the plate-shaped battery cells is configured in a structure in which an electrode assembly is mounted in a cell case, and electrode terminals electrically connected to a cathode and an anode of the electrode assembly protrude outward from the case. Consequently, each of the battery cell electrode terminals may be formed of a metal plate in consideration of conductivity, durability, and weldability with respect to another component.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As previously described, the left-wing connection part of the electrode terminal connecting member electrically connects the left-side electrode terminals of the battery cells arranged in the lateral direction thereof, which are located at the left side of the plate-shaped member body, to one another, and the right-wing connection part of the electrode terminal connecting member electrically connects the right-side electrode terminals of the battery cells arranged in the lateral direction thereof, which are located at the right side of the plate-shaped member body, to one another. Only one battery cell may be connected to each of the connection parts, or two or more battery cells may be connected to each of the connection parts. For example, when the number of the left-side electrode terminals connected to the left-wing connection part is two or more and when the number of the right-side electrode terminals connected to the right-wing connection part is two or more, parallel connection between the battery cells corresponding to the number of the battery cells connected to connection parts may be possible in addition to series connection between the battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a preferred example of the structure in which the battery cells are connected in series and in parallel to one another, therefore, the left-wing connection part may be provided with a step formed in the lateral direction such that the step corresponds to the number of the battery cells connected in series to one another, and the right-wing connection part may be provided with a step formed in the lateral direction such that the step corresponds to the number of the battery cells connected in series to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, the left-wing connection part may extend in the left upper direction of the plate-shaped member body, and the right-wing connection part may extend in the right lower direction of the plate-shaped member body. Consequently, the left-wing connection part is connected to the left electrode terminals of the battery cells, which are located at the left side of the plate-shaped member body, and the right-wing connection part is connected to the right electrode terminals of the battery cells, which are located at the right side of the plate-shaped member body, while the right-wing connection part has a step formed in the lateral direction such that the step corresponds to the number of the battery cells connected in series to the left-side connection part. As a result, the battery cells connected to the left-wing connection part and the battery cells connected to the right-wing connection part are connected in series to each other. Also, the battery cells of each connection part are connected in parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another preferred example, the left-wing connection part may be provided with two or more slits arranged in the lateral direction thereof such that two or more adjacent battery cells are connected in parallel to each other, and the right-wing connection part may be provided with two or more slits arranged in the lateral direction thereof such that two or more adjacent battery cells are connected in parallel to each other. For example, when the battery cells are electrically connected to each other in a 3P (parallel)-2S (series) connection structure, the left-wing connection part may have three slits, and the right-wing connection part may have three slits. On the other hand, when the battery cells are electrically connected to each other in a 2P-2S connection structure, the left-wing connection part may have two slits, and the right-wing connection part may have two slits.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The slits are not particularly restricted as long as the battery cell electrode terminals can be easily inserted through the slits of the left- and right-wing connection parts. For example, the slits may be depressed from the outside end of each of the left- and right-wing connection parts. Alternatively, the slits may be formed in each of the left- and right-wing connection parts such that the slits are spaced apart from the outside end of each of the left- and right-wing connection parts by a predetermined distance.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Meanwhile, as previously described, the coupling between the electrode terminals of the battery cells and the electrode terminal connecting member may be achieved by inserting the electrode terminals of the respective battery cells through the slits of the left- and right-wing connection parts, bending the electrode terminals of the respective battery cells such that the electrode terminals of the respective battery cells comes into tight contact with the top of the electrode terminal connecting member, and welding the bent portions of the electrode terminals of the respective battery cells to the top of the electrode terminal connecting member in a state in which the electrode terminals of the respective battery cells are in tight contact with the top of the electrode terminal connecting member, thereby achieving stable mechanical coupling and electrical connection. The welding may be appropriately carried out using a welding method selected from a group consisting of resistance welding, laser welding, arc welding, and ultrasonic welding.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the middle- or large-sized battery module according to the present invention, the coupling structure may include a frame configured in a hollow structure (&#x2018;hollow frame&#x2019;) formed in the lateral direction of the battery cells, and the insulating joint member, configured in a bar type structure, may be fixedly inserted through the hollow frame in a state in which a plurality of electrode terminal connecting members are arranged in the lateral direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the coupling structure in which the electrode terminal connecting members are fixed by inserting the insulating joint member through the hollow frames, therefore, it is possible to prevent electrical contact between the electrode terminal connecting members and the insulating joint member and, in addition, to effectively prevent dislocation of the electrode terminal connecting members when external impact is applied to the battery module.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The hollow frame is not particularly restricted as long as the hollow frame is configured in a shape corresponding to the insulating joint member, and therefore, coupling between the insulating joint member and the hollow frame through the insertion of the insulating joint member into the hollow frame is easily achieved. For example, the hollow frame may have a vertical sectional shape configured in a polygonal hollow structure such that the insulating joint member cannot freely rotate in the hollow after the insulating joint member is inserted into the hollow frame. The polygonal hollow structure may include a quadrangular hollow structure, a triangular hollow structure, and a pentagonal hollow structure.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Also, the hollow frame may be formed at the top or bottom of the plate-shaped member body. Alternatively, the hollow frame may be formed at both the top and bottom of the plate-shaped member body. That is, the hollow frame may be selectively used as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Meanwhile, the insulating joint member is not particularly restricted as long as the insulating joint member can be made of a material to secure desired rigidity and insulation or can be configured in a structure to secure desired rigidity and insulation. For example, the insulating joint member may be made of an insulative material or may be configured in a structure in which a metal rod is covered with an insulative material.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, the insulating joint member includes a rod made of a metal material exhibiting high physical rigidity and an insulative material covering the rod. For example, an insulative film having a predetermined thickness may be attached to the outside of the rod so as to isolate the rod from the hollow frame. Alternatively, the rod may be covered with an insulative coating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Also, the insulative film or the insulative coating layer may be made of, for example, resin or rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">One or more electrode terminal connecting members may be used based on the number of the battery cells arranged in the lateral direction thereof or the arrangement structure of the battery cells arranged in the lateral direction thereof. In a case in which two or more electrode terminal connecting members are used, an insulating member is preferably disposed between the respective electrode terminal connecting members so as to prevent electrical contact between the respective electrode terminal connecting members.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to prevent dislocation of the insulating member in the structure in which the insulating member is disposed between the respective electrode terminal connecting members, the insulating member may be coupled to outer circumferences of the electrode terminal connecting members. Since the insulating member is coupled to the electrode terminal connecting members as described above, it is possible to prevent electrical contact between the electrode terminal connecting members and to stably maintain the coupling structure between the electrode terminal connecting members and the insulating member.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another example, the insulating member may have a hollow structure, into which the insulating joint member is inserted, thereby achieving coupling between the electrode terminal connecting members and the insulating joint member. For example, the insulating member may be provided at the bottom thereof with a hollow structure having a shape corresponding to the hollow frame of the electrode terminal connecting member, thereby improving coupling between the electrode terminal connecting member and the insulating member.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to circumstances, the middle- or large-sized battery module may further have a structure in which two or more battery cells are arranged in the longitudinal direction thereof in addition to a lateral arrangement structure. Consequently, the electrode terminal connecting member is preferably used not only to achieve electrical connection between the battery cells arranges in the lateral direction thereof and but also to achieve electrical connection between the battery cells arranges in the longitudinal direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In particular, the middle- or large-sized battery module according to the present invention is preferably used in a middle- or large-sized battery module or a middle- or large-sized battery pack having high power and large capacity, which requires a long-term life span and excellent durability. The middle- or large-sized battery module may be used as a power source for, for example, electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, electric motorcycles, and electric bicycles.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The structures of the middle- or large-sized battery module and the middle- or large-sized battery pack and a method of manufacturing the same are well known in the art to which the present invention pertains, and a detailed description thereof will not be given.</p>
