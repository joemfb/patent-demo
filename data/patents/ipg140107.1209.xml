<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a sheet processing apparatus in the past, when a long-size sheet longer than, for example, the normal A4 size in a paper discharge direction is discharged to a discharge tray, the leading end of the sheet tends to hang down. Consequently, when the leading end of the long-size sheet comes into contact with a sheet stacking surface of the discharge tray, the sheet curls and causes a stacking failure.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the same numerals are applied to the similar elements in the drawings, and therefore, the detailed descriptions thereof are not repeated.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a sheet processing apparatus according to a first embodiment, for a fixed time, a pivoting roller (a second roller) of a standby tray is separated from a standby tray roller (a first roller) during the conveyance of a sheet P to the standby tray.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a configuration diagram of the sheet processing apparatus. Processing of sheets by the sheet processing apparatus is usually called sheet finishing and includes stapling, sorting, hole punching, and saddle binding. In this embodiment, a sheet processing apparatus that applies the stapling is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a fixed tray <b>75</b> is provided in an upper surface section of a sheet processing apparatus <b>7</b>. The fixed tray <b>75</b> is tilted such that the leading end of sheets P stacked thereon is higher than the trailing end of the sheets P. A pair of sheet discharge rollers <b>76</b> and <b>77</b> that include a discharging mechanism and nip and convey the sheet P are provided adjacent to a paper discharge port <b>71</b> of the fixed tray <b>75</b>. A fixed tray path <b>74</b> that leads the sheet P to the sheet discharge rollers <b>76</b> and <b>77</b> is provided between an inlet roller <b>22</b>, which receives the sheet P from an apparatus at a preceding stage such as an image forming apparatus <b>5</b>, and the paper discharge port <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Plural tray ribs <b>80</b> functioning as trailing end supporting members that support the trailing end of the sheets P are provided below the paper discharge port <b>71</b>. The fixed tray <b>75</b> and the tray ribs <b>80</b> are integrally molded. A sensor <b>81</b> that detects a stacking limit of the sheets P stacked on the fixed tray <b>75</b> is attached above the paper discharge port <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The fixed tray <b>75</b> is arranged to tilt such that the leading end side of the sheets P is higher than the trailing end side of the sheets P as explained above. Therefore, the sheet P conveyed to the fixed tray <b>75</b> returns in an arrow x direction, which is a sheet trailing end direction, making use of the tilt of the fixed tray <b>75</b> and comes into contact with the tray ribs <b>80</b> at the trailing end to be vertically aligned. The sheets P discharged from the image forming apparatus <b>5</b> in the same manner are sequentially discharged onto the fixed tray <b>75</b> until the number of sheets P reaches a predetermined number and are vertically aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A standby tray <b>10</b> is provided below the fixed tray <b>75</b>. A paper path <b>36</b> that leads the sheet P to a pair of paper feeding rollers (a paper feeding section) <b>24</b> is provided between the inlet roller <b>22</b> and the standby tray <b>10</b>. An outlet sensor (a detecting section) <b>60</b> is provided between the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b> and the standby tray <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the outlet sensor <b>60</b> is arranged adjacent to the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b>. The outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the sheet P conveyed via the paper path <b>36</b>. It is assumed that, when the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the sheet P, the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b> nip and convey the sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The standby tray <b>10</b> explained in detail later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has grooves for providing standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. The standby tray rollers <b>66</b> are fit in the grooves of the standby tray <b>10</b>. A part of the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> project upward from the standby tray <b>10</b>. A rotating shaft of the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> is incorporated in the standby tray <b>10</b>. The standby tray rollers <b>66</b> are respectively incorporated in tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are located above the standby tray <b>10</b>. The plural pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are configured integrally with a pivoting roller shaft <b>65</b><i>a </i>in a direction orthogonal to a conveying direction of the sheet P as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This is not a limitation. One pivoting roller <b>65</b> long in the direction orthogonal to the conveying direction may be configured integrally with the pivoting roller shaft <b>65</b><i>a</i>. In this way, the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are provided in plural places or the long one pivoting roller <b>65</b> is provided integrally with the pivoting roller shaft <b>65</b><i>a </i>in the direction orthogonal to the conveying direction. Consequently, even if the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> slide according to a sheet size, the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> and the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> come into contact with each other. The standby tray rollers <b>66</b> partially projecting from the standby tray <b>10</b> and the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> nip the sheet P and convey the sheet P to the standby tray <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A processing tray <b>12</b> on which the sheets P dropped and supplied from the standby tray <b>10</b>, i.e., from between the moving tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>is arranged below the standby tray <b>10</b>. Roller pairs formed by the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> are located on the downstream side of the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b> and convey the sheet P conveyed by the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The processing tray <b>12</b> aligns and supports the sheets P stacked thereon while the sheets P are stapled by a stapler <b>14</b>. The processing tray <b>12</b> is arranged to tilt down toward the stapler <b>14</b>. The processing tray <b>12</b> includes a pair of upper and lower aligning rollers <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b </i>that align the plural sheets P, which are dropped and supplied from the standby tray <b>10</b>, in a longitudinal direction, which is the conveying direction. The aligning rollers <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b </i>are provided near the stapler <b>14</b>. The aligning rollers <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b </i>are also used as bundle conveying rollers that nip a sheet bundle T subjected to stapling and remove the sheet bundle T from the stapler <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A paddle <b>44</b> mounted on the processing tray <b>12</b> is arranged in a position where the trailing end of the sheets P drops when the sheets P are dropped and supplied from the standby tray <b>10</b> to the processing tray <b>12</b>. The paddle <b>44</b> is rotatable and aligns the top sheet P in the longitudinal direction. The paddle <b>44</b> is made of, for example, a rubber material and has elasticity.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A stopper <b>45</b> that comes into contact with the trailing end of the sheets P and regulates the trailing end position is provided at an end on the stapler <b>14</b> side of the processing tray <b>12</b>. A conveyor belt <b>50</b> is provided substantially in the center of the processing tray <b>12</b>. The conveyor belt <b>50</b> conveys the sheet bundle T subjected to the stapling and removed from the stapler <b>14</b> by the upper and lower aligning rollers <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b </i>to a first paper discharge tray (a paper discharge section) <b>16</b>. A feeding claw <b>50</b><i>a </i>that catches the trailing end of the sheet bundle T is attached to the conveyor belt <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The standby tray <b>10</b> can drop and supply the sheets P to the processing tray <b>12</b>. On the other hand, the standby tray <b>10</b> can convey the sheets P not subjected to stapling in the direction of the first paper discharge tray <b>16</b>. The roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> convey the sheets P to the first paper discharge tray <b>16</b> while coming into contact with the sheets P on the standby tray <b>10</b>. The pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are driven to rotate by a pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> via an arm <b>64</b> and are driven to rotate by a conveying motor <b>105</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The conveying motor <b>105</b> is connected to the pivoting roller shaft <b>65</b><i>a </i>that rotatably supports the pivoting rollers <b>65</b>. The pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are driving rollers and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> are driven rollers. The standby tray rollers <b>66</b> rotate according to the rotation of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> when the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> are in contact with the pivoting rollers <b>65</b>. When the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> and the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are in contact with each other, nips are formed between the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> and the pivoting rollers <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A striking member <b>62</b> is provided above the standby tray <b>10</b>. The striking member <b>62</b> is controlled by a striking solenoid <b>61</b>. The striking member <b>62</b> strikes the sheets P, which are conveyed to the standby tray <b>10</b>, in an arrow w direction to thereby form corrugation curving along the conveying direction (hereinafter simply referred to as corrugation) in the center of the sheets P. The striking member <b>62</b> also strikes the sheets P when the sheets P are dropped from the standby tray <b>10</b> to the processing tray <b>12</b>. When the striking member <b>62</b> strikes the sheets P, if the sheets P are thin, a striking mark is likely to remain on the sheets P. Therefore, protective members may be attached to the corners and the bottom surface of the striking member <b>62</b>. The protective members are, for example, sheets or sponges. The striking member <b>62</b> may be rounded off at the corners and formed in a roundish shape.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the standby tray <b>10</b>. The standby tray <b>10</b> is arranged to tilt such that the leading end of the sheets P is higher than the trailing end of the sheets P. The standby tray <b>10</b> includes the pair of tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>. The tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>receive the sheets P and support both the sides of the sheets P in a state in which the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>are slid to the width of the sheet P. Standby stoppers that regulate the trailing end of the sheets P are provided in the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>. The standby tray <b>10</b> is slid by a standby tray motor <b>109</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The tray member <b>10</b><i>a </i>slides in an arrow y direction and a direction opposite to the arrow y direction. The tray member <b>10</b><i>b </i>slides in an arrow z direction and a direction opposite to the arrow z direction. The standby tray rollers <b>66</b> are provided in the standby tray <b>10</b>. The standby tray rollers <b>66</b> also move according to the sliding of the standby tray <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A series of flow of the sheet P in the sheet processing apparatus <b>7</b> is explained. There are three paths for conveying the sheet P. A first conveying path is a path through which the sheet P is discharged to the fixed tray <b>75</b> without being subjected to stapling. A second conveying path is a path through which the sheet P is discharged to the paper discharge tray <b>16</b> without being subjected to stapling. A third conveying path is a path through which the sheet P is subjected to stapling and discharged from the processing tray <b>12</b> to the paper discharge tray <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first conveying path is explained. If the sheet P is discharged to the fixed tray <b>75</b> without being subjected to stapling, the sheet P discharged from a paper feeding roller <b>6</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>5</b> is conveyed to the sheet discharge rollers <b>76</b> and <b>77</b> by the inlet roller <b>22</b> via the tray path <b>74</b> and discharged to the fixed tray <b>75</b>. The sheets P discharged from the image forming apparatus <b>5</b> are sequentially discharged to the fixed tray <b>75</b> and vertically aligned until the number of sheets P reaches a predetermined number.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The second conveying path is explained. If the sheet P is discharged to the first paper discharge tray <b>16</b> without being subjected to stapling, for example, the paper discharge tray <b>16</b> slides to a position indicated by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in advance. If stapling is not performed, the sheet P conveyed to the inlet roller <b>22</b> is conveyed to the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b> from the inlet roller <b>22</b> via the paper path <b>36</b> and fed to the standby tray <b>10</b> by the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b>. Subsequently, the sheet P is conveyed on the standby tray <b>10</b> by the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> and discharged to the paper discharge tray <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The third conveying path is explained. When stapling is performed, the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>slide and the standby tray <b>10</b> can support the sheets P. The sheet P discharged from the image forming apparatus <b>5</b> and supplied by the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b> is placed on the standby tray <b>10</b> in order to, for example, wait for stapling of the preceding sheets P to be completed on the processing tray <b>12</b>. The plural sheets P are stacked on the standby tray <b>10</b> until completion of the processing on the processing tray <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the preceding sheets P on the processing tray <b>12</b> are discharged onto the paper discharge tray <b>16</b> and the stapling on the processing tray <b>12</b> is completed, the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> respectively slide in the arrow y direction and the arrow z direction. When the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>slide, the striking member <b>62</b> strikes the sheets P from above in the arrow w direction. The sheets P placed on the standby tray <b>10</b> are dropped to the processing tray <b>12</b> according to the sliding of the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the sheet striking by the striking member <b>62</b>. After the stapling, a control section <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> drives the conveyor belt <b>50</b> to hook the trailing end of the sheet bundle T subjected to the stapling to the feeding claw <b>50</b><i>a</i>, and convey the sheet bundle T to the paper discharge tray <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the long-size sheet P is conveyed to the standby tray <b>10</b>, even if the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are separated from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, it is possible to convey the sheet P to the standby tray <b>10</b> according to the conveyance by the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b>. When the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> functioning as the driving rollers separate from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> functioning as the driven rollers, the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> do not have conveying force for the sheet P. However, since the long-size sheet P such as an FOLIO sheet has sufficient length, the sheet P can be conveyed to the standby tray <b>10</b> by the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b> located upstream the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At this point, since the long-size sheet P such as the FOLIO sheet is long in the longitudinal direction, even if the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are separated from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> or the processing for forming corrugation by sheet striking of the striking member <b>62</b> is applied to the sheet, although hanging-down of the sheet P is suppressed, the sheet P comes into contact with the paper discharge tray <b>16</b>. Even in the conveyance of the sheet P through the third conveying path, when the sheet P is put on standby on the standby tray <b>10</b>, the leading end of the sheet P comes into contact with the paper discharge tray <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of the sheet processing apparatus <b>7</b>. The control section <b>100</b> of the sheet processing apparatus <b>7</b> includes, for example, a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a ROM (Read Only Memory), and a RAM (Random Access Memory). The ROM has stored therein a computer program for causing the CPU to operate. The RAM stores, for example, data of the number of sheets P to be processed and various kinds of information transmitted from the image forming apparatus <b>5</b> at a preceding stage of the sheet processing apparatus <b>7</b>. The control section <b>100</b> communicates with the image forming apparatus <b>5</b>, a client PC (not shown), and an external server (not shown) through a communication interface (I/F) <b>102</b> connected via a system bus <b>101</b>.</p>

When the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are pivoted in an arrow t direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) from a state of contact with the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> separate from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. When the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are pivoted in a direction opposite to the arrow t direction from a state of separation from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> come into contact with the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>.</p>

The striking member <b>62</b> strikes the sheets P according to the pivoting in the arrow w direction. When the striking solenoid <b>61</b> is turned off, the striking member <b>62</b> pivots in a direction opposite to the arrow w direction and returns to an original position. The original position is a position before the striking member <b>62</b> pivots in the arrow w direction. The control section <b>100</b> controls the striking member <b>62</b> to retract into a sheet conveying path (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which is a home position of the striking member <b>62</b>, not to prevent sheet conveyance other than time when the striking member <b>62</b> strikes the sheets P to form corrugation on the sheets P.</p>

After the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are separated from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> for a fixed time, the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> are brought into contact with each other again.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Timing for changing the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> from ON to OFF may be timing when it is confirmed that the leading end of the sheet P comes into contact with the paper discharge tray <b>16</b> or a predetermined number of steps elapses after the sheet detection in the outlet sensor <b>60</b> is turned off. The predetermined number of steps is, when a stepping motor is used, the number of steps at which the leading end of the sheet P is assumed to come into contact with a sheet stacking surface of the paper discharge tray <b>16</b> after the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the sheet P. The predetermined number of steps may be the number of steps at which the conveyance of the sheet P to the standby tray <b>10</b> is assumed to end. The timing for changing the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> from ON to OFF may be timing when the sheet detection in the outlet sensor <b>60</b> is turned off. By controlling the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> in this way, it is possible to convey the sheet P with corrugation sufficiently formed on the sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is a space between the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, when the sheet P collides against the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>, corrugation is formed on the sheet P fed by the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b>. In other words, the leading end of the sheet P forms a recess on the sheet P in the space between the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>. However, when the sheet P is further fed and is conveyed in the contact state of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, in a portion of the sheet P passed through the nips between the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, the corrugation formed during the collision against the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>disappears. When the sheet P passes the nips between the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, the sheet P is flattened by the conveying force of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. When the conveyance of the sheet P is continued in a state in which the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are set in contact with the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, the sheet P flattens and hangs down with the gravity. Therefore, when the sheet P comes into contact with the sheet stacking surface of the paper discharge tray <b>16</b>, it is likely that a stacking failure of the sheet P is caused.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">However, as explained above, the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are separated from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> for the fixed time during the conveyance of the sheet P in the standby tray <b>10</b>. This makes it possible to convey the sheet P in a state in which the corrugation of the sheet P formed during the collision against the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>is maintained. When the sheet P passes the nips between the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, the leading end of the sheet P flattens. However, the trailing end of the sheet P maintains the corrugation of the sheet P formed during the collision against the tray members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>. When the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are separated from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> for the fixed time in this state, the leading end of the sheet P regains the corrugation with the own weight of the sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The separation of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> is performed at an early stage after the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the leading end of the sheet P and the leading end of the sheet P passes the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. For example, the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are separated from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> when the leading end of the sheet P moves forward about several tens millimeters after passing the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. When the sheet P is conveyed, for example, several tens millimeters after the separation of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> nip and convey the sheet P again. When the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are separated from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, the conveyance is performed by the paper feeding rollers <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The control section <b>100</b> may control the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> to be turned on after the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the sheet P and before the sheet P passes the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. In this case, the control section <b>100</b> separates the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> before the sheet P passes the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. The control section <b>100</b> controls the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> to nip and convey the sheet P after the leading end of the sheet P moves forward on the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> several tens millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are brought into contact with the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> again after being separated from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> for the fixed time and the sheet P is conveyed in this way, the corrugation is maintained and the sheet P does not hang down.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The sheet P tends to hang down when the sheet P is the long size. Therefore, if the control section <b>100</b> determines that the long-size sheet P is processed, the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> may be separated from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> as explained above. The long-size sheet P is the sheet P equal to or larger than, for example, the A3 or FOLIO size. The control section <b>100</b> receives various kinds of information such as a type of the sheet P, a printing mode, and a sheet size transmitted from the image forming apparatus <b>5</b>. If the control section <b>100</b> determines that the sheet size is size or length equal to or larger than a specified value, the control section <b>100</b> controls the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> to separate from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>.</p>

In <b>301</b>, the control section <b>100</b> determines from the received various kinds of information whether the sheet P is the long-size sheet P. If the control section <b>100</b> determines that the sheet P is not the long-size sheet P (NO in <b>301</b>), the control section <b>100</b> conveys the sheet P in a state in which the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> are set in contact with the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> without separating the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> and ends conveyance processing of the sheet P to the standby tray <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">If the control section <b>100</b> determines that the sheet P is the long-size sheet P (Yes in <b>301</b>), in <b>302</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the control section <b>100</b> separates the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> when the numbers of steps A<b>1</b>, which is predetermined timing, elapses after the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the sheet P. Thereafter, in <b>303</b>, the control section <b>100</b> brings the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> into contact with the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and ends the conveyance processing of the sheet P to the standby tray <b>10</b> when the number of steps A<b>2</b>, which is predetermined timing, elapses after the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the sheet P.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The contact state of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> is a home position.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The rib <b>73</b> is shaped to form corrugation on the sheet P in the contact state of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. For example, the distal end of the rib <b>73</b> is shaped to project further downward than the position of nips formed when the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> come into contact with each other. Since the rib <b>73</b> is shaped in this way, the center of the sheet P conveyed to the standby tray <b>10</b> is pressed downward by the rib <b>73</b> and corrugation is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When the rib <b>73</b> comes into contact with the sheet P and forms corrugation on the sheet P, for example, if the sheet P is thin, it is likely that a striking mark remains on the sheet P.

The rib <b>73</b> may be rounded off at the corners and formed in a roundish shape.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> is turned on, the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> moves in the arrow s direction together with the first arm <b>68</b>.

At this point, the pivoting roller shaft <b>65</b><i>a </i>connected to the second arm <b>69</b> also pivots in the arrow t direction together with the second arm <b>69</b>. Therefore, when the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> is turned on, the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> separate from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).

When the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> is turned on, the control section <b>100</b> drives the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> to locate the rib <b>73</b> in a position where the rib <b>73</b> does not come into contact with the conveyed sheet P. Alternatively, the rib <b>73</b> is shaped not to come into contact with the conveyed sheet P when the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> is turned off, the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> moves in the direction opposite to the arrow s direction together with the first arm <b>68</b> connected to the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b>. The second arm <b>69</b> pivots in the direction opposite to the arrow t direction about the fixed second shaft <b>71</b>. The pivoting roller shaft <b>65</b><i>a </i>connected to the second arm <b>69</b> also pivots in the direction opposite to the arrow s direction together with the second arm <b>69</b>. At this point, the rib <b>73</b> connected to the pivoting roller shaft <b>65</b><i>a </i>also pivots in the direction opposite to the arrow t direction. Therefore, when the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> is turned off, the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> come into contact with the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. The rib <b>73</b> returns to a state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> together with the pivoting rollers <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a timing chart of pivoting of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b>. The timing chart is a timing chart inputting the sheet P on standby on the standby tray <b>10</b>. In the following explanation with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, two sheets P are put on standby on the standby tray <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The control section <b>100</b> drives the conveying motor <b>105</b> when the number of steps E<b>1</b> elapses after the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the first sheet P. During the conveyance of the first sheet P to the standby tray <b>10</b>, the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> is in an OFF state. In other words, the control section <b>100</b> performs control to convey the first sheet P in a state in which the rib <b>73</b> continues to be in contact with the first sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Subsequently, the control section <b>100</b> turns on the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> when the number of steps E<b>2</b> elapses after the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the second sheet P. The control section <b>100</b> turns off the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> when the number of steps E<b>3</b> elapses after the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">During the conveyance of the second sheet P, the first sheet P is stacked on the standby tray <b>10</b> in a state in which the first sheet P is held in the nips formed by the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. When the second sheet P is conveyed to the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, which already nip the first sheet P, it is likely that a space in which the second sheet P is conveyed is insufficient. In other words, it is likely that the leading end of the second sheet P causes a jam in the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> or in the rib <b>73</b>. Therefore, timing for turning on the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> after the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the second sheet P is desirably timing before the leading end of the second sheet P passes on the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>. The control section <b>100</b> sets timing for changing the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> from ON to OFF during the conveyance of the second sheet P to timing after the leading end of the second sheet P passes on the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The control explained above is not a limitation. The control section <b>100</b> may control the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> to be turned on at an early stage after the leading end of the second sheet P passes the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> after the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the second sheet P. If the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> is turned on at an early stage (e.g., 10 mm after passing the roller pairs) after the leading end of the second sheet P passes the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>, it is possible to convey the second sheet P without causing a jam. In the above explanation, the two sheets P are put on standby on the standby tray <b>10</b>. However, the number of sheets is not limited to two. The control section <b>100</b> performs the same control during the conveyance of the second and subsequent sheets P to the standby tray <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Even if plural sheets P are put on standby on the standby tray <b>10</b>, it is possible to sufficiently secure a conveyance space for the second and subsequent sheets P. As in the other embodiments, it is possible to form corrugation on the plural sheets P.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">With the sheet processing apparatus and the sheet conveying method according to the fifth embodiment explained above, it is possible to form corrugation on the sheet P and suppress the leading end of the sheet P from hanging down. Further, since corrugation is formed by the rib <b>73</b>, it is possible to obtain a further effect of suppressing the leading end of the sheet P from hanging down. Even if the plural sheets P are put on standby on the standby tray <b>10</b>, it is possible to sufficiently secure a conveyance space for the second and subsequent sheets P. Further, as in the other embodiments, it is possible to form corrugation on the plural sheets P.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In a sheet processing apparatus according to a sixth embodiment, the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> of the standby tray <b>10</b> is separated from the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> for a fixed time and corrugation is formed on the sheet P with the rib <b>73</b> connected to the pivoting roller shaft <b>65</b><i>a</i>, which rotatably supports the pivoting rollers <b>65</b>, via the bearing sections <b>67</b> of the pivoting roller shaft <b>65</b><i>a</i>.

If the plural sheets P are put on standby on the standby tray <b>10</b>, timing for turning on the pivoting solenoid <b>63</b> after the outlet sensor <b>60</b> detects the second and subsequent sheets P is timing before the leading end of the second sheet P passes on the standby tray rollers <b>66</b> or at an early stage after the leading end of the second sheet P passes the roller pairs of the pivoting rollers <b>65</b> and the standby tray rollers <b>66</b>.</p>
