<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to electronic product catalogs and, more specifically, to aggregating endorsement information from users and associating the endorsement information with products in the product catalog.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Computer networks, such as the Internet, enable transmission and reception of a vast array of information. In recent years, for example, some commercial retail stores have attempted to make product information available to customers over the Internet. It is becoming increasingly popular to provide mechanisms by which consumers can indicate how favorably or unfavorably they view each product. For example, users may click a radio button or other control on a website to indicate that they &#x201c;like&#x201d; or &#x201c;dislike&#x201d; a particular product displayed on the website. The website logs the &#x201c;likes&#x201d; and &#x201c;dislikes&#x201d; received for the particular product. The number and value of &#x201c;likes&#x201d; and &#x201c;dislikes&#x201d; are indications of user endorsement of the product.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, the &#x201c;likes&#x201d; and &#x201c;dislikes&#x201d; are logged for a particular product only on the particular website that collects this information. The &#x201c;likes&#x201d; and &#x201c;dislikes&#x201d; collected on a particular website are not available on other websites that display the same product. Additionally, &#x201c;likes&#x201d; and &#x201c;dislikes&#x201d; logged on one or multiple websites cannot be aggregated to provide an overall indication (or a factor of indication) of the users endorsement of the product. Furthermore, a particular product on a popular website may have received many &#x201c;likes&#x201d; and &#x201c;dislikes&#x201d;, but the same product on a different website may have received zero or very few &#x201c;likes&#x201d; and &#x201c;dislikes&#x201d;. The &#x201c;likes&#x201d; and &#x201c;dislikes&#x201d; for the product on the popular website cannot be attributed to the same product on the different website.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, it is desirable to make users endorsements obtained on one website available on other websites. Additionally, it is desirable to aggregate users endorsements from multiple websites into an overall indication of endorsement and to make that overall indication available on multiple websites. It is further desirable to determine an indication of endorsement for a manufacturer based on endorsements of products of the manufacturer. It is also desirable to determine endorsement trends of products and manufacturers over time and to predict product and/or product sector performance based on those trends. Furthermore, it is desirable to filter search results based on endorsements and to present advertisements based on endorsements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect, a computer-implemented method for aggregating endorsement information for a product includes receiving a multiple indications of endorsement for the product from a first electronic source associated with the product. Each indication of endorsement received from the first electronic source is associated with a social site. Multiple indications of endorsement for the product also are received from a second electronic source associated with the product. Each indication of endorsement received from the second electronic source is associated with a social site. The indications of endorsement from the first and second electronic sources are aggregated, and the aggregated indications of endorsement are communicated for presentation via a third electronic source.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect, a computer-implemented method for communicating endorsement information for a product includes receiving a plurality of indications of endorsement for the product. Each indication of endorsement is associated with a social site. Each indication of endorsement is obtained from a first electronic document associated with the product. Then, the indications of endorsement for the product are communicated for presentation via a second electronic document associated with the product.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These and other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated exemplary embodiments, which include the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently perceived.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The methods and systems described herein enable collection of endorsement information for a product displayed on a website. The collected endorsement information can then be made available on other websites that display the product. Additionally, the methods and systems described herein enable aggregation of endorsement information for a product, where the endorsement information is obtained from multiple websites on which the product is displayed. The aggregated information provides a more thorough indication of the endorsements of the product.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The system includes a product catalog system, which is implemented in hardware and/or software. The product catalog system receives information regarding products offered from multiple merchants. For simplicity, manufacturers, retailers, and others that sell products to customers may sometimes be referred to herein as &#x201c;merchants.&#x201d; Generally, the product information typically includes, for each product, a product title, a product description, pricing information, a product category, one or more images of the product, and a product identifier, such as a global trade item number (&#x201c;GTIN&#x201d;), universal product code (&#x201c;UPC&#x201d;), manufacturer's part number (&#x201c;MPN&#x201d;), international standard book number (&#x201c;ISBN&#x201d;), European article number (&#x201c;EAN&#x201d;), Japanese Article Number (&#x201c;JAN&#x201d;), and/or brand name and model number combination. As used throughout this specification, the term &#x201c;products&#x201d; should be interpreted to include tangible and intangible products and/or services.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An analysis module of the product catalog system can collect and analyze endorsement information for each product. In an exemplary embodiment, the collected information can be obtained from a particular website, such as a manufacturer's website. Then, the analysis module can provide the collected information to retailers for presentation with the corresponding product information on other websites associated with the retailers. The endorsement information can be provided directly to the retailers or can be converted into an endorsement rating that can be provided to the retailers. In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the collected information can be obtained from multiple websites and aggregated into an endorsement rating based on the information collected from the multiple websites. Then, the analysis module can provide the endorsement rating to merchants for presentation with the corresponding product information on websites displaying the product. The endorsement rating also can be used to filter search results by ranking and presenting products in order of highest endorsement rating or by limiting search results to a number of products based on the highest endorsement ratings or a threshold endorsement rating.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The analysis module also can determine an endorsement rating for a manufacturer based on endorsement ratings for products of the manufacturer. In this case, the analysis module aggregates the endorsement ratings for products of the manufacturer to create an endorsement rating for the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The analysis module also can determine an endorsement rating trend of a product over time or of a manufacturer over time. In this case, for a product, the analysis module collects endorsement information for the product at a first time and at a later time. Then, the analysis module compares the endorsement rating corresponding to the first time with the endorsement rating corresponding to the later time and determines the trend of the endorsement rating for the product. A similar analysis can be performed for a manufacturer, based on the trend of the endorsement rating for the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An advertisement module of the product catalog system can present advertisements based on endorsement ratings. Products and search results can be ranked based on their corresponding endorsement ratings. Then, the advertisement module retrieves advertisements for the products with the highest endorsement ratings. The retrieved advertisements can be presented with the search results.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The analysis module also can predict product sector performance based on endorsement ratings. In this case, an endorsement rating trend for a product is determined over a period of time. Based on this trend, the analysis module can determine whether a similar product produced by another manufacturer or another product in the same product sector would fare well in the same market. The analysis module also can consider endorsement ratings trends of manufacturers in this analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One or more aspects of the invention may comprise a computer program that embodies the functions described and illustrated herein, wherein the computer program is implemented in a computer system that comprises instructions stored in a machine-readable medium and a processor that executes the instructions. However, it should be apparent that there could be many different ways of implementing the invention in computer programming, and the invention should not be construed as limited to any one set of computer program instructions. Further, a skilled programmer would be able to write such a computer program to implement an embodiment of the disclosed invention based on the appended flow charts and associated description in the application text.

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">System Process</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block flow diagram depicting a method <b>200</b> for aggregating endorsement information of products according to an exemplary embodiment. The method <b>200</b> is described with reference to the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In block <b>205</b>, the product catalog system <b>151</b> maintains the product catalog <b>152</b>. The product catalog <b>152</b> includes a data structure, such as one or more databases and/or electronic records, that includes information regarding products from at least one merchant, such as the manufacturer <b>105</b>. For each product, the information typically includes at least a product identifier, such as a global trade item number (&#x201c;GTIN&#x201d;), an international standard book number (&#x201c;ISBN&#x201d;), a universal product code (&#x201c;UPC code&#x201d;), a European article number (&#x201c;EAN&#x201d;), a manufacturer part number (&#x201c;MPN&#x201d;), a Japanese article number (&#x201c;JAN&#x201d;), a brand name and model number combination, and/or another standardized or non-standardized identifier. The product information also can include, for each product, a product title, a product description, pricing information, a product category, one or more images of the product, and any other information associated with the product. As described hereinafter, the product information also can include endorsement information, comprising an endorsement rating.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Generally, the product identifiers uniquely identify their corresponding products. Information, other than the aforementioned product identifiers, that uniquely identifies a product also can be used as a product identifier. For example, a product identifier may be a string of alphanumeric characters and/or symbols that uniquely identify a product. In another example, a product identifier may be a product title, a product description, a trademark or service mark for a product or service, or a Uniform Resource Locator (&#x201c;URL&#x201d;) or other type of link to a product or associated with a product. In certain exemplary embodiments, the product identifier may include a portion of one of the aforementioned product identifiers only. For example, some product identifiers, such as UPCs, include information identifying a manufacturer and a product. In certain exemplary embodiments, the product identifier stored in the product catalog <b>152</b> includes the portion of the product identifier that identifies the product only or some other portion of the product identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In certain exemplary embodiments, a receipt module <b>154</b> of the product catalog system <b>151</b> receives information that is included in the product catalog <b>152</b> in electronic data feeds and/or hard copy provided by one or more merchants, such as manufacturer <b>105</b>, and/or another information source, such as the retailer <b>117</b>, social media source <b>118</b>, another specialized information aggregator, or an Internet web site. For example, each manufacturer <b>105</b> and/or other source may periodically provide batched or unbatched product data in an electronic feed or electronic storage media to the receipt module <b>154</b>. The receipt module <b>154</b> also may receive product information from scanned product documentation and/or catalogs. In certain exemplary embodiments, the receipt module <b>154</b> also may receive the product data from a screen-scraping mechanism, which is included in or associated with the product catalog system <b>151</b>. For example, the screen-scraping mechanism may capture product information from manufacturer, retailer, social media source, or other merchant and/or information provider websites.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In block <b>210</b>, the receipt module <b>154</b> or another module receives endorsement information for one or more products. That is, the receipt module <b>154</b> or another module receives endorsement information that is associated with a product. The endorsement information provides an indication of a user's recommendation or perceived value of the product. In certain exemplary embodiments, the endorsement information is an indication of a user's &#x201c;like&#x201d; or &#x201c;dislike&#x201d; of the product. For example, users may select a radio button or other control on a website to indicate that the users view the product favorably or unfavorably. The website or other information source logs the users' selections to count the total number of favorable or unfavorable indications.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The endorsement information is collected from social networking sites (&#x201c;social sites&#x201d;) or an extension thereof. Social sites function like an online community of Internet users. Social sites often group specific individuals or organizations together. While there are a number of social sites that focus on particular interests, there are others that do not. The websites without a main focus usually have open memberships. This means that anyone can become a member, regardless of his or her hobbies, beliefs, or views. Such sites may be not require a membership but may allow anyone to participate with registration.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In certain examples, websites, companies, or applications, such as Facebook, Google Plus 1, Buzz, YouTube, Twitter, or other suitable entity, log such endorsement information. Such entities may allow manufacturers, retailers, or other merchants to include the above-described controls on their websites, where the controls allow the entities to log the favorable and unfavorable selections of the controls. For instance, the controls may allow a user to &#x201c;like&#x201d; or &#x201c;dislike&#x201d; a product, select &#x201c;Plus 1&#x201d; to indicate a favorable view of the product, &#x201c;share&#x201d; a webpage (or product or other information on a webpage or other electronic document), or &#x201c;tweet&#x201d; a favorable or unfavorable view of the product. The controls log the users' selections and aggregate the count of each specific selection for the corresponding website.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In certain exemplary embodiments, the product catalog system <b>151</b> includes a web crawler that browses the Internet for endorsement information. For example, the receipt module <b>154</b> may receive the endorsement information from a screen-scraping mechanism, which is included in or associated with the product catalog system <b>151</b>. The screen-scraping mechanism may capture endorsement information from merchant and/or information provider web sites. For example, many merchants and consumer web sites include endorsement information submitted by consumers or published by product experts that have interacted with the product. The screen-scraping mechanism can seek out and capture this information.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In certain exemplary embodiments, the receipt module <b>154</b> receives the endorsement information via an electronic feed or electronic storage media provided by one or more merchants, one or more social media sources, and/or another source. An example of another source is an Internet web site having forums or message boards for consumers to provide endorsement information, which may provide batched or unbatched endorsement information in an electronic feed or electronic storage media to the receipt module <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In certain exemplary embodiments, the receipt module <b>154</b> may obtain the endorsement information directly from one or more social media sources <b>118</b>. Such social media sources <b>118</b> may provide the endorsement information in response to a request from the receipt module <b>154</b>. For example, the receipt module <b>154</b> may communicate a request to the social media source network device <b>118</b> to receive endorsement information associated with a product on a particular uniform resource locator (&#x201c;URL&#x201d;). In response, the social media source network device <b>118</b> returns the endorsement information collected at the specified URL.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Block <b>210</b> will be described in further detail hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Regardless of how the endorsement information is received, in block <b>215</b>, an analysis module <b>153</b> assigns an endorsement rating for each product based on the endorsement information for the corresponding product. Block <b>215</b> will be described in further detail hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Via block <b>220</b>, the method <b>200</b> repeats blocks <b>210</b> and <b>215</b> for each product in the product catalog <b>152</b> and thereby receives endorsement information, where available, for each product and assigns an endorsement rating for each product. After assigning an endorsement rating for each product, the method <b>200</b> proceeds to block <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In block <b>225</b>, the product catalog system <b>151</b> communicates the endorsement rating for presentation. Block <b>225</b> will be described in further detail hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block flow diagram depicting a method <b>210</b> for receiving endorsement information for a product according to an exemplary embodiment, as referenced in block <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The method <b>210</b> will be described with reference to the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In block <b>305</b>, the receipt module <b>154</b> receives endorsement information from a manufacturer or retailer that has collected the information from its website. As discussed previously, the manufacturer or retailer may provide this information in batched or unbatched form via an electronic feed or electronic storage media.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In block <b>310</b>, the receipt module <b>154</b> receives endorsement information from a social media source that has collected the information. As discussed previously, the social media source may provide this information in response to a request from the receipt module <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In block <b>315</b>, a web crawler of the product catalog system <b>151</b> searches websites and reads endorsement information presented on those websites.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In block <b>320</b>, the analysis module <b>153</b> correlates the endorsement information with a particular product in the product catalog <b>152</b>, based on matching identifiers associated with the endorsement information and with each particular product. For example, the analysis module <b>153</b> can read the endorsement information and extract an identifier of a product associated with the endorsement information. Then, the analysis module <b>153</b> can associate the endorsement information with a product in the product catalog <b>152</b> having the same identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an exemplary embodiment, the endorsement information includes the identifier of a product. For example, the identifier of the product is obtained from the website from which the endorsement information is obtained, and the identifier is included in the endorsement information. When the manufacturers or retailers provide batch information, the identifier can be included in the endorsement information for each product in the batch information.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In block <b>325</b>, the analysis module <b>153</b> stores the endorsement information with the corresponding product information for the product in the product catalog <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Blocks <b>305</b>-<b>325</b> can be repeated as desired to obtain endorsement information for multiple products or to obtain current endorsement information for products in the product catalog <b>152</b>. For example, blocks <b>305</b>-<b>325</b> may be repeated at periodic or random intervals. Additionally, blocks <b>305</b>-<b>315</b> may be performed simultaneously or independently, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">From block <b>325</b>, the method <b>210</b> proceeds to block <b>215</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block flow diagram depicting a method <b>215</b> for assigning an endorsement rating based on the endorsement information according to an exemplary embodiment, as referenced in block <b>215</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The method <b>215</b> will be described with reference to the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In block <b>405</b>, threshold values are established for endorsement ratings. In exemplary embodiments, a rating scale can be established and a minimum amount or value of endorsement information can be established for each step in the rating scale. For example, a rating scale of 0 to 5 can be established. Additionally, a minimum amount or value of endorsement information can be set for a rating at each step in the rating scale. For instance, a rating of five might require 100 &#x201c;likes&#x201d; or other favorable indications for the particular product, while a rating of three might require 50 &#x201c;likes&#x201d; or other favorable indications for the particular product. The rating scale and the minimum amount of endorsement information for each step in the scale is configurable to provide a desired rating.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In block <b>410</b>, the analysis module <b>153</b> aggregates all collected endorsement information for a particular product. In certain exemplary embodiments, the endorsement information may be from a single source, such as a single website. Alternatively, the endorsement information may be from multiple sources, such as from multiple websites. In an exemplary embodiment, the analysis module <b>153</b> adds each instance of endorsement information for the particular product to obtain a total of the endorsement information. For example, the analysis module <b>153</b> may add the number of &#x201c;likes&#x201d; or other favorable indications obtained from a manufacturer that makes the product to the number of &#x201c;likes&#x201d; or other favorable indications obtained from a retailer that sells the product to obtain a sum of the &#x201c;likes&#x201d; or other favorable indications for the product.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In certain exemplary embodiments, the analysis module <b>153</b> can aggregate endorsement information that includes different types of information. For example, a &#x201c;like&#x201d; from one source, a &#x201c;Plus 1&#x201d; from another source, a &#x201c;tweet&#x201d; from another source, a favorable &#x201c;rating&#x201d; from another source, a favorable indication from another source, and/or a &#x201c;buzz&#x201d; from another source can be added together to obtain a sum of &#x201c;6&#x201d; (1+1+1+1+1+1=6) as the aggregated endorsement information. Unfavorable indications also can be considered when aggregating the endorsement information. For example, a &#x201c;dislike&#x201d; from one source, a &#x201c;Plus 1&#x201d; from another source, a &#x201c;tweet&#x201d; from another source, an unfavorable &#x201c;rating&#x201d; from another source, a favorable indication from another source, and/or a &#x201c;buzz&#x201d; from another source can be added together to obtain a sum of &#x201c;2&#x201d; (&#x2212;1+1+1&#x2212;1+1+1=2) as the aggregated endorsement information.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an exemplary embodiment, endorsement information from one source can be weighted more than endorsement information from another source. For example, a more popular source may be given more weight than a less popular source when summing the endorsement information from each source.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In block <b>415</b>, the analysis module <b>153</b> converts the aggregated endorsement information into a common value corresponding to the threshold values, if necessary. In this manner, the information can be normalized with the threshold values.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In block <b>420</b>, the analysis module <b>153</b> determines the endorsement rating for the product based on the aggregated endorsement information relative to the threshold values for the rating scale. In an exemplary embodiment, the analysis module <b>153</b> compares the aggregated endorsement information to the threshold values and determines the endorsement rating based on the particular threshold value exceeded by the aggregated endorsement information.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, as discussed previously, a rating scale of 0 to 5 can be used, and a minimum amount or value of endorsement information can be required for a rating at each step in the rating scale. For instance, a rating of five might require 100 &#x201c;likes&#x201d; or other favorable indications for the particular product, while a rating of three might require 50 &#x201c;likes&#x201d; or other favorable indications for the particular product.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Alternatively, the aggregated endorsement information can be compared across related products to determine the endorsement rating for the particular product. In this case, the threshold values for each step in the rating can be based on a particular product's percentage of the total amount of endorsement information for all related products. For example, related products might include a 23 inch TV with an aggregated amount of endorsement information of 10, a 32 inch TV with an aggregated amount of endorsement information of 15, a 40 inch TV with an aggregated amount of endorsement information of 50, and a 50 inch TV with an aggregated amount of endorsement information of 100, all made by the same manufacturer. The aggregated amount of endorsement information for all products is (10+15+50+100) 175. The 50 inch TV is 57% (100/175) of the aggregated amount of endorsement information for all of the related products. If the threshold for an endorsement rating of 5 is 50%, then the 50 inch TV is assigned an endorsement rating of 5. The endorsement ratings of the 23, 32, and 40 inch TVs are assigned similarly, based on the threshold values established for each step in the rating.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In certain exemplary embodiments, the endorsement rating is an indication of how much users &#x201c;like&#x201d; a product. Accordingly, the endorsement rating may be referred to as a &#x201c;likeness factor&#x201d; or a &#x201c;like rank.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In block <b>425</b>, the analysis module <b>153</b> stores the endorsement rating for the product with the product information for the product in the product catalog <b>152</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In block <b>505</b>, the product catalog system <b>151</b> receives a search query for product information. In block <b>510</b>, the product catalog system <b>151</b> retrieves search results for the search query from the product catalog <b>152</b>. For example, the product catalog system <b>151</b> can search the product catalog <b>152</b> to identify products that match at least one component of the search query.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In block <b>515</b>, the product catalog system <b>151</b> retrieves the endorsement ratings corresponding to the search results. For example, for each product in the search results, the product catalog system <b>151</b> retrieves the endorsement rating stored with the product information for the product in block <b>425</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In block <b>520</b>, the analysis module <b>153</b> filters the search results based on the endorsement rating for each product in the search results. For example, if the search results include ten products, the analysis module <b>153</b> may limit the search results to the five products having the five highest endorsement ratings. Alternatively and/or additionally, the analysis module <b>153</b> may present products in the search results in rank order based on the endorsement ratings.</p>
