<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An extendable folding bed frame includes a pair of first sub-frames having a pair of spaced apart and extendable longitudinal bars, each longitudinal bar having a first end and a second end. The opposing longitudinal bars are fixedly connected together by a plurality of lateral support bars. The pair of first sub-frames are pivotally connected together at corresponding longitudinal bar first ends by first pivotal connecting members. The pair of first sub-frames are pivotable from an open configuration whereby each first sub-frame is aligned longitudinally to form a generally rectangular co-planar support surface and a folded configuration whereby each first sub-frame is substantially overlapped and adjacent to each other. The folding bed frame also includes a connecting bracket for attaching additional bed frames to provide a larger mattress support surface.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to foldable bed frames, and more particularly to an extendable folding bed frame capable of expanding and/or attaching with other foldable bed frames for providing larger surface areas to accommodate mattresses of different sizes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Beds are traditionally a large piece of furniture used as a place to sleep and relax. Most modern beds consist of a mattress on a bed frame, with the mattress resting either on a solid base, often wooden slats, or a sprung base or box spring&#x2014;a large-mattress sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. For beds with box springs, standard collapsible rectangular metal bed frames are often used.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some people, especially in Europe, Australia and Japan, prefer to dispense the box spring and bed frame, and replace it with a traditional platform bed style&#x2014;a raised, level, usually rectangular horizontal solid frame, often with a section consisting of rows of flexible wooden slats or latticed structure meant to support just a mattress. This platform provides adequate, flexible support and ventilation for a mattress by itself, eliminating the need for a box-spring or a second mattress as a foundation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With either type of traditional bed, however, there are unavoidable disadvantages. For example, traditional beds are not capable of easy assembly and disassembly because of the various components associated with the bed frame. Also, the bed frame, mattress and box spring of the traditional bed are heavy and thus not easily transportable. Furthermore, the traditional bed cannot be stored easily because the length of the bed frame as well as the mattress and box spring is often fixed and cannot be retracted or folded. Moreover, traditional beds are relatively expensive. Finally, for a retailer, traditional beds are almost impossible to sell off of store shelves because of size constraints.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For at least these reasons, alternative sleep solutions have been developed over the years. One of those solutions is a foldable bed frame capable of being folded at least in half. Foldable bed frames are manufactured and sold in different variations and designs. However, the common thread between foldable bed frames is that, for example, they are cost effective; light-weight; easily storable and transportable; and capable of being sold by retailers directly to the consumer from store shelves due to its light weight and relatively compact size.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Mattresses used with foldable bed frames vary in price and size as well. Even though traditional spring mattresses could be used with foldable bed frames, other mattresses that are light-weight and capable of easy storage and transport could also be used. For example, inflatable air mattresses, foldable spring mattresses and foldable foam mattresses are available at reasonable cost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Despite these features, foldable bed frames in the prior art can only accommodate mattresses which are sized specifically for the particular foldable bed frame the mattress is used with. Thus, it is almost impossible to have a foldable bed frame or an assembly of foldable bed frames that is capable of accommodating various mattress sizes. Furthermore, for larger foldable bed frames, storage and transport is difficult even when folded because they are still quite bulky due to the fixed width of the bed frame.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, an extendable folding bed frame capable of accommodating different size mattresses while still being light-weight and capable of being compactly stored and transported is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is intended to overcome at least the above-described disadvantages and to provide further improvements to foldable bed frames in the prior art. The objects and advantages of the present invention, more specifically, are to provide an extendable folding bed frame for expanding and/or attaching with other foldable bed frames to provide larger surface areas to accommodate mattresses of different sizes while still being light-weight and capable of being compactly stored and transported.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following presents a simplified summary of some embodiments of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some embodiments of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For achieving the above-mentioned objects, the present invention generally provides an extendable folding bed frame comprising a pair of first sub-frames. Each first sub-frame comprises a pair of spaced apart longitudinal bars, each longitudinal bar having a first end and a second end. The opposing longitudinal bars are fixedly connected together by a plurality of lateral support bars. The pair of first sub-frames are pivotally connected together at corresponding longitudinal bar first ends by first pivotal connecting members. A first leg assembly is fixedly attached to the first sub-frames proximate the first pivotal connecting member. The foldable bed frame also includes a pair of second leg assemblies. Each second leg assembly is pivotally attached to each first sub-frame. The pair of first sub-frames are pivotable from an open configuration whereby each first sub-frame is aligned longitudinally to form a generally rectangular co-planar support surface and a folded configuration whereby each first sub-frame is substantially overlapped and adjacent to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the foldable bed frame comprises a second sub-frame comprising a pair of spaced apart lateral extension bars, each lateral extension bar having a first end and a second end. The first ends of each lateral extension bar are pivotally connected to a longitudinal bar of one of the first sub-frames by a second pivotal connecting member. The second ends of each lateral extension bar have a first connecting bracket fixedly attached thereto. In a retracted configuration the second sub-frame is disposed within and substantially co-planar with the one of the first sub-frames. In an extended configuration the second sub-frame is pivotally extended adjacent to and substantially co-planar with the first sub-frame and engaged with an adjacent structure to form an expanded support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the longitudinal bars of at least one first sub-frame of the foldable bed frame are extendable to form an expanded support surface. Illustratively, the longitudinal bars of at least one first sub-frame are extendable with respect to the first pivotal connecting members along a longitudinal axis of the at least one first sub-frame.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another aspect of the present invention includes a second connecting bracket including a base having a plurality of opposing outer walls extending upwardly from opposing edges of the base and at least one inner wall extending upwardly from an inner portion of the base substantially parallel to the outer walls such that a plurality of engaging spaces are formed between the walls. Each engaging space corresponds to a predetermined mattress size. In the open configuration of the bed frame one of the plurality of engaging spaces is engaged with one of the first sub-frames and another one of the plurality of engaging spaces is engaged with an adjacent structure to form a larger mattress engaging surface.</p>

The foldable bed frame <b>100</b> includes a pair of first sub-frames <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. Each first sub-frame <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> includes a pair of spaced apart longitudinal bars <b>110</b> in parallel arrangement. Each longitudinal bar <b>110</b> has a first end <b>2</b> and a second end <b>4</b>, and the opposing longitudinal bars <b>110</b> are fixedly connected together by lateral support bars <b>108</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>108</b><sub>2 </sub>at opposing longitudinal bar first ends <b>2</b> and at opposing longitudinal bar second ends <b>4</b>, respectively. In the preferred embodiment, the inner lateral support bar <b>108</b><sub>1 </sub>is welded onto opposition longitudinal bars <b>110</b> but the outer lateral support bar <b>108</b><sub>2 </sub>is integral with the longitudinal bars <b>110</b> in that the outer lateral support bar <b>108</b><sub>2 </sub>is formed by bending an elongated hollow steel bar into two right angles. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that separate components could be welded or fastened together to form the second end <b>4</b> of the first sub-frame <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the preferred embodiment, one of the first sub-frames <b>102</b> includes two spaced apart auxiliary lateral support bars <b>106</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>106</b><sub>2 </sub>fixedly attached, preferably by welding, to a bottom portion of opposing longitudinal support bars <b>110</b>. Three spaced apart auxiliary longitudinal support bars <b>111</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>111</b><sub>2 </sub>and <b>111</b><sub>3 </sub>are fixedly attached, preferably by welding, onto top surfaces of the auxiliary lateral support bars <b>106</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>106</b><sub>2 </sub>such that the top surfaces of auxiliary longitudinal support bars <b>111</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>111</b><sub>2 </sub>and <b>111</b><sub>3 </sub>are co-planar with the longitudinal support bars <b>110</b> and the lateral support bars <b>108</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>108</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the preferred embodiment, the other first sub-frame <b>104</b> includes an auxiliary lateral support bar <b>106</b><sub>4 </sub>fixedly attached, preferably by welding, to inner side portions of opposing longitudinal support bars <b>110</b>. An auxiliary longitudinal support bar <b>111</b><sub>4 </sub>is fixedly attached to an inner side portion of the inner later support bar <b>108</b><sub>1 </sub>on one end and an inner side portion of the auxiliary lateral support bar <b>106</b><sub>4 </sub>on another end, preferably by welding, such that the top surfaces of the top surfaces of the auxiliary longitudinal support bar <b>111</b><sub>4 </sub>and the auxiliary lateral support bar <b>106</b><sub>4 </sub>are co-planar with the longitudinal support bars <b>110</b> and lateral support bars <b>108</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>108</b><sub>2</sub>. The first sub-frame <b>104</b> further includes a plurality of spaced apart auxiliary lateral support bars <b>106</b><sub>3 </sub>constructed of thin yet durable tubular metal that are welded onto opposing longitudinal support bars <b>110</b> and the auxiliary longitudinal support bar <b>111</b><sub>4</sub>. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other materials and shapes could be used for the lateral support bars <b>106</b><sub>3</sub>, and the number of longitudinal supports as well as lateral supports for each first sub-frame <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> could vary so long as a secure engaging surface is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the pair of first sub-frames <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are pivotally connected together at corresponding first ends of the longitudinal bars <b>2</b> by first pivotal connecting members <b>128</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the first pivotal connecting member <b>128</b> is substantially U-shaped with an open interface <b>144</b> for which each corresponding longitudinal support member first end <b>2</b> is disposed within and pivotally attached to the first pivotal connecting member <b>128</b> with a fastener <b>130</b> such as a screw, rivet or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a first leg assembly <b>114</b> is fixedly attached to a lower portion of the first pivotal connecting member <b>128</b>, preferably by welding. The first pivotal connecting member <b>128</b> could also be constructed of two opposing plates and the first leg assembly <b>114</b> fixedly connected to bottom edges of each opposing plate. In the preferred embodiment, the first leg assembly <b>114</b> includes a lateral leg support member <b>124</b> fixedly attached to the upright members of the first leg assembly <b>114</b>, preferably by welding, to provide additional stability to the mid portion of the bed frame <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the bed frame <b>100</b> includes a pair of second leg assemblies <b>112</b> to provide peripheral support to the bed frame <b>100</b>. In the preferred embodiment, each second leg assembly <b>112</b> also includes a lateral leg support member <b>124</b> fixedly attached to the upright members of the second leg assembly <b>112</b>, preferably by welding, to provide additional stability to the ends of the bed frame <b>100</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the second leg assemblies <b>112</b> are pivotally connected to bottom portions of the outer auxiliary lateral support bars <b>106</b><sub>2 </sub>and <b>106</b><sub>4 </sub>but the second leg assemblies <b>112</b> could also be connected to other portions of the first sub-frame <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> such as inner portions of the longitudinal support bars <b>110</b> or to other lateral support bars on the first sub-frame <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. Each second leg assembly <b>112</b> is further secured to each first sub-frame with a support brace <b>126</b> which is pivotally connected to the lateral leg support member <b>124</b> on one end with a fastener <b>146</b> such as a screw or rivet, and detachably connected to the outermost lateral support bar <b>108</b><sub>2 </sub>with a fastener <b>148</b> such as a screw on another end. When the bed frame <b>100</b> is in an open configuration, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the support brace <b>126</b> is fixedly connected to the outer lateral support bar <b>108</b><sub>2 </sub>via the fastener <b>148</b> and when the bed frame <b>100</b> is folded, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the fastener <b>148</b> is disengaged and the support brace <b>126</b> pivoted to a position parallel to the second leg assembly <b>112</b>. In the alternative, each second leg assembly <b>112</b> could be attached to each first sub-frame <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> by other means such as a sliding brace that is pivotably and lockably engaged with the longitudinal bars <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the pair of first sub-frames <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are pivotable from an open configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> whereby each first sub-frame <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> is aligned longitudinally to form a generally rectangular co-planar support surface. In the folded configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each first sub-frame <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> is substantially overlapped and adjacent to each other in a compact state for easy storage and transport.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, the foldable bed frame <b>100</b>, and more specifically, one of the first sub-frames <b>102</b>, includes a second sub-frame <b>134</b>. The second sub-frame <b>134</b> includes a pair of spaced apart lateral extension bars <b>12</b> in parallel arrangement. Each lateral extension bar <b>12</b> includes a first end <b>14</b> and a second end <b>16</b>. The opposing lateral extension bars <b>12</b> are fixedly connected together by two longitudinal extension bars <b>20</b>, preferably by welding, but other attachment methods could be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Also, even though two longitudinal extension bars are used in the preferred embodiment, the number of longitudinal extension bars could vary depending on preference. The lateral extension bars <b>12</b> and the longitudinal extension bars <b>20</b> are configured such that when the bed frame <b>100</b> is opened the top surfaces are substantially co-planar for an even mattress engaging surface. The top surfaces of the lateral extension bars <b>12</b> and the longitudinal extension bars <b>20</b> are also substantially co-planar with the top surfaces of the longitudinal support bars <b>110</b> and auxiliary longitudinal support bars <b>111</b><sub>1-3 </sub>when the second sub-frame <b>134</b> is fully extended.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, the first end of each lateral extension bar <b>14</b> is pivotally connected to a longitudinal bar of one of the first sub-frames <b>110</b> by a second pivotal connecting member <b>132</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second pivotal connecting member <b>132</b> includes a substantially U-shaped member for securing to longitudinal support bars <b>110</b> of corresponding first sub-frames <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> when the second sub-frame <b>134</b> is in the extended configuration. The U-shaped member is sized such that the inner width is substantially similar to the width of the longitudinal support bar <b>110</b> such that when engaged in the open configuration of the bed frame <b>100</b> the U-shaped member fits onto the longitudinal support bar <b>110</b>. One with ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the shape and size of the U-shaped member of the second pivotal connecting member <b>132</b> could vary to accommodate other types of frames.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, the second end of each lateral extension bar <b>16</b> includes a first connecting bracket <b>120</b> fixedly attached thereto, preferably by welding. In the preferred embodiment, the first connecting brackets <b>120</b> of the second sub-frame <b>134</b> are substantially U-shaped and sized such that the inner width of the first connecting bracket <b>120</b> is substantially similar to the width of the longitudinal support bars <b>110</b>. One with ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the shape and size of the first connecting bracket <b>120</b> could vary to accommodate other structures that the second sub-frame <b>134</b> would connect to.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, and in particular to one of the first sub-frames <b>102</b>, in a retracted configuration the longitudinal extension bars <b>20</b> are disposed on a top surface of the auxiliary lateral support bars <b>106</b><sub>1-2 </sub>and between the auxiliary longitudinal support bars <b>111</b><sub>1-3 </sub>such that the second sub-frame <b>134</b> is disposed within the first sub-frame <b>102</b> and the top surfaces of the first and second sub-frames <b>102</b>, <b>134</b> are substantially co-planar. The co-planar relationship between the first and second sub-frames <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>134</b> provides a substantially flat mattress engaging surface throughout the length of the bed frame <b>100</b> when used as a single bed frame for a smaller size mattress or when used side-by-side, as described in more detail below, for an intermediate size mattress. Moreover, the co-planar relationship provides a compact arrangement when the bed frame <b>100</b> is folded as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In an embodiment, each foldable bed frame <b>100</b> while in an open configuration with the second sub-frame <b>134</b> retracted, as illustratively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is preferably 19.5 inches wide and 75 inches long.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in an extended configuration the second sub-frame <b>134</b> is pivotally extended and the first connecting brackets <b>120</b> of the second sub-frame <b>134</b> of one foldable bed frame <b>100</b><sub>1 </sub>or <b>100</b><sub>2 </sub>is engaged with the longitudinal support bar <b>110</b> of an adjacent foldable bed frame <b>100</b><sub>2 </sub>or <b>100</b><sub>1 </sub>to form an expanded mattress support surface. The top surfaces of the first and second sub-frames <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>134</b> are adjacent to and substantially co-planar with each other to form a substantially flat mattress engaging surface for larger mattresses. In the preferred embodiment, the second sub-frame provides an additional 15 inches laterally to form a full size bed frame (54&#x2033;&#xd7;75&#x2033;).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 10</figref>, in another embodiment of the present invention, two or more foldable bed frames <b>100</b> could be connected directly to each other in a side-by-side arrangement with a second connecting bracket <b>118</b> without extending the second sub-frames <b>134</b> to form a support surface for a mattress of an intermediate size. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the second connecting bracket <b>118</b> includes a base <b>30</b> having a plurality of opposing outer walls <b>32</b> extending upwardly from opposing edges of the base <b>30</b>. The second connecting bracket <b>118</b> is constructed of a hard metal such as steel to provide strength and durability but other strong and durable materials such as a hard plastic could be used. At least one inner wall <b>34</b> extends upwardly from an inner portion of the base <b>30</b> substantially parallel to the outer walls <b>32</b> such that a plurality of engaging spaces <b>36</b> are formed between the walls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. A plurality of openings <b>33</b> are formed by virtue of the manufacturing process as the material from the base <b>30</b> is punched and bent at right angles to form the inner walls <b>34</b>. The width <b>38</b> of each engaging space <b>36</b> is substantially similar to the width of the longitudinal support bars <b>110</b> such that when engaged, the second connecting bracket <b>118</b> is sufficiently snug with the longitudinal support bars <b>110</b> to prevent movement of the adjacent bed frames <b>100</b><sub>1-2</sub>. A small gap <b>35</b> is formed between the inner walls <b>34</b> to provide tolerance for any lateral movement of the inner walls <b>34</b> if the longitudinal support bars <b>110</b> are wider than the engaging spaces <b>36</b>. In the preferred embodiment, attaching the two bed frames sides-by-side with the second connecting bracket <b>118</b> forms a bed frame with dimensions substantially similar to a twin size mattress (39&#x2033;&#xd7;75&#x2033;).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The preferred embodiments are geared toward the U.S. market and thus the dimensions of the foldable bed frame <b>100</b>, including the second sub-frame <b>134</b> are as such. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the dimensions of the foldable bed frame <b>100</b> as well as the second connecting bracket <b>118</b> could be customized or varied depending on the target market.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>, a foldable bed frame of a second embodiment <b>200</b> (sometimes referred to as <b>200</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>200</b><sub>2</sub>, <b>200</b><sub>3 </sub>and <b>200</b><sub>4</sub>) of the present invention is shown. The foldable bed frame <b>200</b> includes a pair of first sub-frames <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>.
