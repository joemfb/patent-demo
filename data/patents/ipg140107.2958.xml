<p id="p-0005" num="0003">As an alcohol synthesis method, an alkyl addition reaction is known in which a carbonyl compound such as an aldehyde compound and a ketone compound is reacted with an organometal nucleophilic agent.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Many of biologically active substances are optically active substances having an asymmetric carbon atom. It is therefore important to obtain an optically active substance that has a desired absolute configuration. For example, optically active substances can be obtained in such a manner that a racemic mixture is synthesized, and then an optically active substance is isolated by optical resolution etc. However, this method requires a chemical alteration and thus is inefficient. For this reason, asymmetric synthesis methods by which optically active substances can be obtained selectively have long been under development. For example, the following methods are known as the method for obtaining optically active alcohols by reaction of a carbonyl compound with an organometal nucleophilic agent.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0019">An optically active alcohol is an important compound as a synthetic intermediate for drugs and the like. Hence, a method of synthesizing an optically active alcohol by an alkyl addition reaction in which a carbonyl compound is reacted with an organometal nucleophilic agent has been required.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020">Particularly, the synthesis of a tertiary alcohol is limited to alkyl addition reaction of a ketone using an organometal nucleophilic agent. Additionally, the alkyl addition reaction is accompanied by side reactions, as described below, such as a reduction reaction and an aldol reaction. It is thus difficult to obtain only the desired tertiary alcohol in sufficient yield. Moreover, the enantioselective production of an optically active tertiary alcohol using an asymmetric catalyst is considered extremely difficult.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0109">There are differences between ketone and aldehyde when each of them is used in an alcohol synthesis using an organozinc compound. The differences are as follows. First, a ketone has a lower reactivity rather than an aldehyde due to three-dimensional and electronic factors. Secondary, the alcohol synthesis reaction itself is often difficult to advance due to low reactivity of an organozinc compound, and the reaction is sometimes accompanied by side reactions. Third, the enantioface discrimination of a ketone by a chiral catalyst is usually more difficult than the enantioface discrimination of an aldehyde. The conventional asymmetric alkyl addition reaction using a catalyst was therefore limited to the synthesis of an optically active secondary alcohol using an aldehyde. However, the method for producing an optically active alcohol of the present invention can be applied to the production of an optically active tertiary alcohol using a ketone compound, as well as the synthesis of an optically active secondary alcohol using an aldehyde compound. In particular, according to the alkyl addition reaction of a ketone in the present invention, an enantioselective optically active tertiary alcohol, which is conventionally difficult to synthesize, can be synthesized with a higher efficiency and high enantioselectivity than before. In the following, &#x201c;optically active alcohol&#x201d; refers to &#x201c;optically active tertiary alcohol&#x201d; when the starting material is a ketone compound, and when the starting material is an aldehyde compound, it refers to &#x201c;optically active secondary alcohol&#x201d;.</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0122">The amount and proportion of each component to be used are not particularly limited in the method for producing an optically active alcohol of the present invention. For example, the amount of the organozinc compound represented by the general formula (11) can usually be in the range from 1 to 5 equivalents, preferably 1 to 4 equivalents, and more preferably 1 to 3 equivalents, based on the above-mentioned carbonyl compound such as a ketone compound and an aldehyde compound. Similarly, the amount of the organozinc compound represented by the general formula (12) can usually be in the range from 1 to 3 equivalents, preferably 1 to 2 equivalents, and more preferably 1 to 1.5 equivalents. In addition, the amount of the organozinc compound represented by the general formula (13) can usually be in the range from 1 to 4 equivalents, preferably 1 to 3 equivalents, and more preferably 1 to 2.5 equivalents. Further, the equivalent ratio of the organozinc compound represented by the general formula (12) to the organozinc compound represented by the general formula (13) can usually be 1:(1 to 5), preferably 1:(1 to 4), more preferably 1:(1 to 3), and further preferably 1: (1 to 2).</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0124">The reaction conditions of the method for producing an optically active alcohol of the present invention are not particularly limited. The reaction time is usually in the range from 6 to 48 hours, preferably from 12 to 36 hours, more preferably from 18 to 24 hours. The reaction temperature is usually in the range from 0&#xb0; C. to 70&#xb0; C., preferably from 10&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C., more preferably from 15&#xb0; C. to 40&#xb0; C., and further preferably from 20&#xb0; C. to 30&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0125">The production of an optically active alcohol of the present invention may be performed in the presence or absence of a solvent. The method is preferably performed in the absence of a solvent because an optically active alcohol can be obtained with a high yield. Moreover, this method is preferably performed in the presence of a solvent because a solid carbonyl compound such as a solid ketone compound, and the like can be used as a starting material. Examples of the solvent include hexane, heptane and toluene. The solvent may be used singly or in combination of two or more types thereof. The solvent may further contain an alcohol such as methanol and ethanol for the improvement of the yield.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0126">A titanium additive such as Ti(Oi-Pr)<sub>4 </sub>is not necessarily used as a reaction accelerator in the method for an optically active alcohol of the present invention. Conventionally, an equimolar or excess amount of the titanium additive was used as a reaction accelerator. However, such a titanium additive is not easy to handle because of strong moisture-absorption resolvability. Since the titanium additive is not necessarily used in the present invention, the production of an optically active alcohol can be readily performed. Of course, such a titanium additive may be used in the present invention. However, the amount of the titanium additive used can be 2 equivalents or less, preferably 1 equivalent or less, more preferably 0.5 equivalent or less, further preferably 0.3 equivalent or less, and particularly 0.1 equivalent or less.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0127">An alkyne can be further mixed in the method for the production of an optically active alcohol of the present invention. When an alkyne is mixed, an alkynyl group derived from the alkyne can be added to the above-mentioned carbonyl compound such as an aldehyde and a ketone. This is presumably because an alkynyl zinc generated by reaction of the added organozinc compound with the above-mentioned alkyne is coordinated to the ligand of the present invention, forming a complex, followed by reaction of the complex with the above-mentioned carbonyl compound (note that this consideration is the inventor's presumption; therefore, this conclusion is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention). That is, the organic group in the organozinc compound may be the same as or different from the organic group added to the above-mentioned carbonyl compound in the method for the production of an optically active alcohol of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0128">The type and structure of the optically active alcohol obtained by the present invention are not particularly limited. Not only an asymmetric alkylation reaction but also an asymmetric phenylation reaction is possible in the method for the production of an optically active alcohol of the present invention. Moreover, various organozinc compounds can be used in the method for the production of an optically active alcohol of the present invention. As a result, various kinds of optically active alcohols having various structures can be produced.</p>

<p id="p-0159" num="0164">It is found from the spectrum data of the phosphoramide compound (L1) and the generation of one equivalent of ethane gas, that the phosphoramide compound (L1) and diethylzinc form a zinc complex.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0165">Moreover, this result suggests that the zinc complex is presumably one represented by the general formula (C1) formed by the following scheme (note that this consideration is the inventor's presumption; therefore, this conclusion is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention).</p>

<p id="p-0162" num="0167">Although optically active tertiary alcohols were conventionally difficult to synthesize, they can be synthesized with a high efficiency and high enantioselectivity by using the phosphoramide compounds (L1) and (L2). In addition, optically active tertiary alcohols can be synthesized with a high efficiency and high enantioselectivity, without the addition of conventionally used reactants such as titanium additives.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0168">Comparing the phosphoramide compounds (L1) and (L2), the yield as well as the enantiomeric excess is higher when the phosphoramide compound (L2) is used. Accordingly, optically active tertiary alcohols can be synthesized with a high efficiency and high enantioselectivity by using the phosphoramide compound (L2).</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0169">Additionally, various phosphoramide compounds of the present invention were synthesized, and the alkyl addition reaction of a ketone was performed using these phosphoramide compounds as a ligand. As a result, tertiary alcohols were synthesized with a high enantioselectivity using any of these ligands.</p>

<p id="p-0167" num="0172">50 ml of methylene chloride was added to a reaction vessel containing 3.35 g (20 mmol) of an amino acid hydrochloride (1) under a nitrogen atmosphere. 4.44 g (22 mmol) of triethylamine was then added, and the reaction vessel was cooled to 0&#xb0; C. After cooling, 5.20 g (22 mmol) of diphenylphosphinic acid chloride was added dropwise over 5 minutes. After dropping, the mixture was stirred at 0&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, warmed to room temperature, and further stirred for 3 hours. The completion of the reaction was confirmed by a TLC, and the mixture was cooled to 0&#xb0; C. 20 ml of water was added and then the mixture was warmed to room temperature. Extraction from the mixture was performed twice using 30 ml of chloroform. The extracted organic layer was washed with 20 ml of a saturated sodium chloride aqueous solution, and was dried with magnesium sulfate. The filtration was performed using &#x201c;Celite&#x201d; (trade name), and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The obtained concentrated liquid was purified by passing through silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate=(3/1) to (1/1)), and thus phosphoramide (2) was obtained.

Then, 1.0 mmol of benzaldehyde was added to the reaction solution and stirred at 0&#xb0; C. for 24 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0179">The completion of the reaction was confirmed by a TLC. After confirmation, 10 ml of a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution was added and warmed to room temperature. Extraction from the mixture was performed twice using 15 ml of diethyl ether. The extracted organic layer was washed with 10 ml of a saturated sodium chloride aqueous solution, and dried with magnesium sulfate. Then, the filtration was performed using &#x201c;Celite&#x201d; (trade name), and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0180">The obtained concentrated liquid was purified by passing through silica gel column chromatography (pentane/diethyl ether=(10/1) to (2/1)), and thus an optically active secondary alcohol was obtained. The structure of the synthesized optically active secondary alcohol, the reaction time, yield, and enantiomeric excess are indicated together with the structure of each of the above ligands.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0181">Optically active secondary alcohols can be synthesized from an aldehyde compound by using the phosphoramide compound (L1) and the ligands (L3) to (L12). Moreover, optically active secondary alcohols can be synthesized with a high efficiency and high enantioselectivity, without the addition of conventionally used reactants such as titanium additives. The phosphoramide compound (L1) is effective in synthesis of both optically active secondary alcohols and optically active tertiary alcohols.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0182">When the ligands (L3) to (L7) (ester) are used, higher yield and higher enantioselectivity are provided rather than when the ligand (L8) (carboxylic acid) and ligand (L9) (alcohol) are used. Moreover, when the ligands (L3) to (L6) are used, higher enantioselectivity is provided rather than when the ligand (L7) is used. Furthermore, when the ligand (L6) is used, higher yield is provided rather than when the ligand (L3) is used.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0183">The ligand (L11) in which amide is reduced ensures higher enantioselectivity rather than the ligand (L10) having an amide structure. Moreover, the tertiary amine (L12) is superior to the secondary amine (L10) in both the yield and enantioselectivity.</p>
<heading id="h-0034" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0179" num="0184">The present invention is useful for synthesizing an optically active alcohol from a carbonyl compound such as an aldehyde compound and ketone compound, particularly a ketone compound, with a high efficiency and high enantioselectivity. The optically active alcohol synthesized by the present invention is useful as drugs and pesticides, or synthetic intermediates thereof. For example, drugs (e.g., clemastine that is often used as an antihistamine) can be synthesized without an optical resolution process, which was essential in the past, by using the optically active alcohols synthesized by the present invention.</p>
