<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A stopword detection component detects stopwords (also stop-phrases) in search queries input to keyword-based information retrieval systems. Potential stopwords are initially identified by comparing the terms in the search query to a list of known stopwords. Context data is then retrieved based on the search query and the identified stopwords. In one implementation, the context data includes documents retrieved from a document index. In another implementation, the context data includes categories relevant to the search query. Sets of retrieved context data are compared to one another to determine if they are substantially similar. If the sets of context data are substantially similar, this fact may be used to infer that the removal of the potential stopword(s) is not material to the search. If the sets of context data are not substantially similar, the potential stopword can be considered material to the search and should not be removed from the query.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the present invention relate generally to information retrieval and, more particularly, to techniques for locating stopwords/stop-phrases.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">B. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Information retrieval systems (e.g., search engines) that use keyword-based queries typically ignore words (&#x201c;stopwords&#x201d;) or groups of words (&#x201c;stop-phrases&#x201d;) that occur very commonly and are usually unconnected to the information being sought. Typically, stopwords or stop-phrases appear in queries because users phrase their queries, even for keyword-based systems, as if they are intended for a human reader. For example, the word &#x201c;a&#x201d; in the query &#x201c;a London hotel&#x201d; is a stopword and the phrase &#x201c;show me&#x201d; in the query &#x201c;show me London hotels&#x201d; is a stop-phrase. Both &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;show me&#x201d; are meaningless for the user's intent to find information about hotels in London.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Sometimes, however, stopwords and stop-phrases can be meaningful in a query. A search query &#x201c;the matrix&#x201d; is typically intended to find information relating to the movie &#x201c;The Matrix,&#x201d; and not the mathematical concept of matrices. Similarly, the phrase &#x201c;show me&#x201d; in the context of the search queries &#x201c;show me the money,&#x201d; &#x201c;show me the way lyrics,&#x201d; or &#x201c;show me state&#x201d; all contain meaningful uses of the term &#x201c;show me.&#x201d; The query &#x201c;show me the way lyrics,&#x201d; for instance, is probably a request for lyrics to a song titled &#x201c;Show Me the Way,&#x201d; such as the like titled songs by the musician Peter Frampton or the musical group Styx.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One technique for handling stopwords and stop-phrases uses a list of known stopwords and stop-phrases. Stopwords or stop-phrases that are on the list are stripped from search queries before giving the search query to the search engine. This simple technique can, however, potentially ignore meaningful stopwords and stop-phrases. One solution to this problem is to build a known list of exceptional phrases when looking for stopwords. Stopword policy may then be to not ignore stopwords or stop-phrases when the other terms from the phrase are present in a query. For example, such a list could include &#x201c;the matrix&#x201d; or &#x201c;show me the money.&#x201d; This approach can also be problematic, however, as it can be difficult to identify phrases in which stopwords are meaningful and to maintain an up-to-date list of such stopwords and stop-phrases.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, it would be desirable to more effectively determine when a stopword or stop-phrase is present in a query.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the invention is directed to a method of detecting stopwords in a query. The method includes identifying a potential stopword in the query based on a comparison to a list of stopwords and generating sets of context data based on the query and the potential stopword. The method further includes comparing the sets of context data and classifying the potential stopword as an actual stopword or as terms material to the query based on the comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A second aspect of the invention is directed to a method that includes identifying potential stopwords in a query and generating context data based on the query and the potential stopwords. The method further includes rewriting the query to remove those of the potential stopwords that did not substantially effect generation of the context data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another aspect of the invention is directed to a system comprising a parser component, a context generation component, and a comparator component. The parser component receives search queries and identifies potential stopwords in the search queries. The context generation component generates context data based on the search queries and the potential stopwords. The comparator component compares the context data to determine those of the potential stopwords that effect generation of the context data.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The detailed description does not limit the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As described herein, a stopword detection component determines when stopwords in a query are meaningful based on context developed for the query. The meaningful stopwords can then be included in the actual query submitted to the search engine instead of stripping them from the search query.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary overview of concepts consistent with aspects of the invention for determining whether a query includes words or phrases that should be considered as stopwords or stop-phrases. An initial exemplary query, &#x201c;the matrix,&#x201d; is parsed and determined to contain a potential stopword &#x201c;the.&#x201d; The potential stopword may be removed from the query to generate a second query &#x201c;matrix.&#x201d; The first and second queries may then be used to generate corresponding first and second sets of context data. The context data may be obtained as results of a search engine or as lists of category names. These sets of context data may be compared to determine if they are substantially similar.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">If the sets of data are substantially similar, this fact may be used to infer that the removal of the potential stopword(s) is not material to the search. The potential stopword can be considered a valid stopword in the context of the query. If the sets of data are not substantially similar, the potential stopword can be considered material to the search and should not be removed from the query. In this manner, stopword/stop-phrases are detected in the context of a complete search query.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Exemplary Network Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exemplary diagram of a network <b>200</b> in which systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may be implemented. Network <b>200</b> may include multiple clients <b>210</b> connected to a server <b>220</b> via a network <b>240</b>. Network <b>240</b> may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), an intranet, the Internet, or a combination of networks. Two clients <b>210</b> and one server <b>220</b> have been illustrated as connected to network <b>240</b> for simplicity. In practice, there may be more clients and/or servers. Also, in some instances, a client may perform the functions of a server and a server may perform the functions of a client.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Clients <b>210</b> may be a number of different entities, such as wireless telephones, a personal computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a lap top, or another type of computation or communication device, a thread or process running on one of these devices, and/or an object executable by one of these devices. Server <b>220</b> may include components that process, search, and/or maintain documents in a manner consistent with the principles of the invention. Clients <b>210</b> and server <b>220</b> may connect to network <b>240</b> via wired, wireless, or optical connections.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, server <b>220</b> may implement a search engine usable by clients <b>210</b>. In general, in response to a client search query, the search engine returns resources, such as web pages, to the client. The search query may be modified to remove certain stopwords/stop-phrases determined by stopword detection component <b>225</b>. The stopwords/stop-phrases may be determined based on the context of the full search query.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A document, as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may be an e-mail, a blog, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page. Web pages often include content and may include embedded information (such as meta information, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as Javascript, etc.).</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Exemplary Client/Server Architecture</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an exemplary diagram of a client <b>210</b> or server <b>220</b> according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention. Client/server <b>210</b>/<b>220</b> may include a bus <b>310</b>, a processor <b>320</b>, a main memory <b>330</b>, a read only memory (ROM) <b>340</b>, a storage device <b>350</b>, an input device <b>360</b>, an output device <b>370</b>, and a communication interface <b>380</b>. Bus <b>310</b> may include a conductor that permits communication among the components of client/server <b>210</b>/<b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Processor <b>320</b> may include a conventional processors or microprocessor that interprets and executes instructions. Main memory <b>330</b> may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by processor <b>320</b>. ROM <b>340</b> may include a conventional ROM device or another type of static storage device that stores static information and instructions for use by processor <b>320</b>. Storage device <b>350</b> may include a magnetic and/or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Input device <b>360</b> may include a conventional mechanism that permits a user to input information to client/server <b>210</b>/<b>220</b>, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and/or biometric mechanisms, etc. Output device <b>370</b> may include a conventional mechanism that outputs information to the user, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc. Communication interface <b>380</b> may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables client/server <b>210</b>/<b>220</b> to communicate with other devices and/or systems. For example, communication interface <b>380</b> may include mechanisms for communicating with another device or system via a network, such as network <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As will be described in detail below, server <b>220</b>, consistent with the principles of the invention, may implement stopword detection component <b>225</b>. Stopword detection component <b>225</b> may be stored in a computer-readable medium, such as memory <b>330</b>. A computer-readable medium may be defined as one or more physical or logical memory devices and/or carrier waves.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The software instructions defining stopword detection component <b>225</b> may be read into memory <b>330</b> from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device <b>350</b>, or from another device via communication interface <b>380</b>. The software instructions contained in memory <b>330</b> may cause processor <b>320</b> to perform processes that will be described later. Alternatively, hardwired circuitry or other logic may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the present invention. Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Stopword Detection Component <b>225</b></heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram conceptually illustrating an implementation of stopword detection component <b>225</b>. Stopword detection component <b>225</b> may include parser component <b>401</b>, context generation component <b>403</b>, and comparator component <b>405</b>. Additionally, stopword detection component <b>225</b> may include a stopword list <b>410</b>. Stopword list <b>410</b> may include a list of potential stopwords and stop-phrases (e.g., &#x201c;the&#x201d;, &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;show me&#x201d;, etc.). The list may be pre-generated in a number of ways, such as by manually compiling list <b>410</b> and/or through automated techniques. Automatic techniques for compiling list <b>410</b> may, for example, be based on the inverse document frequency (IDF) of terms or phrases. The IDF is a measure of term frequency in which more common words have lower IDF values. Stopwords/stop-phrases typically have low IDF values. In general, the list includes terms or phrases that, when used in a search query, are frequently terms/phrases that are unconnected to the user's intended information results.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">List <b>410</b> may be implemented in many different forms, such as a distributed database, a relational database, a simple file structure, and so on. List <b>410</b>, and the operation of stopword detection component <b>225</b>, will, for notational convenience, be described as containing/operating on stopwords, although stop-phrases can be equivalently implemented in list <b>410</b>. Thus, henceforth, the term &#x201c;stopword&#x201d; can also be construed to refer to &#x201c;stop-phrases.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Parser component <b>401</b> may receive user search queries and parse the search queries into a structure containing the individual terms from the search queries. The parsing may be performed by separating terms in a search query based on spaces or punctuation marks between terms. Parser component <b>401</b> may additional identify terms or phrases in the parsed search query as whether they are stopwords. This can be performed by matching the terms in the parsed search query to stopword list <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Context generation component <b>403</b> may receive the parsed search query from parser component <b>401</b> or receive multiple versions of the search query in which each version contains all of the non-stopwords from the query and various combinations of the stopwords. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a number of versions of the search query, S<sub>1 </sub>through S<sub>n</sub>, are input to context generation component <b>403</b>. In one implementation, n is equal to two, and S<sub>1 </sub>represents the original search query and S<sub>2 </sub>represents the search query minus all of its stopwords.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Context generation component <b>403</b> may generate context data sets for the n queries S. In a first possible implementation, the context data includes documents returned from a search engine that uses the search queries to perform searches on an index of documents. In a second implementation, the context data includes lists of possible categories to which the search queries are likely to pertain.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating the first implementation of context generation component <b>403</b> in additional detail. In this implementation, context generation component <b>403</b> returns context data that includes documents returned from a search engine. Context generation component <b>403</b> may include a search component <b>510</b> and a document index <b>520</b>. Document index <b>520</b> includes a pre-indexed corpus of documents, such as a large number of documents taken from a source, such as the World Wide Web. Other sources for the documents in document index <b>520</b> are, of course, possible. For example, document index <b>520</b> may be derived from a specialized collection of documents, such as news articles, or from a set of documents specifically selected to facilitate the operation of stopword detection component <b>225</b>. In the situation in which document index <b>520</b> includes documents specifically selected to facilitate the operation of stopword detection component <b>225</b>, each of the documents may be selected as being representative of an individual concept in which the words in each document are words that are related to the concept.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In operation, search component <b>510</b> receives search queries and returns documents (or links to documents) that are relevant to the search queries. Search component <b>510</b> may access document index <b>520</b> to locate documents relevant to the search query. Techniques for locating relevant documents from a document index based on a search query are well known in the art and will not be further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram illustrating the second implementation of context generation component <b>403</b> in additional detail. In this implementation, context generation component <b>403</b> returns category names that are determined to be relevant to a search query. As shown, in this implementation, context generation component <b>403</b> may include a category generator <b>610</b> and a category database <b>620</b>. Category database <b>620</b> may store a list of category titles along with descriptive information, such as textual information, that describes the category. Category generator <b>610</b> may compare the input search queries to the category titles and the category descriptive information to determine which of the categories are relevant to the search queries. Thus, in general, category generator <b>610</b> and category database <b>620</b> implement a taxonomy of categories that are constructed with words from documents related to the particular category. The category titles that are used to label each category may include titles, such as &#x201c;arts&#x3e;music&#x3e;singers&#x3e;Frank Sinatra&#x201d; and &#x201c;arts&#x3e;music&#x3e;singers&#x3e;Peter Frampton.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation, category generator <b>610</b> may receive an input search query and return a list of the categories most relevant to the search query. In some implementations, each of the returned categories may also be associated with a score that defines a degree of relevance of the category to the search query.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The commonly assigned patent application &#x201c;Method and Apparatus for Characterizing Documents Based on Clusters of Related Words,&#x201d; application Ser. No. 10/676,571, filed Sep. 30, 2003, describes, in additional detail, some techniques that may be applied to implement the functionality of category generator <b>610</b>. The contents of this application are incorporated herein by reference. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that numerous other techniques may be applied to implement the functionality of category generator <b>610</b>; for purpose of clarity, such details have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, comparator component <b>405</b> compares context data corresponding to multiple queries from context generation component <b>403</b>. Based on the comparison, comparator component <b>405</b> determines whether the context data from multiple sets of documents are &#x201c;substantially similar.&#x201d; Whether a set is substantially similar to another set can then be used by stopword detection component <b>225</b> to determine, as described in more detail below, whether to include or exclude the stopword from a final rewritten version fo the stopword.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Whether the two sets of context data are &#x201c;substantially similar&#x201d; can be determined by context component <b>405</b> using a number of possible techniques. When the context data includes sets of documents, such as sets of documents returned from search component <b>510</b>, similarity can be determined by comparing word frequency in each set of documents. For example, frequently occurring words can be compared from both sets of documents. If the frequencies are relatively equal, the sets of documents can be said to be substantially similar. Other techniques for determining substantial similarity, such as by simply looking at the percentage of documents appear in the two sets of context data, could alternatively be used.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the context data includes lists of categories, such as categories returned from category generator <b>610</b>, &#x201c;substantially similar&#x201d; can be determined by directly comparing categories. For example, two sets of category lists can be compared by calculating the portion of the categories that are in both sets. That is, the number of categories in common between the two sets may be divided by the total number of different categories in the two sets to obtain a similarity metric.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Other techniques, such as those based on the relevance scores returned with each category, could alternatively be used. More specifically, the similarity metric mentioned in the previous paragraph may be calculated as a weighted metric based on the category relevance scores. For example, the relevance scores associated with each of the categories in common between the two sets may be summed and then divided by the sum of all the relevance scores of the different categories in the two sets. Alternatively, the relevance scores between the two sets can be normalized such that the sum for each set, or the sum of squares for each set, is one. The products of the relevance scores of matching categories may then be summed to obtain a similarity metric. A further modification in calculating this similarity metric may be based on additional similarity scores that define similarity between different categories. For example, there may be two categories that are both about slightly different types of cartoons, and the relatedness of these two categories may be defined with a category similarity score. In this situation, the similarity metric may then be calculated based on comparing every pair of categories associated with two queries, computing their similarity scores to each other, multiplying by the relevance scores, adding these values, and then normalizing by dividing by the sum of the relevance scores of the different categories in the two sets.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Still another technique that may be used to determine similarity between categories may be based on the observation that some categories add little value to the query context analysis. These categories may be ignored. For example, one possible category may be triggered when the query is a question. Anytime a query has the words &#x201c;where,&#x201d; &#x201c;what,&#x201d; etc., this category may be associated with the query, even though this category is not really relevant to the real meaning of the query. Categories such as this may thus be pre-determined and ignored when they are returned from category generator <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that, in addition to the techniques discussed above for determining similarity, other techniques for determining similarity are known in the art and could be used.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Detection Component <b>225</b></heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations consistent with aspects of the invention for performing searches based on a received search query.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">To begin, a search query is received and parsed (act <b>701</b>). As described above, parser component <b>401</b> may parse the search query into a structure containing the individual terms from the search query. The terms in the search query may then be compared to stopword list <b>410</b> to identify stopwords (and stop-phrases) in the search query (act <b>702</b>). If no stopwords are identified for the query, the original query may be used to generate search results for the user (acts <b>703</b> and <b>704</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">If the original query is determined to contain stopwords, however, two versions of the query may be constructed. The first version, S+, can be the original search query, including stopwords (act <b>705</b>). The second version, S&#x2212;, can be the original search query minus the stopwords (act <b>706</b>). In some implementations, stopwords in S&#x2212; may be replaced with placeholders. Placeholders may be used to indicate the presence of a word without regard to the specific word. As an example of Acts <b>702</b>-<b>706</b>, consider the search query &#x201c;show me the way lyrics.&#x201d; Assume &#x201c;show me&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are identified in act <b>702</b> as stopwords. S+ would then be &#x201c;show me the way lyrics.&#x201d; S&#x2212; would then be &#x201c;way lyrics&#x201d; or, if placeholders are used, &#x201c;* * * way lyrics&#x201d; (where &#x201c;*&#x201d; represents the placeholder).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Context data for each of the search queries S+ and S&#x2212; may then be identified (act <b>707</b>). As described previously, the context data may be sets of documents generated for a search query or lists of categories relevant to the search query. The two sets of context data (i.e., one corresponding to S+ and one corresponding to S&#x2212;) are compared (act <b>708</b>). If the sets are substantially similar, the search query S&#x2212; may be used as the search query (acts <b>709</b> and <b>710</b>). Otherwise, the search query S+ may be used as the search query (acts <b>709</b> and <b>711</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Returning to the examplary initial search query &#x201c;show me the way lyrics,&#x201d; the stopwords identified for this search query may be &#x201c;show me&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; (act <b>702</b>). Accordingly, S+ would be &#x201c;show me the way lyrics&#x201d; and S&#x2212;could be &#x201c;* * * way lyrics&#x201d; (acts <b>705</b> and <b>706</b>). Because S&#x2212; is a less specific query than S+, it is likely to result in more context data and/or less specific context data. For example, when the context data includes sets of documents, the documents for S&#x2212; may refer to songs that contain the term &#x201c;way&#x201d; in the title but are not titled &#x201c;Show Me the Way,&#x201d; such as the songs &#x201c;My Way&#x201d; or &#x201c;Walk this Way.&#x201d; Accordingly, the context data for S&#x2212; and S+ are likely to be determined to be not substantially similar, (acts <b>709</b> and <b>711</b>), and it would thus be desirable to use S+ as the final search query.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations consistent with another aspect of the invention for performing searches based on a received search query.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To begin, a search query is received and parsed (act <b>801</b>). As described above, parser component <b>401</b> may parse the search query into a structure containing the individual terms from the search query. The terms in the search query may then be compared to stopword list <b>410</b> to identify stopwords (and stop-phrases) in the search query (act <b>802</b>). If no stopwords are identified for the query, the original query may be used to generate search results for the user (acts <b>803</b> and <b>804</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If the original query is determined to contain stopwords, however, multiple versions of the query may be constructed (act <b>805</b>). For example, n queries S may be generated. Each generated query may include the non-stopword portion of the original query plus combinations of the identified stopwords. For example, for the query &#x201c;show me the way lyrics,&#x201d; four queries may be generated: &#x201c;show me the way lyrics,&#x201d; &#x201c;show me * way lyrics,&#x201d; &#x201c;* * the way lyrics,&#x201d; and &#x201c;* * * way lyrics&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Context data may then be generated for the search queries (act <b>806</b>). The results may then be compared to determine whether pairs of the search queries include substantially similar context data results (act <b>807</b>). Based on the comparison, stopwords can be identified that cause the search results to be not substantially similar to the results from the original search query (act <b>808</b>). In other words, stopword detection component <b>225</b> may identify the stopwords that meaningfully contribute to the search results. These are stopwords that should be included in the final search query that is issued on behalf of the user. Accordingly, stopword detection component <b>225</b> may generate a search query on the user's behalf that includes the non-stopword terms in the search query plus any of the identified stopwords that meaningfully contribute to the search results (act <b>809</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As an example of Acts <b>808</b> and <b>809</b>, consider the previously-mentioned query &#x201c;show me the way lyrics&#x201d;. Stopword detection component <b>225</b> may consider the differences between the search results returned for &#x201c;show me * way lyrics&#x201d; and &#x201c;show me the way lyrics.&#x201d; Assume that these two search results were substantially similar. Additionally, stopword detection component <b>225</b> may consider the differences between the search results returned for &#x201c;* * the way lyrics&#x201d; and &#x201c;show me the way lyrics.&#x201d; Assume that the results for these two search queries were substantially different. Based on these results, stopword detection component <b>225</b> may conclude that the stop-phrase &#x201c;show me&#x201d; is a significant phrase in this search query and should be retained in the search query while &#x201c;the&#x201d; is not material to the search query and can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Modifications to the operations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> are possible. For example, heuristics may be applied to determine whether the techniques shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> should be used. If not, an alternate stopword detection technique, such as simply identifying stopwords based on a predetermined list, may be used. For example, the techniques for finding stopwords shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> may only be applied when there are potential stopwords at the end of the search query. For example, because the query &#x201c;how to write a will&#x201d; contains the stopword &#x201c;will&#x201d; at the end of the query, the techniques of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> may be applied to this query.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Exemplary Implementation</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary implementation of stopword detection component <b>225</b> implemented in an Internet search engine. A number of users <b>905</b> may connect to a search engine <b>910</b> over a network <b>915</b>, such as the Internet. Search engine <b>910</b> may be a traditional search engine that returns a ranked set of documents related to a user query. Search engine <b>910</b> may be a general search engine, such as one based on all documents from a large collection, such as documents on the web, or a more specialized search engine, such as a news search engine. In other implementations, search engine <b>910</b> may be implemented over a specialized corpus of documents, such as a corporate document database made available over a corporate network <b>915</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In operation, search engine <b>910</b> may receive a user query. The search engine may submit the search query to stopword detection component <b>225</b> for initial processing. Stopword detection component <b>225</b>, as described above, may then identify stopwords within the search query and/or rewrite the search query to remove stopwords that are determined to not contribute to the intended information requested by the user. Search engine <b>910</b> may generate a list of documents that contain the terms of the modified user search query. Search engine <b>910</b> may sort the documents in the list based on a number of factors, including ranking scores computed for each of the documents in the list. Search engine <b>910</b> may then return some or all of the sorted documents (or references to the sorted documents) to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an alternate implementation, search engine <b>910</b>, in addition to returning search results based on the potentially modified version of the user search query, may also return an indication to the user that the search query was modified. Search engine <b>910</b> may additionally present the user with an option to resubmit the search query without using stopword detection component <b>225</b>. This feature essentially gives the user an option to manually override stopword detection in search engine <b>910</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Techniques for detecting stopwords in a search query were described above. The techniques take into account context information derived from the input search query to more accurately determine whether a potential stopword should actually be considered a stopword in the context of the other terms in the search query.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that aspects of the invention, as described above, may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures. The actual software code or specialized control hardware used to implement aspects consistent with the present invention is not limiting of the present invention. Thus, the operation and behavior of the aspects were described without reference to the specific software code&#x2014;it being understood that a person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to design software and control hardware to implement the aspects based on the description herein.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The foregoing description of preferred embodiments of the present invention provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the invention. For example, although many of the operations described above were described in a particular order, many of the operations are amenable to being performed simultaneously or in different orders.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">No element, act, or instruction used in the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the invention unless explicitly described as such.
