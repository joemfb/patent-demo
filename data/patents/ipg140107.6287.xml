<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 or 365 to Great Britain, Application No. 0908229.8, filed May 13, 2009. The entire teachings of the above application are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to processing communication events in a communications system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Packet-based communication systems allow the user of a device, such as a personal computer, to communicate across a computer network such as the Internet. Packet-based communication systems include voice over internet protocol (&#x201c;VoIP&#x201d;) communication systems. These systems are beneficial to the user as they are often of significantly lower cost than fixed line or mobile networks. This may particularly be the case for long-distance communication. To use a VoIP system, the user must install and execute client software on their device. The client software provides the VoIP connections as well as other functions such as registration and authentication. In addition to voice communication, the client may also provide further features such as video calling, instant messaging (&#x201c;IM&#x201d;), voicemail and file transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One type of packet-based communication system uses a peer-to-peer (&#x201c;P2P&#x201d;) topology built on proprietary protocols. To enable access to a peer-to-peer system, the user must execute P2P client software provided by a P2P software provider on their computer, and register with the P2P system. When the user registers with the P2P system the client software is provided with a digital certificate from a server. Once the client software has been provided with the certificate, communication can subsequently be set up and routed between users of the P2P system without the further use of a server. In particular, the users can establish their own communication routes through the P2P system based on the exchange of one or more digital certificates (or user identity certificates, &#x201c;UIC&#x201d;), which enable access to the P2P system. The exchange of the digital certificates between users provides proof of the users' identities and that they are suitably authorised and authenticated in the P2P system. Therefore, the presentation of digital certificates provides trust in the identity of the user. It is therefore a characteristic of peer-to-peer communication that the communication is not routed using a central server but directly from end-user to end-user. Further details on such a P2P system are disclosed in WO 2005/009019.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Communication events that occur at a user terminal in the communication system, such as receiving an incoming call or placing an outgoing call, may require certain features to be enabled and activated for use at the user terminal in order for the communication event to be processed correctly at the user terminal. For example, a particular version of a codec may be required at the user terminal in order to encode and/or decode data of the communication event in an optimal manner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Software that includes a required feature can be installed on the user terminal, or on a server accessible by the user terminal. Software providers often require that the software is authenticated for use at the user terminal, for reasons such as preventing or reducing illegal copying of the software. This also allows the software provider to control the distribution and use of the software. The user of the user terminal is required to provide an identification, such as a product key, to the software provider in order to activate and enable the software for use on the user terminal. The software provider issues a certificate to the user terminal which allows the activation and enablement of the software for use on the user terminal. The software provider can control the number of certificates that are issued for a particular identification (or product key).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the user has not authorised the software for use on the user terminal then he cannot use the software on the user terminal. Therefore, if a communication event occurs that requires the use of a feature to process data pertaining to the communication event, then that feature cannot be used, which can result in failure or degradation of the communication event.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method of communicating over a communications system, the method comprising: determining that a communication event at a user terminal of the communications system requires use of a feature for processing data, the communication event being over the communications system; determining that the feature required by the communication event is not enabled for use at the user terminal when the communication event is initiated; following said step of determining that the feature is not enabled, retrieving a certificate enabling the use of the feature at the user terminal; and using the feature at the user terminal to process data of the communication event.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The step of retrieving a certificate may comprise: transmitting a request to enable the use of the feature at the user terminal, over the communications system, to a node of the communications system; determining, at the node, based on data contained in the request, whether the use of the feature at the user terminal is authorized; if the use of the feature at the user terminal is authorized, transmitting the certificate to the user terminal over the communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Alternatively, the step of retrieving a certificate may comprise retrieving the certificate from a memory of the user terminal. The memory may provide for permanent storage of data on the user terminal. Alternatively, the memory may provide for temporary storage of data on the user terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a second aspect of the invention there is provided a communications system comprising a user terminal, the user terminal comprising: means for determining that a communication event at the user terminal requires use of a feature for processing data, the communication event being over the communications system; means for determining that the feature required by the communication event is not enabled for use at the user terminal when the communication event is initiated; means for retrieving a certificate enabling the use of the feature at the user terminal; and means for using the feature at the user terminal to process data of the communication event.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When a communication event at a user terminal requires the use of a feature to process data of the communication event, where the feature is not enabled for use at the user terminal, the user terminal can automatically authenticate and enable the feature for use at the user terminal for processing data of the communication event. In this way, if a user has not yet authenticated the software including the required feature, the feature can be automatically authenticated and enabled as and when it is needed in a communication event. This results in a better performance of the communication event from the user's perspective (since the required features can be used).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to enable the feature at the user terminal, the user terminal requires a certificate to authenticate the feature for use at the user terminal. The certificate may be stored in configuration files in the memory of the user terminal, but if not, the user terminal will attempt to retrieve the certificate from a Call Triggered Activation (CTA) service of the communications system. The CTA service will only issue the certificate to activate the feature if use of the feature is permitted on the device for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Software installed on the user terminal, or on a central server of the communications system, may contain many features. In some systems in which the user provides an identification to the software provider to enable the software, all of the features of the software will be enabled at once. Since the present invention does not require involvement of the user, individual features can be enabled automatically at the user terminal when required in communication events such that use of the individual features in the software can be controlled on a per device basis or on a per user basis. This allows the software provider to control the activation of features in the software with greater flexibility. It also allows the software provider to track the use of features in the communications system for the purposes of billing, and to see how popular the individual features are. A user may also allocate features for which payment is required to particular devices at different times, by activating the feature temporarily.</p>

For example, if the user terminal <b>104</b> is a mobile device, then it can connect to the communication network <b>106</b> via a cellular mobile network (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), for example a GSM or UMTS network.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The user terminal <b>104</b> is running a communication client <b>108</b>, provided by the software provider. The communication client <b>108</b> is a software program executed on a local processor in the user terminal <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An example of a user interface <b>200</b> of the communication client <b>108</b> executed on the user terminal <b>104</b> of the first user <b>102</b> is shown illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Note that the user interface <b>200</b> can be different depending on the type of user terminal <b>104</b>. For example, the user interface can be smaller or display information differently on a mobile device, due to the small screen size. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the client user interface <b>200</b> displays the username <b>202</b> &#x201c;User_A&#x201d; of User A <b>102</b> in the communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The client user interface <b>200</b> comprises a tab <b>204</b> labelled &#x201c;contacts&#x201d;, and when this tab is selected the contacts of User A are displayed in a pane <b>206</b> below the tab <b>204</b>. In the example user interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, four other users of the communication system are shown as contacts of User A listed in pane <b>206</b>. Each of these contacts have authorised User A <b>102</b> of the client <b>108</b> to view their contact details.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">VoIP calls to the contacts displayed in pane <b>206</b> may be initiated over the communication system by selecting the contact and clicking on a &#x201c;call&#x201d; button <b>208</b> using a pointing device such as a joystick or a mouse. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the call set-up is performed using proprietary protocols, and the route over the network <b>106</b> between the calling user and called user is determined by the peer-to-peer system without the use of servers. For example, the User A <b>102</b> can call User B <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Following authentication through the presentation of digital certificates (to prove that the users are genuine subscribers of the communication system&#x2014;described in more detail in WO 2005/009019), the call can be made using VoIP. The client <b>108</b> performs the encoding and decoding of VoIP packets. VoIP packets from the user terminal <b>104</b> are transmitted into the network <b>106</b>, and routed to a user terminal <b>112</b> of the called party <b>110</b>. A client <b>114</b> (similar to the client <b>108</b>) running on the user terminal <b>112</b> of the called user <b>110</b> decodes the VoIP packets to produce an audio signal that can be heard by the called user through a speaker of user terminal <b>112</b>. Conversely, when the second user <b>110</b> talks into a microphone of the user terminal <b>112</b>, the client <b>114</b> executed on user terminal <b>112</b> encodes the audio signals into VoIP packets and transmits them across the network <b>106</b> to the user terminal <b>104</b>. The client <b>108</b> executed on user terminal <b>104</b> decodes the VoIP packets, and produces an audio signal that can be heard by the user of the user terminal <b>104</b> through a speaker of the user terminal <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The VoIP packets for calls between users (such as <b>102</b> and <b>110</b>) as described above are passed across the network <b>106</b> only, without involving other networks, such as a public switched telephone network. Furthermore, due to the P2P nature of the system, the actual voice calls between users of the communication system can be made with no central servers being used. This has the advantages that the network scales easily and maintains a high voice quality, and the call can be made free to the users. Additionally, calls can also be made from the client (<b>108</b>, <b>114</b>) using the packet-based communication system to fixed-line or mobile telephones, by routing the call to a PSTN network (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) connected to the P2P network <b>106</b>. Similarly, calls from fixed-line or mobile telephones can be made to the packet-based communication system via a PSTN network (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) connected to the P2P network <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition to making voice calls, the user of the client <b>108</b> can also communicate with the contacts listed in pane <b>206</b> in several other ways. For example, an instant message (also known as a chat message) can be sent by typing a message in box <b>210</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) using a keyboard (or keypad) and pressing &#x201c;enter&#x201d; on the keyboard (or keypad). The first user <b>102</b> can also use the client <b>108</b> to transmit files to his contacts using the &#x201c;send file&#x201d; button <b>212</b>. Additionally, the user can use the client <b>108</b> to send voicemails to the contacts or establish video calls with the contacts (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At step S<b>502</b> a communication event commences at the user terminal <b>104</b>. For example, the client <b>108</b> running on the CPU <b>302</b> of the user terminal <b>104</b> may receive an incoming call from user terminal <b>112</b> using the P2P communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In step S<b>504</b> the client <b>108</b> determines that in order to process the incoming call a particular feature is required to be enabled. As described above the feature may be stored in the memory <b>328</b> of the user terminal <b>104</b>. In this case, the feature required by the incoming call may be for example a particular version of a codec for decoding the data of the incoming call. In alternative embodiments, the feature may be stored on a server of the communications system. In these alternative embodiments the feature may be used by the user terminal to process data of the communication event so long as the user terminal can provide a valid certificate to the server storing the feature. For example, in these alternative embodiments, the feature stored on the server may be a server supported session such as Multiparty Video or Screen Sharing, wherein the presentation of a valid certificate for use of the feature allows the user terminal to use the server supported session. In a multiparty voice conference, the feature might be an advanced feature (e.g. allowing remote muting of participants in the conference or full conference bridge functionality). If the required feature is enabled for use at the user terminal <b>104</b> then the feature is used to process the incoming call. However, if the feature is not enabled for use at the user terminal <b>104</b> then the feature cannot be used to process the incoming call (at least until the feature is enabled).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step S<b>506</b> it is determined that the feature is not enabled for use at the user terminal <b>104</b>. In step S<b>508</b> the client checks the relevant configuration files in the memory <b>328</b> to see if a certificate for enabling the require feature is stored there. The configuration files may additionally be stored at a backend service of the communications system, such that the configuration files can be reinstalled on the user terminal if necessary, e.g. if the certificates are lost from the memory <b>328</b> of the user terminal <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If a certificate authorizing the enablement of the required feature for the communication event is found in step S<b>508</b>, then in step S<b>510</b> the certificate is retrieved from the memory <b>328</b> of the user terminal <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a diagrammatical representation of a certificate <b>602</b> according to a preferred embodiment. The certificate <b>602</b> comprises a signature portion <b>604</b> and a data portion <b>606</b>. The signature portion <b>604</b> allows the certificate to be signed to verify the authenticity of the certificate. The certificate may for example be signed by including a specific key in the signature portion <b>604</b> to signify that the certificate is authentic. Maintaining a secure system is of particular importance when the communications system is a P2P communications system in which calls can be established without the involvement of central servers in the system. The use of keys in the signature portion <b>604</b> of the certificate helps to ensure the security of the communications system. For example, a public/private key system can be used as would be known to a person skilled in the art in order to ensure the security of the certificates.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The data portion <b>606</b> of the certificate <b>602</b> can contain data allowing the certificate to be used to enable specific features on specific user terminals and/or for specific users. For this purpose the data portion <b>606</b> comprises:

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0041">an identifier of a feature that is to be enabled using the certificate, for example this could identify a specific codec, or a server supported session, that is to be enabled;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0042">an identifier unique to the user terminal <b>104</b>, or unique to the user <b>102</b>, or unique to the combination of the user terminal <b>104</b> and the user <b>102</b> that is requiring the enablement of the feature; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0043">parameters related to the specific feature being enabled, for example the codec type of the codec being enabled.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0044">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, following step S<b>510</b> is an optional step S<b>512</b> of verifying the certificate at the user terminal <b>104</b>. The verification of the certificate in step <b>5512</b> may be carried out by the client <b>108</b>. In step S<b>512</b> the data portion <b>606</b> of the certificate may be checked to verify that the certificate relates to the particular feature required in the communication event. This can be achieved by checking that the identifier of the required feature is present in the data portion <b>606</b> of the certificate. Also in step S<b>512</b> the validity of the certificate signature may be verified. This is achieved using the signature in the signature portion <b>604</b> of the certificate and a public key stored in the client <b>108</b> corresponding to the specific feature being enabled. Also in step S<b>512</b> parameters in the data portion <b>606</b> of the certificate may be checked to verify that they are the parameters required to enable the required feature. For example, it is verified that the certificate relates to the correct codec type and codec version for the communication event. Also in step S<b>512</b> it may be verified that the user terminal <b>104</b> and/or the user <b>102</b> correspond to the identifier in the data portion <b>606</b> of the certificate that is unique to a user terminal, or unique to a user, or unique to the combination of a user terminal and a user.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0045">If any of the verifications in step S<b>512</b> do not succeed then the certificate is not valid for enabling the required feature at the user terminal. Therefore the certificate cannot be used to enable the feature for use at the user terminal. If the certificate fails at least one of the verifications of step S<b>512</b> then the user terminal can attempt to retrieve a valid certificate from the CTA service <b>402</b> using the method described below in relation to steps S<b>516</b> to S<b>524</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">However, if all of the verifications of step S<b>512</b> succeed, or alternatively, if step S<b>512</b> is omitted from the method, then in step S<b>514</b> the feature is enabled for use at the user terminal <b>104</b> and is used to process data of the communication event. In this way a call can proceed using the now-enabled feature. Where for example the required feature is a version of a codec, then the required version of the codec can be used to decode incoming data of a call and to encode outgoing data of the call. For example, the feature may be the latest version of a video codec, whereby the data in the communication event will be processed most optimally if that specific version of the video codec is used. Using the specific version of the video codec can result in better quality of communication and better user-experience.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047">Returning to step S<b>508</b>, if it is determined that the certificate is not stored at the user terminal <b>104</b> then the user terminal automatically attempts to retrieve the required certificate from the CTA service <b>402</b> to encode the required feature. Alternatively, as described above, if a certificate is found in the memory <b>328</b> of the user terminal <b>104</b> but that certificate does not pass the verifications of step S<b>512</b> (because, for example, the certificate is signed with an invalid key or the parameters in the data portion <b>606</b> of the certificate do not match the current system) or that certificate cannot be used to enable the required feature for some other reason then the user terminal <b>104</b> automatically attempts to retrieve the required certificate from the CTA service <b>402</b> to enable the required feature. As described above the CTA service <b>402</b> may be a network node of the communications system, such as a dedicated server or peer node.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">In step S<b>516</b> the client <b>108</b> sends a request to enable the required feature to the front end service block <b>404</b> of the CTA service <b>402</b>. The front end service block <b>404</b> may be a server in the communications system. The request includes verification data which comprises an identifier of the required feature and an identifier of at least one of the user <b>102</b> and the user terminal <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0049">The front end service block <b>404</b> receives the request from the client <b>108</b> over the network <b>106</b>. Step S<b>518</b> is an optional step in which tracking data is sent from the front end service block <b>404</b> to the tracking database <b>410</b>. The tracking data is written into the tracking database <b>410</b>. The tracking data may include an identifier of the feature identified in the request and an identifier of at least one of the user and the user terminal identified in the request. This allows the software provider to track the requests to enable particular features that are received from user terminals in the communications system. In this way, the software provider can keep a record of how often particular features are requested and used. This information can be used for billing purposes where a user is required to pay for the use of a feature. A feature can be enabled on a temporary basis, for example for a predetermined amount of time or for a particular communication event or set of communication events. In that case, a user may be billed an amount of money for the use of the feature that is dependent upon the duration, or the number of communication events, for which the feature is enabled. Alternatively, a feature may be enabled on a permanent basis, i.e. indefinitely. It can be useful to track the use of a feature in the tracking database <b>410</b> for purposes other than billing. For example, this allows the software provider to see how popular certain features are with users of the communications system. This information can be used by the software provider to determine how to improve or add to existing features in the communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0050">The front end service block <b>404</b> forwards the request to the signing service block <b>408</b>. In step S<b>520</b> the signing service block <b>408</b> determines whether the use of the feature is authorized. The authorizations database <b>406</b> stores information regarding whether particular users or user terminals are allowed to enable certain features. The signing service block <b>408</b> determines whether the feature should be authorized in step S<b>520</b> based on: (i) data in the authorizations database <b>406</b>; (ii) the identifier of the feature in the verification data of the request; and (iii) the identifier of either the user terminal or the user in the verification data of the request to.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0051">If it is found that the user <b>102</b> or the user terminal <b>104</b> is not authorized to enable the required feature then in step <b>5522</b> the process ends without a certificate being sent to the user terminal <b>104</b>. Therefore the user terminal will not obtain a certificate enabling the use of the required feature. Therefore the required feature cannot be used in the communication event. This may mean that the communication event cannot continue. Alternatively, it may mean that the communication event can continue but with a reduced performance, for example an older version of a requested codec may be used. One reason for not authorizing the use of the feature is if the service provider requires payment in order to allow a user to use a feature and no such payment has been received from the user. Another reason for not authorizing the use of the feature is if a certain level of system resources (e.g. processing power or memory) is required at the user terminal to implement the feature and it is determined that the user terminal <b>104</b> does not possess the required level of resources. For example, a high level video codec might not be suitable for the processing power of a mobile phone, so that if user terminal <b>104</b> is a mobile phone the feature might not be authorized for use on that user terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0052">If it is found in step S<b>520</b> that the user <b>102</b> or the user terminal <b>104</b> (or the combination of the user <b>102</b> and the user terminal <b>104</b>) is authorized to enable the required feature then the signature portion <b>604</b> of a certificate enabling the use of the feature at the user terminal is signed with a specific key. In step S<b>524</b> the front end service block <b>404</b> sends a response comprising the signed certificate to the user terminal <b>104</b> over the network <b>106</b>. The certificate is received by the user terminal <b>104</b> via the network interface <b>326</b>. The certificate can be stored in the memory <b>328</b> of the user terminal <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0053">As described above, the certificate can specify that the feature is enabled for use at a specific user terminal, or that the feature is enabled for use by a specific user, or that the feature is enabled for use by a specific user on a specific user terminal. In this way, the feature can be enabled in a per device or a per user manner (or in a per user using a particular device manner). In any of these events, the certificate can enable the use of a feature at the user terminal <b>104</b> for processing data in the communication event.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0054">After step S<b>524</b>, the process passes to the optional step S<b>512</b> of verifying the certificate at the user terminal as described above, before the feature is used in the communication event in step S<b>514</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0055">Where the certificate is retrieved from the CTA service <b>402</b> by sending a request to the front end service block <b>404</b> as described above in step S<b>516</b>, the data in the data portion <b>606</b> of the certificate can be time stamped and activated for a predetermined time for the call. The call may be identified in the data portion <b>606</b> of the certificate by a call identifier and a timestamp present in the verification data included in the request sent from the client <b>108</b> to the front end service block <b>404</b>. This allows the certificate to enable the feature on a temporary basis for a particular time, or for a particular call.</p>

However, if the feature is required again by the communication event, or a different communication event, then the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can start again from step <b>5504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0057">The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can occur when the user <b>102</b> of the user terminal <b>104</b> is a called user in a communication event.

<p id="p-0061" num="0063">If the user terminal <b>104</b> is authorised to enable the feature then the data is signed and then sent back to the client <b>108</b> in the form of a certificate.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">The client repeats the verification process for the new certificate, and if this succeeds, the certificate is written to the configuration file and the feature is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0065">In case the activation fails, for example due to database error or any other problem the feature remains disabled and the certificate is removed from the configuration file (if it has been stored in the configuration file).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0066">While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments, it will be understood to those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appendant claims. For example, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention described herein can be employed in an IM system, a VoIP system, a video call system or any combination thereof. The user terminals (<b>104</b>, <b>112</b>) on which the communication client is running can connect to the communication network <b>106</b> via intermediate networks (such as mobile networks, WLAN networks or corporate networks).</p>
