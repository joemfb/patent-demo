<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure generally relates to test fixtures, and deals more particularly with a test fixture apparatus and related method for testing the performance of a joint between an attachment and a beam.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is sometimes necessary to test the performance of attachment joints. For example, in the aircraft industry, a variety of attachments such as, without limitation, stanchions, seats, partitions and other fixtures may be attached to either the top or the bottom of beams that support cargo or cabin floors. These attachments may be connected to the floor beam by various types of attachment hardware, such as, without limitation, seat tracks which are used to mount passenger seats on the floor beams. The floor beams may comprise a pair of caps connected by a web that may be either substantially straight and flat along the length of the beam, or contain non-flat and/or undulating sections. Beams having non-flat and/or undulating webs may also be known as corrugated beams, referring to the corrugated-like shape of the web.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the past, in order to test hardware joints between an attachment and a corrugated metal floor beam, the floor beam and the attachment were connected through test fixtures to a load test machine which applied force to the floor beam that loaded the web in shear. The test fixtures, which were specially fabricated for each load test, were permanently attached to a cap and/or the corrugated metal web of the beam, thus rendering them unsuitable for reuse. The irregular shape of the corrugated web made it necessary to weld flat plates to short sections of the web in order to connect the web to the load test machine. Following a load test, the plates were not easily removed for possible reuse because they were welded to the web. Accordingly, a fresh set of plates had to be fabricated and fitted for each new load test.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a method and test fixture for testing joints between attachments and beams which allow reuse of test fixture in order to reduce test cycle time, labor and materials. It would also be desirable to provide a method and test fixture that allows a moment to be applied about the attachment, as the floor beam is being shear loaded during a load test.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the disclosed embodiments, a reusable test fixture is employed to react an applied attachment load in shear through the corrugated web of a short floor beam section in order to simulate the local internal loads of a full length floor beam. The applied loads may be either axial tension loads or compression loads, with or without a moment applied to an attachment joint on the beam. The embodiments produce internal floor beam loads that closely simulate floor beam internal loads at the seat track or stanchion of an actual floor beam installed in an aircraft. Additionally, the reusable test fixture may be quickly attached to the floor beam in order to reduce test cycle time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The test fixture is useful in rapidly generating design capability curves for multi-axis applied loads and varying corrugated floor beam geometries. The availability of these design capability curves may streamline the stress analysis process and may reduce the design/build cycle times for corrugated beams.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one embodiment, apparatus is provided for testing the performance of a joint between a floor beam and an attachment to the floor beam, wherein the floor beam includes a pair of caps connected by a corrugated web. The apparatus comprises first and second grips for gripping the ends of the web, and, means coupled with the attachment and the grips for applying a force through the beam. Each of the grips includes first and second portions having faces contoured to generally match the contour of the corrugated web, and at least one fastener for releasably clamping the web between the first and second grip portions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another disclosed embodiment, apparatus is provided for testing the performance of a joint between a seat track and a floor beam having a corrugated web, using a short section of the floor beam as a test specimen. The apparatus comprises means for holding the opposite ends of the web of the test specimen; a load applicator for applying a load on the test specimen through the centroid of the seat track; and, a connection between the load applicator and the seat track for maintaining the direction of the applied load through the centroid of the seat track as the seat track deflects in response to the applied load.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with a further embodiment, a reusable fixture is provided for testing a short test section of a floor beam in order to simulate local internal loads on a full length beam, wherein the floor beam includes a corrugated web connected between first and second caps. The fixture comprises a load applicator for applying a load to the floor beam in a direction that loads the corrugated web in shear; a set of first reusable connections for releasably connecting the load applicator to opposite ends of the corrugated web; an attachment mounted on one of the caps; and, a second reusable connection releasably connecting the load applicator with the attachment and reacting the applied load through the attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a disclosed method embodiment, testing the performance of a joint between an attachment and a floor beam having a pair of caps connected by a corrugated web, comprises: clamping each end of the corrugated web; and, applying a shear load to the corrugated web through the attachment. The method may further include applying a moment about the joint as the shear load is being applied to the web.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The disclosed embodiments satisfy the need for a method and apparatus for testing joints between attachments and beams having corrugated webs which overcome disadvantages of the prior test fixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other features, benefits and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will become apparent from the following description of embodiments, when viewed in accordance with the attached drawings and appended claims</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a reusable test fixture <b>10</b> includes a load applicator <b>11</b> for applying shear loads and/or bending moments through a joint <b>13</b> between an attachment <b>15</b> to a floor beam <b>14</b>. The floor beam <b>14</b> is held by a pair of grips <b>24</b>, and the load may be applied through a pivotal connection <b>17</b> between the load applicator and the attachment <b>15</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below, the attachment <b>15</b> may comprise any of a variety of structural members, fixtures or hardware, and the floor beam <b>14</b> may comprise only a short section of a full length floor beam that is used as a test specimen to determine the performance of the joint <b>13</b> between the floor beam <b>14</b> and the attachment <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in one embodiment, a test fixture <b>10</b><i>a </i>broadly includes a load applicator <b>11</b> and a pair of grips <b>24</b><i>a </i>for testing a joint <b>13</b> between an attachment <b>15</b> in the form of a seat track <b>12</b> and a floor beam <b>14</b>. Although a seat track <b>12</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is to be understood that any of various other forms of attachments, hardware, fixtures or structural members may comprise an attachment <b>15</b> to the floor beam <b>14</b>. The seat track <b>12</b> includes generally flat, spaced apart flanges <b>12</b><i>a, </i><b>12</b><i>b</i>, and a central, longitudinally extending opening <b>22</b> having a generally rectangular cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The floor beam <b>14</b> comprises a pair of caps <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> connected by a corrugated web <b>16</b> whose length extends from right to left as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The corrugated web <b>16</b> may possess any of various geometric configurations, such as, for example and without limitation, a sine wave, a square wave or a saw tooth wave. The floor beam <b>14</b> may be formed of metal, composite materials or combination of metal and composite materials. For example, the caps <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may be formed of a carbon fiber reinforced polymer resin and the web <b>16</b> may be formed of a metal such as, without limitation, titanium. The caps and the web <b>16</b> may be formed of other composite materials such as, without limitation, metallic or ceramic composites. In accordance with the disclosed embodiments, the floor beam <b>14</b> comprises a section representing a test specimen of a longer floor beam (not Shown) that may be installed in an aircraft (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The seat track <b>12</b> is fastened to the upper cap <b>18</b> by means of fasteners <b>21</b> that pass through the lower flange <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the upper cap <b>18</b> and radius fillers <b>19</b> that are formed on the bottom of the cap <b>18</b>. Nuts <b>23</b> and washers (not shown) may be used to secure the ends of the fasteners <b>21</b> on the cap <b>18</b>. The grips <b>24</b> include first and second portions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>, each of which includes a contoured surface <b>31</b>, <b>33</b> matching that of the web <b>16</b>. The outer ends of the web <b>16</b> are clamped between the first and second portions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the grips <b>24</b> by means of a fastener <b>28</b> that passes through a hole <b>35</b> formed in the web <b>16</b> and an opening <b>29</b> in the grip <b>24</b> which is aligned substantially normal to a generally flat section <b>34</b> of the web <b>16</b>. The first and second portions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the grips <b>24</b> may include countersunk holes <b>26</b> for respectively receiving the ends <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the fastener <b>28</b>. Clamping of the grips <b>24</b> to the extremities <b>27</b> of the web <b>16</b> is used to transfer the loads between the load applicator <b>11</b> and the test specimen.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The lower end of each of the grips <b>24</b> includes a recess <b>36</b> partially formed by retainer plates <b>38</b> that may be removably held on the bottom of the grips <b>24</b> by fasteners <b>37</b>. The outer ends of the lower cap <b>20</b> are captured within the recess <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The load applicator <b>11</b> may take various forms, depending upon the particular application and load testing machine (not shown) that is used to generate the load forces. In the illustrated example, the load applicator <b>11</b> includes a U-shaped clevis <b>42</b> that is connected by a pivot pin <b>48</b> through a force applying member <b>46</b> that may apply an axial force in either direction indicated by the arrow <b>50</b>. The clevis <b>42</b> may be is secured to the seat track <b>12</b> by means of a fastener <b>44</b>. The pivotal connection formed between the clevis <b>42</b> and the pivot pin <b>48</b> allows a slight relative rotational moment between the force applying member <b>46</b> and the seat track <b>15</b>, about the axis of pivot pin <b>48</b>, thereby maintaining application of the load in the direction <b>50</b>. The load applicator <b>11</b> may further include a member such as a flat plate <b>49</b> that is secured to the bottom of the grips <b>24</b> by means of the retainer plates <b>38</b> and fasteners <b>40</b>. Member <b>49</b> may be stationarily mounted on a base (not shown) and thus acts as a stationary member against which the applied forces may react, or may form part of the load test machine (not shown) that applies axial force in either direction <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In use, a test specimen may be provided by cutting a short section of a floor beam <b>14</b> from a longer full length floor beam (not shown). The seat track <b>12</b> may then be secured to the upper cap <b>18</b> by means of suitable fasteners <b>21</b>. Next, the grips <b>24</b> may be installed by positioning the first and second portions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>on opposite sides of the web <b>16</b>, near the outer extremities <b>27</b> of the floor beam <b>14</b>. A hole <b>35</b> is formed in the web <b>16</b> that is aligned with the through hole opening <b>29</b> in each of the grips <b>24</b>. Fasteners <b>28</b> may then be installed and tightened, thereby clamping the first and second portions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the grips <b>24</b> on the ends of the web <b>16</b>. The retainers <b>38</b> may be fastened to the bottom of the grips <b>24</b>, thereby clamping the lower cap <b>20</b> on the grips <b>24</b>. The clevis <b>42</b> is fastened to the seat track <b>12</b> using the fastener <b>44</b>. The load applying member <b>49</b> may be fastened to the retainers <b>38</b> or other portions of the grips <b>24</b> using fasteners <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With the assembled seat track <b>12</b> and beam <b>14</b> installed in the test fixture <b>10</b><i>a </i>as described above, a shear load may be imposed on the web <b>16</b> through the seat track <b>12</b> by axially displacing the load applicator <b>11</b> to produce either tension or compression, as desired, in the test specimen. The load test may be either a static test that tests static properties of the test specimen, or it may be a dynamic test in which a series of either the same or different loads are applied to the test specimen. The load test may reveal information concerning the static or dynamic performance of the attachment joint <b>13</b>, the attachment <b>15</b> itself, the floor beam <b>14</b>, or the combination of these structural elements. Following completion of one or more the load tests, the test fixture <b>10</b><i>a </i>may be disassembled by simply removing the grips <b>24</b> and releasing fasteners <b>37</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>44</b> which allow removal of the test specimen, thus readying the test fixture <b>10</b><i>a </i>for reuse with another test specimen.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Attention is now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> which depict an alternate embodiment of the test fixture <b>10</b><i>b. </i>Test fixture <b>10</b><i>b </i>is similar to the test fixture <b>10</b><i>a </i>previously described, but further includes a semi-spherical, pivotal connection <b>13</b> between a load applicator fitting <b>56</b> and the seat track <b>12</b>. The seat track <b>12</b> includes a plurality of longitudinally spaced, aligned through holes <b>54</b> in the top flange <b>12</b><i>b </i>that represent alternate choices for fastening a seat (not shown) to the seat track <b>12</b>. When the load applicator fitting <b>56</b> is connected to the seat track <b>12</b> using one of the through holes <b>54</b> that is offset or eccentric by a distance &#x201c;E&#x201d; relative to the web <b>16</b>, a force applied to the seat track <b>21</b> by the load applicator <b>11</b> through the fitting <b>56</b> results in both a shear load being applied to the web <b>16</b>, as well as a bending moment applied being to both the seat track <b>12</b> and the flange <b>18</b>, which in turn transfer the moment to the upper cap <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a solid insert <b>58</b> is disposed within the longitudinal opening <b>22</b> in the seat track <b>12</b>. The semi-spherical pivotal connection <b>13</b> comprises a semi-spherical lobe <b>64</b> on the end of a lug <b>62</b> forming an extension of the load applicator fitting <b>56</b>. The lug <b>62</b> passes through a through hole <b>54</b> and a cylindrical passageway <b>60</b> formed in the insert <b>58</b>. The insert <b>58</b> includes a semi-spherical cavity <b>66</b> that conformally engages the lobe <b>64</b>, allowing the central axis <b>57</b> of the load applicator <b>56</b> to pivot and/or rotate in any direction by an angle &#x3b8; until the lug <b>62</b> bottoms out on the insert <b>58</b>. The size and position of the cavity <b>66</b> is chosen such that the bottom of the lobe <b>64</b> is positioned at the centroid &#x201c;C&#x201d; of the seat track <b>12</b>. The bottom of the lug <b>64</b> remains centered at the centroid &#x201c;C&#x201d; regardless of the rotational/pivotal position of the load applicator fitting <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the load applicator fitting <b>56</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> is connected to the seat track <b>12</b> at a through hole <b>54</b><i>a </i>that is axially aligned with the web <b>16</b>, a pulling force &#x201c;P&#x201d; may act in the direction of the arrow <b>67</b> along an axis <b>69</b> passing vertically through the web <b>16</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when the load applicator fitting <b>56</b>, including the pivotal connection <b>17</b>, is fastened to the seat track <b>12</b> at a through hole <b>54</b><i>b </i>offset from the axis <b>69</b> of web <b>16</b>, the pulling force P acts along an axis <b>71</b> spaced from the web <b>69</b> by a distance &#x201c;E&#x201d;, thereby resulting in a bending moment being applied along the length of the seat track <b>12</b> that is substantially equal to P&#xd7;E. As a result of the bending moment applied to the seat track <b>12</b>, both the seat track <b>12</b> and the upper cap <b>18</b> may deflect. During this deflection, the load applicator fitting <b>56</b> is allowed to rotate/pivot relative to the seat track <b>12</b> so that the axis <b>57</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the force applied through the load applicator fitting <b>56</b> remains aligned with, and passes through the centroid C.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a technique for measuring the amount of deflection produced by the bending moment applied to the seat track <b>12</b>. A laser <b>68</b> or similar beam generating device, may be mounted either on the upper flange <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the seat track <b>12</b>, or on the upper cap <b>18</b> of the beam <b>14</b>. The laser <b>68</b> directs a beam <b>75</b> onto a surface <b>70</b>. In response to the bending moment applied by the load applicator fitting <b>56</b>, the seat track flange <b>12</b><i>b </i>(as well as the upper cap <b>18</b>) may deflect by a distance d<sub>1</sub>, causing the laser <b>68</b> to be displaced. This displacement of the laser <b>68</b> causes the laser beam <b>75</b> to be deflected by a distance d<sub>2 </sub>on surface <b>70</b>, proportional to, but greater than the deflection to d<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Attention is now directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> which illustrates the steps of a method of testing the strength of the joint <b>13</b> between the attachment <b>15</b> and the floor beam <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A test specimen is prepared at <b>80</b> by forming a section of floor beam <b>14</b> as shown at <b>82</b>, and installing the attachment <b>15</b> on the floor beam <b>14</b>, as indicated at step <b>84</b>. Next, at <b>86</b>, the web <b>16</b> is clamped by installing the grips <b>24</b> on the outer extremities <b>27</b> of the web <b>16</b>. An optional pivotal connection <b>17</b> may be formed between the attachment <b>15</b> and the load applicator <b>11</b>, as shown at step <b>88</b>. At step <b>90</b>, the load applicator <b>11</b> may be connected to the floor beam <b>14</b> and to the attachment <b>15</b>. Then, at step <b>92</b>, a shear load may be applied to the web <b>16</b> through, without limitation, the centroid of the attachment <b>15</b>. Simultaneously with step <b>92</b>, a moment may be applied about the attachment <b>15</b>, as shown at optional step <b>94</b>.
