<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A titanium nitride-stripping liquid for stripping a titanium nitride coating film, the titanium nitride-stripping liquid being capable of stripping a titanium nitride coating film even in a semiconductor multilayer laminate having particularly a layer that includes tungsten or a tungsten alloy, without corrosion of this layer is provided, and furthermore, a titanium nitride-stripping liquid which can strip a titanium nitride coating film without affecting an insulating layer is provided. A titanium nitride-stripping liquid including hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide and water, and further including an inorganic acid other than hydrofluoric acid. According to the present invention, since the titanium nitride-stripping liquid includes an inorganic acid other than hydrofluoric acid, a titanium nitride coating film can be stripped even in the case in which a semiconductor multilayer laminate has a layer that includes tungsten or a tungsten alloy, without corrosion of the layer by the titanium nitride-stripping liquid.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2007-184694, 2007-184693, 2007-184692 that were each filed on 13 Jul. 2007 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-144933 filed on 2 Jun. 2008, the content of each which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a titanium nitride-stripping liquid, and a method for stripping a titanium nitride coating film.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, etching processing in manufacture of semiconductor devices and the like generally includes: coating a resist material such as a photoresist or an electron beam resist on the surface of a substrate to be etched; carrying out etching using as an etching mask the resist film formed to have a pattern by a lithography technology; stripping the resist film after the etching; and thereby forming a specified pattern on the etched substrate. According to such a process, in etching with the resist film as an etching mask, there may be a case in which the resist film does not sufficiently serve as the etching mask, depending on the etching rate of the used substrate to be etched due to the problems of etching selectivity of the resist film for the substrate to be etched.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, when a substrate to be etched which may have lowered etching selectivity is etched using a resist film as an etching mask, high etching selectivity of the etching mask for the substrate to be etched is maintained by providing an etching mask referred to as a hard mask constituted with a titanium coating film, a titanium nitride coating film or the like. A stripping liquid of an etching mask has been desired, which can remove the etching mask constituted with titanium or titanium nitride after etching the substrate to be etched without causing damage on a conductor layer or an insulating layer, in the case of use of the hard mask as an etching mask.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Known other technologies in which a titanium nitride coating film is used include, for example, techniques for producing a transistor having a hybrid gate structure. In p type transistors having a hybrid gate structure, a structure is formed in which a titanium nitride coating film is laminated on a high-permittivity film. As an etching liquid that is a titanium nitride-stripping liquid used in pattern formation of this titanium nitride coating film, an etching liquid has been desired which does not affect characteristics of the high-permittivity film.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a liquid for dissolving the titanium thin film, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-146562 discloses an etching agent of titanium which includes an aqueous solution containing hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen peroxide. According to the etching agent of titanium disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-146562, fine pattern formation of a titanium thin film is reportedly enabled without corrosion of the resist, and with less influences on the substrate material such as aluminum or an alloy thereof, SiO<sub>2</sub>, or Si.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although the etching agent disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-146562 can be used also as a liquid for stripping a titanium nitride coating film, when a titanium nitride coating film as a hard mask is removed using the etching agent of titanium disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-146562, change in electrical characteristics and the like could be caused through corrosion of the conductor layer, depending on the metal material used for the conductor layer in the semiconductor multilayer laminate. In particular, when a layer that includes tungsten or a tungsten alloy is used in the semiconductor multilayer laminate, this layer could be corroded by the etching agent.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, when the etching agent disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-146562 is used as the liquid for stripping a titanium nitride coating film, the anticorrosive effect on the insulating film by the etching agent is not necessarily sufficient, and electrical properties of the insulating layer may be affected depending on the condition employed in stripping the titanium nitride coating film.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention was made in view of the aforementioned problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a titanium nitride-stripping liquid for stripping a titanium nitride coating film, the titanium nitride-stripping liquid being capable of stripping a titanium nitride coating film, particularly even in a semiconductor multilayer laminate having a layer that includes tungsten or a tungsten alloy, without corrosion of this layer, and further to provide a titanium nitride-stripping liquid which can strip a titanium nitride coating film without affecting an insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present inventors found that a titanium nitride coating film can be stripped when a titanium nitride-stripping liquid contains hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide and water, and further contains an inorganic acid other than hydrofluoric acid, even though it is applied to a semiconductor multilayer laminate in which a layer that includes tungsten or a tungsten alloy is formed, without causing damage on the layer, thereby achieving the completion of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Specifically, the present invention provides the following.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a titanium nitride-stripping liquid including hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide and water, and further including an inorganic acid other than hydrofluoric acid.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a titanium nitride-stripping liquid including hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and a water-soluble organic solvent, in which the water-soluble organic solvent includes a polyhydric alcohol or an alkyl ether thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, in a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for removing a titanium nitride coating film which includes bringing a semiconductor multilayer laminate having a layer that includes tungsten or a tungsten alloy, and a titanium nitride coating film to be in contact with the titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention, whereby the titanium nitride coating film is dissolved and removed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the first aspect of the present invention, since the titanium nitride-stripping liquid includes an inorganic acid other than hydrofluoric acid, a titanium nitride coating film can be stripped even in the case in which the semiconductor multilayer laminate has a layer that includes tungsten or a tungsten alloy, without corrosion of the layer by the titanium nitride-stripping liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, according to the second aspect of the present invention, since the titanium nitride-stripping liquid includes a nitrogen-containing compound having two nitrogen atoms in the ring, a titanium nitride coating film can be stripped even in the case in which the semiconductor multilayer laminate has a layer that includes tungsten or a tungsten alloy, without corrosion of the layer by the titanium nitride-stripping liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, according to the third aspect of the present invention, since the titanium nitride-stripping liquid contains a polyhydric alcohol or an alkyl ether thereof, the corrosion of the insulating layer by the titanium nitride-stripping liquid can be inhibited when the titanium nitride coating film is stripped.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first embodiment of the present invention is described below.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Titanium Nitride-Stripping Liquid</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention includes hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide, water, and an inorganic acid other than hydrofluoric acid. Furthermore, the titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention may also include an anticorrosive, and a water-soluble organic solvent such as a glycol ether as needed. This titanium nitride-stripping liquid can be particularly suitably used when a titanium nitride coating film is stripped in a semiconductor multilayer laminate having a titanium nitride coating film, a conductor layer, and an insulating layer.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Hydrofluoric Acid</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention includes hydrofluoric acid. Since the titanium nitride-stripping liquid includes hydrofluoric acid, the titanium nitride coating film can be efficiently stripped. The content of hydrofluoric acid which can be included in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid is preferably no less than 0.01% by mass and no greater than 5% by mass. The content of hydrofluoric acid falling within the above range serves in keeping high solubility of titanium nitride in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid, and can inhibit corrosion of the conductor layer and the insulating layer. The content is more preferably no less than 0.1% by mass and no greater than 2% by mass.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Hydrogen Peroxide</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention includes hydrogen peroxide. Since the titanium nitride-stripping liquid includes hydrogen peroxide, dissolution of titanium nitride in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid is accelerated, and the corrosion of the conductor layer and the insulating layer by hydrofluoric acid can be inhibited. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide can capture the hydrogen gas generated in the step of dissolving the titanium nitride coating film any time, whereby local inhibition of dissolution of titanium nitride by the hydrogen gas may be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The content of hydrogen peroxide which can be included in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid is preferably no less than 0.1% by mass and no greater than 20% by mass. The content of hydrogen peroxide being no less than 0.1% by mass allows high solubility of titanium nitride in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid to be kept. In addition, when the content of hydrogen peroxide is no greater than 20% by mass, the corrosion of the insulating layer and the conductor layer by excess hydrogen peroxide may be avoided. The content is more preferably no less than 1% by mass and no greater than 10% by mass.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Inorganic Acid</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention further includes an inorganic acid. The inorganic acid included in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid enables the pH of the titanium nitride-stripping liquid to be lowered. When a layer that includes a metal material that is insoluble in acid such as tungsten or a tungsten alloy is provided in a semiconductor multilayer laminate, the corrosion of the layer that includes tungsten or the tungsten alloy by the titanium nitride-stripping liquid can be further reduced by lowering the pH of the titanium nitride-stripping liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The inorganic acid which can be included in titanium nitride-stripping liquid is not particularly limited as long as it is an inorganic acid other than hydrofluoric acid, and examples thereof include nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and the like. These inorganic acids can be preferably used since various types of materials in the semiconductor multilayer laminates are less affected. The inorganic acid is preferably sulfuric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The content of the inorganic acid in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid is preferably no less than 0.1% by mass and no greater than 10% by mass. When the content of the inorganic acid is no less than 0.1% by mass, the corrosion of particularly a layer that includes tungsten, a tungsten alloy or the like by the titanium nitride-stripping liquid can be effectively inhibited. Also, when the content of the inorganic acid is no greater than 10% by mass, decrease of the solubility of titanium nitride may be avoided. The content is more preferably no less than 0.5% by mass and no greater than 5% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the inorganic acid is included in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention, it is preferred that 100 ml of the titanium nitride-stripping liquid regulated to have a temperature of 25&#xb0; C. has a pH of no higher than 3 as measured for 1 min with a pH meter calibrated with standard solutions of pH 4 and pH 7. When the pH of the titanium nitride-stripping liquid is adjusted as described above, the corrosion of particularly a layer that includes tungsten, a tungsten alloy or the like in a semiconductor multilayer laminate by the titanium nitride-stripping liquid can be effectively inhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention includes water. The content of water is preferably no less than 10% by mass and no greater than 98% by mass of total solvent in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid. When the content of water is no less than 10% by mass, the effect of the inorganic acid as an acid can be sufficiently exhibited.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Anticorrosive</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention may include an anticorrosive. Although this anticorrosive is not particularly limited, a nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compound having two nitrogen atoms in the ring can be preferably used when employed for a semiconductor multilayer laminate having a layer that includes tungsten, a tungsten alloy or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compound having two nitrogen atoms in the ring.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compound having two nitrogen atoms in the ring is used in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid, the corrosion of particularly a layer that includes tungsten, a tungsten alloy or the like by the titanium nitride-stripping liquid can be effectively inhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compound having two nitrogen atoms in the ring is not particularly limited, and conventionally known imidazole and pyrazole, and derivatives thereof can be exemplified. Specific examples include imidazole, 2-methylimidazole, 1,2-methylimidazole, N-methylimidazole, 4-methylimidazole, 2-ethylimidazole, 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole, vinylimidazole, 2-undecylimidazole, 2-heptadecylimidazole, 2-phenyl-4-methylimidazole, 1-benzyl-2-methylimidazole, pyrazole, and aminopyrazole. Among the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compounds described above, 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole, vinylimidazole, and aminopyrazole are preferred. These nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compounds may be used alone, or two or more may be used as a mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The content of the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compound in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid is preferably no less than 0.1% by mass and no greater than 10% by mass. When the content of the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compound is no less than 0.1% by mass, the corrosion of particularly a layer that includes tungsten, a tungsten alloy or the like by the titanium nitride-stripping liquid can be effectively inhibited. In addition, when the content of the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compound is no greater than 10% by mass, decrease of the solubility of titanium nitride may be avoided. The content is more preferably no less than 0.3% by mass and no greater than 5% by mass, and particularly preferably no less than 0.5% by mass and no greater than 2% by mass. Since the nitrogen-containing compound is not soluble in water, an appropriate water-soluble organic solvent is preferably added for permitting dissolution of the nitrogen-containing compound in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Water-Soluble Organic Solvent</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention may contain a water-soluble organic solvent. The water-soluble organic solvent which can be included in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid is not particularly limited, and for example, alcohols and glycol ethers may be exemplified.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The content of the water-soluble organic solvent in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention is preferably no less than 10% by mass and no greater than 90% by mass. The content of the water-soluble organic solvent being no less than 10% by mass allows the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compound to be sufficiently dissolved. In addition, when the content of the water-soluble organic solvent is no greater than 90% by mass, decrease of the solubility of titanium nitride may be avoided. The content is more preferably no less than 50% by mass and no greater than 90% by mass, and particularly preferably no less than 70% by mass and no greater than 85% by mass.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Glycol Ether</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention preferably contains a glycol ether. By including the glycol ether, the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring compound can be sufficiently dissolved in the titanium nitride-stripping liquid. Moreover, since the glycol ether also involves an action of inhibiting corrosion of the insulating layer, the insulating layer can be inhibited from the corrosion by the titanium nitride-stripping liquid in stripping the titanium nitride coating film.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the glycol ether is not particularly limited, for example, the glycol ether represented by the following general formula (1) can be exemplified.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Particularly, the method for stripping a titanium nitride coating film of the present invention can be suitably performed in semiconductor multilayer laminates having a layer that includes tungsten or a tungsten alloy, and a low-permittivity film as an insulating layer, when, after a substrate to be etched is etched using a patterned titanium nitride coating film, the titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention is brought into contact with the titanium nitride coating film, whereby the titanium nitride coating film following serving as an etching mask is dissolved and stripped.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Moreover, in the method for stripping a titanium nitride coating film of the present invention, etching is carried out by bringing a titanium nitride coating film formed in a semiconductor multilayer laminate having a high-permittivity film as an insulating layer, into contact with the titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention via a resist film subjected to pattern formation.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to the method for stripping a titanium nitride coating film of the present invention, since the titanium nitride-stripping liquid of the present invention is used, a titanium nitride coating film can be stripped in a semiconductor multilayer laminate particularly provided with an insulating layer, in particular, while minimizing the corrosion of the insulating layer.</p>

The value of resistance of a wafer having a titanium nitride coating film formed to have a thickness of 100 nm was measured, and converted with respect to the film thickness of the titanium nitride coating film. The value of resistance of a wafer having a tungsten layer formed to have a thickness of 100 nm was measured, and converted with respect to the film thickness of the tungsten layer. A wafer having a P-TEOS layer formed to have a thickness of 500 nm was measured with an ellipsometer. According to the aforementioned method, the film thicknesses before and after the processing were measured, whereby the etching rate was determined. The determined etching rate of each material, and the etching selectivity for titanium nitride with respect to tungsten, and the etching selectivity for titanium nitride with respect to P-TEOS are shown in Table 3.</p>
