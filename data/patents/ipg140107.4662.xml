<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/427,073 filed Dec. 23, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various technologies exist for recording a message when a user is unwilling or unavailable to answer a phone call including voicemail systems and answering machines. Voicemail is a centralized system for managing telephone messages and conveying voice messages. Voicemail has become a ubiquitous feature on phone systems serving companies, wireless, and residential subscribers. Wireless and residential voicemail systems are used primarily as simple telephone answering systems. With virtually all wireless communication, a voicemail service is employed by users for storing and retrieving calls when the called party is unavailable to take a call, or chooses not to take a call.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In today's electronic and mobile environment, it is common for a user to utilize voicemail as a call-screening mechanism. For example, if the user receives a call while in a meeting and does not want to be disturbed, the user may select a command to send the call directly to voicemail or ignore the call altogether and let the call be directed automatically to voicemail after a number of rings and listen to a saved message later. For another example, when the user does not recognize the incoming calling party's number and does not wish to answer a call from an unknown calling party, the user may send the call directly to voicemail.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As mentioned, traditional answering machines may also provide for recording a message when a user is unwilling or unavailable to answer a phone call. Traditional answering machines may also provide for a call-screening mechanism. For example, the user may listen in on the incoming message as the caller is leaving the message, and optionally answer the call to have a live conversation. As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, call-screening is a useful tool and is often employed for some of the reasons mentioned above to mention just a few. While the call-screening methods mentioned above are certainly useful for call-screening, current voicemail systems do not allow for real-time control of a call while a voicemail is being created.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention solve the above and other problems by allowing a user of a communication device to have real-time control as a voicemail is being generated. According to embodiments, an incoming call to a communication device may be sent to voicemail; however, rather than waiting for the message to be deposited into the voicemail system followed by subsequent retrieval, a user of the called communication device/called party may have an option to listen to the message as it is being created and stored. During the process of listening in on the message being deposited in the voicemail system, the user/called party may have options in real-time to take the call, ignore the call, listen to the call, and the like. Alternatively, the user/called party may take the call (answer) as the voicemail is being deposited without listening in on the voicemail as it is being deposited.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to allowing a user of a communication device to have real-time call-screening capability for voicemail messages generated for the user. As will be described below, a user of a communication device may provision a real-time call-screening feature for allowing the called party to &#x201c;listen in&#x201d; as voicemail is being created by a calling party and for allowing the called party to exercise control over the associated incoming call when desired. That is, when an incoming call is passed to a voicemail system, the called party may exercise various call control options, such as listen in only, take or pick-up the call in the midst of voicemail generation, allow the message to go to voicemail, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the present invention provide for allowing call screening of a voicemail message in a telephone system, wherein a call directed to a communication device may be routed to a voicemail system associated with the communication device; an indication that the call directed to the communication device is being routed to the voicemail system associated with the communication device is presented at the communication device; a voicemail message associated with the call is received at the voicemail system; an indication to listen to the voicemail message is received at the voicemail system as the voicemail message is being received at the voicemail system; in response to receiving an indication to listen to the voicemail message received at the voicemail system as the voicemail message is being received at the voicemail system, an extension to the called communication device may be added to establish a three-way bridge between a calling party, the called communication device, and the voicemail system; and the microphone of the called communication device may be muted.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Consider, for example, a user receives a call on his wireless device from a number that he/she may not recognize. Instead of answering the call, he/she decides to route the call to his/her voicemail. He/she may then decide to listen in on the voicemail as it is being left. Accordingly, he/she selects an option on his/her wireless phone to listen in on the voicemail. A communication switch associated with the wireless phone may then set up a three-way call between the caller, the called device, and the voicemail platform so that the user of the called device may listen in on the voicemail as it is being received at the voicemail system. The microphone of the user's device may be muted so that the caller does not know that the voicemail is being screened.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Other embodiments provide for allowing call screening of a voicemail message in a telephone system, wherein: a call directed to a communication device is received; an indication to route the call to a voicemail system associated with the communication device and an indication to allow a user of the communication device to listen to the voicemail message routed to the voicemail system associated with the communication device is received; in response to receiving an indication to route the call to a voicemail system associated with the communication device and receiving an indication to allow a user of the communication device to listen to the voicemail message routed to the voicemail system associated with the communication device, a three-way bridge between a calling party, the called communication device, and the voicemail system is established; and the microphone of the called communication device is muted.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Consider, for example, a user receives a call on his/her phone. Instead of answering the call, he/she decides to route the call to his/her voicemail and additionally, to listen in on the voicemail as it is being left. He/she may select an option provided on his/her phone to send the voicemail and to listen in. Upon receiving the user's selection, the communication switch may establish a three-way call between the calling party, the called phone, and the voicemail system. The microphone of the user's device may be muted so that the caller does not know that the voicemail is being screened.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to embodiments, after a three-way bridge is established between a calling party, the called communication device, and the voicemail system, an indication may be received to answer the call at the communication device. In response to receiving an indication to answer the call at the communication device, the voicemail system extension of the three-way bridge may be dropped, and the microphone of the called communication device may be unmuted.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, a user receives a call, routes the call to his/her voicemail, and listens in on the voicemail as it is being left like in the previous two examples. While the user is listening to the voicemail as it is being left, he/she decides to answer the call. He/she may select an option on his/her phone to answer the call, wherein the voicemail system leg of the three-way call may be dropped, the microphone of the called user's phone may be turned on, and he/she may communicate with the caller.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Other embodiments provide for allowing call screening of a voicemail message in a telephone system, wherein: a call directed to a communication device is received; the call directed to the communication device is routed to a voicemail system associated with the communication device; an indication is presented at the communication device that the call directed to the communication device is being routed to the voicemail system associated with the communication device; a voicemail message associated with the call is received at the voicemail system; an indication to answer the call at the communication device is presented at the communication device, and in response to receiving an indication to answer the call at the communication device, the call is routed back to the communication device, and the routing of the call to the voicemail system may be terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Consider, for example, a user receives a call on his/her phone. He/she is not able to get to his/her phone in time to answer the call, and the call is routed to his/her voicemail.
