<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/416,259, filed on May 3, 2006, now pending, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/724,786, filed on Oct. 11, 2005 in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and Korean Patent Application No. 2005-113662, filed on Nov. 25, 2005 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments relate to turbo processing and transmitting a digital broadcasting transport stream, a digital broadcasting transmission and reception system, and a method of processing signals thereof, and more particularly, to turbo processing, transmitting and receiving a digital broadcasting transport stream to enhance reception performance of a terrestrial-wave digital television (DTV) system in the U.S. in accordance with the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) vestigial sideband (VSB) transmission system through information exchange and mapping with respect to a dual transport stream (TS) which includes normal data and turbo data, and a digital broadcasting transmission and reception system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) vestigial sideband (VSB) transmission system, which is used in a terrestrial-wave digital television (DTV) system in the U.S., is a single-carrier system that transmits one field synchronization (sync) segment for each unit of 312 data segments. Therefore, reception performance of the ATSC VSB system is inferior over weak channels, especially over a Doppler-fading channel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an ATSC VSB digital broadcasting transceiver of the related art. The digital broadcasting transceiver shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is configured in accordance with an enhanced VSB (E-VSB) system proposed by Phillips, and produces and transmits a dual stream configured by adding enhanced or robust data to normal data of the standard ATSC VSB system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a digital broadcasting transmitter includes a randomizer <b>11</b>, a Reed-Solomon (RS) encoder <b>12</b> having a concatenated encoder form adding parity bytes to a dual transport stream to enable errors generated by channel impairments during transmission to be corrected during reception, an interleaver <b>13</b> interleaving the RS-encoded data according to a predetermined pattern, and a 2/3 rate trellis encoder <b>14</b> performing trellis-encoding at a rate of 2/3 with respect to the interleaved data and mapping the interleaved data to 8-level symbols. With this structure, the digital broadcasting transmitter performs error-correction encoding with respect to the dual stream.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The digital broadcasting transmitter further includes a multiplexer <b>15</b> inserting field synchronization (sync) and segment sync in the error-correction encoded data according to a data format shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and a modulator <b>16</b> inserting a pilot by adding a predetermined direct current (DC) value to the data symbols and the inserted segment sync and field sync, amplitude-modulating the resulting signal onto an intermediate frequency (IF) carrier, filtering the resulting IF signal to produce a vestigial sideband (VSB) signal, up-converting the VSB signal to a radio-frequency (RF) signal having a frequency of a desired channel, and transmitting the RF signal through the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, in the digital broadcasting transmitter, the normal data and the enhanced or robust data are multiplexed according to the dual stream system that transmits the normal data and the enhanced or robust data on one channel and are inputted to the randomizer <b>11</b>. The inputted data is randomized by the randomizer <b>11</b>, and the randomized data is outer-encoded by the RS encoder <b>12</b> which is an outer encoder. The interleaver <b>13</b> distributes the encoded data according to the predetermined pattern. The interleaved data is inner-encoded by the trellis encoder <b>14</b> in 12-symbol units. The inner-encoded data is mapped to 8-level symbols. The field sync and the segment sync are inserted in the mapped data. The pilot is inserted and the VSB modulation is performed. The VSB signal is up-converted to the RF signal, and the RF signal is transmitted through the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A digital broadcasting receiver shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a tuner (not shown) converting the RF signal received through the channel to a baseband signal, a demodulator <b>21</b> performing synchronization detection and demodulation with respect to the baseband signal, an equalizer <b>22</b> compensating for channel distortion generated by multiple transmission paths with respect to the demodulated signal, a Viterbi decoder <b>23</b> correcting errors of the equalized signal and decoding the error-corrected signal to symbol data, a deinterleaver <b>24</b> rearranging the symbol data according to the predetermined pattern by which data was distributed by the interleaver <b>13</b> of the digital broadcasting transmitter, an RS decoder <b>25</b> correcting errors, and a derandomizer <b>26</b> derandomizing the data corrected by the RS decoder <b>25</b> and outputting an MPEG-2 (Moving Picture Experts Group) transport stream. Therefore, the digital broadcasting receiver of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> down-converts the RF signal to the baseband signal in a reverse order relative to the digital broadcasting transmitter, demodulates and equalizes the converted signal, and performs channel-decoding, thereby recovering the original signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a VSB data frame where the segment sync and the field sync are inserted according to an 8-VSB system which is used in the DTV system in the U.S. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one frame includes two fields. One field includes one field sync segment which is a first segment of the field, and 312 data segments. In the VSB data frame, one segment corresponding to one MPEG-2 packet comprises a 4-symbol segment sync and 828 data symbols. The segment sync and the field sync in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are used for synchronization and equalization in the digital broadcasting receiver. More specifically, the segment sync and the field sync, which are known to the digital broadcasting transmitter and receiver, are used as reference signals when the receiver performs synchronization and equalization. The U.S. terrestrial-wave digital broadcasting system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is configured to produce and transmit the dual stream by adding the enhanced or robust data to the normal data of the ATSC VSB system of the related art. Therefore, the U.S. terrestrial-wave digital broadcasting system transmits the enhanced or robust data as well as the normal data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Although the enhanced or robust data is transmitted in the dual stream in addition to the normal data, inferior reception performance due to multipath channel distortion caused by transmission of the normal data stream is not remarkably improved. In fact, almost no improvement in the reception performance is obtained by the improved normal data stream. Moreover, reception performance is not much improved with respect to the enhanced or robust stream, either.</p>

While not required in all aspects, the normal stream and the turbo stream may be received from an external module such as a broadcasting camera, or internal modules such as compression module such as MPEG-2 module, a video encoder, and an audio encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The randomizer unit <b>150</b> randomizes the dual TS generated by the TS generating unit <b>300</b> and provides it to the parity area generating unit <b>110</b>. Accordingly, the parity area generating unit <b>110</b> provides a parity area for the dual TS. Since the elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> other than the TS generating unit <b>300</b> and the randomizer unit <b>150</b> are same in function as those of the above-described embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, additional description will be omitted for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">An exemplary structure of the TS generating unit <b>300</b> will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The TS generating unit <b>300</b> includes a first Reed-Solomon encoder <b>310</b>, a pre-interleaver <b>320</b>, a duplicator <b>330</b>, and a service MUX (multiplexer) <b>340</b>. Although the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> uses the first Reed-Solomon encoder <b>310</b> and the pre-interleaver <b>320</b>, these can be omitted or replaced with other elements (not shown). It is preferable, but not required, that the first Reed-Solomon encoder <b>310</b>, when used, be used together with the pre-interleaver <b>320</b>. The position of the pre-interleaver <b>320</b> is interchangeable with that of the duplicator <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The first Reed-Solomon encoder <b>310</b> performs encoding by adding parity bytes to the received turbo stream. The pre-interleaver <b>320</b> interleaves the turbo stream having the added parity bytes. The duplicator <b>330</b> provides a parity area with respect to the interleaved turbo stream. The parity area provided by the duplicator <b>330</b> will be called a &#x201c;second parity area&#x201d; in the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In order to provide the second parity area, the byte, which is the basic unit of the turbo stream, is divided into two or four bytes. A part of bits of one byte, and null data such as 0, are then stuffed in each of the bytes. The area stuffed with the null data becomes the parity area.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The service MUX <b>340</b> multiplexes the normal stream which is separately received with the turbo stream processed in the duplicator <b>330</b>. As the dual TS is generated, the service MUX <b>340</b> provides the dual TS to the randomizer unit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">An exemplary structure of the transmitting unit <b>200</b> of the digital broadcasting transmission system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will be explained below with reference to the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the transmitting unit <b>200</b> includes a second Reed-Solomon encoder <b>210</b>, a second interleaver <b>220</b>, a trellis encoder <b>230</b>, a MUX <b>240</b>, and a modulator <b>250</b>. The second Reed-Solomon encoder <b>210</b> encodes the dual TS received from the deinterleaver <b>140</b> by adding the parity bytes to the dual TS. More specifically, the second Reed-Solomon encoder <b>210</b> inserts parity bytes computed with respect to the dual TS in the first parity area provided by the parity area generating unit <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The second interleaver <b>220</b> interleaves the dual TS having the added parity bytes added by the second Reed-Solomon encoder <b>210</b>. The trellis encoder <b>230</b> encodes the dual TS after the dual TS is interleaved by the second interleaver <b>220</b>. The MUX <b>240</b> multiplexes the dual TS after the trellis encoding by adding segment sync and field sync to the dual TS. The modulator <b>250</b> modulates channel of the dual TS after the multiplexing, and up-converts into a signal of RF channel band. Accordingly, the dual TS is transmitted to a variety of reception systems via the channel. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and while not required in all aspects, the transmission unit <b>200</b> may additionally include general components for the signal transmission, such as a power amplifier (not shown) which amplifies the power of the modulated signal of the modulator <b>250</b>, and an antenna (not shown), and may further include elements used to broadcast within cable, internet, and/or satellite systems and media through which digital broadcasts can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">An exemplary structure of the turbo processing unit <b>130</b> of the digital broadcasting transmission system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will be explained below with reference to the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the turbo processing unit <b>130</b> includes a byte/symbol converting unit <b>131</b>, a de-MUX <b>132</b>, a turbo encoder <b>133</b>, a turbo interleaver <b>134</b>, a turbo data MUX <b>135</b>, and a symbol/byte converting unit <b>136</b>. The byte/symbol converting unit <b>131</b>, the de-MUX <b>132</b>, the turbo data MUX <b>135</b>, and the symbol/byte converting unit <b>136</b> may be omitted, or replaced with other components in other aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The byte/symbol converting unit <b>131</b> converts the basic unit of the interleaved dual TS of the first interleaver <b>120</b> from bytes to symbols. Conversion of the basic unit from byte to symbol will be easily understood with reference to the table D5.2 of U.S. ATSC DTV standard (A/53), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The de-MUX <b>132</b> demultiplexes the dual TS of symbol unit to recover the turbo stream. The turbo encoder <b>133</b> computes parity bytes with respect to the detected turbo stream, and encodes the turbo stream by stuffing the second parity area with the computed parity bytes. In this particular example, the turbo encoder <b>133</b> performs encoding in the unit of each byte of the turbo stream. However, it is understood that other units can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The turbo interleaver <b>134</b> interleaves the turbo stream which is convolution-encoded. In this example, the turbo interleaver <b>134</b> interleaves in the unit of bit. The turbo data MUX <b>135</b> generates a dual TS by multiplexing the interleaved turbo stream and the normal stream. More specifically, the turbo data MUX <b>135</b> constructs a dual TS by stuffing the turbo stream to the place before it is detected by the de-MUX <b>132</b>. The symbol/byte converting unit <b>136</b> converts the basic unit of the dual TS from symbols to bytes. This conversion will be easily understood with reference to the table D5.2 of the U.S. ATSC DTV standard (A/53), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> shows a dual TS generated by the TS generating unit <b>300</b> according to another embodiment of the invention. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, the dual TS includes a plurality of consecutive packets. Turbo data is arranged with respect to a predetermined number of packets. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> shows that 78-packet turbo streams are inserted in 312-segment packets of one field of the dual TS. The dual TS comprises 1 packet (188 bytes) of the turbo stream and 3 consecutive packets (188 bytes) of the normal streams which are repeatedly arranged at the rate of 1:3.</p>

The dual TS is structured in a manner that 4 packets comprising 2 packets (188 bytes) of the turbo streams and 2 packets (188 bytes) of the normal streams are repeatedly arranged 10 times, and 4 packets comprising 1 packet (188 bytes) of the turbo stream and 3 consecutive packets (188 bytes) of the normal streams are repeatedly arranged at the rate of 1:3 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9F</figref> shows a dual TS structured by the TS structure unit <b>300</b>, according to still another embodiment of the invention, which is a combined form of the dual TS shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9C and 9D</figref>. The dual TS is structured in a manner that 4 packets are repeatedly arranged, the 4 packets comprising 1 packet (188 bytes) of the turbo stream, 1 packet of the normal stream wherein SRS data and the turbo data are inserted in a part of the AF of the normal stream packet, and 2 packets (188 bytes) of the normal stream packets.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9G</figref> shows the dual TS which is structured in the form of 312-segment packets. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9G</figref>, packet information, along with the turbo data and the normal data, is included in the dual TS. The packet information may be recorded in the option field. In this case, locations of option field can be designated and fixed so as not to overlap with the turbo data. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9G</figref>, &#x201c;m&#x201d; denotes a possible length (byte) of the turbo data.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9G</figref>, the option fields recording the number of macro blocks (splice countdown) are arranged in the segments <b>11</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>167</b>, <b>219</b>, <b>271</b>, while the option fields recoding program clock reference (PCR) are arranged in the segments <b>15</b>, <b>67</b>, <b>119</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">a number of macro blocks (splice countdown) (using 1 byte): 52n+15, n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The &#x201c;transport private data length&#x201d; among these, for example, exists in the segments <b>171</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>275</b>. The dual TS in which the turbo data is inserted in the null data except the option fields can be structured in various ways besides the above-introduced ways. Additionally, the structural rate of the turbo data can be adjusted according to the structure of the dual TS packet.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram showing a digital broadcasting transmission system that transmits a supplementary reference sequence (SRS). While described in the context of SRS, it is understood that other training sequences and/or sets of known data can be implemented in other aspects of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the digital broadcasting transmission system includes a TS structure unit <b>801</b> including a stuffing region to insert SRS data in respective packets of the dual TS, a randomizer <b>803</b> randomizing the dual TS packet (hereinafter, referred to as merely &#x201c;packet&#x201d;), a supplementary reference sequence inserting unit <b>805</b> inserting the SRS data in the stuffing region of the randomized packet, a parity area generating unit <b>807</b> generating a first area for inserting a parity for error correction, a first interleaver <b>809</b> primarily interleaving the packet where the first area is generated, a turbo processing unit <b>811</b> convolution-encoding and interleaving the turbo stream included in the primarily interleaved packet, a deinterleaver <b>813</b> deinterleaving the packet processed by the turbo processing unit <b>811</b>, a Reed-Solomon (RS) encoder <b>815</b> inserting the parity in the first area of the deinterleaved packet, a second interleaver <b>817</b> secondarily interleaving the packet where the parity is inserted, a trellis encoder <b>819</b> trellis encoding the interleaved packet, a MUX <b>823</b> multiplexing the trellis-encoded packet by adding a sync, and a modulator <b>825</b> channel-modulating and transmitting the multiplexed packet. Additionally, a backwards compatibility parity generator <b>821</b> generating a compatible parity may be further included.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Known SRS data for synchronization and/or channel equalization may be inserted in the dual TS packet received by the digital broadcasting transmission, which will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The TS structure unit <b>801</b> receives the normal stream and the turbo stream and structures the dual TS packet. According to an embodiment of the invention, the dual TS packet may include a stuffing region for inserting therein the known SRS data for synchronization and/or channel equalization. The TS structure unit <b>801</b> may be constructed in the same way as explained above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and therefore, description thereof will be omitted for the sake of brevity. If the TS structure unit <b>801</b> includes the first Reed-Solomon encoder <b>310</b> as in the above embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the Reed-Solomon encoder <b>815</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> will be called as a second Reed-Solomon encoder for the convenience in explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The stuffing region for inserting therein the known SRS data for synchronization and/or channel equalization will now be described. The stuffing region may be a part of the packet including a header and a payload. More particularly, the packet further includes an adaptation field (AF). The stuffing region as part of the AF is positioned not to be overlapped with the option field included in the AF. The option field comprises a program clock reference (PCR) used for synchronization of a demodulator of a receiver, an original PCR (OPCR) used for recording, reservation, and reproduction of a program in the receiver, four circuit blocks, the number of macro blocks (splice countdown) denoting the number of consecutive macro blocks comprising one Cr block and one Cb block, transport private data length denoting length of text data for teletext broadcasting, and AF extension length.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">According to an embodiment of the invention, the AF of the packet may further include a stuffing region for inserting therein data for initializing the trellis encoder <b>809</b> that will be described hereinafter. The randomizer <b>803</b> randomizes the packet including the stuffing region.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The SRS inserting unit <b>805</b> inserts the SRS data in the stuffing region of the randomized packet. Here, the SRS data is a reference signal, that is, specific sequence data having a pattern predetermined by the transmitter and the receiver. Thus, the SRS data is known to both the transmitter and the receiver. Since the SRS data is different from general payload data transceiving the pattern of the reference signal, the SRS data can be detected easily from general packets to be transmitted and thereby used for synchronization of the receiver and/or channel equalization. The insertion of the SRS data in the stuffing region can be controlled by a predetermined controlling signal.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The parity area generating unit <b>807</b> generates a first area for inserting the parity for error correction in the packet where the SRS data is inserted. As shown, the first area is for inserting therein the parity added by the RS encoder <b>815</b>. The first interleaver <b>809</b> primarily interleaves the packet where the parity area is generated. The turbo processing unit <b>811</b> convolution-encodes the turbo stream included in the primarily interleaved packet and interleaves the convolution-encoded turbo stream. The turbo processing unit <b>811</b> is configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and operates in the same manner as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The deinterleaver <b>813</b> deinterleaves the packet output from the turbo processing unit <b>811</b>. The RS encoder <b>815</b> adds the parity to the deinterleaved dual TS. According to an embodiment of the invention, the RS encoder <b>815</b>, being structured in the form of concatenated code, inserts the parity to correct errors generated by the channel at the first area of the packet where the SRS data is inserted. The second interleaver <b>817</b> secondarily interleaves the packet where the parity is inserted. The trellis encoder <b>819</b> trellis encodes the secondarily interleaved packet.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">According to an embodiment of the invention, the trellis encoder <b>819</b> can be initialized to a predetermined value right before the SRS data included in the interleaved packet is trellis-encoded. The initialization is required due to the SRS data. More specifically, the trellis encoder <b>819</b> may generate different encoded results for the same data depending on the previously encoded data. Therefore, the result of trellis encoding of the SRS data may vary according to data previous to the SRS data and in this case, the receiver cannot discriminate the SRS data. To solve such a problem, the trellis encoder <b>819</b> is initialized to the predetermined value right before trellis encoding of the SRS data. In other words, the predetermined value is trellis encoded right before the SRS data is trellis-encoded.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The trellis encoder <b>819</b> according to an embodiment of the invention may include i) a general mode that trellis encodes the packet interleaved by the interleaver, ii) an initialization mode that initializes the trellis encoder <b>819</b>, and iii) a parity replacement mode that trellis-encodes the compatible parity substituted for the whole or a part of the parity applied by the RS encoder <b>815</b>. For this purpose, the trellis encoder <b>819</b> may receive a control signal from a control signal generation unit (not shown), the control signal operated in the general mode, the initialization mode, or the parity replacement mode.</p>
