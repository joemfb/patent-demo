<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Rowing simulators that include a variety of features that provide one or more rowers with a rowing experience that more accurately simulates on-water rowing and/or provide enhanced training feedback. One feature is a rowing station that includes one or two oars each having a vertical-feel emulator implemented as a compliant guide follower that engages a corresponding oar guide during the drive phase of the rowing stroke so as to simulate an oar's engagement with water during on-water rowing. In other embodiments, the vertical-feel emulator is incorporated into an oar support. Other features include: stroke gauges that provide visual feedback on the various phases of a rower's stroke, including the catch phase, drive phase, finish phase, and recovery phase; an oar feathering indicator; and seats linked together for training rowers to row in unison, among others.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one example of a rowing simulator <b>100</b> made in accordance with the present disclosure. As will be understood from reading this entire disclosure, rowing simulator <b>100</b> includes a number of unique features that provide a number of advantages, including providing a rower with a realistic simulated rowing experience in a controlled environment, allowing a coach to assess rower performance during rowing, providing a rower with instantaneous feedback on various aspects of his/her rowing stroke, and being usable with existing rowing machines, among others. Details of the features that provide these and other advantages are described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Before describing rowing simulator <b>100</b>, it is noted that this disclosure uses the following standard nautical terminology to identify the locations of various parts of the simulator that correspond to parts on an actual boat, which the simulator is generally set up to simulate: &#x201c;bow&#x201d; refers to the leading, or front, end of the boat that points in the direction of travel during proper rowing; &#x201c;stern&#x201d; refers to the trailing, or rear, end of the boat that is opposite the bow; &#x201c;starboard&#x201d; refers to the right-hand side when aboard the boat and facing the bow; and &#x201c;port&#x201d; refers to the left-hand side when aboard the boat and facing the bow. This disclosure also uses the following rowing terminology: &#x201c;sweep&#x201d; refers to a rowing style in which each rower operates one oar with both hands; &#x201c;sculling&#x201d; refers to a rowing style in which each rower simultaneously operates two oars, one in each hand; &#x201c;catch&#x201d; is a maneuver in which the rower places an oar blade in the water; &#x201c;finish&#x201d; is a maneuver in which the rower removes the oar blade from the water; &#x201c;feathering&#x201d; is a maneuver in which the rower rotates the oar after extraction from the water so that each blade face of the oar is parallel to the water; &#x201c;squaring&#x201d; is a maneuver in which the rower rotates the oar prior to the catch to pivot the faces of the oar blade from parallel to the water to perpendicular to the water; &#x201c;drive&#x201d; is a phase of the rowing stroke from the catch to the finish; and &#x201c;recovery&#x201d; is a phase of the stroke from the finish to the catch.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With these terms in mind, rowing simulator <b>100</b> has a shell structure <b>102</b>, which in this embodiment is generally configured to mimic the shell of an actual rowing boat. Shell structure <b>102</b> includes a seating region <b>104</b> generally defined by starboard and port gunwales <b>104</b>A-B and a seat deck <b>104</b>C extends between the gunwales. While the term &#x201c;shell structure&#x201d; is used herein, it is noted that the physical structure need not form an actual shell, for example, the structure need not have continuous solid walls. For example, in some alternative embodiments shell structure <b>102</b> can be a minimalistic open structure, such as a ladder-type structure or a truss-like structure, that provides only the structural members necessary to allow simulator to function properly. In yet other embodiments, shell structure <b>102</b> can be fashioned from an actual rowing shell. Generally, the construction of shell structure <b>102</b> can be any construction suitable for the purposes of simulator <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this example, rowing simulator <b>100</b> is set up as a two-person module having two sweep-type rowing stations, a starboard-oar rowing station <b>106</b>A (here, the fore station) and a port-oar rowing station <b>106</b>B (here, the aft station) having, respectively, a port-side oar assembly <b>108</b>A and a starboard-side oar assembly <b>108</b>B, which are described below in much more detail. As those skilled in the art can readily appreciate, alternative embodiments of a rowing simulator made in accordance with the present disclosure can be set up with one or more sculling-type rowing stations so as to provide each rower with port and starboard oars. An example of a rowing simulator <b>1200</b> configured for sculling training is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and described below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each rowing station <b>106</b>A-B has a pair <b>110</b>A-B of foot stretchers and a seat <b>112</b>A-B for accommodating a rower. In this example, foot stretcher pairs <b>110</b>A-B are located in corresponding respective foot wells <b>114</b>A-B. Each seat <b>112</b>A-B is slidable within shell structure <b>102</b> in a direction parallel to Y-axis <b>116</b>, in this example along a pair of seat tracks <b>118</b>A-B secured to shell structure <b>102</b> on opposite sides of seat deck <b>104</b>C. It is noted that seats <b>112</b>A-B are configured to be slidable independently of one another, but, in this example the seats are removably tied together with optional seat ties <b>120</b>A-B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that enable the seats to move in unison. The use of seat ties <b>120</b>A-B can be beneficial under certain training conditions. When seats <b>112</b>A-B are tied together, each rower is subjected to the same fore and aft movements, which tend to force the rowers to act in unison with one another. Being forced to row in unison with one or more other rowers using a rowing simulator of the present disclosure, such as simulator <b>100</b>, can greatly improve a rowers synchronicity during actual on-water rowing events where the seats are not tied together.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Rowing simulator <b>100</b> also includes, in this example, a pair of oar guides, here, water tables <b>122</b>A-B, that interact with corresponding respective oar assemblies <b>108</b>A-B in a manner that provides the rowers with a strikingly realistic simulation of the interaction of a rowing oar with water in a vertical direction during actual on-water rowing, i.e., in a direction parallel to Z-axis <b>124</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. To round-out the oar/water interaction experience, rowing simulator <b>100</b> also includes a pair of resistance systems <b>126</b>A-B that are specially configured to provide rowers with a strikingly realistic simulation of the interaction of a rowing oar with water in a horizontal plane during actual on-water rowing, i.e., in a plane parallel to the plane defined by X-axis <b>128</b> and Y-axis <b>116</b>. Various aspects of rowing simulator <b>100</b> that provide these realistic simulations are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, each oar assembly <b>108</b>A-B includes a simulated oar <b>130</b>A-B and a guide follower <b>132</b>A-B located on the end of the oar distal from the corresponding rower. Each simulated oar <b>130</b>A-B is attached to shell structure <b>102</b> via a corresponding outrigger <b>134</b>A-B, which supports a corresponding oarlock <b>136</b>A-B. Each oarlock <b>136</b>A-B supports the respective oar <b>130</b>A-B relative to the shell structure in a manner that permits the rower to move the oar horizontally, in this example about a corresponding rigger set pin <b>138</b>A-B parallel to Z-axis <b>124</b>, and vertically to perform a rowing stroke. Importantly, oarlocks <b>136</b>A-B are located so as to mimic the locations of oarlocks on an actual rowing boat.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this example, each oar <b>130</b>A-B includes a central member <b>140</b>A-B, a handle <b>142</b>A-B, and an extension <b>144</b>A-B. Each handle <b>142</b>A-B is rotatably engaged with the corresponding central member <b>140</b>A-B in a manner that provides rowing simulator <b>100</b> with feathering and squaring simulation. In the particular embodiment shown, central members <b>140</b>A-B are cylindrical tubes, and each handle <b>142</b>A-B is similarly cylindrical and extends into the corresponding one of the central members so as to be rotatable therein. In some embodiments, the magnitude of the force(s) needed to rotate each handle <b>142</b>A-B relative to the respective central member <b>140</b>A-B can be set to accurately simulate the force(s) needed to rotate an actual oar during feathering and squaring by presetting the rotational resistance of the handle within the central member. As a rower rotates the handle/shaft of an oar, the entire oar rotates, including the oar sleeve. This sleeve, which wraps around the shaft, is designed with two flat faces. As the sleeve is rotated, the appropriate face of the sleeve engages the flat face of the oar lock. There is a feeling and sound that corresponds to the positioning of the oar face into this correct position. As the rower rotates the oar from feathering to square they will feel and hear the transition. It is very clear to the rower when they are in the correct orientation for the recovery/feathering or drive/square position.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each oar assembly <b>108</b>A-B includes an oar-rotation indicator <b>146</b>A-B that allows a rower and/or coach or other viewer to visually check the rotational position of the corresponding oar handle <b>142</b>A-B during various stages of a rowing stroke, for example, to allow the rower to ensure that the handle is in the correct rotational position upon initially gripping the handle and to allow the rower/coach/viewer to assess the rower's feathering and squaring techniques during rowing. In this embodiment, each oar rotation indicator <b>146</b>A-B is a peg that is fixedly secured to a corresponding one of handles <b>142</b>A-B and extends through a corresponding circumferential slot <b>148</b>A-B in tubular central members <b>140</b>A-B. As the rowers rotate their respective oar handles <b>142</b>A-B, indicators <b>146</b>A-B move circumferentially in their corresponding respective slots <b>148</b>A-B.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, each water table <b>122</b>A-B is configured in an arcuate shape selected based on the geometry of oar assemblies <b>108</b>A-B such that the shape of the water table corresponds to the arc(s) swung by guide followers <b>132</b>A-B of the corresponding respective oar assemblies during a rowing stroke. In the example shown, the length Loo from each set pin <b>138</b>A-B to outboard tip of the corresponding oar <b>130</b>A-B is adjustable by virtue of a pin-and-hole arrangement <b>150</b>A-B that allows the respective guide follower <b>132</b>A-B to be located at various distances from the corresponding set pin <b>138</b>A-B. As will be described below in detail, this adjustability provides, among other things, the ability to adjust the water-related sensation and resistance each rower experiences not only in a vertical plane, but also in a horizontal plane. While water tables <b>122</b>A-B are shown as having an arcuate shape, this need not be so. For example, in other embodiments each water table <b>122</b>A-B can be another shape, such as rectangular, oval, etc. Generally, an important feature of the shape and size is that whatever oar guide is provided, it should have a guide surface sized and configured to accommodate the full arc of the rowing stroke in its interaction with the corresponding guide followers.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this example, the sensations and resistances that rowers experience during rowing on water due to the water are simulated, in part, by the interaction of guide followers <b>132</b>A-B with water tables <b>122</b>A-B, which generally provides the rowers with sensation and resistance mimicking the interaction between an actual oar and water in a vertical plane, and by the resistance provided by resistance systems <b>126</b>A-B, which generally provides the rowers with sensation and resistance mimicking the interaction between the actual water in a horizontal plane. Relative to the sensation and resistance in a vertical plane, each guide follower <b>132</b>A-B includes an anti-friction element <b>152</b>A-B that engages the corresponding upper surface <b>154</b>A-B of the respective water table <b>122</b>A-B, which may likewise be made of a suitable low-friction and/or hard material, depending on the nature of the anti-friction element.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the example shown (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), each antifriction element <b>152</b>A-B includes a roller assembly <b>156</b>A-B mounted on a strut <b>158</b>A-B that extends through the corresponding guide follower <b>132</b>A-B so that an upper portion <b>160</b>A-B of that strut visibly extends from the upper side of that guide follower. A spring <b>162</b>A-B, here a coil spring surrounding strut <b>158</b>A-B, is biased between each roller assembly <b>156</b>A-B and the corresponding guide follower <b>132</b>A-B. Each spring <b>162</b>A-B provides increasing vertical resistance to the corresponding rower as the rower lifts up on the corresponding handle <b>142</b>A-B during the catch and drive phases of the stroke to simulate the sensation and resistance, or &#x201c;vertical feel,&#x201d; that the rower would experience during actual rowing on water. In other words, each spring <b>126</b>A-B in combination with the corresponding guide follower <b>132</b>A-B provides rowing simulator <b>100</b> with a vertical feel emulator. Upper portions <b>160</b>A-B of struts <b>158</b>A-B can include markings or other indicia <b>164</b>A-B that indicate the amount that corresponding respective springs <b>162</b>A-B are compressed. The compression of springs <b>162</b>A-B corresponds to the amount that an actual oar blade is submerged in water during actual rowing and also to the amount of force being applied by the rowers.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The rowers, or more typically a rowing coach or other viewer, can use indicia <b>164</b>A-B to visually monitor the rowers' strokes, especially during the catch and drive phases. Example indicia suitable for indicia <b>164</b>A-B include markings that correspond to the number of degrees of vertical rotation of oars <b>130</b>A-B and/or markings indicating differing zones. Regarding the former, during the drive phase, a typical oar angle &#x3b8; ranges from about 5&#xb0; to about 10&#xb0;, depending on the height of oarlocks <b>136</b>A-B above corresponding respective water tables <b>122</b>A-B, which is typically adjusted to match the height of a rower. Consequently, suitable indicia <b>164</b>A-B can be degree markings in, say, 1&#xb0; increments. Regarding the latter, the zones provided can be, for example, bands of differing colors that indicate that oar-blade insertion into the simulated water is too deep, too shallow, or within an acceptable band. In some embodiments, indicia <b>164</b>A-B can be read based on the amount of extension of each upper portion <b>160</b>A-B from the corresponding opening in the respective guide follower <b>132</b>A-B. In other embodiments, a marker (not shown) can be fixedly mounted to each of guide followers <b>132</b>A-B so that the marker is located above the upper surface of the guide follower and adjacent to a corresponding one of upper portions <b>160</b>A-B of struts <b>158</b>A-B.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each resistance system <b>126</b>A-B includes a resistance device <b>166</b>A-B, a pulley <b>168</b>A-B, here supported outboard of shell structure <b>102</b> by a corresponding bracket <b>170</b>A-B, and a suitable longitudinally stiff, laterally flexible tensile member <b>172</b>A-B, which may be, for example, a cord, cable, chain, etc. In this example, rowing simulator <b>100</b> is particularly configured to utilize the resistance mechanisms of a pair of CONCEPT2&#xae;, or similar, rowing machines <b>174</b>A-B, available from Concept2, Inc., Morrisville, Vt. This configuration is particularly useful for organizations that already own and use such rowing machines as part of rowing training. Since each rowing machine <b>174</b>A-B is a single-person machine, in this embodiment one rowing machine is provided for each rowing station <b>106</b>A-B. Using existing rowing machines <b>174</b>A-B is also beneficial because their resistance mechanisms, here, resistance devices <b>166</b>A-B, are generally already configured to provide a suitable range of resistance to rowing simulator <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">That said, the present inventor has discovered that the forces experienced by rowers using the exemplary rowing simulator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> requires each resistance system <b>126</b>A-B to further include at least one strategically located pulley, in this example one pulley <b>168</b>A-B with the corresponding resistance device <b>166</b>A-B located aftward of the corresponding rowing station <b>106</b>A-B as shown. In this case, each pulley <b>168</b>A-B is particularly located via corresponding pulley brackets <b>170</b>A-B to provide the proper geometry to the respective tensile member <b>172</b>A-B relative to the location of the connection <b>176</b>A-B of the tensile member with oar <b>130</b>A-B, in this example on the corresponding guide follower <b>132</b>A-B. This geometry provides each oar <b>130</b>A-B with a variable resistance over the arc that the corresponding guide follower <b>132</b>A-B traverses during the drive phase of the rowing stroke. In general, rowing simulator <b>100</b> mimics the feeling of power and acceleration that one feels with an oar in water. It matches the variable resistance felt during the various phases of a stroke. During the catch maneuver the rower feels the greatest resistance and during the release maneuver the rower feels the least resistance. So, in proper technique a rower will accelerate the oar during the stroke. As the boat moves through water, the rower accelerates the stroke speed. In a similar fashion, by placing the pulley in this specific location the invention is able to duplicate this variable resistance and allow the rower to naturally accelerate the oar speed through the stroke. Other embodiments of a resistance system that includes a resistance device similar to resistance device <b>166</b>A-B and similarly located, and that use multiple pulleys are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 13</figref> and are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> particularly illustrates the location of pulley <b>168</b>A relative to oar <b>130</b>A in a plane parallel to the plane of X- and Y-axes <b>128</b>, <b>116</b>, as well as the geometry of oar <b>130</b>A itself and a typical rowing stroke in a similar plane. It is noted that the location of pulley <b>168</b>B and the geometry of oar <b>130</b>B and rowing stroke are similar to the corresponding items shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the dimensions given are suited to the precise configuration of rowing simulator <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, but may be different in other embodiments, depending on a number of variables, such as type of resistance devices <b>166</b>A-B used, length of oar <b>130</b>A-B implemented, and placement of oarlocks <b>136</b>A-B, among others. Before describing various dimensions of a suitable setup of rowing simulator <b>100</b>, it is noted that oar <b>130</b>A is shown in its mid-drive position in which a vertical plane extending along the longitudinal axis of the oar is parallel to X-axis <b>128</b>. Also illustrated in dashed lines are the location <b>176</b>A of the longitudinal axis of oar <b>130</b>A at the finish of the drive phase and the location <b>176</b>B of the longitudinal axis of oar <b>130</b>B at the catch of the drive phase.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in this example, the perpendicular distance Dsx from the rotational axis of pulley <b>168</b>A to Y-axis <b>116</b> is about 67 cm, and the distance Dps from the vertical centerline of set pin <b>138</b>A to the rotational axis of pulley <b>168</b>A along a line parallel to the Y-axis is about 135 cm. Regarding a typical stroke, in this example forward catch angle &#x3c6; is about 55&#xb0; and aftward release angle &#x3b1; is about 45&#xb0;. Also in this particular example, and as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the inboard (i.e., inboard of oarlock <b>136</b>A) length Lci of central member <b>140</b>A is about 70 cm, length Loo of oar <b>130</b>A outboard of oarlock <b>136</b>A is an adjustable 93 cm and the length Lh of handle <b>142</b>A extending from central member <b>140</b>A is about 43 cm. Generally, the distance Dc between connection <b>176</b>A of tensile member <b>172</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of resistance system <b>126</b>A and oarlock <b>136</b>A is about 25% to 100% of the overall length of oar <b>130</b>A inboard of oarlock <b>136</b>A, which in this example is about 113 cm (70 cm+43 cm). It is also seen that upper surface <b>154</b>A of water table <b>122</b>A is located at a height Hw of about 56 cm from a horizontal surface <b>178</b> supporting rowing simulator <b>100</b>, and the vertical pivot axis of oarlock <b>136</b>A is located at a height Hvpa of 80 cm above the horizontal surface. The horizontal centerline of pulley <b>168</b>A is located at a distance Dsz of about 5 cm above upper surface <b>154</b>A of water table <b>122</b>A. Again, these dimensions are merely illustrative of an embodiment that the present inventor has found to provide a fairly realistic simulation of rowing on water. Other embodiments can be set up differently to achieve similar results. Vertical and horizontal dimensions for other parts of rowing simulator <b>100</b>, such as height of gunwales <b>104</b>A-B, location of seats <b>112</b>A-B width of seat deck <b>104</b>C, locations of foot stretcher pairs <b>110</b>A-B, depth of footwells <b>114</b>A-B and length of travel of the seats, can be readily determined by those skilled in the art, for example, using corresponding respective dimensional information based on an actual rowing boat.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this embodiment of rowing simulator <b>100</b> includes a full-stroke gauge <b>180</b> that is attached to water table <b>122</b>A and allows a training coach, the rower in rowing station <b>106</b>A and/or another viewer to view the performance of the rower while rowing. Full-stroke gauge <b>180</b> includes, among other things, a transparent, curved panel <b>182</b> fixed to water table <b>122</b>A and an oar-location indicator <b>184</b> fixedly attached to the end of oar <b>130</b>A proximate the curved panel. The transparency of panel <b>182</b> allows a viewer to view the movement of oar-location indicator <b>184</b> from a position outboard of water table <b>122</b>A relative to rowing simulator <b>100</b>. As described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, full-stroke gauge <b>180</b> includes various markings and other features that assist the viewer and/or rower with judging the rower's performance during various phases of the rower's stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> as needed for context, full-stroke gauge <b>180</b> includes four gauge zones, specifically, a catch zone <b>500</b>, a drive zone <b>504</b>, a finish zone <b>508</b> and a recovery zone <b>512</b>. Each of zones <b>500</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>508</b>, <b>512</b> is provided with a corresponding gauge that not only can provide stroke feedback to the rower, but also allows a viewer to visually analyze the rower's performance as a function of the location of oar-location indicator <b>184</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at any point within each of the zones.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Catch zone <b>500</b> includes a catch gauge <b>516</b>, which in this example comprises a number of pegs, here three pegs <b>520</b>A-C, positioned to provide boundaries that define the optimal location and configuration of the catch zone. Pegs <b>520</b>A-C provide visual information regarding catch zone <b>500</b>, and they also can provide tactile feedback to the rower if oar-location indicator <b>184</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>) strikes any one or more of the pegs during rowing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary stroke path <b>524</b> superimposed on full-stroke gauge <b>180</b>. As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, stroke path <b>524</b> is the trajectory of the tip of oar-location indicator <b>184</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) during a full stroke cycle. In this example, the stroke that results in stroke path <b>524</b> is properly executed in catch zone <b>500</b> because it enters the catch zone between pegs <b>520</b>A and <b>520</b>B and then exits the catch zone between pegs <b>520</b>B and <b>520</b>C where it then enters drive zone <b>504</b>. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, any stroke path (not shown) that does not fall between the pairs of pegs <b>520</b>A-C in the manner just indicated is not optimal. Catch gauge <b>516</b> may also, or alternatively, include markings and/or translucent color applied to transparent panel <b>182</b> that define the proper catch zone <b>500</b>. In one example, catch gauge <b>516</b> includes a translucent colored film (not shown) adhered to transparent panel <b>182</b> at catch zone <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Drive zone <b>504</b> includes a drive gauge <b>528</b> that defines the elevational bounds of a proper rowing stroke during the drive phase. In other words, as long as the trajectory of the tip of oar-location indicator <b>184</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) falls within the upper and lower boundaries <b>528</b>A, <b>528</b>B, respectively, such as seen with stroke path <b>524</b>, the corresponding stroke may be considered acceptable. That said, while the trajectory of the tip of oar-location indicator <b>184</b> of a particular drive phase may stay within upper and lower boundaries <b>528</b>A-B of drive gauge <b>528</b>, the trajectory may waver upwardly and/or downwardly depending on the actions of the rower. In this case, a trained viewer could see this wavering and work to correct the rower's stroke accordingly. In the present example, drive gauge <b>528</b> comprises a region of translucent color, for example a sheet (not shown) of colored film adhered to transparent panel <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Like catch zone <b>500</b> discussed above, finish zone <b>508</b> includes a finish gauge <b>532</b>, which in this example comprises a number of pegs, here three pegs <b>536</b>A-C, positioned to provide boundaries that define the optimal location and configuration of the finish zone. Pegs <b>536</b>A-C provide visual information regarding finish zone <b>500</b>, and they also can provide tactile feedback to the rower if oar-location indicator <b>184</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) strikes any one or more of the pegs during rowing. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the stroke that results in stroke path <b>524</b> is properly executed in finish zone <b>508</b> because it enters the catch zone between pegs <b>536</b>B and <b>536</b>C and then exits the catch zone between pegs <b>536</b>A and <b>536</b>B where it enters recovery zone <b>512</b>. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, any stroke path that does not fall between the pairs of pegs <b>536</b>A-C in the manner just indicated is not optimal. Finish gauge <b>532</b> may also, or alternatively, include markings and/or translucent color applied to transparent panel <b>182</b> that define the proper finish zone <b>508</b>. In one example, finish gauge <b>532</b> includes a translucent colored film (not shown) adhered to transparent panel <b>182</b> at finish zone <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Recovery zone <b>512</b> includes a recovery gauge <b>540</b> that defines the elevational bounds of a proper rowing stroke during the recovery phase. In other words, as long as the trajectory of the tip of oar-location indicator <b>184</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) falls within the upper and lower boundaries <b>540</b>A, <b>540</b>B, respectively, such as seen with stroke path <b>524</b>, the corresponding stroke may be considered acceptable. That said, while the trajectory of the tip of oar-location indicator <b>184</b> of a particular recovery phase may stay within upper and lower boundaries <b>540</b>A-B of recovery gauge <b>540</b>, the trajectory may waver upwardly and/or downwardly depending on the actions of the rower. In this case, a trained viewer could see this wavering and work to correct the rower's stroke accordingly. In the present example, recovery gauge <b>540</b> comprises a region of translucent color, for example a sheet (not shown) of colored film adhered to transparent panel <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it can be readily seen that rowing station <b>106</b>B does not include a panel corresponding to transparent panel <b>182</b>, but still has a catch gauge <b>186</b> and a finish gauge <b>188</b> located in corresponding respective catch and finish zones <b>190</b>, <b>192</b>, respectively. In this example, catch and finish gauges <b>186</b>, <b>188</b> are similar to catch and finish gauges <b>516</b>, <b>532</b> of full-stroke gauge <b>180</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, except that pegs <b>186</b>A-C, <b>188</b>A-C of the corresponding respective catch and finish gauges are mounted to respective peg supports <b>186</b>D, <b>188</b>D that, in turn, are affixed to water table <b>122</b>B. It is noted that during the drive phase of the rowing stroke, indicia <b>164</b>B on strut <b>158</b>B of guide follower <b>132</b>B can be used to gauge a rower's performance as described above. In other embodiments, water table <b>122</b>B can be fitted with a panel (not shown) that provides drive and recovery gauges, for example, in a manner similar to drive and recovery gauges <b>528</b>, <b>540</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the foregoing description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> are directed to a very specific example of a rowing simulator made in accordance with the present disclosure, those skilled in the art will understand that aspects of rowing simulator <b>100</b> can be changed without departing from concepts underlying the detailed example provided above. Following are some examples of alternatives for these aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Regarding guide followers <b>132</b>A-B, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> comprises roller assemblies <b>150</b>A-B to provide a low-friction interface between oars <b>130</b>A-B and corresponding respective water tables <b>122</b>A-B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an alternative guide follower <b>600</b> that can be used in place of each of roller-based guide followers <b>132</b>A-B. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, guide follower <b>600</b> includes a fixed low-friction element <b>604</b> selected to provide a low-friction interface with a corresponding oar guide <b>608</b>. The material(s) of low-friction element <b>604</b> can be selected based on the material of oar guide <b>608</b> upon which it will slide. Example materials for low friction element <b>604</b> include, among others, nylon, polytetrafluoroethylene, polished metal, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, resistance devices <b>166</b>A-B shown are parts of corresponding respective CONCEPT2&#xae; rowing machines. However, in other embodiments other resistance devices can be used. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an alternative rowing simulator <b>700</b> having a resistance device <b>704</b> attached directly to shell structure <b>708</b>, which can be the same as or different from shell structure <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates another rowing simulator <b>800</b> that has a resistance device <b>804</b> attached to a support brackets <b>808</b> that is fixedly attached to the gunwale <b>812</b> of a shell structure <b>816</b>, which can be the same as or different from shell structure <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This example generally replaces pulleys <b>168</b>A-B, which are not necessary because the design of rowing simulator <b>800</b> is not predicated on the use of resistance devices of existing rowing machines, as is the design of rowing simulator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Each resistance device <b>704</b>, <b>804</b> can be the same as resistance devices <b>166</b>A-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but they can also be different. Generally, a resistance device, regardless of particular form, that is suitable for use in many embodiments of a rowing simulator of the present disclosure should have a variable resistance of zero pounds to about 300 pounds to about 400 pounds and fairly accurately simulate the force-versus-oar-drive-angle curve derived from actual rowing on water. This will allow the rowing simulator constructed therewith to have a realistic-feeling rowing stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is noted that the height of shell structure <b>102</b> and upper surfaces <b>154</b>A-B of water tables <b>122</b>A-B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are driven in part by the use of existing rowing machines for their resistance devices <b>166</b>A-B. However, in alternative designs, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the height of the rowing simulator can be higher or lower than depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Indeed, in some embodiments, the shell structure can be made low enough to use, for example, a floor, such as the floor of a gymnasium, or an outdoor surface, such as the surface of a concrete pad, as the oar guide(s). A drawback of such a low design, however, may be that it is uncomfortable for a rowing coach or other viewer to accurately view any stroke gauges provided, especially drive and recovery gauges, due to them being relatively very low to the floor/ground/etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Rowing simulator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> can be used alone to accommodate one or two rowers. However, rowing simulator <b>100</b> is designed as a module that can be used with other like modules to create a rowing simulator having as many rowing stations as desired. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows four identical rowing-simulator modules <b>900</b>A-D linked together to provide a rowing simulator <b>904</b> that simulates an eight-rower sweep-rowing boat. In this example, the shell structures <b>908</b>A-D of adjacent ones of modules <b>900</b>A-D are mechanically connected to one another, for example, using suitable pins, bolts, etc. In addition, if desired, not only can seats <b>912</b>A-H within any one or more of modules <b>900</b>A-D be linked together with a rigid link so that they move in unison with one another, but the seats of adjacent modules can be rigidly linked together, as well. For example, with all eight seats <b>912</b>A-H linked together, they will all move in unison. As mentioned above, this linking can be beneficial in coordinating the rowing motions of all the rowers aboard rowing simulator <b>904</b>. It is noted that while each module <b>900</b>A-D, and therefore entire rowing simulator <b>904</b>, is set up to simulate a sweep-rowing boat, in alternative embodiments, the modules and the entire rowing simulator can be set up as a skulling boat. Of course, each module <b>900</b>A-B does not need to be the same as rowing simulator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but rather it can have an alternative configuration, such as, for example, either of the configurations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. Many other variations that are not shown in any of the attached drawings are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates another rowing simulator <b>1000</b> made in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, simulator <b>1000</b> is largely the same as rowing simulator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> except as described below. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the oar guide, here water table <b>1004</b>, is attached at one end to the shell structure <b>1008</b> via an outrigger <b>1012</b> and includes several support legs <b>1016</b> spaced along its arcuate length. In this example, water table <b>1004</b> makes efficient use of material by being relatively narrow in width along its arcuate length, which mimics the arcuate trajectory of the guide follower, here a wheel <b>1020</b> rotatably attached to an oar <b>1024</b> so as to be rotatable about the longitudinal central axis <b>1028</b> of the oar. As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, wheel <b>1020</b> can be rotatably mounted to oar <b>1024</b> via a suitable low-friction rotational bearing, such as a ball-bearing assembly <b>1032</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this example, a catch gauge <b>1036</b> and a finish gauge <b>1040</b> are each moveably secured to water table <b>1004</b> so as to be readily located on the water table to suit the rowing stroke of a particular rower and/or the particular set up of rowing simulator <b>1000</b>, including the length of oar <b>1024</b> and the relative location of the oar support <b>1044</b>. Catch and finish gauges <b>1036</b>, <b>1040</b> can be movable secured to water table <b>1004</b> in any suitable manner, such as by magnetic attraction, using a peg and hole connection (e.g., holes (not shown) along the outer circumference <b>1004</b>A of tabletop <b>1004</b>B and mating pegs on the gauges), via releasable clamps or other removable fasteners, via hook and loop fasteners, etc. Each of catch and finish gauges <b>1036</b>, <b>1040</b> of this embodiment is simple, comprising a base <b>1036</b>A, <b>1040</b>A and a corresponding pair of markers <b>1036</b>B(<b>1</b>), <b>1036</b>B(<b>2</b>), <b>1040</b>B(<b>1</b>), <b>1040</b>B(<b>2</b>). Correspondingly, an oar-end-position indicator <b>1048</b> is attached to end of oar <b>1024</b>, here in a manner such that it extends along longitudinal central axis <b>1028</b> of the oar. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the respective pairs of markers <b>1036</b>B(<b>1</b>), <b>1036</b>B(<b>2</b>), <b>1040</b>B(<b>1</b>), <b>1040</b>B(<b>2</b>) define a catch zone <b>1036</b>C and a finish zone <b>1040</b>C in which the rower (not shown) should keep oar-end-position indicator <b>1048</b> during the catch and finish maneuvers of the rowing stroke, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As can be readily envisioned, during a proper rowing stroke, the rower moves oar <b>1024</b> during the drive phase so that wheel <b>1020</b> rolls on water table <b>1004</b> so that oar-end-position indicator <b>1048</b> passes under marker <b>1040</b>B(<b>1</b>) on finish gauge <b>1040</b>. At an appropriate point after oar-end-position indicator <b>1048</b> has passed under marker <b>1040</b>B(<b>1</b>), the rower moves oar <b>1024</b> so that the oar-end-position indicator moves upward between markers <b>1040</b>B(<b>1</b>) and <b>1040</b>B(<b>2</b>) within finish zone <b>1040</b>C to execute the finish maneuver. Similar, at the end of the recovery phase, the rower moves oar <b>1024</b> so that oar-end-position indicator <b>1048</b> passes over marker <b>1036</b>(B)<b>1</b> and then moves downward between markers <b>1036</b>B(<b>1</b>) and <b>1036</b>B(<b>2</b>) within catch zone <b>1036</b>C so as to execute the catch maneuver. Water table <b>1004</b> includes an oar stop <b>1050</b> against which oar <b>1024</b> rests when the oar is not in use in order to keep the oar within the reasonable grasp of the rower before the rower starts rowing.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Rowing simulator <b>1000</b> also includes a resistance system <b>1052</b> that is largely the same as each resistance system <b>126</b>A-B of rowing simulator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, except that system <b>1052</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> includes a pair of pulleys <b>1056</b>, <b>1060</b>. Pulley <b>1056</b> is located so that the cable <b>1064</b> exits resistance device <b>1068</b> (such as, e.g., the resistance erg of a CONCEPT2&#xae; rowing machine) at the proper horizontal angle, and pulley <b>1060</b> is located relative to pulley <b>1056</b> and the connection point <b>1072</b> of the cable to oar <b>1024</b> so as to provide the rower (not shown) with resistance during the drive phase of the rowing stroke that emulates that resistance the rower would feel during actual on-water rowing. In the embodiment shown, pulley <b>1060</b> is located outboard of pulley <b>1056</b> and slightly forward of pulley <b>1056</b>. The present inventor has found that this location of pulley <b>1060</b>, when used in conjunction with a current generation CONCEPT2&#xae; rowing machine as resistance device <b>1068</b> and with connection point <b>1072</b> shown, can provide a more realistic feel than if pulley <b>1056</b> were used alone. It is noted that pulley <b>1060</b> can provided in a way that its location is adjustable. For example, in the embodiment shown in which pulley <b>1060</b> is mounted to a bracket <b>1076</b> that also is connected to pulley <b>1056</b>, pulley <b>1060</b> can be secured to this bracket so as to be movable longitudinally relative to the central axis <b>1080</b> of the bracket and the bracket can be pivotable about the rotational axis <b>1084</b> of pulley <b>1056</b>, so that pulley <b>1060</b> is locatable in a polar coordinate fashion. That said, pulley <b>1060</b> can be relocatable in other fashions, such as providing a set of holes (not shown) in water table <b>1004</b> between oar stop <b>1050</b> and pulley <b>1056</b> through which a fastener (not shown) that is concentric with the axle <b>1088</b> of pulley <b>1060</b> can extend. Those skilled in the art will recognize how to adjust the location of a pulley of another rowing simulator that corresponds to pulley <b>1060</b> according to the particular arrangement and instrumentalities of that rowing simulator.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an oar support <b>1100</b> that includes a vertical-feel emulator <b>1104</b>. Oar support <b>1100</b> can be used with any suitable rowing simulator, such as simulator <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Indeed, oar support <b>1100</b> is described in the context of simulator <b>1000</b>. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, vertical-feel emulator, in conjunction with an oar guide (here, water table <b>1004</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) and corresponding guide follower (here, wheel <b>1020</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), provides increasing vertical resistance to a rower as they lifts up on the oar handle <b>1028</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>; located to the right relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) during the catch and drive phases of the stroke to simulate the sensation and resistance, or &#x201c;vertical feel,&#x201d; that the rower would experience during actual rowing on water.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in the embodiment shown, oar support <b>1100</b> includes a vertical pivot pin <b>1108</b> fixedly supported at the top by a pair of stays <b>1112</b>, <b>1116</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) and at the bottom by outrigger <b>1012</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Oar <b>1024</b> is movably engaged with pivot pin <b>1108</b> via an oar-lock assembly <b>1120</b> that includes a vertical sleeve <b>1124</b> and an oar lock <b>1128</b> used to lock the oar to the vertical sleeve. Sleeve <b>1124</b> is sized so as to be freely movable vertically along pivot pin <b>1108</b> and rotationally about the pivot pin. Oar <b>1024</b> includes inboard and outboard collar assemblies <b>1132</b>, <b>1136</b>, respectively, for stabilizing the oar relative to pivot pin <b>1108</b> along longitudinal central axis <b>1028</b> of the oar.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this example, vertical-feel emulator <b>1104</b> includes an upper spring <b>1140</b> and a lower spring <b>1144</b> that provide, respectively, resistance to vertical travel of sleeve <b>1124</b>, and hence oar <b>1024</b>, in both upward and downward directions. Due to the length of pivot pin <b>1108</b>, the length of sleeve <b>1124</b>, and the lengths of upper and lower springs <b>1140</b>, <b>1144</b>, in this embodiment oar support <b>1100</b> also includes a pair of spacers <b>1148</b>, <b>1152</b> and a pair of washers <b>1156</b>, <b>1160</b>. As can be readily envisioned by those skilled in the art, when the rower finishes the recovery phase of the rowing stroke and executes the catch maneuver, the rower lifts the oar handle so as to engage wheel <b>1020</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) with water table <b>1004</b>. As the rower continues to lift during the catch maneuver the pivoting of oar <b>1024</b> about wheel <b>1020</b> causes sleeve <b>1124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) to move upward and encounter the resistance of upper spring <b>1140</b> as the upper spring is compressed. This movement and resistance give the rower a sensation and resistance that mimics the sensation and resistance that the rower would feel during the catch maneuver of actual on-water rowing. As the rower continues with the stroke with the drive phase, the resistance of upper spring <b>1140</b> continues to provide the rower with a realistic feel emulating the feel of the paddle of an actual oar in water. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other configurations of a vertical-feel emulating oar support that achieve the same or similar result as oar support <b>1100</b> are possible. For example, helical-type springs <b>1140</b>, <b>1144</b> can be replaced with other types of springs, such as cylindrical rubber springs, among others. In addition, those skilled in the art will be able to select the proper spring constants to achieve the desired feel.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates how the inventions and features disclosed herein can be readily incorporated into a sculling-type rowing simulator <b>1200</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, rowing simulator <b>1200</b> in this example is configured as a two-rowing-station simulator having first and second rowing stations <b>1204</b>, <b>1208</b>. Being a sculling-type simulator, each rowing station <b>1204</b>, <b>1208</b> includes a pair of oars <b>1212</b>A-B, <b>1216</b>A-B set up for sculling as shown, with each oar being configured like oar <b>1024</b> of simulator <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Correspondingly, simulator <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> includes suitable oar guides, here four arcuate-shaped water tables <b>1220</b>A-B, <b>1224</b>A-B. In this example, each water table <b>1220</b>A-B, <b>1224</b>A-B is configured like water table <b>1004</b> of simulator <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. It is noted, for the sake of brevity, that other aspects and features of rowing simulator <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> not explicitly described here can be identical to the corresponding aspects and features of rowing simulator <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Indeed, those skilled in the art comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 12</figref> will readily see that virtually the only differences between simulator <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and simulator <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is that simulator <b>1200</b> is configured as a sculling simulator while simulator <b>1000</b> is configured as a sweep simulator. It is noted that a sculling simulator made in accordance with the present disclosure could alternatively, for example, have some or all of the features of simulator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, including a mix of features as between simulator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and simulator <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and/or could have any one or more other features not specifically shown or described herein but nonetheless falling within the scope of the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows yet another rowing simulator <b>1300</b> made in accordance with the present disclosure. For brevity and convenience, in this example simulator <b>1300</b> is identical to rowing simulator <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, except that resistance system <b>1304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is set up differently from resistance system <b>1052</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Specifically, resistance system <b>1304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> has a pulley arrangement that multiplies the resistance that a rower would feel during the drive phase of the rowing stroke relative to resistance system <b>1052</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, cable <b>1064</b> from resistance device <b>1068</b> is attached to oar <b>1024</b> at connection point <b>1072</b> such that the horizontal resistance experienced by the rower during the drive phase of the rowing stroke is a function of the tension in the cable and the horizontal angle that the cable makes with the longitudinal axis of the oar.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">However, in resistance system <b>1304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a pulley <b>1308</b> is attached to oar <b>1312</b> so that the horizontal resistance experienced by the rower of rowing simulator <b>1300</b> during the drive phase of the rowing stroke is a function of twice the tension in cable <b>1320</b> and the angles &#x3b8;<b>1</b>, &#x3b8;<b>2</b> formed by the two segments <b>1320</b>A-B of cable <b>1320</b> extending from pulley <b>1308</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>1316</b> of the oar. As those skill in the art will readily appreciate, with two segments <b>1320</b>A-B of cable <b>1320</b> contributing to the resistance and the attachment location of pulley <b>1308</b> being virtually identical to the location of connection point <b>1072</b> of cable <b>1064</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the resistance provided by resistance system <b>1304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> can be up to twice the resistance of resistance system <b>1052</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, which has only a single segment of cable <b>1064</b> providing the resistance. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, pulley <b>1324</b> is identical to pulley <b>1056</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a third pulley <b>1328</b> is provided along outrigger <b>1332</b>, and end <b>1320</b>C of cable <b>1320</b> is secured to the outrigger at attachment point <b>1336</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As those skilled in the art will appreciate, pulleys <b>1308</b> and <b>1328</b> can be located to optimize the resistance felt by a rower. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that pulley <b>1328</b> can be replaced by a fixed attachment point (not shown) for end <b>1320</b>C of cable <b>1320</b>. In alternative embodiments, outrigger <b>1332</b> can be provided with multiple such fixed attachment points spaced along the length of the outrigger to allow ready adjustment of the resistance. Likewise, outrigger <b>1332</b> can be configured to allow pulley <b>1328</b> to be located at any of multiple locations along the length of the outrigger. Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that cable <b>1320</b> can be looped one or more additional times to further increase the resistance experienced by a rower. For example, with the configuration shown, cable segment <b>1320</b>B could be moved to the other side of pulley <b>1328</b> and cable segment <b>1320</b>D passed around pulley <b>1328</b> and end <b>1320</b>C attached to oar <b>1312</b>. In this manner, the resistance would be a function of three times the tension in cable <b>1320</b> and the angles &#x3b8;<b>1</b>, &#x3b8;<b>2</b> formed by cable segments <b>1320</b>A-B, as well as the location of the attachment point (not shown) of cable end <b>1320</b>C and the angle (not shown) formed between cable segment <b>1320</b>D and longitudinal axis <b>1316</b> of oar <b>1312</b>. Those skilled in the art will understand that the adjustments available using multiple pulleys, at least one of which is attached to oar <b>1312</b>, are numerous.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Exemplary embodiments have been disclosed above and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
