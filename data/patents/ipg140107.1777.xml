<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A safety needle assembly is provided herein which includes a displaceable locking tongue which has a first position in which the locking tongue covers an aperture formed in a shield so as to prevent the passage therethrough of a needle. A biasing element is also provided for urging the locking tongue to the first position. The locking tongue is releasably retained in a retained position prior to use of the safety needle assembly, the aperture being sufficiently uncovered with the locking tongue being in the retained position so as to permit passage of the needle through the aperture. The locking tongue is releasably retained in the retained position against biasing force of the biasing element. With the shield being displaced proximally from a first position to a second position, the locking tongue is released from the retained position and permitted to be displaced to the first position under force of the biasing element. Advantageously, with the subject invention, a safety needle assembly is provided which covers a used needle after use and, optionally, provides a use indicator.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to safety needle assemblies and, more particularly, to safety needle assemblies having a displaceable locking element for restricting access to a used needle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Safety needle assemblies are known in the prior art. With many of these assemblies, a shield is provided which covers a needle so as to restrict access thereto. However, the shield may have an open end through which access may still be obtained to a used needle, even with the shield in a protective state.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, many safety needle assemblies seek to continuously shield a needle before, during and after use. Thus, the shield is provided in a covered, shielded position both before and after use. It may be difficult to discern if a needle assembly has been used considering that the safety needle assembly looks the same before and after use.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an aspect of the subject invention, a safety needle assembly is provided herein including a hub; a needle fixed to the hub, the needle having a distal end, formed for insertion into a patient, and a proximal end; and, a shield having a tubular body with a proximal end and a distal end, an aperture being formed in the distal end to allow passage therethrough of the distal end of the needle. The shield is axially displaceable proximally relative to the hub between a first position to a second position, where the needle extends through the aperture and the distal end of the needle is exposed. The assembly further includes a displaceable locking tongue which has a first position in which the aperture is sufficiently covered so as to prevent passage therethrough of the distal end of the needle. A biasing element is also provided for urging the locking tongue to the first position. The locking tongue is releasably retained in a retained position prior to use of the safety needle assembly, the aperture being sufficiently uncovered with the locking tongue being in the retained position so as to permit passage of the distal end of the needle through the aperture. The locking tongue is retained in the retained position against biasing force of the biasing element. With the shield being displaced from the first position to the second position, the locking tongue is released from the retained position and urged towards the first position under force of the biasing element. Advantageously, with the subject invention, a safety needle assembly is provided which covers a used needle after use and, optionally, provides a use indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Optionally or alternatively, in a further aspect of the subject invention, a locking tongue may be provided for the proximal end of the needle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As used herein, the term &#x201c;proximal&#x201d;, and derivatives thereof, refer to a direction away from a patient during use. The term &#x201c;distal&#x201d;, and derivatives thereof, refer to a direction towards a patient during use.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These and other features of the invention will be better understood through a study of the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-11</figref>, a first embodiment of a safety needle assembly is shown and generally designated with the reference numeral <b>10</b>. The safety needle assembly <b>10</b> generally includes a hub <b>12</b>, a needle <b>14</b>, a shield <b>16</b>, a displaceable locking tongue <b>18</b>, and a biasing element <b>20</b> configured to apply force to the locking tongue <b>18</b> as described below. The safety needle assembly <b>10</b> may be used with various medical injectors, and is particularly well-suited for use with pen injectors.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The hub <b>12</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, includes a tubular injector receiving portion <b>22</b> having mounting elements <b>24</b>, such as threads, disposed therein formed to cooperatively engage corresponding mounting elements <b>25</b> on an injector I. The mounting elements <b>24</b> may, in addition, or alternatively, include tapered wall portions configured to provide a Luer mount onto an injector I. The hub <b>12</b> also includes a cross-piece <b>26</b> to which the needle <b>14</b> may be affixed in any known manner. A shoulder <b>28</b> is also provided to extend, continuously or discontinuously, radially outwardly from the hub <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The needle <b>14</b> includes a distal end <b>30</b>, formed for insertion into a patient, and a proximal end <b>32</b>. The needle <b>14</b> is positioned relative to the hub <b>12</b> such that the distal end <b>30</b> is located distally of the hub <b>12</b> and the proximal end <b>32</b> is located to be inserted into the injector I with the injector I being mounted to the hub <b>12</b>. The needle <b>14</b> is provided with sufficient length to have the proximal end <b>32</b> extend into a reservoir contained in the injector I having contained therein drug or other agent intended for injection by the safety needle assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The shield <b>16</b> is located about the hub <b>12</b> and includes a proximal end <b>34</b> and a distal end <b>36</b>. An aperture <b>38</b> is formed in the distal end <b>36</b> to allow passage therethrough of the distal end <b>30</b> of the needle <b>14</b>. The aperture <b>38</b> is formed larger than the needle <b>14</b> to ensure sufficient clearance therefor. The shield <b>16</b> is axially displaceable proximally relative to the hub <b>12</b> between a first position to a second position, where the needle <b>14</b> extends through the aperture <b>38</b> and the distal end <b>30</b> of the needle <b>14</b> is exposed (shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the first position, the distal end <b>36</b> of the shield <b>16</b> is located distally of the distal end <b>30</b> of the needle <b>14</b>. Alternatively, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the distal end <b>30</b> of the needle <b>14</b> may be initially located to extend from the aperture <b>38</b> to permit visual observation during priming of the needle <b>14</b> for use (i.e., the distal end <b>30</b> of the needle <b>14</b> may extend distally from the distal end <b>36</b> of the shield <b>16</b>). The distal end <b>30</b> may only extend slightly. With this arrangement, the shield <b>16</b> is displaced proximally to the second position to operate in the same manner as the preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the safety needle assembly <b>10</b> includes a secondary biasing element <b>40</b> disposed to urge the hub <b>12</b> relative to the shield <b>16</b> to the shielding position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The secondary biasing element <b>40</b> is preferably disposed about the hub <b>12</b> so as to act against the shoulder <b>28</b>. The secondary biasing element <b>40</b> may be positioned against any portion of the shield <b>16</b>, including a ledge <b>42</b> which may be located at the distal end <b>36</b> or along a mid-location of the shield <b>16</b> between the proximal end <b>34</b> and the distal end <b>36</b>. One or more detents <b>35</b> may be formed on the shield <b>16</b> positioned to limit proximal movement of the hub <b>12</b> under force of the secondary biasing element <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, the locking tongue <b>18</b> is located within the shield <b>16</b> at or in proximity to the distal end <b>36</b>. The locking tongue <b>18</b> is displaceable between a position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in which the aperture <b>38</b> is sufficiently uncovered to permit passage therethrough of the distal end <b>30</b> of the needle <b>14</b>, to a covered position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, where the locking tongue <b>18</b> sufficiently covers the aperture <b>38</b> so as to prevent passage therethrough of the distal end <b>30</b> of the needle <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The biasing element <b>20</b> is configured to provide biasing force for urging the locking tongue <b>18</b> from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the biasing element <b>20</b> may be formed of various configurations. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the biasing element <b>20</b> may include a swivable locking member <b>44</b> to which the locking tongue <b>18</b> is fixed so as to move in concert therewith. Various elements for generating force to the swivable locking member <b>44</b>, so as to urge movement thereof, may be utilized with the subject invention. In a preferred embodiment, the swivable locking member <b>44</b> is fixed to a base <b>46</b> via a hinge connection <b>48</b>. The hinge connection <b>48</b> is resiliently distortable so as to permit distortion thereof with inherent resilient biasing force being internally generated urging return of the hinge connection <b>48</b> back to the unstressed, natural state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a preferred arrangement, the locking tongue <b>18</b> is releasably retained in the uncovered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, any arrangement for releasably retaining the locking tongue <b>18</b> consistent with the invention herein may be utilized. In a preferred embodiment, a displaceable locking finger <b>50</b> is provided and located to interferingly engage the swivable locking member <b>44</b> in an initial, pre-use state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The displaceable locking finger <b>50</b>, thus, restricts movement of the swivable locking member <b>44</b> under force generated by the biasing element <b>20</b>, which may be in the form of the hinge connection <b>48</b>. During use, with the shield <b>16</b> being axially displaced relative to the hub <b>12</b> from the first shielding position to the second position, described above, the displaceable locking finger <b>50</b> is positioned to come into contact with the hub <b>12</b> and be displaced upon sufficient contact. In this manner, displaceable locking finger <b>50</b> is caused to be displaced and moved out of the interfering position where the displaceable locking finger <b>50</b> restricts movement of the swivable locking member <b>44</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the locking finger <b>50</b> may be displaced below the swivable locking member <b>44</b> so that the swivable locking member <b>44</b> may be caused to move with the locking tongue <b>18</b> to the covering position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> under force of movement by the biasing element <b>20</b>, which may be in the form of the hinge connection <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a preferred embodiment, the locking tongue <b>18</b>, the swivable locking member <b>44</b>, the base <b>46</b>, the hinge connection <b>48</b>, and the locking finger <b>50</b> are unitarily formed. It is preferred that all these elements be fixed to the shield <b>16</b> so as to move therewith. For example, the base <b>46</b> may be coupled to the shield <b>16</b>. More preferably, these elements are unitarily formed from a stamped piece of metal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the locking tongue <b>18</b> may be formed by a cutting or stamping process which separates the locking tongue <b>18</b> from the surrounding portions of the base <b>46</b>. To ensure sufficient stiffness of the elements, and, thus, dependable operation thereof, the swivable locking member <b>44</b> is disposed upwardly relative to the base <b>46</b>. It is preferred that the hinge connection <b>48</b> be located at the end of the swivable locking member <b>44</b> further from the locking tongue <b>18</b>. In addition, it is preferred that free end <b>52</b> of the swivable locking member <b>44</b> be bent or otherwise reinforced to impart stiffness to the swivable locking member <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 9</figref>, prior to use, the locking tongue <b>18</b> is in the uncovered state, where the distal end <b>30</b> of the needle <b>14</b> may pass through the aperture <b>38</b>. The locking tongue <b>18</b> is releasably retained by the locking finger <b>50</b> in this state. It is noted that the swivable locking member <b>44</b> is sufficiently out of alignment with the hub <b>12</b> so as to not prevent axially movement thereof during use. In this manner, the hub <b>12</b> may move distally to permit injection without engaging the swivable locking member <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, during use, the shield <b>16</b> is urged proximally from the first position to the second position. With sufficient proximal movement of the shield <b>16</b>, the needle <b>14</b> extends through the aperture <b>38</b> with the distal end <b>30</b> of the needle <b>14</b> being exposed for injection. The hub <b>12</b> is configured such that, with sufficient proximal movement of the shield <b>16</b> during injection, the hub <b>12</b> engages the locking finger <b>50</b> so as to cause displacement thereof. It is preferred that the hub <b>12</b> and the locking finger <b>50</b> be configured and positioned such that the shield <b>16</b> may have some proximal movement without the locking finger <b>50</b> being engaged. This ensures that a pre-determined amount of proximal movement of the shield <b>16</b> is required to engage the locking finger <b>50</b>, and thus activate the shielding mechanism of the safety needle assembly <b>10</b>. This also limits the possibility of unintended activation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>, with the locking finger <b>50</b> having been displaced, the swivable locking member <b>44</b> is no longer restrained by the locking finger <b>50</b>. After injection, and with the use of the secondary biasing element <b>40</b>, the shield <b>16</b> is urged to the shielding position with the swivable locking member <b>44</b> moving distally relative to the hub <b>12</b>. With the swivable locking member <b>44</b> moving clear of the hub <b>12</b>, the swivable locking member <b>44</b>, under force of the biasing element <b>20</b>, which may be in the form of the hinged connection <b>48</b>, urges the locking tongue <b>18</b> to the covering position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>. It is preferred that the swivable locking member <b>44</b> have sufficient height so as to permit movement of the locking tongue <b>18</b> once the distal end <b>30</b> of the needle <b>14</b> is located proximally of the locking tongue <b>18</b>. The swivable locking member <b>44</b> interferingly engages a portion of the hub <b>12</b> until the hub <b>12</b> is cleared beyond the height of the swivable locking member <b>44</b>. With this arrangement, the locking tongue <b>18</b> is caused to be displaced only once the needle <b>14</b> is clear thereof. It is preferred that the locking tongue <b>18</b> not strike or engage the needle <b>14</b> during an injection or prior to full shielding of the needle <b>14</b>. With the shielding state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the locking tongue <b>18</b> prevents the needle <b>14</b> from entering or passing through the aperture <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the locking tongue <b>18</b> is exposed through the aperture <b>38</b> after use. The locking tongue <b>18</b>, particularly the visible surface thereof, may be formed of a different material and/or color than the shield <b>16</b> so as to be readily discerned therefrom. The locking tongue <b>18</b>, thus, may act as a visual indicator that the safety needle assembly <b>10</b> has been used. The locking tongue <b>18</b>, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, may be adorned with various patterns, graphics or other indicia as an additional option or alternatively to that described above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">One or more windows <b>41</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be defined in the shield <b>16</b> to permit visual inspection of the needle <b>14</b>, before, during, or after use.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-26</figref>, with a second embodiment of the invention, a safety needle assembly <b>100</b> may be provided which is usable to shield the proximal end <b>32</b> of the needle <b>14</b>. Except as noted below, all discussion from above applies equally hereto. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, both the distal end <b>30</b> and the proximal end <b>32</b> of the needle <b>14</b> may be shielded. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, only the proximal end <b>32</b> of the needle <b>14</b> may be shielded.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-21</figref>, the safety needle assembly <b>100</b> includes a secondary shield <b>102</b>, having a secondary aperture <b>104</b> formed in a proximal end <b>106</b> thereof; a secondary locking tongue <b>108</b>; and, a supporting biasing element <b>110</b>. The safety needle assembly <b>100</b> preferably also includes a secondary supporting biasing element <b>112</b> formed to urge the secondary shield <b>102</b> in a proximal direction. Cooperating members <b>114</b> may be formed on the secondary shield <b>102</b> and the hub <b>12</b> which limit the proximal movement of the secondary shield <b>102</b> under force of the secondary supporting biasing element <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The secondary locking tongue <b>108</b> operates in the same fashion as the locking tongue <b>18</b>, except with reference to the secondary aperture <b>104</b> formed in the secondary shield <b>102</b> so as to provide selective access to the proximal end <b>32</b> of the needle <b>14</b>. The supporting biasing element <b>110</b> may be in the form of a hinge connection <b>116</b> formed in the same manner as the hinge connection <b>48</b>. In addition, a secondary swivable locking member <b>118</b>, a secondary base <b>120</b>, a secondary displaceable locking finger <b>122</b>, and a secondary free end <b>124</b> may be provided, all formed in the same manner as the corresponding elements described above. These elements, however, may be formed proportionately smaller due to the more restrictive area within the injection receiving portion <b>22</b> of the hub <b>12</b>. The elements are configured to move in concert with the secondary shield <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>20</b>, preferably, the secondary shield <b>102</b> is in an initial position with the proximal end <b>106</b> being located proximally of the proximal end <b>32</b> of the needle <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the proximal end <b>32</b> of the needle <b>14</b> may extend proximally beyond the proximal end <b>106</b> in the initial position. Also, the secondary locking tongue <b>108</b> is initially in an uncovered position where the proximal end <b>32</b> of the needle <b>14</b> may pass through the secondary aperture <b>104</b>. With mounting of the injector I into the injector receiving portion <b>22</b>, the secondary shield <b>102</b> shall be caused to move distally to a second position against force of the secondary supporting biasing element <b>112</b>. In the second position, the needle <b>14</b> extends through the secondary aperture <b>104</b> with the distal end <b>32</b> being beyond the secondary aperture <b>104</b> for use. With sufficient distal movement of the secondary shield <b>102</b>, a portion of the hub <b>12</b> is caused to engage the secondary displaceable locking finger <b>122</b> and cause displacement thereof. Preferably, a shaft <b>126</b> is provided on the hub <b>12</b> positioned and configured to engage the secondary displaceable locking finger <b>122</b>. In addition, the shaft <b>126</b> may interferingly engage the secondary swivable locking member <b>118</b> so as to prevent movement of the secondary locking tongue <b>108</b> to the covering position prior to the secondary locking tongue <b>108</b> being moved clear of the proximal end <b>32</b> of the needle <b>14</b>. In this manner, the secondary locking tongue <b>108</b> does not come into contact with the needle <b>14</b>.</p>
