<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of the prior Japanese Patent Application 2010-76652 filed on Mar. 30, 2010, so that the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a rotor of an electric rotating machine such as an alternator for a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An alternator mounted on a vehicle has a cylindrically-shaped stator and a rotor located in the center space of the stator. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view, partially in cross section, of a rotor of an alternator according to a prior art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a rotor <b>100</b> of an alternator has a rotational shaft <b>104</b> revolving on its shaft center, a single core layer <b>102</b> rotated on its central axis with the shaft <b>104</b>, slip rings <b>106</b> through which electric current flows to the core layer <b>102</b>, and fans <b>107</b> located on respective sides of the core layer <b>102</b> in the axial direction to cool the alternator. The core layer <b>102</b> has a single field coil <b>105</b> wound in a torus shape so as to place the shaft <b>104</b> on the central axis of the coil <b>105</b>, a first rotor core <b>110</b> located so as to surround the coil <b>105</b> on the first axial side of rotor <b>100</b>, and a second rotor core <b>111</b> located so as to surround the coil <b>105</b> on the second axial side of the rotor <b>100</b>. Both ends of the coil <b>105</b> are connected with the respective slip rings <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> is composed of a cylindrical portion located on the inner side of the coil <b>105</b> in the radial direction, a yoke portion extending from the cylindrical portion toward the outer side in the radial direction, and a plurality of magnetic poles <b>117</b> extending from the yoke portion so as to face the outer circumferential surface of the coil <b>105</b> on the outer side of the coil <b>105</b>. Each magnetic pole is formed in a claw shape. The magnetic poles of the core <b>110</b> and the magnetic poles of the core <b>111</b> are alternately arranged along the circumferential direction of the rotor <b>100</b>. Therefore, each core is called a Lundell type core or a pole core. For example, Published Japanese Patent First Publication No. H11-164499 discloses an alternator having this Lundell type core.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When a field current is supplied to the coil <b>105</b> of the rotor <b>100</b> through the slip rings <b>106</b>, a magnetic flux is generated by the coil <b>105</b> and passes through the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> and a core of the stator (not shown). This magnetic flux indirectly extends from one of two magnetic poles of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>, adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction, to the other pole through the stator core for each pair of poles, and directly extends from one of the cylindrical portions of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> to the other cylindrical portion. Therefore, a magnetic circuit is made up of the closed loop path of the magnetic flux extending between the rotor core <b>105</b> and the stator core.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, lines of magnetic force are induced in the alternator. These magnetic force lines pass through the cross sectional area of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> perpendicular to the path surrounding the coil <b>105</b> without crossing with one another. For example, the Publication (No. H11-164499) shows magnetic force lines of a magnetic circuit (see FIG. 1 to FIG. 6 of the Publication). Therefore, when the rotor <b>100</b> is rotated, electric power is electromagnetically generated in the alternator.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This type of alternator is always required to be lightened in weight or to increase the generated electric power. For example, in the alternator disclosed in the Publication (No. H11-164499), a diameter R<b>1</b> of a circle drawn by the rotated magnetic poles is defined as a rotational diameter of the magnetic poles (see FIG. 9 of the Publication), a diameter R<b>2</b> of outer circumferential surfaces of the cylindrical portions is defined as an outer circumferential diameter (see FIG. 9 of the Publication) of the cylindrical portions, and a ratio R<b>2</b>/R<b>1</b> of the outer circumferential diameter R<b>2</b> to the rotational diameter R<b>1</b> is set. Electric power generated per unit weight of the alternator is heightened at a specific ratio R<b>2</b>/R<b>1</b> ranging from 0.54 to 0.60 (see FIG. 11 of the Publication).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in the conventional alternator, as the path of the magnetic force line surrounding the coil <b>105</b> is further away from the coil <b>105</b>, the length of the magnetic path is increased, and magnetic reluctance or resistance along the magnetic path is increased. In other words, as the thickness of the rotor cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic force lines is increased, the length of the magnetic path on the outer circumferential side of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> far away from the coil <b>105</b> is increased, and magnetic reluctance or resistance on the outer circumferential side of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, although the cross sectional area of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> perpendicular to the magnetic paths is increased with the thickness of the rotor cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> so as to lower magnetic reluctance or resistance of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, the weight of the alternator is increased with the thickness of the rotor cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>, and magnetic reluctance or resistance on the outer circumferential side of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> is increased. In this case, to obtain a desired magnetic flux density in the alternator, the number of turns of a conductive line wound in the coil <b>105</b> and the field current supplied to the coil <b>105</b> are sometimes increased due to the high magnetic reluctance or resistance on the outer circumferential side of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, Published, Japanese Patent First Publication No. 2008-054392 corresponding to US Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0048516 A1 discloses an alternator in which a permanent magnet is fixedly located between two claw-shaped magnetic poles adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction for each pair of poles. In this alternator, the magnet between the magnetic poles acts so as to reduce a leaking magnetic flux directly passing between the magnetic poles. Therefore, the leaking magnetic flux not acting for the generation of electric power can be reduced, and electric power generated in the alternator can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, the weight of the alternator disclosed in the Publication (No. 2008-054392) is undesirably increased by the magnets, and it is required to stably fix the magnets in the rotor. In this case, the electric power generated per unit weight is sometimes reduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An object of the present invention is to provide, with due consideration to the drawbacks of the conventional alternator, a rotor of an electric rotating machine which is lightened in weight so as to increase electric power generated per unit weight of the machine or rotational force generated per unit weight.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an aspect of this invention, the object is achieved by the provision of a rotor of an electric rotating machine, comprising a laminated body, having a plurality of core layer units serially located along an axial direction so as to place an outer magnetic body on an outer side of the core layer units in a radial direction, that is rotatable about a center axis extending along the axial direction. Each of the core layer units comprises a field coil wound in a cylindrical shape around the center axis of the laminated body, a first rotor core located on a first axial side of the field coil in the axial direction, and a second rotor core located on a second axial side of the field coil in the axial direction. The field coil generates a magnetic flux, the first rotor core receives the magnetic flux, and the second rotor core receives the magnetic flux. Each of the rotor cores comprises a first yoke portion formed in a cylindrical shape so as to be located on an inner side of the field coil, a second yoke portion extending from the first yoke portion toward the outer side of the field coil, and a plurality of claw-shaped magnetic poles, located on the outermost side of the second yoke portion so as to alternately arrange the magnetic poles of the first rotor core and the magnetic poles of the second rotor core in a circumferential direction on the outer side of the field coil. The magnetic flux directly extends from one of the first yoke portions of the rotor cores of each core layer unit to the other first yoke portion. The first yoke portions of the laminated body have an outer circumferential diameter equal to a distance from the central axis of the laminated body to outer circumferential surfaces of the first yoke portions in the radial direction. The magnetic flux indirectly extends from one magnetic pole in each pair of magnetic poles of the rotor cores, adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction, to the other magnetic pole through the outer magnetic body located on the outer side of the magnetic poles. The magnetic poles of the laminated body have a rotational diameter equal to a distance from the central axis of the laminated body to the magnetic poles in the radial direction. A ratio of the outer circumferential diameter to the rotational diameter is lower than 0.54.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With this structure of the rotor, in each of the core layer units, a magnetic flux is generated by the field coil, directly extends from the first yoke portion of one rotor core to the first yoke portion of the other rotor core, and indirectly extends from one magnetic pole in each pair of magnetic poles of the rotor cores, adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction, to another magnetic pole through the outer magnetic body. Therefore, the magnetic fluxes, required of the machine to generate a desired level of electric power or a desired level of rotational force, are distributed to the core layer units.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this case, as compared with a conventional rotor having a single field coil and two rotor cores placing the coil between the cores, the number of turns in each field coil generating one of the distributed magnetic fluxes can be reduced so as to lighten the total weight of the field coils.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, because the core layer units are serially located along the axial direction, the length of each core layer unit in the axial direction is shortened, as compared with the conventional rotor. In this case, because the cores are necessarily thinned in the axial direction, the path of the magnetic flux passing through the cores while surrounding the field coil is shortened so as to reduce magnetic reluctance or resistance caused in the cores, and the difference in the path lengths of magnetic force lines in the cores is reduced so as to uniformly set the density of the magnetic flux in the cores. Therefore, the magnetic flux density can be heightened.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, the rotor can be lightened in weight or can increase the magnetic flux density so as to increase the electric power or the rotational force generated per unit weight in the machine.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals indicate like parts, members or elements throughout the specification unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of a rotor of an electric rotating machine according to the first embodiment, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side view, partially in cross section, of the rotor. An electric rotating machine is, for example, used as an alternator mounted on a vehicle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this alternator representing the machine has a rotor <b>1</b> and a cylindrically-shaped stator (not shown) surrounding the rotor <b>1</b> on the outer side of the rotor <b>1</b> in the radial direction of the rotor <b>1</b>. The rotor <b>1</b> has a laminated body <b>3</b> formed in a torus or cylindrical shape, a rotational shaft <b>4</b> located along the central axis of the body <b>3</b> so as to revolve on its shaft center, two slip rings <b>6</b> attached to the shaft <b>4</b> such that electric current flows to the body <b>3</b> through the rings <b>6</b>, fans <b>7</b> fixedly located on respective axial side surfaces of the body <b>3</b>, and a spacer <b>8</b> located between the body <b>3</b> and the shaft <b>4</b> and fixed to the body <b>3</b> and the shaft <b>4</b>. The spacer <b>8</b> is made of non-magnetic metallic material or resin, and the specific gravity of the spacer <b>8</b> can be lower than the specific gravity of the laminated body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, a pulley (not shown) is attached to the shaft <b>4</b> on a first axial side of the rotor <b>1</b> in the axial direction perpendicular to the radial direction. The slip rings <b>6</b> are located on a second axial side of the rotor <b>1</b> opposite to the first axial side. In response to the generation of a rotational force in an engine of the vehicle, this force is transmitted to the shaft <b>4</b> through the pulley, and the shaft <b>4</b> is rotated on its shaft center. Because the laminated body <b>3</b> and the spacer <b>8</b> are fixed to the shaft <b>4</b>, the rotor <b>1</b> is rotated as one body on the axis of rotation (i.e., the shaft center of the shaft <b>4</b>) by the force.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The laminated body <b>3</b> has a plurality of core layer units <b>2</b> (preferably, three core layer units <b>2</b> or more) serially located along the axial direction. Therefore, the alternator is formed in a tandem structure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exploded view of one of the core layer units <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each core layer unit <b>2</b> has a field coil <b>5</b> wound in a cylindrical shape, a first rotor core <b>10</b> located on the first axial side of the coil <b>5</b>, a second rotor core <b>10</b> located on the second axial side of the coil <b>5</b> so as to place the coil <b>5</b> between the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the axial direction, a first plate-shaped insulating member <b>12</b>A made of resin to electrically insulate the coil <b>5</b> from the core <b>10</b> on the first axial side of the coil <b>5</b>, a second plate-shaped insulating member <b>12</b>B made of resin to insulate the coil <b>5</b> from the core <b>11</b> on the second axial side of the coil <b>5</b>, and a ring-shaped body <b>13</b> made of non-magnetic material in a ring shape to be located between the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the axial direction and to be placed on the outer side of the coil <b>5</b> in the radial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The insulating members <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B are combined with each other as a bobbin <b>12</b>, and the coil <b>5</b> is wound on the bobbin <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a plan view of the rotor core <b>10</b> or <b>11</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a sectional view taken substantially along line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> are substantially formed in the same structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, each of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> is composed of a first yoke portion <b>15</b> formed in a cylindrical shape to face the spacer <b>8</b>, a second yoke portion <b>16</b> extending from the portion <b>15</b> toward the outer side, and a plurality of claw-shaped magnetic poles <b>17</b> extending from the portion <b>16</b> on the outermost side of the portion <b>16</b>. The poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> extend toward the second axial side, and the poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> extend toward the first axial side. Therefore, the rotor <b>1</b> has Lundell type cores or pole cores.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each portion <b>16</b> has a plurality of plate-shaped branches <b>18</b> branched out in all directions toward the outer side, and each magnetic pole <b>17</b> is located on the outermost end of one branch <b>18</b>. Therefore, a fan-shaped planar space <b>19</b> is formed between two branches <b>18</b> adjacent to each other in each pair.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> and the magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> in each core layer unit <b>2</b> are alternately arranged along the circumferential direction perpendicular to the radial and axial directions. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in each pair of two core layer units <b>2</b> adjacent to each other in the axial direction, each magnetic pole <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> in the unit <b>2</b> located on the first axial side is substantially placed at the same position in the circumferential direction as the position of one magnetic pole <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> in the other unit <b>2</b> located on the second axial side. Therefore, the second yoke portions <b>16</b> of the core <b>11</b> in the unit <b>2</b> located on the first axial side face the respective second yoke portions <b>16</b> of the core <b>11</b> in the other unit <b>2</b>, located on the second axial side, in the axial direction.</p>

In other words, the field coils <b>5</b> have an inner diameter R<b>2</b>. The diameter R<b>1</b> is defined as a distance from the rotation axis of the rotor <b>1</b> (i.e., the central axis of the laminated body <b>3</b>) to the magnetic poles <b>17</b> in the radial direction.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the insulating portion <b>22</b> of the member <b>12</b>A has a plurality of hooks <b>27</b> located along the circumferential direction on the outer side, and each hook <b>27</b> is located on side ends of two branches <b>25</b>A facing each other in the circumferential direction.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an exploded view explanatorily showing the coils <b>5</b> of the core layer units <b>2</b> serially connected with one another through the crossover lines <b>32</b> and the leading lines <b>33</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in each pair of two core layer units <b>2</b> adjacent to each other in the axial direction, the coils <b>5</b> of the core layer units <b>2</b> are electrically connected with each other through the crossover line <b>32</b> extending from the innermost side of the coil <b>5</b> of the core layer unit <b>2</b> located on the first axial side and extending from the outermost side of the coil <b>5</b> of the core layer unit <b>2</b> located on the second axial side. The coil <b>5</b> of the core layer unit <b>2</b> located at one end of the laminated body <b>3</b> on the first axial side is electrically connected with one slip ring <b>6</b> through the leading line <b>33</b> (hereinafter, called the leading line <b>33</b><i>a</i>) extending from the outermost side of the coil <b>5</b>. The coil <b>5</b> of the core layer unit <b>2</b> located at the other end of the laminated body <b>3</b> on the second axial side is electrically connected with the other slip ring <b>6</b> through the leading line <b>33</b> (hereinafter, called the leading line <b>33</b><i>b</i>) extending from the innermost side of the coil <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Therefore, one conductive line is formed by the leading line <b>33</b><i>a</i>, the coil <b>5</b> of the core layer unit <b>2</b> located at the end of the laminated body <b>3</b> on the first axial side, the crossover lines <b>32</b> and the coils <b>5</b> of the other core layer units <b>2</b>, and the leading line <b>33</b><i>b </i>arranged in that order.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When a field current is supplied to the coils <b>5</b> serially connected with one another by the crossover lines <b>32</b> and the leading lines <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>through the slip rings <b>6</b>, a magnetic flux is generated by the coil <b>5</b> in each core layer unit <b>2</b>. This generated magnetic flux indirectly extends from one magnetic pole <b>17</b> in each pair of magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction, to the other magnetic pole <b>17</b> through a core (i.e., an outer magnetic body) of the stator located on the outer side of the poles <b>17</b>, and directly extends from one of the first yoke portions <b>15</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> to the other first yoke portion <b>15</b>. Therefore, a magnetic circuit is made up of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> and the stator core. When the shaft <b>4</b> is rotated by a rotational force generated in an engine of the vehicle while the field current is supplied to the coils <b>5</b> of the core layer units <b>2</b> through the rings <b>6</b>, electric power is generated in a coil (not shown) wound on the stator core.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, in the rotor <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the core layer units <b>2</b> are serially located along the axial direction, and the rotational diameter R<b>1</b> of the magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> and the outer circumferential diameter R<b>2</b> of the first yoke portions <b>15</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> satisfy the ratio R<b>2</b>/R<b>1</b> lower than 0.54. Accordingly, as compared with the prior art, the magnetic flux density (or magnetic induction) in the rotor <b>1</b> can be heightened so as to generate higher electric power, and the weight of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the laminated body <b>3</b> can be reduced so as to heighten electric power generated per unit weight of the alternator.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">More specifically, because the rotor <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has only the single core layer unit composed of the coil <b>105</b> and the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>, the thickness of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> becomes large. In this case, paths of magnetic force lines passing through the thickened cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> while surrounding the coil <b>105</b> are lengthened, so that magnetic reluctance or resistance along the magnetic paths is inevitably increased so as to lower the density of magnetic flux in the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>. Further, as the magnetic force line passing through the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> is further away from the coil <b>105</b>, the length of the magnetic force line is increased. Therefore, the difference in the lengths of the magnetic force lines passing through the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> becomes large, so that the magnetic flux density cannot be uniformly set in the thickened cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">To achieve a high average density of magnetic flux for the purpose of obtaining a desired level of electric power or rotational force in an alternator having the rotor <b>100</b>, it is inevitably required to increase the number of turns in the coil <b>105</b> and/or to heighten the field current supplied to the coil <b>105</b>. As a result, the weight of the rotor <b>100</b> is increased, and electric power cannot be efficiently generated.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In contrast, in the rotor <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, many core layer units <b>2</b> (preferably, three core layer units <b>2</b> or more) are serially located along the axial direction, and electric power is generated in the stator surrounding the units <b>2</b> due to the electromagnetic interaction between the stator and each unit <b>2</b>. Because the length of each unit <b>2</b> in the axial direction is shortened, the thickness of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the axial direction becomes small. In this case, in each core layer unit <b>2</b>, the distance from the coil <b>5</b> to lines of magnetic force passing through the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> becomes short so as to shorten paths of the magnetic force lines surrounding the coil <b>5</b>. Therefore, magnetic reluctance or resistance along the magnetic paths can be considerably reduced. Accordingly, the magnetic flux density (or magnetic induction) can be efficiently heightened in response to the field current supplied to the coil <b>5</b>, and electric power can be efficiently generated. Further, because the thickness of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the axial direction is small, the difference in the magnetic paths is reduced. Therefore, in each core layer unit <b>2</b>, the magnetic flux density can be uniformly set in the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. Accordingly, electric power can be further efficiently generated.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, because many core layer units <b>2</b> are serially located along the axial direction, the thickness of the second yoke portions <b>16</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the axial direction becomes small, the length of the first yoke portions <b>15</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the axial direction is shortened, and the length of the magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the axial direction is shortened. Because of the portions <b>16</b> thinned in the axial direction, the thickness of the portions <b>15</b> in the radial direction can be reduced, and the thickness of the magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the radial direction can be reduced. Therefore, the total weight of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the rotor <b>1</b> can be considerably reduced as compared with the total weight of the cores <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> of the rotor <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Accordingly, the rotor <b>1</b> can be lightened in weight, and electric power generated per unit weight of the alternator can be heightened.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Moreover, the spacer <b>8</b> having the specific gravity lower than the specific gravity of the units <b>2</b> is located in the inner side of the core layer units <b>2</b> in the radial direction. Therefore, the length of the second yoke portions <b>16</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the radial direction can be reduced. Accordingly, the rotor <b>1</b> can be further lightened in weight.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Furthermore, in the alternator <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the electric power generated per unit weight reaches a highest value at the ratio R<b>2</b>/R<b>1</b> set at 0.56. However, in the alternator according to this embodiment, because of the reduction of magnetic reluctance or resistance and the lightening of the weight, the electric power generated per unit weight at the ratio R<b>2</b>/R<b>1</b> lower than 0.54 can be set to be higher than the highest value in the alternator <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Still further, because the thickness of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> is considerably reduced, eddy current is hardly generated in the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the loss of magnetic energy can be reduced so as to efficiently generate electric power.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Still further, the length of the magnetic poles <b>17</b> in the axial direction is considerably reduced. Therefore, even when the magnetic poles <b>17</b> receives the centrifugal force caused during the rotation of the rotor <b>1</b> and/or the magnetic attractive force applied from the stator core, the inclination of the magnetic poles <b>17</b> to the radial direction hardly occurs, and the magnetic poles <b>17</b> can be stably positioned. Accordingly, the rotor <b>1</b> can be rotated at a high speed with a high margin of safety, and the damage occurring in the alternator can be sufficiently prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Still further, the centrifugal force and the magnetic attractive force applied to the magnetic poles <b>17</b> induce the poles <b>17</b> to be shifted or inclined to the outer side, this shifting or inclination of the poles <b>17</b> induces the second yoke portions <b>16</b> of the cores <b>10</b> to be bent toward the first axial side and induce the second yoke portions <b>16</b> of the cores <b>11</b> to be bent toward the second axial side. To prevent the deformation of the poles <b>17</b> and the portions <b>16</b>, in each pair of two core layer units <b>2</b> adjacent to each other in the axial direction, each magnetic pole <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> in the unit <b>2</b> allocated on the first axial side is substantially placed at the same position in the circumferential direction as the position of one magnetic pole <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> in the other unit <b>2</b> allocated on the second axial side (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In other words, the magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> in the unit <b>2</b> allocated on the first axial side face, in the axial direction, the respective magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> in the other unit <b>2</b> allocated on the second axial side. Therefore, each of the magnetic poles <b>17</b> facing each other in the axial direction prevents the bending of the other pole <b>17</b> against the centrifugal force and the magnetic attractive force. Because of this prevention, the shifting or inclination of the poles <b>17</b> to the outer side can be suppressed in the rotor <b>1</b>, and the deformation of the portions <b>16</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> can be suppressed. Accordingly, noise caused by the deformation of the portions <b>16</b> and the poles <b>17</b> can be reduced, and the durability of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the rotor <b>1</b> can be heightened.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Still further, the body <b>13</b> is located on the second axial side of the core <b>10</b> and on the inner side of the magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> as a first non-magnetic member so as to be in contact with the second yoke portion <b>16</b> of the core <b>10</b> while pressing the portion <b>16</b> from the second axial side, and the body <b>13</b> is located on the first axial side of the core <b>11</b> and on the inner side of the magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> as a second non-magnetic member so as to be in contact with the second yoke portion <b>16</b> of the core <b>11</b> while pressing the portion <b>16</b> from the first axial side (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>). Accordingly, without influencing the magnetic flux extending from one pole <b>17</b> in each pair of poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction, to the other pole <b>17</b> through the stator core, the body <b>13</b> can suppress the deformation of the portions <b>16</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> so as to heighten the stiffness of the portions <b>16</b>, and can further suppress the deformation of the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> so as to heighten the stiffness of the poles <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Assuming that a plurality of non-magnetic members separated from one another are located on the second axial side of the core <b>10</b> and on the inner side of the respective magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> in place of the body <b>13</b> so as to be in contact with the portion <b>16</b> of the core <b>10</b>, there is high probability that the non-magnetic members are shifted toward the outer side due to the centrifugal force so as to press the poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> toward the outer side. Further, assuming that a plurality of non-magnetic members separated from one another are located on the first axial side of the core <b>11</b> and on the inner side of the respective magnetic poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> in place of the body <b>13</b> so as to be in contact with the portion <b>16</b> of the core <b>11</b>, there is high probability that the non-magnetic members are shifted toward the outer side due to the centrifugal force so as to press the poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> toward the outer side. However, in this embodiment, because the body <b>13</b> not divided is located in each unit <b>2</b>, there is no probability that the body <b>13</b> applies the pressing force to the poles <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Still further, because the body <b>13</b> is formed in a ring shape as one body, the deformation of the body <b>13</b> toward the outer side, induced by the centrifugal force, can be prevented. Therefore, the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> located on the outer side of the body <b>13</b> receive no load from the body <b>13</b>. Accordingly, the body <b>13</b> can heighten the stiffness of the portions <b>16</b> and the poles <b>17</b> without applying any load to the poles <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Still further, the crossover lines <b>32</b> and the leading line <b>33</b><i>a </i>are placed on the inner side of the body <b>13</b>. Therefore, the body <b>13</b> can prevent the crossover lines <b>32</b> and the leading line <b>33</b><i>a </i>from being shifted toward the outer side by the centrifugal force. Accordingly, the disconnection of the crossover line <b>32</b> or the leading line <b>33</b><i>a </i>can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Still further, the crossover lines <b>32</b> and the leading line <b>33</b><i>a </i>are caught by the portions <b>30</b> of the hooks <b>27</b>. Therefore, the crossover lines <b>32</b> and the leading line <b>33</b><i>a </i>can be reliably fixed to the bobbins <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the disconnection of the crossover line <b>32</b> or the leading line <b>33</b><i>a </i>can be further prevented.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a side view, partially in cross section, of a rotor of an electric rotating machine according to the second embodiment.

More specifically, each core layer unit <b>2</b> has a field coil <b>5</b>A, a first rotor core <b>10</b>A, a second rotor core <b>11</b>A, a ring-shaped body <b>13</b>A and a bobbin (not shown) assembled in the same manner as those in the unit <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The coil <b>5</b>A has an inner diameter and an outer diameter smaller than those in the coil <b>5</b> so as to approach the shaft <b>4</b>. Each of the rotors <b>10</b>A and <b>11</b>A has a first yoke portion <b>15</b>A having an outer diameter R<b>2</b> smaller than that of the portion <b>15</b>, a second yoke portion <b>16</b>A extending from the portion <b>15</b>A toward the outer side so as to substantially have the same outer diameter as that of the portion <b>16</b>, and the magnetic poles <b>17</b> extending from the outer end of the portion <b>16</b>A. The rotational diameter R<b>1</b>, the structure and the arrangement of the poles <b>17</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are substantially the same as those of the poles <b>17</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Although the outer diameter of the body <b>13</b>A is substantially the same as the outer diameter of the body <b>13</b>, the body <b>13</b>A has an inner diameter larger than the inner diameter of the body <b>13</b> so as to be placed between the coil <b>5</b>A and the poles <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">With this structure of the rotor <b>1</b>A, the coil <b>5</b>A of each unit <b>2</b> is located near to the shaft <b>4</b> and has the number of turns which is substantially the same as the number of turns in the coil <b>5</b>. Therefore, the weight of each coil <b>5</b>A can be considerably reduced as compared with the weight of the coil <b>5</b>, and the coil <b>5</b>A can generate the magnetic flux at a desired density when a field current set at the same value as that supplied to the coil <b>5</b> is supplied to the coil <b>5</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Further, although the length of the portions <b>16</b>A of the cores <b>10</b>A and <b>11</b>A and the width of the body <b>13</b>A in the radial direction are increased as compared with those in the rotor <b>1</b>, the rotor <b>1</b>A is lightened in weight because of the weight reduction in the coils <b>5</b>A, the thinned portions <b>16</b>A and the low specific gravity of the body <b>13</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Accordingly, in the same manner as in the rotor <b>1</b>, the generated electric power per unit weight in the rotor <b>1</b>A can be increased as compared with the rotor in the prior art.</p>

For example, each pole <b>17</b>B has only one step at each stepped end so as to have one tread surface <b>35</b>B at each stepped end, and each pole <b>17</b>C has only one step at each stepped end so as to have one tread surface <b>35</b>C at each stepped end.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The poles <b>17</b>B of the core <b>10</b> and the poles <b>17</b>C of the core <b>11</b> in each core layer unit <b>2</b> are alternately arranged along the circumferential directions. Each pole <b>17</b>B of the core <b>10</b> in each unit <b>2</b> is substantially placed at the same position in the circumferential direction as the position of one pole <b>17</b>B of the core <b>10</b> in any of the other units <b>2</b>. Therefore, the poles <b>17</b>B of the cores <b>10</b> of the units <b>2</b> are aligned along the axial direction at each of the positions in the circumferential direction to form a series of poles <b>17</b>B at each position in the circumferential direction, and the poles <b>17</b>C of the cores <b>11</b> of the units <b>2</b> are aligned along the axial direction at each of the other positions in the circumferential direction to form a series of poles <b>17</b>C at each position in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The rotor <b>1</b>B further has a reinforcing member <b>36</b> located between one series of poles <b>17</b>B and one series of poles <b>17</b>C, adjacent to each other as a pair in the circumferential direction so as to be in contact with the tread surfaces <b>35</b>B and <b>35</b>C of the poles <b>17</b>B and <b>17</b>C in the axial direction. The member <b>36</b> is shaped so as to substantially form no space between the series of poles <b>17</b>B and the series of poles <b>17</b>C. One reinforcing member <b>36</b> is located in the rotor <b>1</b>B every two pairs. For example, in the counterclockwise direction when the rotor <b>1</b>B is seen from the second axial side to the first axial side, the reinforcing member <b>36</b> is fitted to the series of poles <b>17</b>B and the series of poles <b>17</b>C, arranged in the order of the series of poles <b>17</b>B and the series of poles <b>17</b>C along the counterclockwise direction, but no reinforcing member is located between the series of poles <b>17</b>B and the series of poles <b>17</b>C, arranged in the order of the series of poles <b>17</b>C and the series of poles <b>17</b>B along the counterclockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Because the members <b>36</b> are in contact with the tread surfaces <b>35</b>B and <b>35</b>C of all poles <b>17</b>B and <b>17</b>C in the axial direction, the members <b>36</b> can directly prevent the poles <b>17</b>B and <b>170</b> of the rotor <b>1</b>B from being shifted to the axial direction due to the centrifugal force and the magnetic attractive force exerted on the poles <b>17</b>B and <b>17</b>C. Because of this prevent ion, the deformation of the second yoke portions <b>16</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> along the axial direction can be suppressed in the rotor <b>1</b>B. Accordingly, noise caused by the deformation of the portions <b>16</b> and the poles <b>17</b>B and <b>17</b>C during the rotation of the rotor <b>1</b>B can be reduced, and the durability of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the rotor <b>1</b>B can be heightened.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In this embodiment, one reinforcing member <b>36</b> is located in the rotor <b>1</b>B every two pairs. However, one reinforcing member <b>36</b> may be located in the rotor <b>1</b>B every pair of one series of poles <b>17</b>B and one series of poles <b>17</b>C adjacent to each other along the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, each reinforcing member <b>36</b> extends to all core layer units <b>2</b>. However, one reinforcing member <b>36</b> may be located between one pole <b>17</b>B and one pole <b>17</b>C, adjacent to each other as a pair in each core layer unit <b>2</b> along the circumferential direction, for each pair of poles <b>17</b>B and <b>17</b>C or every two pairs of poles <b>17</b>B and <b>17</b>C.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a side view, partially in cross section, of a rotor of an electric rotating machine according to the fourth embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a rotor <b>1</b>C differs from the rotor <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in that the rotor <b>1</b>C has another ring-shaped body <b>38</b> made of magnetic material without locating any spacer between the shaft <b>4</b> and the laminated body <b>3</b>. More specifically, each core layer unit <b>2</b> has the coil <b>5</b>, a first rotor core <b>10</b>C, a second rotor core <b>11</b>C, the body <b>13</b> and the bobbin <b>12</b> (not shown) assembled in the same manner as those in the unit <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Each of the rotors <b>10</b>C and <b>11</b>C has a first yoke portion <b>15</b>C having an outer diameter R<b>2</b> smaller than that of the portion <b>15</b> so as to be fitted to the shaft <b>4</b>, a second yoke portion <b>16</b>C extending from the portion <b>15</b>C toward the outer side so as to substantially have the same outer diameter as that of the portion <b>16</b>, and the magnetic poles <b>17</b> extending from the outer end of the portion <b>16</b>C. The body <b>38</b> is located between the portions <b>16</b>C of the cores <b>10</b>C and <b>11</b>C in the axial directions and is located between the coil <b>5</b> and the portions <b>15</b>C of the cores <b>10</b>C and <b>11</b>C in the radial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">With this structure of the rotor <b>1</b>C, a magnetic flux passes through the body <b>38</b> and the portions <b>15</b>C of the cores <b>10</b>C and <b>11</b>C. Therefore, as compared with the sectional area of the magnetic flux in the portions <b>15</b> according to the first embodiment, the sectional area of the magnetic flux in the body <b>38</b> and the portions <b>15</b>C is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Therefore, the magnetic reluctance or resistance in a magnetic circuit made up in each core layer unit <b>2</b> can be reduced. Due to this reduction of the magnetic reluctance or resistance, the magnetic flux density can be increased so as to heighten electric power generated in the stator core surrounding the rotor <b>1</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, the body <b>38</b> placed on the outer side of the portions <b>15</b>C of the cores <b>10</b>C and <b>11</b>C prevents the cores <b>10</b>C and <b>11</b>C from being moved toward the outer side due to the centrifugal force and the magnetic attractive force exerted on the poles <b>17</b>. Accordingly, the rotor <b>1</b>C can be further stably rotated.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> is an exploded view of rotor cores of two core layer units adjacent to each other according to the fifth embodiment, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> is a perspective side view of two adjacent core layer units, in which two magnetic poles magnetized in different polarities face each other, according to the fifth embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, each magnetic pole <b>17</b> extending in the axial direction is bent toward the inner side to have a contacting portion <b>40</b> at the tip of the pole <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, in each pair of two core layer units adjacent to each other in the axial direction, each magnetic pole <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> of the unit <b>2</b> located on the first axial side is substantially placed at the same position in the circumferential direction as the position of one magnetic pole <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> of the unit <b>2</b> located on the second axial side. Therefore, the contacting portions <b>40</b> of the poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> in the unit <b>2</b> located on the first axial side are in contact with the respective contacting portions <b>40</b> of the poles <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> in the unit <b>2</b>, located on the second axial side, in the axial direction. Further, due to the positioning of the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, the branches <b>18</b> of the second yoke portion <b>16</b> of the core <b>11</b> in the unit <b>2</b> located on the first axial side are in contact with the respective branches <b>18</b> of the second yoke portion <b>16</b> of the core <b>10</b> in the unit <b>2</b>, located on the second axial side, in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In each unit <b>2</b>, each contacting portion <b>40</b> of the core <b>10</b> is hooked on the body <b>13</b> from the second axial side, and each contacting portion <b>40</b> of the core <b>11</b> is hooked on the body <b>13</b> from the first axial side.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">With this structure of the rotor <b>1</b>C, the direction of lines of magnetic force induced in the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> is opposite to the direction of lines of magnetic force induced in the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>11</b>. In this case, in response to the supply of a field current to the coils <b>5</b> of the units <b>2</b>, the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> are magnetized in one polarity, and the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>11</b> are magnetized in another polarity different from the polarity of the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Further, in each pair of two core layer units <b>2</b> adjacent to each other in the axial direction, the contact portion <b>40</b> of each pole <b>17</b> of the core <b>10</b> in the unit <b>2</b> located on the first axial side is in contact with the contact portion <b>40</b> of one pole <b>17</b> of the core <b>11</b> in the unit <b>2</b>, located on the second axial side, in the axial direction. These poles <b>17</b> having the contact portions <b>40</b> being in contact with each other in the axial direction are placed at the same position in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">When the field current is supplied to the coils <b>5</b>, two poles <b>17</b> in each pair of poles <b>17</b> of two cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> substantially placed at the same position in the circumferential direction in two units <b>2</b> adjacent to each other in the axial direction are magnetized in different polarities so as to tightly attach the contact portions <b>40</b> of the poles <b>17</b> to each other. Therefore, the portions <b>40</b> of the poles <b>17</b> attached to each other directly prevent the poles <b>17</b> from being deformed along the axial direction due to the centrifugal force and the magnetic attractive force exerted on the poles <b>17</b>. Further, the portions <b>40</b> of the poles <b>17</b> prevent the second yoke portions <b>16</b> of the poles <b>17</b> from being deformed along the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Accordingly, noise caused by the deformation of the portions <b>16</b> and the poles <b>17</b> during the rotation of the rotor <b>1</b> can be reduced, and the durability of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in the rotor <b>1</b> can be heightened.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Modifications</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In these embodiments, the crossover lines <b>32</b> and the leading line <b>33</b><i>a </i>are caught by the bending portions <b>30</b> of the hooks <b>27</b>. However, at least one crossover line <b>32</b> or the leading line <b>33</b><i>a </i>may be caught by the portion <b>29</b> of the hook <b>27</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Further, in the fifth embodiment, each of the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> has one contact portion <b>40</b>. However, each pole <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> may have one contact portion <b>40</b> while none of the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>11</b> has a contact portion, or each pole <b>17</b> of the cores <b>11</b> may have one contact portion <b>40</b> while none of the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> has a contact portion. Because two poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> facing each other in two units <b>2</b> adjacent to each other in the axial direction are magnetized in different polarities, the poles <b>17</b> of the cores <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> can be magnetically attached to each other even when one of the poles <b>17</b> has no contact portion.</p>
