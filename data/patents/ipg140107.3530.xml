<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-121911, filed on May 27, 2010; and Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-093245, filed on Apr. 19, 2011, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus and a magnetic resonance imaging method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As an image taking method related to magnetic resonance imaging apparatuses, a method called &#x201c;Fast Spin Echo (FSE) method&#x201d; is conventionally known. The FSE method is an image taking method by which a plurality of echo signals called an echo train are collected by applying a flip pulse to an examined subject and then sequentially applying a plurality of flop pulses to the examined subject. In this situation, the flip pulse is a Radio Frequency (RF) pulse used for exiting atomic nuclear spins within the examined subject. The flop pulses are RF pulses used for refocusing phases of the atomic nuclear spins.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the FSE method described above, because the plurality of RF pulses are applied, a stimulated echo is generated together with a spin echo. In some situations, the stimulated echo causes a phase shift in the collected echo signals. Such phase differences among the echo signals may be a cause of degradations of image quality such as sensitivity unevenness, lowering of signal strength, &#x201c;ghost&#x201d; phenomena, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To prevent such degradations of the image quality, generally speaking, a pre-scan for measuring the phase differences among the echo signals is performed prior to a main scan, so that a pulse sequence for the main scan can be corrected based on the phase differences measured during the pre-scan. In this situation, for example, a pulse sequence that cancels the stimulated echo is executed during the pre-scan so that only the spin echo is collected. Further, of the spin echo collected during the pre-scan, the first and the second echo signals are Fourier-transformed in a readout direction, so that a zero-order phase difference and a first-order phase difference between the first echo signal and the second echo signal can be calculated. After that, a correction amount is calculated so as to correct a readout direction phase shift and a slice selecting direction phase shift, based on the zero-order phase difference and the first-order phase difference being calculated. The pulse sequence for the main scan is changed, based on the calculated correction amount.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, according to the conventional technique described above, the phase differences among the collected echo signals may vary in some situations, depending on the type of the image taking method being implemented. In those situations, there is a possibility that the pulse sequence used for the main scan may not be properly corrected and that the image quality may be degraded.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A magnetic resonance imaging apparatus according to an embodiment includes an executing unit, a calculating unit, and a correcting unit. The executing unit executes a pre-scan while using a pulse sequence by which a plurality of echo signals are collected. The calculating unit calculates a phase difference between at least two echo signals of which a fluctuation of phase differences is stable and that are selected out of the plurality of echo signals collected during the pre-scan and are selected while excluding echo signals collected during an initial time period.

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following sections, exemplary embodiments of a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus and a magnetic resonance imaging method will be explained in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the description of the exemplary embodiments below, a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus will be referred to as an &#x201c;MRI apparatus&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of an MRI apparatus according to an embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an MRI apparatus <b>100</b> includes a static magnetic field magnet <b>1</b>, a gradient coil <b>2</b>, a gradient magnetic field power supply <b>3</b>, a couch <b>4</b>, a couch control unit <b>5</b>, a transmission Radio Frequency (RF) coil <b>6</b>, a transmitting unit <b>7</b>, reception RF coil <b>8</b>, a receiving unit <b>9</b>, a sequence control unit <b>10</b>, and a computer system <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The static magnetic field magnet <b>1</b> is a magnet formed in the shape of a hollow circular cylinder and generates a uniform static magnetic field in the space on the inside thereof. The static magnetic field magnet <b>1</b> may be configured by using, for example, a permanent magnet, a superconductive magnet, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The gradient coil <b>2</b> is a coil formed in the shape of a hollow circular cylinder and is disposed on the inside of the static magnetic field magnet <b>1</b>. The gradient coil <b>2</b> is formed by combining three coils corresponding to X-, Y-, and Z-axes that are orthogonal to one another. These three coils individually receive a supply of electric current from the gradient magnetic field power supply <b>3</b> (explained later) and generate gradient magnetic fields of which the magnetic field intensities change along the X-, Y-, and Z-axes. It is assumed that the Z-axis direction is the same as the direction of the static magnetic field. The gradient magnetic field power supply <b>3</b> supplies the electric current to the gradient coil <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this situation, the gradient magnetic fields on the X-, Y-, and Z-axes that are generated by the gradient coil <b>2</b> correspond to, for example, a slice selecting gradient magnetic field Gs which is used for slice selecting, a phase encoding gradient magnetic field Ge which is used for phase encoding, and a readout gradient magnetic field Gr which is used for readout, respectively. The slice selecting gradient magnetic field Gs is used for determining an imaging cross section in an arbitrary manner. The phase encoding gradient magnetic field Ge is used for changing the phase of a magnetic resonance signal according to a spatial position. The readout gradient magnetic field Gr is used for changing the frequency of a magnetic resonance signal according to a spatial position.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The couch <b>4</b> includes a couchtop <b>4</b><i>a </i>on which an examined subject P is placed. Under control of the couch control unit <b>5</b> (explained later), while the examined subject P is placed thereon, the couchtop <b>4</b><i>a </i>is inserted into the hollow (i.e., an image taking opening) of the gradient coil <b>2</b>. Normally, the couch <b>4</b> is provided so that the longitudinal direction thereof extends parallel to the central axis of the static magnetic field magnet <b>1</b>. The couch control unit <b>5</b> is a device that controls the couch <b>4</b>, under control of a control unit <b>26</b>. The couch control unit <b>5</b> drives the couch <b>4</b> so that the couchtop <b>4</b><i>a </i>moves in the longitudinal direction and in an up-and-down direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The transmission RF coil <b>6</b> is disposed on the inside of the gradient coil <b>2</b> and generates a high frequency magnetic field by receiving a supply of a high frequency pulse from the transmitting unit <b>7</b>. The transmitting unit <b>7</b> transmits the high frequency pulse corresponding to a Larmor frequency to the transmission RF coil <b>6</b>. The reception RF coil <b>8</b> is disposed on the inside of the gradient coil <b>2</b> and receives a magnetic resonance signal emitted from the examined subject P due to an influence of the high frequency magnetic field described above. When having received the magnetic resonance signal, the reception RF coil <b>8</b> outputs the received magnetic resonance signal to the receiving unit <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Based on the magnetic resonance signal being output from the reception RF coil <b>8</b>, the receiving unit <b>9</b> generates magnetic resonance (MR) signal data. The receiving unit <b>9</b> generates the MR signal data by applying a digital conversion to the magnetic resonance signal being output from the reception RF coil <b>8</b>. The MR signal data is brought into correspondence with information about spatial frequencies in a phase encoding direction, a readout direction, and a slice encoding direction by the slice selecting gradient magnetic field Gs, the phase encoding gradient magnetic field Ge, and the readout gradient magnetic field Gr described above and is disposed in a k-space. When having generated the MR signal data, the receiving unit <b>9</b> transmits the generated MR signal data to the sequence control unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The sequence control unit <b>10</b> performs a scanning process on the examined subject P, by driving the gradient magnetic field power supply <b>3</b>, the transmitting unit <b>7</b>, and the receiving unit <b>9</b>, based on sequence execution data transmitted from the computer system <b>20</b>. In this situation, the sequence execution data is information that defines a pulse sequence indicating a procedure for performing the scanning process on the examined subject P, such as the intensity of the electric power supply to be supplied by the gradient magnetic field power supply <b>3</b> to the gradient coil <b>2</b> and the timing with which the electric power supply is to be supplied; the strength of the RF signal to be transmitted by the transmitting unit <b>7</b> to the transmission RF coil <b>6</b> and the timing with which the RF signal is to be transmitted; and the timing with which the magnetic resonance signal is to be detected by the receiving unit <b>9</b>. When the MR signal data is transmitted from the receiving unit <b>9</b> after the sequence control unit <b>10</b> drives the gradient magnetic field power supply <b>3</b>, the transmitting unit <b>7</b>, and the receiving unit <b>9</b> based on the sequence execution data, the sequence control unit <b>10</b> transfers the MR signal data to the computer system <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The computer system <b>20</b> exercises overall control of the MRI apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, the computer system <b>20</b> performs the scanning process on the examined subject P and performs an image reconstruction process, by driving the constituent elements included in the MRI apparatus <b>100</b>. The computer system <b>20</b> includes an interface unit <b>21</b>, an image reconstruction unit <b>22</b>, a storage unit <b>23</b>, an input unit <b>24</b>, a display unit <b>25</b>, and the control unit <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The interface unit <b>21</b> controls inputs and outputs of various types of signals that are transmitted to and received from the sequence control unit <b>10</b>. For example, the interface unit <b>21</b> transmits the sequence execution data to the sequence control unit <b>10</b> and receives the MR signal data from the sequence control unit <b>10</b>. When having received the MR signal data, the interface unit <b>21</b> stores the received MR signal data into the storage unit <b>23</b>, for each examined subject P.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The image reconstruction unit <b>22</b> generates spectrum data or image data corresponding to desired nuclear spins occurring within the examined subject P, by applying a post-processing process (i.e., a reconstruction process such as a Fourier transform) to the MR signal data stored in the storage unit <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The storage unit <b>23</b> stores therein various types of data and various types of computer programs that are required in processes (explained later) performed by the control unit <b>26</b>. For example, the storage unit <b>23</b> stores therein, for each examined subject P, the MR signal data received by the interface unit <b>21</b>, the spectrum data and/or the image data generated by the image reconstruction unit <b>22</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The input unit <b>24</b> receives various types of instructions and inputs of information from an operator of the MRI apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, the input unit <b>24</b> may be configured by using any of the following as appropriate: a pointing device such as a mouse and/or a trackball; a selecting device such as a mode changing switch; and an input device such as a keyboard.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Under control of the control unit <b>26</b>, the display unit <b>25</b> displays various types of information such as the spectrum data or the image data. The display unit <b>25</b> may be configured by using a display device such as a liquid crystal display monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The control unit <b>26</b> includes a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a memory, and the like (not shown) and exercises overall control of the MRI apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, the control unit <b>26</b> controls the scanning process by generating various types of sequence execution data based on an imaging condition that is input by the operator via the input unit <b>24</b> and transmitting the generated sequence execution data to the sequence control unit <b>10</b>. Also, when the MR signal data is sent from the sequence control unit <b>10</b> as a result of the scanning process, the control unit <b>26</b> controls the image reconstruction unit <b>22</b> so that an image is restructured based on the MR signal data.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The configuration of the MRI apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment has thus been explained. The MRI apparatus <b>100</b> configured as described above performs a pre-scan while using a pulse sequence by which a plurality of echo signals are collected.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this situation, when an image taking process is performed while using a conventional FSE method together with, for example, a Variable Flip Angle (VFA) method, it has been known that the phase differences among the collected echo signals vary. The FSE method in this situation is an image taking method by which a plurality of echo signals called an echo train are collected by applying an flip pulse for excitation to an examined subject and then sequentially applying a plurality of flop pulses for refocusing to the examined subject. The VFA method in this situation is an image taking method by which a plurality of echo signals are collected while changing the flip angle of the flop pulses, by using a pulse sequence according to the FSE method.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Returning to the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pre-scan executing unit <b>26</b><i>b </i>performs the pre-scan while using the pulse sequence by which a plurality of echo signals are collected. For example, the pre-scan executing unit <b>26</b><i>b </i>performs the pre-scan while using the pulse sequence by which a plurality of echo signals are collected without applying the phase encoding gradient magnetic field. In the present example, a situation is explained in which the pulse sequence by which the plurality of echo signals are collected without applying the phase encoding gradient magnetic field is used as the pulse sequence for the pre-scan; however, a pulse sequence by which the phase encoding gradient magnetic field is applied may be used instead as the pulse sequence for the pre-scan.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">More specifically, when the sequence execution data for the pre-scan is generated by the imaging condition setting unit <b>26</b><i>a</i>, the pre-scan executing unit <b>26</b><i>b </i>reads the sequence execution data from the sequence execution data storage unit <b>23</b><i>a</i>. Further, the pre-scan executing unit <b>26</b><i>b </i>transmits the read sequence execution data to the sequence control unit <b>10</b> via the interface unit <b>21</b> so as to execute the pre-scan.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>calculates a phase difference between at least two echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable and that are selected out of the plurality of echo signals collected during the pre-scan and are selected while excluding the echo signals collected during the initial time period. More specifically, after the pre-scan is performed by the pre-scan executing unit <b>26</b><i>b</i>, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>reads, out of the MR signal data storage unit <b>23</b><i>b</i>, MR signal data related to at least two echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable and that are selected out of the echo signals collected during the pre-scan and are selected while excluding the echo signals collected during the initial time period. The phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>then causes the read MR signals to be Fourier-transformed in the readout direction and calculates a zero-order phase difference and a first-order phase difference.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to the FSE method, a dephasing amount generated by the phase encoding gradient magnetic field applied to a preceding echo signal is added to an immediately following echo signal, so that a phase difference occurs in the echo observed next. Because the phase difference can be expressed by using a linear function (i.e., a first-order function) of the location, the phase difference is referred to as the &#x201c;first-order phase difference&#x201d;. Further, a gradient magnetic field contains a zero-order term (i.e., a BO component) due to misalignments in positional arrangements of the coils. Although the zero-order term of the gradient magnetic field is a uniform component having no dependency on the location, the zero-order term has a time-related characteristic where the value thereof decreases exponentially like an eddy current eventually and may be a cause of phase differences. This phase difference is referred to as the &#x201c;zero-order phase difference&#x201d;. The first-order phase difference denotes a phase shift in the readout direction, whereas the zero-order phase difference denotes a phase shift in the slice selecting direction (i.e., the zero-order term caused by the misalignments in the positional arrangements of the coils or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, as the echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable and that are selected while excluding the echo signals collected during the initial time period, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>uses the echo signals that are collected during a time period that is the same as or close to the time period during which the phase encoding gradient magnetic field is equal to zero in the main scan.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">To explain a more specific example, let us assume that, for instance, the pulse sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is used in the main scan, whereas the pulse sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is used in the pre-scan. Like the pulse sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when an arrangement is made so that the phase encoding number is 128 and so that the phase encoding gradient magnetic field is equal to zero with respect to the 64th echo signal collected, generally speaking, it requires approximately forty-eight echo signals for the fluctuation of the phase differences among the echo signals to become stable (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Also, as for the echo signals used for correcting the phase differences, it is desirable to use echo signals positioned at the center of the k-space that contribute the most to the image quality. In this situation, for example, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>calculates a phase difference between the 64th echo signal and the 63rd echo signal that are collected during the pre-scan. Alternatively, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>may calculate a phase difference between the 64th echo signal and the 65th echo signal that are collected during the pre-scan.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the MRI apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment is configured so that, when the operator instructs that an image taking process should be started (step S<b>101</b>: Yes), the imaging condition setting unit <b>26</b><i>a </i>receives an input of an imaging condition from the operator via the input unit <b>24</b> (step S<b>102</b>).</p>

After that, the main scan executing unit <b>26</b><i>e </i>performs the main scan, based on the sequence execution data for the main scan corrected by the sequence correcting unit <b>26</b><i>d </i>(step S<b>107</b>). Subsequently, the image reconstruction unit <b>22</b> restructures an image from the MR signal data collected during the main scan (step S<b>108</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As explained above, according to the present embodiment, the pre-scan executing unit <b>26</b><i>b </i>performs the pre-scan while using the pulse sequence by which the plurality of echo signals are collected without applying the phase encoding gradient magnetic field. Also, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>calculates the phase difference between the two or more echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable and that are selected out of the plurality of echo signals collected during the pre-scan and are selected while excluding the echo signals collected during the initial time period. Further, the sequence correcting unit <b>26</b><i>d </i>corrects the pulse sequence for the main scan, based on the phase difference between the echo signals calculated by the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c</i>. With these arrangements, according to the present embodiment, even if the image taking method being implemented is one by which the phase differences among the echo signals vary, it is possible to prevent the image quality from being degraded by the varying phase differences.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, according to the present embodiment, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>uses, as the echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable, the echo signals that are collected during a time period that is the same as or close to the time period during which the phase encoding gradient magnetic field is equal to zero in the main scan. With this arrangement, according to the present embodiment, the pulse sequence for the main scan is corrected based on the echo signals positioned at the center of the k-space that contribute the most to the image quality. It is therefore possible to further improve the image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, each of the pulse sequences used for the pre-scan and for the main scan is a pulse sequence that uses the FSE method and by which the plurality of echo signals are collected while changing the flip angle of the RF pulses for refocusing. With this arrangement, according to the present embodiment, when an image taking process is performed by using the VFA method and even if the phase differences vary among the echo signals collected during the initial time period, with regard to the plurality of echo signals collected during the pre-scan, it is possible to prevent the image quality from being degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the description of the present embodiment above, the example is explained in which the echo signals that are collected during the time period that is the same as or close to the time period during which the phase encoding gradient magnetic field is equal to zero in the main scan are used as the echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable; however, technical features according to the present embodiment are not limited to this example. For instance, another arrangement is acceptable in which the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>uses, as the echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable, echo signals of which the magnitude of the fluctuation of the phase differences is equal to or smaller than a predetermined threshold value. In this situation, by changing the threshold value, for example, the operator is able to change the degree of the phase differences between the echo signals used for correcting the pulse sequence for the main scan. As a result, the operator is able to adjust the level of precision of the phase difference correcting process.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, in the description of the present embodiment above, the example is explained in which the echo signals that are collected during the time period that is the same as or close to the time period during which the phase encoding gradient magnetic field is equal to zero in the main scan are used as the echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable; however, the technical features according to the present embodiment are not limited to this example. Examples of image taking methods that can be used by MRI apparatuses include methods (e.g., methods for taking proton density weighted images, T<sub>1 </sub>weighted images, and the like) by which the number of echo signals that are collected before the intensity of the phase encoding gradient magnetic field becomes equal to zero is small. When one of such image taking methods is used, there may be a situation in which the phase differences between the echo signals is not yet stable even during the time period when the intensity of the phase encoding gradient magnetic field is equal to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">To cope with this situation, another arrangement is acceptable in which, for example, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>calculates an average value of the phase differences among a plurality of echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable. In that situation, the sequence correcting unit <b>26</b><i>d </i>corrects the pulse sequence for the main scan, based on the average value of the phase differences calculated by the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c</i>. For example, when the intensity of the phase encoding gradient magnetic field becomes equal to zero with respect to an n&#x2032;th echo signal, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>calculates the average value of the phase differences by calculating (difn+difn1+difn2+ . . . )/N, where difn denotes the phase difference between the n&#x2032;th echo signal and the (n+1)th echo signal; difn1 denotes the phase difference between the (n+2)th echo signal and the (n+1)th echo signal; difn2 denotes the phase difference between the (n+2)th echo signal and the (n+3)th echo signal; and so on. In this expression, N denotes the number of echo signals used in the calculation of the phase differences. With this arrangement, for example, even if the image taking method being implemented is one by which the number of echo signals that are collected before the intensity of the phase encoding gradient magnetic field becomes equal to zero is small, it is possible to correct the pulse sequence for the main scan with a high level of precision.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, in the description of the present embodiment above, the example is explained in which both of the pulse sequences used for the pre-scan and for the main scan are each a pulse sequence that uses the VIA method; however, the technical features according to the present embodiment are not limited to this example. For example, another arrangement is acceptable in which a pulse sequence that uses the VFA method is used for the main scan, whereas a pulse sequence that uses a Constant Flip Angle (CFA) method is used for the pre-scan. In this situation, the pre-scan executing unit <b>26</b><i>b </i>performs the pre-scan by using the pulse sequence that uses the CFA method. Further, the main scan executing unit <b>26</b><i>e </i>performs the main scan by using the pulse sequence that uses the VIA method.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The CFA method mentioned above is an image taking method by which, with a pulse sequence according to the FSE method, a plurality of echo signals are collected while keeping the flip angle of the flop pulses constant. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a chart of an example of a pulse sequence that uses the CFA method according to a modification example of the present embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an example of the fluctuation of the first-order phase differences among echo signals collected by using the CFA method is shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the CFA method is used, the first-order phase differences among the echo signals are substantially stable throughout the entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In that situation, for example, the flip angle of the flop pulses in the pulse sequence for the pre-scan is set so as to be equal to the flip angle of the first flop pulse applied in the pulse sequence for the main scan. Further, as the echo signal of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>uses the echo signals collected during the initial time period that are selected out of the echo signals collected during the pre-scan. By using the echo signals collected during the initial time period, it is possible to correct the pulse sequence for the main scan with a high level of precision, even in the situation where, for example, the noise component included in the echo signals becomes larger as the number of echo signals increases. Generally speaking, it is anticipated that an image taking process performed by using the CFA method has a high Specific Absorption Rate (SAR); however, because the execution time period of the pre-scan is shorter than that of the main scan, the impact of using the pulse sequence according to the CFA method is small.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, in the description of the present embodiment above, the example is explained in which the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>uses, as the echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable and that are selected while excluding the echo signals collected during the initial time period, the echo signals that are collected during the time period that is the same as or close to the time period during which the phase encoding gradient magnetic field is equal to zero in the main scan; however, the embodiments are not limited to this example. As long as the echo signals are such echo signals of which the fluctuation of the phase differences is stable and that are selected while excluding the echo signals collected during the initial time period, it is acceptable to use echo signals that are collected in any other periods.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an example of changes in the flip angle for each of the echo signals in a pulse sequence for a pre-scan is shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an example of changes in the signal strength for each of the echo signals collected during a pre-scan is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, out of the plurality of echo signals collected during the pre-scan, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>may use the echo signals that are collected after a point in time at which the change amount of the flip angle of the RF pulses for refocusing in the pulse sequence for the pre-scan changes from a decrease to an increase. In that situation, for example, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>uses at least two echo signals selected out of the plurality of echo signals that are collected after the point in time at which the change amount of the flip angle of the RF pulses for refocusing changes from a decrease to an increase, the plurality of signals namely being, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, echo signals from an echo signal A to an echo signal B (i.e., the echo signal positioned at the center of the k-space) with which the phase encoding gradient magnetic field becomes equal to zero in the main scan.</p>

In that situation, for example, the phase difference calculating unit <b>26</b><i>c </i>uses at least two echo signals selected out of the plurality of echo signals that are collected after the point in time at which the change amount of the signal strength for each echo has become equal to or smaller than the predetermined signal threshold value, the plurality of signals namely being, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, echo signals from an echo signal C to an echo signal D (i.e., the echo signal positioned at the center of the k-space) with which the phase encoding gradient magnetic field becomes equal to zero in the main scan.
