<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the E-UTRAN system there are conventional network access nodes/cells termed eNodeBs which serve all users, and also subscriber group CSG cells such as home eNodeBs which are available for traffic (voice and/or data) to only those subscribers registered with the CSG and possibly also certain allowed guests. Any given CSG may include a group of cells (such as a corporate or university campus) or a single cell. CSGs may allow traffic access for non-subscribers for emergency calls or routine, non-emergency access.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">These different types of cells or access nodes may be termed more generally as public access nodes/public cells and private access nodes/private cells. Other wireless systems (GERAN, GSM, UTRAN, WCDMA) have either implemented or are considering implementing similar such private networks as more functionality is shifted from higher in the radio access network toward the base stations/access nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">There are two types of conventional closed subscriber group (CSG) implementations, namely CSG-aware user equipment (UE) and non-CSG-aware UE. In the CSG-aware UE implementation, CSG subscription data is maintained at the home location register and is retrieved by mobility management entities, such as MME, MSC/VLR, SGSN, as part of UE's subscription profile. In the LTE system the CSG-aware UE maintains a list, termed a CSG whitelist or CSG allowed list, which lists the identities of the CSG cells for which that particular UE has access rights. 3GPP TS 23.401 states that the UE is to keep this CSG whitelist, which can be either the &#x201c;allowed CSG list&#x201d; or the &#x201c;operator CSG list&#x201d; contained in the so-called UE context which is provided by the UE's home network to any other networks the UE is transiting. Each CSG list has the form of a list of CSG IDs and the associated PLMNs. Each CSG ID reliably identifies a CSG, which as above might include a single CSG cell or multiple CSG cells. Prior to requesting access to a CSG cell, UEs verify whether its CSG TD is in their white list, and only request access if it is. Users can override this automatic CSG cell screening by manually selecting a CSG cell that is not in their UE's allowed list.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When a CSG-aware UE accesses such a CSG cell, the MME/SGSN/MSCNLR checks that the CSG ID of the CSG cell corresponds to a CSG ID in the CSG subscription data, and that the relevant validity criteria are met.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As regards the non-CSG-aware UE implementation, CSG subscription data is maintained by CSG operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) function.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Access to CSG cells may be further controlled on the basis of service operator assigned classes. There are 15 such classes (0-9 assigned to low priority users (so-called &#x201c;Ordinary UEs&#x201d;) and 11-15 assigned to high priority users, such as emergency services), and the entire population of UEs are allocated to a service access class. If any given CSG cell allows, for example, service access class 0 to camp on its cell, then if there are 100,000 users of this class, this gives rise to a significant number of users that may potentially require access to the given CSG cell.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Ordinary UEs are barred from accessing a given CSG cell based on RRC configuration parameters for access barring that are broadcasted on SIB<b>2</b> (i.e. access class barred, barring rates, barring probability). The broadcast of enhanced access barring by the RAN has been proposed in TR 23.888 v11.1.2 in order to restrict a specific congesting MTC Group/APN from attempting access to a CSG cell, or to prevent all MTC Devices, low-priority MTC Devices, and/or MTC Devices of a PLMN type from attempting access. The RRC and/or NAS rejection back-off times and MTC access barring randomization can successfully prevent the rejected/barred MTC Devices from almost simultaneously initiating access attempts after the congestion scenario or the overload scenario have subsided.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The aforementioned access barring mechanism for Ordinary UEs is based on their access class, and, as alluded to above, since there are a significantly larger number of low priority users than high priority users, it applies to relatively large mobile populations. While such barring mechanisms are suited to special scenarios where UEs may be prevented from making access attempts in case of states of emergency, they are not suitable as a means to prevent low-priority UEs from making access attempts to a eN odeB based on congestion or overload considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Embodiments are directed towards providing an improved method of controlling access to private cells such as CSG cells.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Embodiments are concerned with improving access to CSG cells so that more users of low priority can access such cells even when co-located high priority are making use of the cell's resources.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary wireless environment within which embodiments may be practiced; as can be seen, a plurality of UEs <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>e </i>are connected to one of macro cells <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>and CSG cell <b>24</b>. While only one is shown, in practice there may be many CSG cells from different CSGs and the UEs may be a subscriber to only one or a few of those CSGs. In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, UEs <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>d </i>and <b>20</b><i>e </i>are connected to CSG <b>24</b>. The various radio access nodes <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>24</b> communicate with mobility management entities, such as MME, MSC/VLR, SGSN <b>23</b> to validate or otherwise access to a given radio access node on the basis of the UE's subscription profile. The wireless environment is in communication with various CSG management entities, namely a CSG gateway <b>25</b> and CSG Admin Server <b>27</b>, which manages the list of subscribers for a CSG, i.e., the access control list for the CSG cells, and provisions UEs with CSG cells that the UEs are allowed to access.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the CSG cell <b>24</b> receives a plurality of Closed Subscriber Group identifiers (CSG IDs) assigned to the cell (step <b>201</b>). These CSG IDs may be received from the afore-mentioned CSG management entity such as the CSG Admin Server <b>27</b> via the CSG gateway <b>25</b>. Thereafter, the CSG cell <b>24</b> selects and transmits a first CSG ID from the plurality of CSG IDs on the basis of a first load condition on the cell (step <b>203</b>); and separately selects and transmits a second, different, CSG ID from the plurality of CSG IDs on the basis of a second, different, load condition on the cell (step <b>205</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As will be explained in more detail below, UEs are associated and preconfigured, e.g. via locally maintained whitelists, with one or ones of the plurality of CSG IDs; in this way, the CSG cell can provide time-varying access thereto for a greater number of UEs than is possible with conventional methods. Furthermore, as the selection and transmission of a given CSG ID is dependent on cell loading conditions, it can dynamically modify the UEs that are able to camp on the cell based on local conditions, thereby actively reacting to usage of its radio resources.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The load conditions may be dependent on cell operational characteristics, as determined by the CSG cell <b>24</b>, such as the state of at least one cell resource, at least one cell buffer, at least one cell channel, the state of traffic within the cell, predetermined types of traffic in the cell, quality of service in the cell, failure rate associated with access requests received by the cell, and the number of UEs currently served by the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In preferred arrangements, the first CSG ID is transmitted by the CSG cell <b>24</b> for a first time period, and the second CSG ID is transmitted by the CSG cell <b>24</b> for a second time period. The first and second CSG IDs may be within a group of CSG IDs, which may comprise CSG IDs in addition to the first and second IDs, in which case the cell <b>24</b> may transmit the respective IDs within consecutive time periods. In at least some arrangements respective CSG IDs are broadcast by the CSG cell <b>24</b>, and the duration of time periods within which a respective said CSG ID is broadcast may be the same for all CSG IDs to be broadcast, or may vary in dependence on cell conditions. In particular, if a given CSG cell is running low on resources, it may select and broadcast a CSG ID that corresponds to higher priority users. As is described below, the mapping between CSG ID and UEs is configured by the CSG admin server <b>27</b>, so that, in one sense, the CSG cell <b>24</b> is able to select a CSG ID to transmit based on an effective access priority of the CSG IDs.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The CSG IDs may be broadcast on SIB<b>1</b> by the CSG <b>24</b>, and received according to conventional methods by UEs within the CSG cell <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As mentioned above, each CSG ID has a set of UEs associated therewith, this having been defined by e.g. the CSG Admin Server <b>27</b> in communication with the various mobility management entities <b>23</b> and the CSG cell <b>24</b> via the CSG gateway <b>25</b>. The CSG Admin Server <b>27</b> may classify UEs into the afore-mentioned groups on the basis of e.g. Quality of Service (QoS) profile and device type. Each UE in a given CSG group may, in this way, be configured with zero, one, or a plurality of CSG IDs in their respective whitelists. The group assignment could further be dependent on load conditions, specified by the CSG Admin Server <b>27</b>, as can be expected to be experienced by the CSG cell <b>24</b>. A CSG management entity such as a CSG Admin Server <b>27</b> therefore assigns the CSG IDs and allocates them to UEs. Subsequent use of a given CSG ID in a given broadcast period is managed by the CSG cell <b>24</b> and dependent on runtime cell loading conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this way the CSG cell <b>24</b> allows different groups of UEs access to the CSG cell using PRACH resources via broadcasting different CSG IDs at different points in time, thereby providing a means of load and admission control by time sharing among UEs.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As mentioned above, the access priority of a given CSG ID may be coupled to access priority of UEs, which is to say that CSG IDs corresponding to higher priority users could have a higher access priority. This enables the aforementioned flexibility of enabling the CSG cell <b>24</b> to select and broadcast a CSG ID corresponding to higher priority users in the event that a given CSG cell is running low on resources. In addition, for higher priority users, more than one CSG IDs may be configured for their UEs, thereby enabling access to such UEs during varying load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An overview of the steps performed by the various entities will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. At step <b>301</b>, UEs report to CSG management entities such as a CSG List Server. The CSG Admin Server <b>27</b> provisions the UEs with a whitelist comprising zero/one/a plurality of CSG IDs for the CSG cell <b>24</b> (step <b>303</b>). Thereafter the CSG List Server assigns CSG IDs to various CSGs, including CSG <b>24</b> (step <b>305</b>) on the basis of e.g. QoS profile and device type, preferably in the form of groups of CSG IDs, which may or may not have priority status associated therewith. For example, it may be assumed that, following step <b>305</b>, CSG cell <b>24</b> has been configured with three CSG IDs {A, B, C}, and that UEs are divided into several groups, UEgrp(<b>1</b>) . . . UEgrp(<b>5</b>). Further, it may be assumed for illustrative purposes that CSG ID A has been assigned to UEgrp(<b>1</b>) and UE grp(<b>4</b>); that CSG ID B has been assigned to UEgrp(<b>2</b>); and that CSG ID C has been assigned to UEgrp(<b>3</b>). There is no CSG ID configured for UEgrp(<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Having received the CSG ID group information, the CSG cell <b>24</b> dynamically broadcasts different CSG IDs at different points in time based, e.g., on the load experienced by the cell <b>24</b> (step <b>307</b>). An exemplary broadcast schedule may comprise the following:</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As UEgrp(<b>5</b>) has no valid CSG ID, none of the T ICS in that group can obtain access to the CSG ID during this period.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As mentioned above, the duration of the respective broadcast periods could be dependent on changes to loading on the cell and/or conditions of the cell, as measured by the CSG cell <b>24</b>. Further, UEs with a higher priority can be configured with more than one CSG ID for this CSG cell <b>24</b>, meaning that these UEs can effectively be served by the CSG <b>24</b> for a longer period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As is also described above, the UEs maintain a whitelist of CSG IDs, this having been provisioned to the UEs at step <b>303</b>. Not all UEs have the same list of CSG IDs in their whitelist, as, for example, different UEs are assigned different priorities. That being the case, when the CSG cell <b>24</b> broadcasts a change to the CSG ID, it may be expected that at least some of the UEs currently being served by the current CSG ID may not be able to continue to be able to be served by the CSG cell <b>24</b> when it broadcasts a different CSG ID.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Embodiments of the invention provide a particularly advantageous mechanism for providing this CSG ID information to the UE, as will now be explained. When the CSG cell <b>24</b> is due to change CSG ID, the CSG cell <b>24</b> may transmit a paging message to the UEs currently being served by the CSG cell <b>24</b>, which causes the UEs to check for a system information update SIB<b>1</b>. Upon receipt of the paging message, the connected UEs are triggered to check the CSG ID and CSG indication that is broadcast on SIB<b>1</b>. For those UEs that have this CSG ID on their whitelist, they are able to continue to receive service from the CSG cell <b>24</b>, whereas those UEs that do not have this CSG ID on their whitelist may initiate a handover to another cell.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">By paging the connected UEs with information identifying a broadcast system update there is no need for a UE to send a RACH in the CSG cell <b>24</b>, and thus avoids the need for any dedicated RRC signaling.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">By way of an example, it is assumed that UEs within UEgrp(<b>1</b>) and UEgrp(<b>2</b>) have registered with the network and may be in RRC_IDLE or RRC_CONNECTED state. It is further assumed that these UEs within the CSG cell area <b>24</b> can be paged to indicate a system information update SIB<b>1</b> by the currently serving cell <b>24</b>. The CSG cell <b>24</b> then broadcasts CSG ID B in the next BCCH modification period with the new system information SIB<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Upon receiving the paging message, UEs in UEgrp(<b>1</b>) and UEgrp(<b>2</b>) will check the CSG ID and CSG indication broadcast on SIB<b>1</b>. UEs in UEgrp(<b>1</b>) will still be able to access the cell because CSG ID B is in the whitelist for this group of users; however, UEs in UEgrp(<b>2</b>) will not be allowed to access the cell as CSG ID B is not in its whitelist.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As regards the UEs in UEgrp(<b>2</b>), two scenarios are possible:</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">(i) If UEs were in RRC_IDLE state the UEs will reselect another suitable cell.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this case, no network signaling is needed for the reselection, as the UEs may have autonomously re-selected an eNodeB cell without re-attaching to the network (i.e the UEs camp on a suitable LTE cell such as <b>22</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). These UEs are known to the relevant MME entity via the EPS Mobility Management Protocol responsible for tracking area update (TAU) to keep track of UEs in RRC_IDLE mode, and the tracking area typically covers a number of eNodeBs such as <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">(ii) If UE was in RRC_CONNECTED state, the UE will handover to another cell.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Handover to another suitable cell (i.e. the accessible cell based on CSG configuration) while in RRC_CONNECTED state is performed via conventional handover procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, described above, is a logic flow diagram which describes, broadly, the above exemplary embodiments from the perspective of the CSG cell <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a logic flow diagram which describes, broadly, the above exemplary embodiments from the perspective of a UE <b>20</b><i>b</i>. In step <b>401</b>, the UE stores in memory a list of a plurality of Closed Subscriber Group identifiers (CSG ID) corresponding to the at least one cell to which the apparatus is authorised to access. At step <b>403</b>, and while being served by the at least one cell in respect of a first CSG ID for the cell, the UE receives a transmission comprising a second, different, CSG ID for the cell. Thereafter, at step <b>405</b>, the UE may compare the received second CSG ID with CSG ID on the list to determine whether the apparatus is authorised to continue to be served by the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a logic flow diagram which describes, broadly, the above exemplary embodiments from the perspective of a CSG management entity. In step <b>501</b>, the CSG management entity may assign a plurality of Closed Subscriber Group identifiers (CSG ID) to a cell. At step <b>503</b>, the CSG management entity may associate a cell load condition with each of the plurality of CSG IDs, assign to each of said plurality of CSG IDs a set of at least one user equipment identifiers and thereafter transmit data indicative of said assignment for use in access control to the cell (steps <b>503</b>, <b>505</b>).</p>
