<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Liquid crystal displays (LCD) are extensively employed in various electronic devices, such as mobile phones, televisions, etc. In addition to portable devices such as the mobile phones, many people may also carry a mirror with them for activities such as applying make-up. Or when at home, people may have both a television and a mirror, it would be space-saving and convenient if an LCD device also had a mirror function.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a liquid crystal display (LCD) <b>100</b> provided in a first embodiment includes a backlight module <b>10</b>, a first flat glass substrate <b>20</b>, a second flat glass substrate <b>40</b>, a liquid crystal layer <b>30</b>, a color filter <b>50</b>, a bandpass filter member <b>60</b> and a touch panel <b>70</b>, which are sequentially arranged in the order written, along a transmission direction of the light emitted from the backlight module <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The backlight module <b>10</b> can be a known liquid emitting diode light resource, including a light emitting surface <b>11</b>, configured for emitting white light beams comprised of red, green, and blue light beams, to the liquid crystal layer <b>30</b> through the first flat glass substrate <b>20</b>. The first flat glass substrate <b>20</b> contacts the emitting surface <b>11</b> of the backlight module <b>10</b>. The second flat glass substrate <b>40</b> is opposite to the first flat glass substrate <b>20</b>. The liquid crystal layer <b>30</b> is sandwiched between the first and second flat glass substrates <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, including a plurality of liquid crystal molecular (not shown) and two opposite transparent electrodes (not shown). The liquid crystal is sandwiched between the two electrodes. The color filter <b>50</b> is disposed on a surface of the second flat glass substrate <b>40</b>, and is configured for converting white light beams transmitted therethrough into red light beams, green light beams, and blue light beams. The red, the green, and the blue light beams are used to irradiate the touch panel <b>70</b> thereby displaying color images.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The bandpass filter member <b>60</b> is disposed on a surface of the color filter <b>50</b>. The bandpass filter member <b>60</b> includes a transparent plate <b>61</b> and a bandpass filter film <b>62</b> formed thereon. The bandpass filter film <b>62</b> faces the touch panel <b>70</b>, and includes a number of (e.g., 15 to 22) alternately arranged first and second layers (not shown). The bandpass filter film <b>62</b> is configured for allowing light of a given spectrum emitted from the backlight module <b>10</b> to pass therethrough, and blocking light that is not in the given spectrum from passing therethrough. Thus, all the light beams emitted from the backlight module <b>10</b> and then passing through the color filter <b>50</b> can pass through the bandpass filter <b>62</b>. The first layers are comprised of a first material and the second layers are comprised of a second material. A refractive index of the first material is in a range from 2.1 to 2.5; and a refractive index of the second material is in a range from 1.3 to 1.5. The first material is selected from a group consisting of Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. The second material can be SiO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the transparent plate <b>61</b> can be omitted. In this situation, the bandpass filter film <b>62</b> is directly formed on the surface of the color filter <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The touch panel <b>70</b> is configured for sensing operation of a user and displaying images according to instructions of a controller (i.e., a CPU of an electronic device) and displaying color images. As such, the touch panel <b>70</b> is capable of displaying handwriting of a user. Therefore, the liquid display <b>100</b> achieves a function of an electronic notebook/blackboard.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the embodiment, when the backlight module <b>10</b> emits white light beams, the bandpass filter member <b>60</b> entirely transmits the white light beams to the touch panel <b>70</b>, and the touch panel <b>70</b> displays color images. When the backlight module <b>10</b> does not emit light beams, an entire surface of the touch panel <b>70</b> reflects the external light beams irradiated thereon except for the red, green, and blue light included therein, and the liquid crystal display <b>100</b> achieves a mirror function.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, another liquid crystal display <b>200</b> of a second embodiment is provided, differing from the previous embodiment in further inclusion of a transreflective layer <b>280</b> including a number of reflecting regions <b>281</b> and transmitting regions <b>282</b>. The reflecting regions <b>281</b> and the transmitting regions <b>282</b> are alternately arranged. The reflecting regions <b>281</b> reflect light beams irradiated thereon such that the LCD <b>200</b> can display images even without a backlight module. The transmitting region <b>282</b> is capable of transmitting the light beams emitted from the backlight module <b>210</b> such that the LCD <b>200</b> can display a high brightness image under the irradiating of the backlight beams. In this embodiment, each reflecting region <b>281</b> includes a plurality of nanoparticles disposed on a reflecting surface (not shown) thereof to improve a reflective index thereof. Furthermore, the color filter <b>250</b> is sandwiched between the first flat glass substrate <b>220</b> and the reflecting layer. The bandpass filter member <b>260</b> is disposed between the second flat glass substrate <b>240</b> and the touch panel <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">While certain embodiments have been described and exemplified above, various other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. The present disclosure is not limited to the particular embodiments described and exemplified but is capable of considerable variation and modification without departure from the scope of the appended claims.</p>
