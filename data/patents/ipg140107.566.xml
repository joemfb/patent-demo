<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a National Stage Application of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2007/087109 with an international filing date of Dec. 12, 2007, which is based on and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/870,245, filed on Dec. 15, 2006.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a device for applying a stretchable material to an item. More particularly, the present invention concerns a stretch film label applicator configured to separate a stretchable film sleeve label from a web of labels and apply it to a container, such as a bottle. The applicator of the present invention is particularly suitable for application of high stretch films used to apply labels to highly contoured containers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The prior art has developed numerous methods to label product containers, such as bottles. For example, the earliest and simplest such methods involved printing information directly onto the container. Later methods included printing the information on a label which then was adhered to the container. However, it more recently has become commonplace to label bottles with stretchable sleeves without the use of adhesives. In particular, such sleeves often are used for beverage bottles and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Advances in product container materials, design and manufacturing techniques over the years have led to the development of complex container designs, such as highly contoured bottles. However, traditional prior art stretch films may be unsuitable for application to such complex designs because such minimally stretch films, which exhibit about 0 to 10% stretch, may not offer sufficient elasticity to permit the film to closely follow the profile of the container. Thus, high stretch films, exhibiting about 0-40% stretch, recently have been developed for use on highly contoured containers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Devices and methods for automatically placing stretch sleeves on containers are well known in the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,566,527 to Drewitz discloses an apparatus for applying a heat-shrinkable band to the neck or body of a container. The apparatus comprises a feeding assembly for advancing a continuous sleeve of heat-shrinkable polymeric material along a predetermined path in order to slip the sleeve over the cap or body of the container, and a cutting assembly to cut the sleeve. The cutting assembly uses a rotatable, extendable blade to slit the sleeve circumferentially after it is mounted on the container.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While this device may be appropriate for heat-shrinkable materials, it is not appropriate for stretch film label applications since there is no stretching mechanism and since the cutting assembly is designed to cut heat-shrinkable sleeves. The device is not optimized for cutting high stretch film sleeve materials, which exhibit significantly greater elasticity as compared to traditional, minimally stretch films.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another such device, disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,483,783 and 5,433,057 to Lerner et al., a high speed sleever uses a vacuum to secure a sleeve as the sleeve is being cut from a continuous sleeve roll or web. The sleever then uses pins to stretch the sleeve for positioning around a container. The pins use an outflow of gas to lubricate the space between the sleeve and the outside of the container as the sleeve and container are engaged with one another. The device also uses mechanical sleeve positioning grippers to frictionally hold the sleeve against the pins during application to the container. Individual sleeves are separated from a web at perforations or frangible regions as the sleeves are pulled from the web. However, this device is not particularly useful for the application of high stretch film sleeve materials to complex container designs, and the mechanical grippers rely solely on frictional engagement with the sleeve and, therefore, may not offer consistent sleeve placement on the container.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional devices are taught by U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,543,514 and 6,263,940 to Menayan. These devices also use pins to stretch a sleeve. However, the pins are solid, and, accordingly, no vacuum or air is used to facilitate sleeve engagement with or disengagement from the pins. Furthermore, in this device the container remains stationary while the stretched sleeve is moved over the container, rather than moving the container into the stretched sleeve. Again, such devices are not designed to apply high stretch film sleeve materials to highly contoured containers, and do not contain sufficient means to provide consistent sleeve placement on the containers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,715,651 to Thebault utilizes two semi-circular collar sections on which the sleeves are positioned, rather than a set of pins, for stretching the sleeve. The collar sections include suction surfaces for engaging the outer surface of the sleeve while it is being stretched. However, such suction surfaces may be insufficient for adequately stretching high stretch film sleeve materials about a complex container design.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While some of the prior art devices discussed above may perform adequately to apply traditional minimally stretch films (about 0 to 10% stretch) to containers having relatively simple geometric designs, such devices are not well suited for application of high stretch films (about 0-40% stretch) to modem containers having complex geometric designs and significant contours.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, there exists a need for a stretch film label applicator configured to apply a stretchable film sleeve label to a container, such as a bottle. Desirably, the applicator is suitable for application of high stretch sleeve film labels to highly contoured containers. More desirably, the applicator is configured to apply such labels in a reliable, consistent manner and to ensure proper positioning of the label on the container. More desirably yet, the applicator is adaptable to easily integrate within a container filling and packaging line. Most desirably, the applicator is configurable to apply both continuous sleeve labels as well as perforated labels.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention comprises a stretch film sleeve label applicator for separating a stretchable sleeve label from a web of such labels and applying the label to an item, such as a container.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Generally, the applicator is configured to receive a series of labels in an elongated, continuous web of flat, 2-ply sleeve labels, open the continuous sleeve of labels, separate an individual label from a next successive label, stretch the label to permit its application to an item to be labeled, such as a container, and apply the label in an accurate and precise location on the container. The process is repeated, preferably at a high rate of speed, on the order of many hundred containers per minute, to apply labels to numerous containers as part of a container filling, labeling and packing process. Such processes are quite common in the beverage industry, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Three primary preferred embodiments are disclosed. In each preferred embodiment, the applicator comprises three primary components: a label feeding assembly, a label separating assembly and a label stretching assembly. The label feeding assembly, the label separating assembly and the label stretching assembly preferably are interactively coupled to one another such that a continuous sleeve of labels may be fed into the applicator by the label feeding assembly, individual labels separated from the web of labels by the label separating assembly and the labels applied to containers by the label stretching assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The applicator is adaptable to easily integrate within any number of container filling, labeling and packaging lines as are known in the prior art, such those utilizing various conveyors (such as flat belt and carousel conveyors), screw shafts, elevators and the like to transport containers to and from the applicator.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The label feeding assembly is disposed at the uppermost portion of the applicator and comprises a mandrel mounted in a vertical orientation within a frame of the applicator. The mandrel is mounted to the applicator frame using a gimbal-style mounting system of opposed bearings. The gimbal-style mounting system allows the mandrel to move, or pivot, to a slight degree along axes in the horizontal plane (relative to the longitudinal axis of the mandrel) to accommodate for movements of the applicator and/or the sleeve during use and to maintain the sleeve in a substantially linear and vertical orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The mandrel extends downwardly through the label feeding assembly and the label separating assembly and defines a guide path along which the sleeve travels through the applicator. To that end, the label feeding assembly further comprises at least one pair of opposed feed wheels disposed on opposite sides of the mandrel. The feed wheels frictionally engage the sleeve and direct it downwardly along the mandrel.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment of the present invention, particularly useful for elongated sleeves of perforated stretch film labels, the feed wheels may be substituted by, or supplemented with, a feed belt system configured to frictionally engage the sleeve over an extended area without causing premature separation of the labels from one another at the perforations.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The label separating assembly is configured to separate individual labels from the continuous web of stretch film labels and to deliver the separated labels to the label stretching assembly for application to the container. In some embodiments of the applicator of the present invention, configured to be used for continuous webs of non-perforated stretch film labels, the label separating assembly separates individual labels using a circumferential cutter wheel having a plurality of cutting blades that rotates about the mandrel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, a plurality of cutting blades that are slidably mounted to the cutter wheel. The cutting blades are configured to slide inwardly (toward the mandrel) and outwardly (away from the mandrel), between a cutting position and a non-cutting position, respectively, as the cutter wheel rotates about the mandrel. In this embodiment, the slidable movement of the cutting blades is controlled by a cam mechanism configured to extend the cutting blades into the cutting position when the sleeve is in the correct position on the mandrel.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment, the plurality of cutting blades are pivotally mounted to a cutter wheel. The cutting blades are configured to pivot inwardly (toward the mandrel) and outwardly (away from the mandrel), between a cutting position and a non-cutting position, respectively, as the cutter wheel rotates about the mandrel. In this embodiment, the pivoting of the cutting blades preferably is controlled by a differential mechanism operatively connected to the cutter wheel and an engagement wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the embodiments of the label separating assembly that use a cutter wheel, the label separating assembly preferably further comprises a set of opposing grippers disposed on opposite sides of the mandrel beneath the cutter wheel to keep the sleeve stationary while it is being cut by the cutter wheel. The grippers are configured to frictionally engage the sleeve against the mandrel during the period that the blades are cutting the sleeve and to disengage from the sleeve when the cutting operation has completed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In yet another embodiment of the label separating assembly of the present invention, configured to be used for webs of perforated stretch film labels, a label breaking mechanism is used instead of a cutter wheel. The label breaking mechanism comprises a pair of opposing breakers disposed on opposite sides of a vertically displaceable axial portion of the mandrel. The breakers are configured to momentarily frictionally engage the sleeve against the vertically displaceable axial portion of the mandrel and to exert a downward force against the sleeve, thus separating an individual label from the web at the perforation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">To prevent the sleeve from bunching or gathering along the mandrel during the label separation process, the vertically displaceable axial portion of the mandrel moves in a downward direction in speed with the sleeve while the breakers engage the sleeve. The vertically displaceable axial portion of the mandrel is spring-biased toward the upper end of the mandrel such that it returns to its starting position once the breakers disengage.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">To transport the separated labels to the label stretching assembly, the label separating assembly preferably further comprises a set of opposed intermittent drive wheels disposed on opposite sides of the mandrel beneath the cutter wheel or the label breaking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The intermittent drive wheels are each configured with a flat portion along their respective peripheries. The flat portion of the intermittent drive wheels does not frictionally engage the label, thus preventing any downward force from being exerted upon the label while the flat portion is in a generally parallel relationship with the mandrel. Accordingly, the flat portion &#x201c;skips over&#x201d; the label so the label remains stationary for that period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The timing of the intermittent drive wheels is such that the intermittent drive wheels are disengaged from the label while the label is being separated from the web. This permits the label to remain stationary during separation, resulting in a clean separation of the label from the web, and permits the label stretching assembly to prepare to receive the label.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In still another embodiment of the label separating assembly of the present invention, again particularly useful for elongated sleeves of perforated stretch film labels, two feed belt systems are used (upper and lower). The feed belt systems are servo-controlled such that their speed may be variable and independently adjusted. In this manner, as the web is fed along the mandrel, both feed belt systems travel at the same speed. When a label is ready to be separated from the web and fed to the label stretching assembly, the second (lower) feed belt system is momentarily accelerated, thereby tearing the label from the web. Thus, the lower feed belt system replaces the intermittent drive wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the preferred embodiment, the label stretching assembly comprises a plurality of upstanding fingers that are generally parallel to one another and equally spaced from one another relative to a longitudinal axis of the assembly. The fingers move toward and away from each other to receive a separated label and to stretch and apply the label to a container. In the preferred embodiment, the fingers move toward and away from one another (into a contracted position and an expanded position) by engagement with a cam plate that is located below the fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each finger further includes an integrated channel that permits the application of air pressure and vacuum to an outer surface of the fingers through an opening formed at the top of each finger. In one embodiment, the fingers are directly connected to a shuttle valve that controls the air pressure and vacuum provided to the fingers. In another embodiment, the fingers are connected to an air ring disposed about the fingers and the air ring is connected to the shuttle valve.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Separated labels are delivered to the label stretching assembly by the label separating assembly using the intermittent drive wheels, as discussed above, to direct the label off the mandrel and onto the fingers of the label stretching assembly. The label is positioned over the fingers of the label stretching assembly while the fingers are in the contracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the label stretching assembly may include optical sensors to confirm the proper alignment of the label on the fingers. Additionally, the fingers may be rapidly and partially opened and closed to create a &#x201c;shaking&#x201d; effect in order to correctly align the labels on the fingers. Once the label is properly aligned on the fingers, a vacuum is then applied to the fingers to hold the label against the outer surface of the fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With vacuum applied, the fingers are then moved to the expanded position by movement of the cam plate, thereby stretching the label. In one embodiment of the label stretching assembly of the present invention, an annular ring is disposed about the fingers such that when the fingers are in the expanded position, the fingers engage the ring with the label held frictionally therebetween. Such frictional engagement aids in holding the label in place during application of the label to the container.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the expanded position, the fingers and the stretched label define an annular configuration with an open central space for receiving the container to be labeled. The central space comprises a generally cylindrical shape having a frusto-conical top. The upper diameter of the frusto-conical top is configured to be sized slightly larger than the diameter of the top of the container to be labeled, such as the neck of a bottle. This permits the top of the container to pass trough the top of the expanded label.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The container is then moved upwardly into the central space using a container transport mechanism, such as an elevator arm. When the container is properly positioned in the central space in relation to the label, as determined by optical or laser sensors, the vacuum holding the label is reversed by the shuttle switch and air pressure is applied to the openings in the fingers. The air pressure forms a cushion of air between the fingers and the label, thereby reducing the friction between the fingers and the label and allowing the label to frictionally engage the container, and disengage from the fingers, as the container passes through the central opening.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once the label is applied to the container, the container is transported away from the label stretching assembly, such as by means of an extractor mechanism, and the fingers are returned to the contracted position to receive the next label.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of label stretching assemblies may be disposed in series so that, for example, labels can be positioned on one set of fingers, while a container is being labeled by another set of fingers, while still another set of fingers is returning to the contracted position for receipt of another label. It is envisioned that such an arrangement can be carried out using, for example, a turntable, or turret, configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, in yet another embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of label stretching assemblies may include a turntable, or turret, configuration, as discussed above, with each assembly radially extendable from the turret. Such a configuration, particularly useful in situations when space is limited, allows for the label feeding assembly and label separating assembly to be radially displaced from the circumference of the turret such that a container delivery mechanism and a container return mechanism may be placed in close proximity to the turret.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, in conjunction with the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms, there are shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described several preferred embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It should be further understood that the title of this section of the specification, namely, &#x201c;Detailed Description of the Invention,&#x201d; relates to a requirement of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and does not imply, nor should be inferred to limit the subject matter disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The present invention comprises a stretch film sleeve label applicator for separating a stretchable sleeve label from a web of such labels and applying the label to an item, such as a container. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, web <b>350</b> is generally configured either as a continuous, non-perforated sleeve from which individual labels (<b>351</b>, <b>352</b>) are cut, as further described herein, or web <b>350</b> may included pre-cut perforations <b>353</b> separating individual labels (<b>351</b>, <b>2352</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Three primary embodiments of the applicator are disclosed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> is configured to separate a continuous web of non-perforated, flat, 2-ply sleeve labels using a cam-driven cutter wheel mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the second embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, applicator <b>1</b> is configured to separate a continuous web of such labels using a differential-driven cutter wheel mechanism. In the third embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, applicator <b>1</b> is configured to separate a continuous web of perforated, flat, 2-ply sleeve labels using a label breaking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In each of the three primary embodiments, applicator <b>1</b> is configured to open the continuous sleeve of labels, separate an individual label from a next successive label, stretch the label to permit its application to an item to be labeled, such as a container, and apply the label in an accurate and precise location on the container.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Additionally, in each of the three primary embodiments, applicator <b>1</b> comprises three primary components: a label feeding assembly <b>2</b>, a label separating assembly <b>3</b> and a label stretching assembly <b>4</b>. Label feeding assembly <b>2</b>, label separating assembly <b>3</b> and label stretching assembly <b>4</b> preferably are interactively coupled to one another such that a continuous sleeve of labels is fed into applicator <b>1</b> by label feeding assembly <b>2</b>, individual labels are separated from the sleeve by label separating assembly <b>3</b> and the labels are applied to containers by label stretching assembly <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, in each primary embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, label feeding assembly <b>2</b> is disposed at the uppermost portion of applicator <b>1</b>. Although the instant description of label feeding assembly <b>2</b> makes references to the figures for the first primary embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, it will be appreciated that the components and configuration of label feeding assembly <b>2</b> are essentially consistent across each of the disclosed primary embodiments of applicator <b>1</b>, with any substantial differences discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in additional detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, label feeding assembly <b>2</b> comprises a mandrel <b>5</b> mounted in a vertical orientation within a frame <b>6</b> of applicator <b>1</b>. Mandrel <b>5</b> is mounted to frame <b>6</b> of applicator <b>1</b> using a gimbal-style mounting system of opposed roller bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Upper mandrel roller bearings <b>7</b> are integrated within, and on opposing sides of, mandrel <b>5</b> and are configured to matingly engage with upper frame roller bearings <b>8</b> mounted to frame <b>6</b>. Similarly, lower mandrel roller bearings <b>9</b> are integrated within, and on opposing sides of, mandrel <b>5</b> and are configured to matingly engage with lower frame roller bearings <b>10</b> mounted to frame <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">This gimbal-style mounting system allows mandrel <b>5</b> to move, or pivot, to a slight degree along axes in the horizontal plane (relative to the longitudinal axis of mandrel <b>5</b>) to accommodate for movements of applicator <b>1</b> and/or the sleeve during use of applicator <b>1</b> and to maintain the sleeve in a substantially linear and vertical orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Mandrel <b>5</b> extends downwardly through label feeding assembly <b>2</b> and label separating assembly <b>3</b> and defines a guide path along which the sleeve travels through applicator <b>1</b>. To that end, label feeding assembly <b>2</b> further comprises a pair of opposed feed wheels <b>11</b> disposed on opposite sides of mandrel <b>5</b> and matingly engaged with feed roller bearings <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Feed wheels <b>11</b> are configured to frictionally engage the sleeve between feed wheels <b>11</b> and feed roller bearings <b>12</b> and to direct the sleeve downwardly along mandrel <b>5</b>. In the preferred embodiment of label feeding assembly <b>2</b>, feed wheels <b>11</b> are belt driven by motor <b>13</b> and rotate at the same speed.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In one embodiment of label feeding assembly <b>2</b>, used with the third primary embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention (as further discussed below), and particularly useful for elongated sleeves of perforated stretch film labels, feed wheels <b>11</b> may be substituted by, or supplemented with, a feed belt system (shown in one embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>) configured to frictionally engage the sleeve against mandrel <b>5</b> over an extended area without causing premature separation of the labels from one another at the perforations.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, mandrel <b>5</b> is further configured to open the sleeve of stretch film label material and impart upon the sleeve the general shape of the container to be labeled, typically a highly contoured, but generally cylindrical, bottle. Thus, mandrel <b>5</b> preferably comprises a generally square cross-section at its upper portion that transitions to a generally circular cross-section at its lower portion.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">It will be appreciated, however, that the cross-sectional shape of mandrel <b>5</b> may vary depending upon the shape of the container to be labeled and upon whether a single, stationary label stretching assembly <b>4</b> is used, or whether multiple, moving label stretching assemblies <b>4</b> are used, as further discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, if multiple, moving label stretching assemblies <b>4</b> are used, it may be advantageous for mandrel <b>5</b> to have an oblong or square cross-section at its lower portion, in order to create a larger cross-sectional area of the sleeve. Such a larger cross-sectional area of the sleeve increases the likelihood that the sleeve will properly engage label stretching assembly <b>4</b> as it is transported between label separating assembly <b>3</b> and label stretching assembly <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Additionally, in one embodiment of mandrel <b>5</b> in the present invention (not shown) mandrel <b>5</b> may be formed of two essentially identical vertical halves, joined using adjustable screws or similar means. In this embodiment, the width of mandrel <b>5</b> may be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the distance between the two halves of mandrel <b>5</b> using the adjustable screws. By adjusting the width of mandrel <b>5</b>, a single mandrel <b>5</b> may be used with a large number of sleeves having different diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The uppermost portion of mandrel <b>5</b> is generally conical in shape and includes a separating blade <b>14</b> extending upwardly therefrom. Separating blade <b>14</b> is configured to enter the flat sleeve of stretch film label material and to open the sleeve so that it may pass over mandrel <b>5</b> and progressively acquire the desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the case of a bottle, as in the preferred embodiment, the sleeve acquires a generally cylindrical shape as it travels downwardly from the top of mandrel <b>5</b> to the bottom of mandrel <b>5</b> through label feeding assembly <b>2</b> and label separating assembly <b>3</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that the shape of mandrel <b>5</b> may vary depending upon the shape of the container to be labeled.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Additionally, it will be appreciated that mandrel <b>5</b> may include additional roller bearings along its length configured to properly guide and transport the sleeve as it traverses mandrel <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> and <b>9</b>-<b>11</b>, in the preferred embodiment of label feeding assembly <b>2</b>, mandrel <b>5</b> includes mandrel guiding roller bearings <b>15</b> disposed on opposite sides of mandrel <b>5</b>. Mandrel guiding roller bearings <b>15</b> are configured to matingly engage frame guiding roller bearings <b>17</b> mounted to frame <b>6</b> and to permit the sleeve to guidingly pass between mandrel guiding roller bearings <b>15</b> and frame guiding roller bearings <b>17</b>. A second set of opposed frame guiding roller bearings <b>26</b> also may be included in mandrel <b>5</b> and, in cooperation with frame guiding roller bearings <b>17</b>, configured to engage a feed belt system in the third primary embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, as further discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Similarly, in the preferred embodiment, mandrel <b>5</b> includes intermittent drive wheel bearings <b>16</b> disposed at the lower portion of mandrel <b>5</b> and on opposite sides of mandrel <b>5</b>. Intermittent drive wheel bearings <b>16</b> are configured to matingly engage a pair of intermittent feed wheels <b>18</b>, as further discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Label separating assembly <b>3</b> is configured to separate individual labels from the continuous sleeve of stretch film labels and to deliver the separated labels to label stretching assembly <b>4</b> for application to a container.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the first and second primary embodiments of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, label separating assembly <b>3</b> is configured to be used for continuous sleeves of non-perforated stretch film labels. To that end, label separating assembly <b>3</b> comprises a circumferential cutter wheel <b>19</b> that rotates about mandrel <b>5</b> and includes a plurality of cutting blades configured to cut the sleeve. Cutter wheel <b>19</b> preferably is a large, flange-like element disposed about mandrel <b>5</b> and through which mandrel <b>5</b> passes. The rotation of cutter wheel <b>19</b> about mandrel <b>5</b> is controlled by drive wheel <b>42</b> connected to a motor (not shown) preferably by a drive belt.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the first embodiment of applicator <b>1</b>, as shown in FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>8</b>A, a plurality of cutting blades <b>21</b> are slidably mounted to cutter wheel <b>19</b> such that cutting blades <b>21</b> slide inwardly (radially toward mandrel <b>5</b>) and outwardly (radially away from mandrel <b>5</b>), between a cutting position and a non-cutting position, respectively, as cutter wheel <b>19</b> rotates about mandrel <b>5</b>. In this embodiment, mandrel <b>5</b> includes a circumferential grove <b>20</b> into which cutting blades <b>21</b> extend when cutting blades <b>21</b> are in the cutting position. Grove <b>20</b> allows cutting blades to slide inwardly toward mandrel <b>5</b> far enough to pass through the sleeve in order cut the sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The slidable movement of cutting blades <b>21</b> in this embodiment is controlled by a cam mechanism configured to extend cutting blades <b>21</b> into the cutting position when the sleeve is in the correct position on mandrel <b>5</b> and to retract cutting blades <b>21</b> into the non-cutting position once the sleeve is cut.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the preferred embodiment, the cam mechanism comprises a pair of arms <b>22</b> disposed on either side of applicator <b>1</b>. Arms <b>22</b> are orbitally mounted to a drive wheel <b>25</b> on one end and rotatably mounted to a pivot plate <b>24</b> on the other end. Pivot plate <b>24</b> is pivotally mounted to frame <b>6</b> of applicator <b>1</b> and is also operatively connected to cutter wheel <b>19</b> such that the pivoting action of pivot plate <b>24</b> serves to extend and retract cutting blades <b>21</b> into cutting and non-cutting positions, respectively. Drive wheel <b>25</b> preferably is belt-driven by a motor <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Preferably, the operative connection between pivot plate <b>24</b> and cutter wheel <b>19</b> comprises a cam plate arrangement as is known to those skilled in the art. In such an arrangement, cutting blades <b>21</b> include integrated fingers (not shown) that travel within a plurality of arcuate tracks formed in a cam plate <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Cam plate <b>27</b> rotates upon application of force by pivot plate <b>24</b>. When cam plate <b>27</b> rotates in one direction with respect to cutter wheel <b>19</b> (as urged by pivot plate <b>24</b>), the fingers of cutting blades <b>21</b> are forced to travel along the tracks of cam plate <b>27</b> toward mandrel <b>5</b>, thereby causing cutting blades <b>21</b> to slide radially inward toward mandrel <b>5</b> and into a cutting position. When cam plate <b>27</b> rotates in the opposite direction with respect to cutter wheel <b>19</b>, the fingers of cutting blades <b>21</b> are forced to travel along the tracks of cam plate <b>27</b> away from mandrel <b>5</b>, thereby causing cutting blades <b>21</b> to slide radially outward away from mandrel <b>5</b> and into a non-cutting position.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the slidable movement of cutting blades <b>21</b> radially toward and away from mandrel <b>5</b> may be accomplished through various means, including by actuators, such as solenoids, operably coupled to each cutting blade. Accordingly, all such alternate means are included within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The second primary embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention is shown in FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>12</b>-<b>20</b>. In this embodiment, label feeding assembly <b>2</b> comprises the same components as label feeding assembly <b>2</b> of the first primary embodiment. However, label separating assembly <b>3</b> differs in that cutter wheel <b>19</b> of label separating assembly <b>3</b> in this embodiment comprises a plurality of cutting blades <b>21</b> that are pivotally mounted to cutter wheel <b>19</b>, the pivoting movement being controlled by a differential mechanism rather than a cam mechanism as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In this embodiment, a plurality of cutting blades <b>21</b> are pivotally mounted to cutter wheel <b>19</b> such that cutting blades <b>21</b> pivot inwardly (toward mandrel <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) and outwardly (away from mandrel <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), between a cutting position and a non-cutting position, respectively, as cutter wheel <b>19</b> rotates about mandrel <b>5</b>. In this embodiment, mandrel <b>5</b> includes the same circumferential grove <b>20</b> as previously discussed above into which cutting blades <b>21</b> extend when cutting blades <b>21</b> are in the cutting position. Grove <b>20</b> allows cutting blades to pivot inwardly toward mandrel <b>5</b> far enough to pass through the sleeve in order cut the sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In this embodiment, the pivotal movement of cutting blades <b>21</b> is controlled by a differential mechanism configured to pivot cutting blades <b>21</b> into the cutting position when the sleeve is in the correct position on mandrel <b>5</b> and to pivot cutting blades <b>21</b> into the non-cutting position after the sleeve is cut.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Preferably, in this embodiment cutter wheel <b>19</b> is mounted vertically adjacent to and below an engagement wheel <b>28</b> also rotatably mounted about mandrel <b>5</b> with mandrel <b>5</b> extending through engagement wheel <b>28</b> and cutter wheel <b>19</b>. Engagement wheel <b>28</b> includes a plurality of posts <b>29</b> that extend through a groove <b>30</b> formed in cutter wheel <b>19</b> to engage cutting blades <b>21</b> and to control the pivoting of cutting blades <b>21</b>. The pivoting of cutting blades <b>21</b> preferably is controlled by a differential mechanism <b>31</b> operatively connected to cutter wheel <b>19</b> and engagement wheel <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Differential mechanism <b>31</b> comprises a drive wheel <b>32</b> attached to a carrier <b>33</b> that holds two opposing pinion gears <b>34</b> rotatably mounted thereto. Pinion gears <b>34</b> are operably connected to a cutter gear <b>35</b> and an engagement gear <b>36</b>, respectively. Cutter gear <b>35</b> and engagement gear <b>36</b> are opposingly mounted within carrier <b>33</b> transverse to opposing pinion gears <b>34</b>. Cutter gear <b>35</b> is connected to a cutter drive wheel <b>37</b> by cutter axle <b>38</b> and engagement gear <b>36</b> is connected an engagement axle <b>39</b> that extends outwardly from carrier <b>33</b> and coaxially through drive wheel <b>32</b>. Cutter drive wheel <b>37</b> is operably connected to cutter wheel <b>19</b>, preferably by a belt drive system.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Drive wheel <b>32</b> is operably connected to both a motor <b>40</b> and to engagement wheel <b>28</b>, preferably by a belt drive system, such that motor <b>40</b> causes drive wheel <b>32</b> and engagement wheel <b>28</b> to rotate at the same speed. When drive wheel <b>32</b> rotates, carrier <b>33</b> also is caused to rotate at the same speed as drive wheel <b>32</b>. As carrier <b>33</b> rotates in speed with drive wheel <b>32</b>, carrier <b>33</b> causes cutter gear <b>35</b> and engagement gear <b>36</b> to rotate cutter axle <b>38</b> and engagement axle <b>39</b>, respectively. Cutter axle <b>38</b> consequently causes cutter drive wheel <b>37</b> to rotate at the same speed as drive wheel <b>32</b>, carrier <b>33</b> and engagement axle <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Differential mechanism further comprises, in the preferred embodiment, a braking mechanism <b>41</b> operably connected to engagement axle <b>39</b>. Braking mechanism is configured to exert a frictional gripping force on engagement axle <b>39</b> in order to slow the speed of engagement axle <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">When braking mechanism <b>41</b> is engaged, the speed of engagement axle <b>39</b> is reduced, and such reduced speed is translated to engagement gear <b>36</b>. When engagement gear <b>36</b> slows, pinion gears <b>34</b> compensate by causing cutter axle <b>38</b> to rotate at a proportionally higher speed. As cutter axle <b>38</b> rotates at a higher speed relative to drive wheel <b>32</b>, cutter drive wheel <b>37</b> causes cutter wheel <b>19</b> to rotate at a higher speed than engagement wheel <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As cutter wheel <b>19</b> and engagement wheel <b>28</b> rotate at different speeds, posts <b>29</b> of engagement wheel <b>28</b> travel within groves <b>30</b> of cutter wheel <b>19</b> and cause cutting blades <b>21</b> to pivot inwardly toward mandrel <b>5</b> and into the cutting position to cut the sleeve. When braking mechanism <b>41</b> is disengaged, cutter wheel <b>19</b> and engagement wheel <b>28</b> again rotate at the same speed and cutting blades <b>21</b> are caused to pivot outwardly away from mandrel <b>5</b> and into the non-cutting position, allowing the cut label to be delivered to label stretching assembly <b>4</b> and permitting the sleeve to advance downwardly along mandrel <b>5</b> in preparation for the next cut.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the pivotal movement of cutting blades <b>21</b> toward and away from mandrel <b>5</b> may be accomplished through various means, including by actuators, such as solenoids, operably coupled to each cutting blade. Accordingly, all such alternate means are included within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In the first and second primary embodiments of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, label separating assembly <b>3</b> preferably further comprises a set of opposing grippers <b>43</b> disposed pivotally mounted on opposite sides of mandrel <b>5</b> beneath cutter wheel <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Grippers <b>43</b> are configured to frictionally engage and secure the sleeve against mandrel <b>5</b> in order to keep the sleeve stationary while it is being cut by cutter wheel <b>19</b>. In the preferred embodiment, grippers <b>43</b> are controlled by solenoid actuators <b>44</b>. When the cutting operation is complete, the grippers disengage from the sleeve to permit the separated label to be transported to label stretching assembly <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the third primary embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, label feeding assembly <b>2</b> and label separating assembly <b>3</b> are configured to be used for webs of perforated stretch film sleeve labels. In this embodiment, feed wheels <b>11</b> preferably are replaced with a feed belt system and cutter wheel <b>19</b> is replaced by a label breaking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The feed belt system comprises a pair of upper opposed belt drive wheels <b>47</b> and a pair of lower opposed belt drive wheels <b>48</b>. Upper opposed belt drive wheels <b>47</b> are aligned with feed roller bearings <b>12</b> of mandrel <b>5</b> and lower opposed belt drive wheels <b>48</b> are aligned with frame guiding roller bearings <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">A pair of guide wheels <b>51</b> are mounted to frame <b>6</b> in order to create paths along which belts <b>50</b> may travel. Belts <b>50</b> are disposed between feed roller bearings <b>12</b> and upper opposed belt drive wheels <b>47</b> and between frame guiding roller bearings <b>26</b> and lower opposed belt drive wheels <b>48</b>. A motor <b>52</b> is used to drive belts <b>50</b>, preferably using a belt drive system configured to drive upper opposed belt drive wheels <b>47</b>, lower opposed belt drive wheels <b>48</b> or guide wheels <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Between feed roller bearings <b>12</b> and frame guiding roller bearings <b>26</b>, belts <b>50</b> travel parallel to mandrel <b>5</b> and frictionally engage the sleeve against mandrel <b>5</b> for that distance. By frictionally engaging the sleeve against mandrel <b>5</b> over an extended area, premature separation of the labels from one another at the perforations is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The label breaking mechanism comprises a pair of opposing breakers <b>45</b> disposed on opposite sides of mandrel <b>5</b>. Breakers <b>45</b> are configured to extend toward mandrel <b>5</b> in order to engage the sleeve of stretch film material and to move downwardly along the vertical axis of mandrel <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The label breaking mechanism further comprises a vertically displaceable axial portion <b>46</b> of mandrel <b>5</b>. Axial portion <b>46</b> is configured to slide up and down along rods (not shown) parallel to the vertical axis of mandrel <b>5</b>. In the preferred embodiment, axial portion <b>46</b> is biased with an internal spring (not shown) that urges axial portion <b>46</b> upwardly towards the top of mandrel <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, axial portion <b>46</b> preferably is formed with a generally castellated design at its lower end configured to matingly engage a receiving castellated design formed in mandrel <b>5</b>. Such a castellated design helps prevent the sleeve from bunching as it travels along mandrel <b>5</b> by allowing air to travel in and out of the space between the sleeve and axial portion <b>46</b>, thereby minimizing the effect of any vacuum that may be created as the sleeve travels along mandrel <b>5</b> at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">It will be appreciated that the castellated design of axial portion <b>46</b> may be configured at the lower end of axial portion <b>46</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>), the upper end of axial portion <b>46</b> (not shown) or at both lower and upper ends of axial portion <b>46</b> (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the preferred embodiment, breakers <b>45</b> are aligned with axial portion <b>46</b> of mandrel <b>5</b> and are configured to frictionally engage the sleeve against axial portion <b>46</b> of mandrel <b>5</b> at a point just beneath a perforation in the sleeve. Once breakers <b>45</b> engage the sleeve, breakers <b>45</b> are configured to exert a downward force against the sleeve and axial portion <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The downward force applied by breakers <b>45</b> causes axial portion <b>46</b> to displace vertically along the vertical axis of mandrel <b>5</b> with the sleeve frictionally engaged therebetween. The downward force also causes the perforation on the sleeve to break, thereby separating the individual label from the sleeve. Because axial portion <b>46</b> moves vertically in speed with breakers <b>45</b> as breakers <b>45</b> move downwardly along the vertical axis of mandrel <b>5</b>, the sleeve is kept from bunching or gathering along mandrel <b>5</b> during the label separation process.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Once the label has been separated, breakers <b>45</b> disengage from the separated label and from axial portion <b>46</b>. The label is then engaged by intermittent feed wheels <b>18</b> for delivery to label stretching assembly <b>4</b>, as further discussed below, and axial portion <b>46</b> returns to its starting position.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In an alternate embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, also configured to be used for webs of perforated stretch film sleeve labels, label separating assembly <b>3</b> of the third primary embodiment may be modified to replace the label breaking mechanism with a second feed belt system.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Additionally, in this embodiment, the two feed belt systems are interactively coupled to the drive wheel <b>32</b> and cutter drive wheel <b>37</b> of the differential mechanism of the second primary embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention. Preferably, drive wheel <b>32</b> is interactively coupled with the first (upper) feed belt system and cutter drive wheel <b>37</b> is interactively coupled with the second (lower) feed belt system such that the upper feed belt system and the lower feed belt system travel at the same speed.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As the upper feed belt system feeds the sleeve downwardly along mandrel <b>5</b>, the sleeve is engaged by the lower feed belt system. When braking mechanism <b>41</b> is engaged (as discussed above) while the sleeve is engaged by the upper feed belt system and the lower feed belt system, the speed of engagement axle <b>39</b> is reduced, and such reduced speed is translated to engagement gear <b>36</b>. When engagement gear <b>36</b> slows, pinion gears <b>34</b> compensate by causing cutter axle <b>38</b> to rotate at a proportionally higher speed.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As cutter axle <b>38</b> rotates at a higher speed relative to drive wheel <b>32</b>, cutter drive wheel <b>37</b> causes the lower feed belt system to travel at a higher speed than the upper feed belt system, thereby exerting a downward force along the longitudinal axis of the sleeve sufficient to separate a label from the sleeve at the perforation. The lower feed belt system continues to travel at a higher speed relative to the upper feed belt system until the separated label is transported by the lower feed belt system off of mandrel <b>5</b> on to label stretching assembly <b>4</b> and breaking mechanism <b>41</b> is disengaged.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">When breaking mechanism <b>41</b> is disengaged, the upper feed belt system and lower feed belt system again travel at the same speed, and the sleeve continues to travel downward along mandrel <b>5</b> in preparation for the separation of the next label.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">To transport the separated labels to label stretching assembly <b>4</b>, in each of the primary embodiments of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, label separating assembly <b>3</b> preferably further comprises a set of opposed intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b> disposed on opposite sides of mandrel <b>5</b> beneath cutter wheel <b>19</b> or the label breaking mechanism, depending on the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b> are aligned with intermittent drive wheel bearings <b>16</b> on mandrel <b>5</b> such that intermittent feed wheels <b>18</b> intermittently engage intermittent drive wheel bearings <b>16</b> in order to frictionally engage and transport the separated label to label stretching assembly <b>4</b>. Intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b> preferably are belt driven by motor <b>59</b> and rotate at the same speed.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b> are each configured with a flat portion <b>53</b> along their respective peripheries. Flat portions <b>53</b> of intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b> do not frictionally engage the separated label against intermittent drive wheel bearings <b>16</b> of mandrel <b>5</b>, thus preventing any downward force from being exerted upon the label while flat portions <b>53</b> are in a generally parallel relationship with mandrel <b>5</b>. Accordingly, flat portion <b>53</b> &#x201c;skips over&#x201d; the label so the label remains stationary for that period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The timing of intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b> is such that the intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b> are disengaged from the label while the label is being separated from the web by cutter wheel <b>19</b> or the label breaking mechanism, depending on the embodiment. This permits the label to remain stationary during the separation process, resulting in a clean separation of the label from the web, and permits label stretching assembly <b>4</b> to prepare to receive the separated label.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In an alternate configuration of the third primary embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, also configured to be used for webs of perforated stretch film sleeve labels, two feed belt systems (upper and lower) are used, as discussed above. However, in this embodiment, the feed belt systems are servo-controlled and the speed of each feed belt system may be variably and independently adjusted. Thus, there is no need for breakers <b>45</b> and intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, first (upper) feed belt system <b>300</b> is similar to the first feed belt system described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. That is, first (upper) feed belt system <b>300</b> comprises a pair of upper opposed belt drive wheels <b>47</b> and a pair of lower opposed belt drive wheels <b>48</b>. Upper opposed belt drive wheels <b>47</b> are aligned with feed roller bearings <b>12</b> of mandrel <b>5</b> and lower opposed belt drive wheels <b>48</b> are aligned with frame guiding roller bearings <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">A pair of guide wheels <b>51</b> are mounted to frame <b>6</b> in order to create paths along which belts <b>50</b> may travel. Belts <b>50</b> are disposed between feed roller bearings <b>12</b> and upper opposed belt drive wheels <b>47</b> and between frame guiding roller bearings <b>26</b> and lower opposed belt drive wheels <b>48</b>. Drive wheels <b>47</b> each are interactively coupled to a servo-controlled motor <b>301</b> mounted to frame <b>6</b> and configured to simultaneously engage drive wheels <b>47</b> and rotate drive wheels <b>47</b> at identical speeds. The design and operation of servo-controlled motor <b>301</b> is well known to those skilled in the art. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, servo-controlled motor <b>301</b> may alternatively drive lower opposed drive wheels <b>48</b> or guide wheels <b>51</b> instead of drive wheels <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Between feed roller bearings <b>12</b> and frame guiding roller bearings <b>26</b>, belts <b>50</b> travel parallel to mandrel <b>5</b> and frictionally engage the sleeve against mandrel <b>5</b> for that distance.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b> is similar in design and operation to first (upper) feed belt system <b>300</b>. That is, second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b> comprises a pair of upper opposed belt drive wheels <b>347</b> and a pair of lower opposed belt drive wheels <b>348</b>. Upper opposed belt drive wheels <b>347</b> are aligned with feed roller bearings <b>312</b> of mandrel <b>5</b> and lower opposed belt drive wheels <b>348</b> are aligned with frame guiding roller bearings <b>326</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">A pair of guide wheels <b>351</b> are mounted to frame <b>6</b> in order to create paths along which belts <b>350</b> may travel. Belts <b>350</b> are disposed between feed roller bearings <b>312</b> and upper opposed belt drive wheels <b>347</b> and between frame guiding roller bearings <b>326</b> and lower opposed belt drive wheels <b>348</b>. Drive wheels <b>347</b> each are interactively coupled to a servo-controlled motor <b>303</b> mounted to frame <b>6</b> and configured to simultaneously engage drive wheels <b>347</b> and rotate drive wheels <b>347</b> at identical speeds. The design and operation of servo-controlled motor <b>303</b> is well known to those skilled in the art. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, servo-controlled motor <b>303</b> may alternatively drive lower opposed drive wheels <b>348</b> or guide wheels <b>351</b> instead of drive wheels <b>347</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In this manner, the speed of first (upper) feed belt system <b>300</b> and second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b> may be independently and variably controlled by servo-controlled motors <b>301</b> and <b>303</b>. Thus, as first (upper) feed belt system <b>300</b> feeds the web of sleeves downwardly along mandrel <b>5</b>, the sleeve is engaged by second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b>. At this point, servo-controlled motors <b>301</b> and <b>303</b> are driving first (upper) feed belt system <b>300</b> and second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b> at the same speed.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">When it an individual label is to be separated from the web, servo-controlled motor <b>303</b> quickly and briefly accelerates and causes the speed of second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b> to quickly and briefly increase. At the same time, the speed of servo-controlled motor <b>301</b> is held constant and, therefore, the speed of first (upper) feed belt system <b>300</b> remains constant.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The net effect of the brief increase in speed of second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b> while the speed of first (upper) feed belt system <b>300</b> remains constant is to exert a downward force along the longitudinal axis of the sleeve sufficient to separate a label from the sleeve at the pre-formed perforation.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b> continues to travel at a higher speed relative to first (upper) feed belt system <b>300</b> until the separated label is transported by the second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b> off of mandrel <b>5</b> to label stretching assembly <b>4</b>. After the sleeve is transported to label stretching assembly <b>4</b>, the speed of second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b> is reduced back to the same speed as first (upper) feed belt system <b>300</b>, and the sleeve continues to travel downward along mandrel <b>5</b> in preparation for the separation of the next label.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In this manner, the instant configuration advantageously eliminates the need for breakers <b>45</b> and intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b>. It will be appreciated however, that, in some embodiments, intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b> still may be used in conjunction with second (lower) feed belt system <b>302</b> to rapidly transport the separated sleeve to label stretching assembly <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, and <b>25</b>-<b>29</b>, in each of the primary embodiments of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, label stretching assembly <b>4</b> is configured to receive a separated label, stretch it to fit around a container and release it on to the container.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">To that end, label stretching assembly <b>4</b> is a generally circular device that comprises a plurality of upstanding fingers <b>54</b> that are generally parallel to one another and equally spaced from one another relative to a central longitudinal axis of assembly <b>4</b>. Fingers <b>54</b> move radially toward and away from the central longitudinal axis of assembly <b>4</b> (and from each other) into a contracted position (to receive a separated label) and into an expanded position (to stretch and apply the label to a container). In the preferred embodiment, fingers <b>54</b> move toward and away from one another by engagement with a rotatable cam plate <b>63</b> disposed below fingers <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Fingers <b>54</b> are mounted to horizontal bases <b>55</b> and extend upwardly therefrom. Bases <b>55</b> are configured to travel in radial channels <b>56</b> formed in a guide plate <b>57</b>. Bases <b>55</b> further comprise posts <b>157</b> extending downwardly therefrom configured to engage cam plate <b>63</b> disposed beneath guide plate <b>57</b> and fingers <b>54</b>. Cam plate <b>63</b> includes a plurality of plurality of arcuate tracks <b>58</b> configured to accept posts <b>157</b> of fingers <b>54</b> and to guide fingers <b>54</b> radially toward and away from the central longitudinal axis of assembly <b>4</b> as fingers travel in tracks <b>58</b> when cam plate <b>63</b> rotates. Rotation of cam plate <b>63</b> may be accomplished by any suitable means known to those skilled in the art, including use of a pneumatically- or electromechanically-controlled actuator arm (not shown) operably connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In the preferred embodiment, each finger <b>54</b> is formed with a single integrated internal air channel <b>60</b>. The upper end of air channel <b>60</b> forms top opening <b>61</b> disposed in the outer surface of finger <b>54</b> and near the top of finger <b>54</b>. Top opening <b>61</b> is recessed from the outer surface of finger <b>54</b>. The lower end of air channel <b>60</b> forms a bottom opening <b>62</b> disposed in base <b>55</b> of finger <b>54</b>. In the preferred embodiment, bottom openings <b>62</b> of fingers <b>54</b> are connected to a source of air pressure and vacuum, such as by appropriate hoses or tubing (not shown) that permits the application of air pressure and vacuum to the outer surface of fingers <b>54</b> through air top openings <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In one embodiment, each bottom opening <b>62</b> of fingers <b>54</b> is directly connected to a source of air pressure and vacuum controlled by a shuttle valve that is configured to rapidly switch between pressure and vacuum conditions. Such shuttle valves are well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In another embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 28</figref>, each bottom opening <b>62</b> of fingers <b>54</b> is connected to an intermediate air ring <b>64</b> annularly disposed about fingers <b>52</b>. Air ring <b>64</b> is formed with an integrated channel <b>65</b> having a plurality of outlets (not shown) configured to connect with bottom openings <b>62</b> of fingers <b>56</b> using appropriate hoses or tubing. Air ring <b>64</b> further comprises an inlet (not shown) configured to connect to the shuttle valve-controlled source of air pressure and vacuum as previously discussed. Channel <b>65</b> is configured to efficiently deliver air pressure and vacuum from the source to fingers <b>54</b> using a minimum amount of hosing or tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Yet another embodiment of finger <b>354</b> and base <b>355</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</figref>. In this embodiment, finger <b>354</b> is mounted to a base <b>355</b> in much the same manner as described above, that is, finger <b>354</b> is mounted to horizontal base <b>355</b> and extends upwardly therefrom. Finger <b>354</b> preferably matinging engages groove <b>364</b> formed in base <b>355</b> and is secured using screws or bolts (not shown) through openings <b>365</b> formed in finger <b>354</b> and base <b>355</b>. A gasket (not shown) preferably is disposed between finger <b>354</b> and base <b>355</b> to create an airtight seal. Like base <b>55</b> in the preferred embodiment, base <b>355</b> in the present embodiment is configured to travel in radial channels <b>56</b> formed in a guide plate <b>57</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25-28</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In the present embodiment, finger <b>354</b> is formed with a single integrated internal air channel formed within the body of finger <b>354</b> (in the same manner as air channel <b>60</b> is formed in finger <b>54</b> in the preferred embodiment). The upper end of the air channel <b>60</b> forms top opening <b>361</b> disposed in the outer surface of finger <b>354</b> and near the top of finger <b>354</b>. The lower end of the air channel forms a bottom opening <b>362</b> disposed in the bottom surface of finger <b>354</b>. A gland <b>367</b> is formed in the outer surface of finger <b>354</b> and extends downwardly from top opening <b>361</b> along the outer surface of finger <b>354</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">When finger <b>354</b> is mounted in base <b>355</b>, bottom opening <b>362</b> of finger <b>354</b> aligns with top opening <b>363</b> formed in base <b>355</b>. Top opening <b>363</b> of base <b>355</b> is formed integral with side opening <b>366</b> formed on the outer surface of base <b>355</b>. Side opening <b>366</b> is connected to a source of air pressure and vacuum, such as by appropriate hoses or tubing (not shown), that permits the application of air pressure and vacuum to the outer surface of finger <b>354</b> through air top opening <b>361</b> and gland <b>367</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Label stretching assembly <b>4</b> is disposed beneath label separating assembly <b>3</b> such that the central vertical axis of label assembly <b>4</b> aligns with the central vertical axis of mandrel <b>5</b>. This configuration permits separated labels to be delivered to label stretching assembly <b>4</b> by label separating assembly <b>3</b> using intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b>, as discussed above, to direct the label off of mandrel <b>5</b> and onto contracted fingers <b>54</b> of label stretching assembly <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In use, fingers <b>54</b> are urged into a contracted position by rotatably actuating cam plate <b>63</b>. While fingers <b>54</b> remain in a contracted position, a separated label is transported by intermittent drive wheels <b>18</b> off of mandrel <b>5</b> and on to contracted fingers <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In some embodiments of the present invention, label stretching assembly <b>4</b> may include optical sensors (not shown) to confirm the proper alignment of the separated label on fingers <b>54</b>. Additionally, if such sensors detect that the separated label did not fully engage fingers <b>54</b>, label separating assembly <b>4</b> may be configured to rapidly and repeatedly move fingers <b>54</b> from a contracted position to a slightly expanded position to create a &#x201c;shaking&#x201d; effect in order to correctly align the separated label on contracted fingers <b>54</b>. Once the label is properly aligned on fingers <b>54</b>, the vacuum source is activated and a vacuum is applied to the labels through top openings <b>61</b> of fingers <b>54</b> in order to hold the label against the outer surface of fingers <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">With vacuum applied, fingers <b>54</b> are then moved to the expanded position by rotatably actuating cam plate <b>63</b>, thereby stretching the label about fingers <b>54</b>. In one embodiment of label stretching assembly <b>4</b> of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 28</figref>, an annular gripping ring <b>66</b> is disposed about fingers <b>54</b> such that when fingers <b>54</b> are in the expanded position, fingers <b>54</b> engage ring <b>66</b> with the label held frictionally therebetween. Such frictional engagement complements the vacuum engagement of the label and aids in holding the label in place during application of the label to the container.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>, while in the expanded position, fingers <b>54</b> and the stretched label <b>67</b> define an annular configuration with an open central space <b>69</b> for receiving the container <b>68</b> to be labeled. Central space <b>69</b> comprises a generally cylindrical shape having a frusto-conical top. The upper diameter of the frusto-conical top is configured to be sized slightly larger than the diameter of the top of container <b>68</b> to be labeled, such as the neck of a bottle. This permits the top of container <b>68</b> to pass trough the top of the stretched label <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Container <b>68</b> is then moved upwardly into central space <b>69</b> using a container transport mechanism (not shown), such as an elevator arm. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>, when container <b>68</b> is properly positioned in central space <b>69</b> in relation to stretched label <b>67</b>, as determined by the distance the container transport mechanism has traveled and/or optical or laser sensors, the vacuum holding the label is reversed by the shuttle switch and positive air pressure is delivered to top openings <b>61</b> in fingers <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The air pressure forms a cushion of air between fingers <b>54</b> and the stretched label <b>67</b>, thereby reducing the friction between fingers <b>54</b> and label <b>67</b> and allowing label <b>67</b> to frictionally engage container <b>68</b>, and disengage from fingers <b>54</b>, as container <b>68</b> continues to travel upwardly through central space <b>69</b>. Once label <b>67</b> is fully applied to container <b>68</b>, container <b>68</b> is transported away from the label stretching assembly, such as by means of an extractor mechanism <b>70</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref>, and fingers <b>54</b> are returned to the contracted position to receive the next label rotatably actuating cam plate <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In one embodiment of applicator <b>1</b> of the present invention, a plurality of label stretching assemblies <b>4</b> may be disposed in series so that, for example, labels can be positioned on fingers <b>54</b> of one label stretching assembly <b>4</b>, while a container is being labeled by another label stretching assembly <b>4</b>, while fingers <b>54</b> of still another label stretching assembly <b>4</b> are returning to the contracted position for receipt of another label. It is envisioned that such an arrangement can be carried out using, for example, a turntable, or turret, configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In such a configuration a rotating turret <b>70</b> includes a plurality of label stretching assemblies <b>4</b> mounted thereto. Label feeding assembly <b>2</b> and label separating assembly <b>3</b> are disposed adjacent to turret <b>70</b> such that as turret rotates, each label stretching assembly <b>4</b> aligns with label separating assembly <b>3</b> to receive a separated label.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref>, label stretching assemblies <b>4</b> may be configured to be radially extendable from turret <b>70</b>. Such a configuration, particularly useful in situations when space is limited, allows for label feeding assembly <b>2</b> and label separating assembly <b>3</b> to be radially displaced from the circumference of turret <b>70</b> such that a container delivery mechanism <b>71</b> and container return mechanism <b>72</b> may be placed in close proximity to turret <b>70</b>. In this embodiment, each label stretching assembly <b>4</b> is mounted to extendible arms <b>73</b> attached to turret <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">As a particular label stretching assembly <b>4</b> travels on rotating circular turret <b>70</b> and approaches label separating assembly <b>3</b>, arm <b>73</b> extends outward from turret <b>70</b> to align label stretching assembly <b>4</b> with label separating assembly <b>3</b> in order to receive a separated label. Then as label stretching assembly <b>4</b> continues to travel on rotating turret <b>70</b>, arm <b>73</b> retracts and radially displaces label stretching assembly <b>4</b> inwardly such that a container extractor mechanism <b>74</b> may deliver the labeled container to a container return mechanism <b>72</b>. In the preferred embodiment, extractor mechanism <b>74</b> is slidably mounted to turret <b>70</b> such that extractor mechanism <b>74</b> may lift labeled container <b>68</b> out of label stretching assembly <b>4</b> and deliver it to container return mechanism <b>72</b> disposed in a different horizontal plane than label stretching assembly <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In another embodiment of the present invention, the plurality of label stretching assemblies <b>4</b> on turret <b>70</b>, described above, may be combined with a plurality of label feeding assemblies <b>2</b> and label separating assemblies <b>3</b>. In this embodiment, the plurality of label feeding assemblies <b>2</b> and label separating assemblies <b>3</b> are configured in series, mounted on a rotatable &#x201c;Ferris wheel&#x201d;-style carriage, with the axis of the carriage normal to the axis of turret <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Preferably, the radial movement of label stretching assembly <b>4</b> on arm <b>73</b> in this embodiment may be controlled by a cam mechanism (not shown). The cam mechanism is configured such that as label stretching assembly <b>4</b> travels around turret <b>70</b>, label stretching assembly <b>4</b> follows a straight-line, chordal path, instead of following the circumference of turret <b>70</b>, within one sector of circular turret <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">As the label feeding assemblies <b>2</b> and label separating assemblies <b>3</b> reach the bottom point of the carriage, they are aligned over label stretching assembly <b>4</b> as label stretching assembly <b>4</b> is traveling along the straight-line, chordal path of turret <b>70</b>. By delivering a separated label to label stretching assembly <b>4</b> while label stretching assembly <b>4</b> is traveling in a straight line, the likelihood that the label sufficiently engages label stretching assembly <b>4</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">It will be appreciated that the applicator of the present invention is adaptable to easily integrate within any number of container filling, labeling and packaging lines as are known in the prior art, such those utilizing various conveyors (such as flat belt and carousel conveyors), screw shafts, elevators and the like to transport containers to and from the applicator.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">From the foregoing it will be observed that numerous modifications and variations can be effectuated without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the present invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with respect to the specific embodiments illustrated is intended or should be inferred. The disclosure is intended to cover by the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the scope of the claims.</p>
