<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present Application is based on International Application No. PCT/EP2005/056584, filed on Dec. 7, 2005, which in turn corresponds to France Application No. 0413583 filed on Dec. 20, 2004, and priority is hereby claimed under 35 USC &#xa7;119 based on these applications. Each of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety into the present application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to electronic components operating at millimetric frequencies and comprising a contactless electromagnetic access port.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">These types of electronic component comprising at least one chip (or integrated circuit) operating at millimetric frequencies have applications in particular in the automobile radar field. In these types of application, an electromagnetic wave is transmitted at a millimetric frequency and the wave reflected by an obstacle is received by an antenna, in order to extract from this wave distance information, on the one hand, and relative speed on the other hand, between this obstacle and the source that transmitted the wave. For this purpose, the vehicle is equipped with a system comprising radars positioned all around the vehicle for detecting objects. Long-range radars, for example operating at 77 GHz, are positioned at the front of the vehicle and short-range radars, operating at 24 GHz and 79 GHz, are positioned on the rear and along the sides of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The distance and relative speed information is transmitted to a central processing unit of the system which ensures, for example, that the vehicle is kept at a specified distance from the objects or from another moving vehicle traveling on the same road.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The objective of these systems using automobile radars is firstly to provide driving comfort with functions for servocontrolling the speed of the vehicle relative to another vehicle preceding it, but also to signal potential hazards.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, these systems using automobile radars comprise elementary frequency generation and microwave transmit/receive functions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The components operating at millimetric frequencies may also be used for short-range very high-data-rate communication applications.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Whatever the application, the electronic processing of millimetric-frequency signals includes a low-frequency processing part that may be carried out by silicon integrated circuits mounted on printed circuits. This part may be carried out by very well-established and low-cost technologies, with connections that are simple to produce between circuit elements on one and the same integrated circuit chip or between various integrated circuit chips. The processing also includes a part of very high frequency (above 45 GHz), which can be implemented only by components and integrated circuits made of semiconductor materials suitable for microwave applications (gallium arsenide GaAs, and especially its derivatives, or else SiGe). These integrated circuits are called MMICs (microwave monolithic integrated circuits). This very high-frequency part poses difficult production problems and in general turns out to be very expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For relatively complex functions, components are encapsulated in a metal package containing a large number of MMIC chips, the quantity of circuit elements that can be placed in one and the same chip being more limited in the case of MMIC circuits than in the case of low-frequency silicon circuits. These chips are mounted on a substrate having interconnections that are difficult to produce and therefore expensive, owing to the very high frequencies at which they work.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Mounting chips on a hybrid substrate (mounting in general with wire bonding to connect the chips to the hybrid substrate) is itself very expensive when there are many chips to be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These components include, especially in the case of automobile applications, contactless access ports operating by electromagnetic coupling for transmitting and receiving the waves.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Transmission by electromagnetic coupling at these very high frequencies is accomplished by using the free propagation properties of electromagnetic signals inside the package and in particular between the inside and the outside. This package includes in particular a conducting cap (a metal or metallized cap) that encloses the signal propagation lines coming from the chip or going to the chip. The conducting cap is located above the external contactless access port, at a distance such that it constitutes (at the main working frequency for which the component is designed) an electromagnetic short-circuit promoting free-propagation signal transmissions via this access port.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Access ports at the working frequency F<sub>0 </sub>of more than 45 GHz are transitions by electromagnetic coupling in the air (or in a gas or in a vacuum) and especially conducting elements capable of radiating toward a waveguide placed facing these elements, or capable of receiving electromagnetic radiation output by a waveguide in front of which they are placed. The package in which the MMIC chips are contained includes a nonconducting part facing these conducting elements so as to let the electromagnetic energy pass between the waveguide and the conducting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a component of the prior art for automobile applications. The component is encapsulated in a package <b>10</b> that includes a contactless electromagnetic access port <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The component comprises a metal base <b>14</b> serving as substrate on which there are directly mounted, via its rear face <b>16</b>, an MMIC microwave chip <b>18</b>, a double-sided ceramic substrate <b>20</b>, serving for interconnections to the inside of the package and to the outside of the package, and a metal or metallized cap <b>19</b> covering the base, in order to enclose, between the base and the cap, the chip and the ceramic substrate <b>20</b>. The MMIC chip <b>18</b> is soldered directly to the base <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The ceramic substrate <b>20</b> is preferably a substrate metallized on both its faces <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, comprising metallizations <b>30</b> on its front face <b>24</b>, in order to form transmission lines, and metallizations <b>32</b> on its rear face <b>26</b>, in order to form a ground plane.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The dimensions of the various dielectric and conducting parts are such that the component operates correctly at the working frequency in question F<sub>0 </sub>(77 GHz). The metallizations <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> serve on the one hand to establish interconnections between chips and, on the other hand, to establish the external access ports of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The access port <b>12</b> of the component shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a contactless electromagnetic coupling transition allowing the signal at the frequency of 77 GHz to pass, contactlessly, from a waveguide to the MMIC chip <b>18</b>, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This electromagnetic coupling transition is preferably made by means of an aperture <b>36</b> in the package <b>10</b>, and more precisely in the metal base <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The substrate <b>20</b> includes a radiating element <b>38</b> communicating for example with a waveguide placed in front of the aperture <b>36</b>, the radiating element acting as element for receiving and transmitting an incoming or outgoing electromagnetic wave in the package.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The electrical connections between the substrate <b>20</b> and the chip <b>18</b> are produced by wire bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The component includes other access ports <b>44</b> operating at frequencies below those of the microwave access port. The MMIC chip is also connected to these other access ports <b>44</b> by wire bonding <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The component is connected to another, similar component or to a different component mounted on a conventional printed circuit via the other access ports <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the automobile radar application, the increase in number of functionalities of such systems entails the use of an increasingly large number of detection radars all around the vehicle and thereby requires greater effort to reduce the costs of the elementary functions of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One of the major problems for these automobile applications is the cost of the millimetric transceiver module. This cost results from the components used, but also from the assembly technology used to fabricate these modules.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The existing solutions do not allow the market-driven cost objectives to be achieved. These solutions are limited for two essential reasons, namely the implementation cost (equipment, training, reproducibility) and the production costs.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention provides, in particular for reducing the production cost of microwave components having contactless access ports, a miniature microwave component comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">a microwave chip encapsulated in an individual package for surface mounting, the chip having an active face, which includes electronic elements and electrical conductors on the active face, and, opposite the active face, a rear face which includes electrical conductors on the rear face and among these conductors on the rear face an electrical conductor forming a ground plane;</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">a metal base for mounting the chip in the package via its rear face, said base having an aperture; and</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">at least two access ports for the communication of electrical signals between the inside and the outside of the package, a contactless microwave access port, by electromagnetic coupling at the aperture in the base, ensuring transmission of coupling signals at a working frequency F<sub>0</sub>, a subharmonic access port via a contact, for inputting, into the integrated circuit, a subharmonic frequency F<sub>0</sub>/n of the working frequency F<sub>0</sub>, characterized in that the chip includes, among its electrical conductors, a coupling electrical conductor connected to the electronic elements of the chip, the coupling conductor being placed at the contactless microwave access port in order to transmit microwave signals by electromagnetic coupling at the working frequency F<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">One main objective of the microwave component according to the invention is to reduce the cost of fabricating the component and to simplify its fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A second objective is to be able to use a component fabrication technology very close to the technologies currently used for fabricating components in high volume, for example those used for components in plastic packages.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Another objective of the component is its compatibility with surface mounting techniques, this representing a major benefit in the case of applications at such millimetric frequencies.</p>
