<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe, at opposite ends of which coupling units formed of a separate material are formed, and a method of manufacturing the same are provided. The vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe includes a reinforced concrete pipe having a reinforcement mat, which is assembled with longitudinal reinforcements and transverse reinforcements, disposed in a concrete layer, and a convexity coupling part and a concavity coupling part that are coupled to opposite ends of the reinforced concrete pipe and have coupling ridges and coupling furrows respectively. Here, the coupling part and the concavity coupling part are formed of a synthetic resin, which is different in physical properties from the reinforced concrete pipe, and have the same shape and thickness as the reinforced concrete pipe. Each of the convexity coupling part and the concavity coupling part has a metal core installed therein to increase a coupling strength.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates, in general, to a vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe and a method of manufacturing the same and, more particularly, to a vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe, at opposite ends of which joint means of high-strength synthetic resin or recycled synthetic resin are provided, and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As is generally known in the art, reinforced concrete pipes are classified by the manufacturing method into centrifugal reinforced concrete pipes and vibrated and rolled (VR) reinforced concrete pipes. The reinforced concrete pipes are produced from a no-slump concrete mixture by a vibrating and compressing method, and are used as drainage pipes, water supply pipes, agricultural water pipes, industrial water pipes, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the reinforced concrete pipes, the gap of a joint or a seam connected in a collar type or a socket type is filled with a filler such as composition mortar. However, the filler falls out of the gap, and thus it is difficult to keep the joint watertight. For this reason, a rubber ring <b>4</b> is used as a primary joining material for joining connector parts <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> of the watertight reinforced concrete pipes that have recently been developed, and composition mortar as a secondary joining material is injected between the connector parts, so that the pipes withstand high hydraulic pressure. However, differential settlement of a pipe line occurs due to compaction of the ground, insufficient foundation work, or careless construction practices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, to prevent a tremendous concentrated load P such as that from soil pressure above the pipe, the load of vehicles, and a dead load of the pipe from being directly applied to the rubber ring <b>4</b> between the pipes, another method of simultaneously injecting the rubber ring <b>4</b> and the composition mortar as the secondary joining material is used, so that the rubber ring <b>4</b> is responsible for handling only the hydraulic pressure, while the composition mortar takes charge of the concentrated load P. However, due to either the breakdown of the injected composition mortar for failing to withstand the concentrated load P or the differential settlement, it is impossible to accomplish the desired purpose of external water flowing into the pipes or internal water flowing out of the pipes. Particularly, a large quantity of external water, i.e. infiltration or inflow, is generated. Recently, pipe maintenance work has been carried out on a large scale for the purpose of protecting the environment and improving the quality of water.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To solve this problem, many inventions have been proposed, representative examples of which are Korean Utility Model Registration No. 333394, entitled &#x201c;THE CONNECTING STRUCTURE OF THE CONCRETE PIPES&#x201d; (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;Cited Invention 1&#x201d;) and Korean Patent No. 726736, entitled &#x201c;FIXING CONSTRUCTURE OF DRAINAGE&#x201d; (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;Cited Invention 2&#x201d;). As for the construction of each invention, Cited Invention 1 is constructed, as in shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, so that cross section L-shaped circular angles <b>3</b> and <b>3</b>&#x2032; are inserted into a spigot part <b>1</b> and a socket part <b>2</b> of the concrete pipes connected by socket connection respectively, and a ring-shaped sealing member <b>4</b> is interposed between the circular angles <b>3</b> and <b>3</b>&#x2032;. Thereby, the socket part <b>2</b> takes charge of a concentrated load P such as soil pressure, and the ring-shaped sealing member <b>4</b> takes charge of watertightness. However, Cited Invention 1 fails to overcome the problem of the conventional concrete pipe, i.e. the breakdown of the socket part <b>2</b>. Due to the breakdown of the socket part <b>2</b> and the twisting of the pipe, watertightness is easily broken.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, Cited Invention 2 includes sewer pipes <b>210</b> and <b>210</b>&#x2032;, wherein the sewer pipe <b>210</b>&#x2032; includes a socket part <b>211</b> that is provided with a slit <b>212</b>, and a plurality of embedded nuts <b>222</b> that are provided adjacent to the slit <b>212</b>, wherein the sewer pipe <b>210</b> includes a circular pipe part <b>213</b> that is provided with a fixing groove <b>214</b> in an outer circumference thereof, and wherein the sewer pipes <b>210</b> and <b>210</b>&#x2032; include inner end steps <b>215</b> and <b>215</b>&#x2032; that are formed in inner circumferences of the socket part <b>211</b> and the circular pipe part <b>213</b>; an inner seal <b>230</b> having a circular ring <b>231</b> that is in close contact with the inner end steps and an insert part <b>232</b> that is integrally formed with the circular ring <b>231</b> and protrudes from the middle of an outer circumference of the circular ring <b>231</b> at a right angle; coupling rings <b>240</b> and <b>240</b>&#x2032; that are inserted into the fixing groove <b>214</b> of the sewer pipe <b>210</b>, are fixed to the socket part <b>211</b> of the other sewer pipe <b>210</b>&#x2032;, are coupled by nuts <b>248</b> and first bolts <b>246</b> passing through fastening holes <b>242</b> of coupling flanges <b>241</b>, have external protection parts <b>244</b> formed outside slits <b>243</b> and making close contact with an outer surface of the socket part <b>211</b>, are provided with fastening holes <b>242</b>&#x2032; through which second bolts <b>246</b> pass and then are fastened to the embedded nuts <b>222</b>, and are formed as a set in two; a packing <b>250</b> that is located inside the coupling rings <b>240</b> and <b>240</b>&#x2032;, has holes <b>251</b> through which the second bolts <b>246</b> pass in a horizontal direction, and are fixed in close contact with an end face of the socket part <b>211</b>; and a bottom support <b>260</b> that is installed in close contact with the outer circumference of the circular pipe parts <b>213</b> of the sewer pipes <b>210</b> and <b>210</b>&#x2032;, has a rubber pad <b>267</b> attached to a round face of an arcuate body <b>261</b> thereof, is provided with anchor holes <b>262</b>, through which anchors <b>270</b> pass, and connecting holes <b>263</b>, into which connecting rods <b>275</b> are inserted, in vertical and horizontal directions respectively, so as to prevent arbitrary motion of the sewer pipes. With this construction, the problem of Cited Invention 1 is solved. However, Cited Invention 2 has disadvantages in that its connection construction is complicated, that many parts are used to inevitably increase the cost of production, and that a constructing process is complicated and requires much time.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the present invention has been made in an effort to solve the problems occurring in the related art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe, which has coupling means precisely formed of a high-strength or recycled synthetic resin so as to be able to prevent damage to opposite ends of the reinforced concrete watertight pipe, provide excellent watertightness, minimize the influence of a concentrated load, and easily connect the reinforced concrete watertight pipes to each other, and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve the above object, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe, which comprises: a reinforced concrete pipe having a reinforcement mat, which is assembled with longitudinal reinforcements and transverse reinforcements, disposed in a concrete layer; and a coupling means made up of a convexity coupling means and a concavity coupling means that are coupled to opposite ends of the reinforced concrete pipe and have coupling ridges and coupling furrows respectively. Here, the convexity coupling means and the concavity coupling means are formed of a material having physical properties different from those of the reinforced concrete pipe, and have shape and thickness identical to those of the reinforced concrete pipe. The convexity coupling means and the concavity coupling means are required to be precisely formed of a high-strength or recycled synthetic resin in order to secure watertightness, and each have a metal core installed therein so as to increase durability, vibration resistance, and coupling strength.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe, which comprises: a process of preparing a reinforced concrete pipe by sequentially performing a process of installing a form around a reinforcement mat having longitudinal reinforcements and transverse reinforcements, a process of injecting concrete into the form, and a process of heating and rotating the entire form to cure the concrete with the reinforcement mat disposed in place by centrifugal force; a process of forming a convexity coupling means and a concavity coupling means, which includes a process of inserting metal cores into respective molds, a process of filling a fused resin into a cavity of each mold under high pressure, and a process of cooling the resin and removing each mold; a process of fixing the convexity coupling means and the concavity coupling means to opposite ends of the reinforcement mat; and a process of sequentially performing a process of installing another form around the fixed result and another curing process similar to that used in the process of preparing the reinforced concrete pipe, or which comprises: a process of preparing a reinforced concrete pipe by sequentially performing a process of installing a form around a reinforcement mat having longitudinal reinforcements and transverse reinforcements, a process of injecting concrete into the form, and a process of heating and rotating the entire form to cure the concrete with the reinforcement mat held in place by centrifugal force; a process of fixing extension bars of each metal core to the reinforcement mat protruding toward opposite ends of the reinforced concrete pipe; and a process of forming a convexity coupling means and a concavity coupling means, which includes a process of installing a mold for forming the coupling means so as to surround the cores and the opposite ends of the reinforcement mat and to enable the pipes to be connected in series, a process of filling a fused resin into a cavity of the mold under high pressure, a process of cooling the resin, and a process of removing the mold.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, coupling means precisely formed of a high-strength or recycled synthetic resin are provided at opposite ends of the reinforced concrete pipe, so that the vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe is highly resistant to deformation and a concentrated load. Since the coupling means are formed of a synthetic resin having high resistance to brittleness and good flexibility, the vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe shows excellent watertightness and is not susceptible to being damaged by external shocks. Thus, the vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe can overcome conventional problems, and recycle wasted synthetic resin. Further, the vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe is easily manufactured and constructed, so that it can be installed within a short time at a low cost, and is easy to perform maintenance on.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Particularly, a method of connecting the vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipes can be visually checked, and after making the connection, the position of the watertight pipes cannot be changed. Thus, a sagging phenomenon that, after the pipes are connected as in a known socket connection method, a connected portion becomes loose to generate a gap due to soil pressure, does not occur. The vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe can avoid the inconvenience of reconstruction, provide an easy watertight test, and secure high watertightness.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">MODE FOR INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reference will now be made in greater detail to exemplary embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the present invention is directed to provide a vibration-resistant reinforced concrete watertight pipe, which includes: a reinforced concrete pipe <b>10</b> having a reinforcement mat <b>20</b>, which is assembled with longitudinal reinforcements <b>21</b> and transverse reinforcements <b>22</b>, disposed in a concrete layer; and a convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and a concavity coupling means <b>40</b> that are formed at opposite ends thereof, are formed of a high-strength synthetic resin or a recycled synthetic resin, which is different in physical properties from the reinforced concrete pipe, and which have the same shape and thickness as the reinforced concrete pipe. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> are provided with coupling ridges <b>31</b> formed as male threads and coupling furrows <b>41</b> formed as female threads, and thus are screwed to connect the reinforced concrete watertight pipe to another reinforced concrete watertight pipe in series. Here, when the reinforced concrete watertight pipes are connected in series, a watertight ring <b>70</b> is fitted into one of ring insertion grooves <b>71</b> formed in outer ends of the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> that are opposite to each other. The watertight ring <b>70</b> is formed of an elastic material, and has slightly larger dimensions than the ring insertion groove <b>71</b>. Then, the reinforced concrete watertight pipe to be connected is turned, and thus the watertight ring <b>70</b> is fitted into the other ring insertion groove <b>71</b>, and is compressed in a turning direction. Thereby, the watertightness is enhanced at the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Meanwhile, conventional reinforced concrete pipes connected in a socket or collar type have been easily deformed at their joint by, for instance, vibration, so that the leakage of water occurs. In contrast, the connecting construction of the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> is not susceptible to deformation or separation, so that the leakage of water does not occur, which results in excellent vibration resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each component for this construction will be described in greater detail. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> formed of a high-strength synthetic resin or a recycled synthetic resin are provided therein with metal cores <b>50</b>, each of which reinforces vibration resistance, durability, or strength, so as to be able to withstand a tremendous concentrated load such as soil pressure above the reinforced concrete watertight pipe, loads of vehicles, and the dead load of the pipe. To further reinforce the strength of the core <b>50</b>, the core <b>50</b> may be provided with a rib <b>52</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the core <b>50</b> is integrally formed with extension bars <b>51</b>, each of which protrudes outwardly from the core <b>50</b> and is formed of the same metal material as the core <b>50</b>, so as to be able to form the reinforced concrete watertight pipe by directly connecting the core <b>50</b> having such strength to the reinforced concrete pipe <b>10</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the extension bars <b>51</b> are welded to the reinforcement mat <b>20</b> of the reinforced concrete pipe <b>10</b>. Thereby, the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> can be connected to the reinforced concrete pipe <b>10</b>. Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each of the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> may be additionally provided with a recess <b>60</b> in an inner end face thereof in which concrete poured when the reinforced concrete pipe <b>10</b> is formed is filled to increase connectability and watertightness.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, each of the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> formed of a high-strength synthetic resin or a recycled synthetic resin is provided with anchors <b>53</b> at an inner end thereof to fasten it to the reinforcement mat <b>20</b>. The convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> can be assembled, so as not to be separated from the reinforcement mat <b>20</b>, in such a manner that the transverse reinforcements <b>22</b> located at opposite ends of the reinforcement mat <b>20</b> are fitted into gaps between a body of the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the anchors <b>53</b> and between a body of the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> and the anchors <b>53</b> and then are fastened to the anchors <b>53</b> by, for instance, welding, or perhaps each longitudinal reinforcement <b>21</b> is fitted into a groove of each anchor <b>53</b> and then is fastened to each anchor <b>53</b> by, for instance, welding.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> may be connected to each other by screwing as described above. As another example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> is provided with protrusions <b>32</b> and grooves <b>42</b> that are alternately formed at regular intervals at an outer end thereof instead of the coupling ridges <b>31</b>, and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> is also provided with protrusions and grooves <b>42</b> that are alternately formed at regular intervals at an outer end thereof instead of the coupling furrows <b>41</b>. Thus, when the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> is inserted into and turned in the concavity coupling means <b>40</b>, the protrusions <b>32</b> are engaged with the grooves <b>42</b>. In this manner, after the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> is inserted into the concavity coupling means <b>40</b>, the reinforced concrete watertight pipe to be connected is turned in one direction, so that the reinforced concrete watertight pipes can be connected in series.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the coupling ridges <b>31</b> of the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the coupling furrows <b>41</b> of the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> are modified so as to be directly connected by a method other than the turning method. To this end, each of the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> is provided with a wedged ring <b>32</b> and a recessed ring <b>42</b> that are formed at an outer end thereof. When the reinforced concrete watertight pipe to be connected is pushed in the direction opposite the connecting direction, or is pulled on the side of the reinforced concrete watertight pipe that has been connected, the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> is inserted into the concavity coupling means <b>40</b>, and thus the wedged ring <b>32</b> is engaged to the counterpart recessed ring <b>42</b>. Thereby, the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b> can be directly connected.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with respect to the construction of a conventional reinforced concrete pipe that is a rigid structure, when the reinforced concrete pipe is subjected to minute changes in linearity or flexure due to differential settlement, stress concentrates on a joint edge, and thus a watertight ring becomes deformed resulting in water leaking, or the joint edge is subjected to cracks and damage, and thus watertightness deteriorates. As such, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the convexity coupling means <b>30</b> and the concavity coupling means <b>40</b>, which are formed of a synthetic resin as a material that has higher resistance to brittleness and better flexibility than the rigid reinforced concrete, are each provided with buffer grooves <b>61</b> having the shape of a continuous ring in inner and outer circumferences thereof, so that they can be prevented from being deformed by shocks, concentrated stress, or flexure of the joint.</p>
