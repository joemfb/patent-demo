<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 12/100,976 filed on Apr. 10, 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,123,897 which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) on Patent Application No. 2007-104478 filed in Japan on Apr. 12, 2007, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a room temperature fast-curing organopolysiloxane composition which is adapted for uses as a silicone sealant, an adhesive, a coating agent, or a potting agent, and more specifically, to a room temperature fast-curing organopolysiloxane composition which cures by condensation and which has excellent fast curability as well as excellent deep curability. This invention also relates to a method for curing such room temperature fast-curing organopolysiloxane composition.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional condensation-curable room temperature fast-curing organopolysiloxane compositions include one part-type compositions in which amount of the crosslinking agent has been reduced to the minimum level to thereby increase the crosslinking speed, and the two part-type compositions in which the crosslinking agent and the curing agent have been separately packaged. However, the one part-type composition does not really have a fast curability since it only exhibits high curing speed on its surface, and a considerable time is required for the in depth curing. The two part-type composition, on the other hand, has the drawback of poor handling convenience since the two parts cannot be mixed at a ratio of 1:1, and it is not adapted for use in an automatic mixer despite its relatively high in depth curability. Furthermore, in order to accomplish complete curing to the full depth, a strict control in the amount of the crosslinking agent and the curing agent added, or alternatively, an addition of water as an in depth curing agent was necessary. In the meanwhile, an addition curable organopolysiloxane composition requires a heated furnace for its curing although it has improved workability since the two parts can be mixed at a ratio of 1:1. The addition curable organopolysiloxane composition also has the drawback that the working conditions are limited since the curing catalyst is poisoned in the presence of an addition poison.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generation of water in the composition system is effective in solving such problems. Japanese Patent No. 2811134 (Patent Document 1) proposes use of the water generated as a side product in the course of ketimine formation between an organic compound having at least one C&#x2550;O group in its molecule and an organic compound having at least one NH<sub>2 </sub>group in its molecule for the depth curing agent. Japanese Patent No. 2841155 (Patent Document 2) proposes use of water generated as a side product in the course of ketimine formation between the ketone compound generated from an alkenoxysilane and a primary amine compound for the in depth curing agent. Japanese Patent No. 3121188 (Patent Document 3) proposes use of water generated as a side product in the course of Michael addition between a &#x3b2; keto ester compound and an organic compound having at least one NH<sub>2 </sub>group in one molecule for the depth curing agent. However, in order to supply the water at an amount sufficient for the crosslinking reaction, volatile components such as the organic compound having C&#x2550;O group and the organic compound having NH<sub>2 </sub>group, the alkenoxysilane and the primary amine compound, the &#x3b2; keto ester and the organic compound having NH<sub>2 </sub>group should be added at a large amount. Use of the methods requiring such addition of volatile components at a large amount will be gradually limited in consideration of the increasingly severe regulations of environmental load substances such as sick house regulations and VOC regulations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-338811 (Patent Document 4) proposes use of the water generated in the course of neutralization between a carboxylic acid generated by hydrolysis of a hydrolyzable silane having at least two acyloxy groups in its molecule or its partial hydrolysate and an inorganic filler for the in depth curing agent. However, such curable composition generating a carboxylic acid which generates a carboxylic acid has extremely limited applications because of the metal corrosion problem.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-12767 (Patent Document 5) proposes direct supply of the moisture by incorporating a moisture-containing wet silica in the composition, and use of the thus supplied moisture for the in depth curing agent. However, control of the curing reaction is difficult when the moisture is directly supplied, and workability is hardly realized.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-129130 corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,075 (Patent Document 6) discloses a room temperature-curable organopolysiloxane composition comprising an amino group-containing silane and 1-methylvinyloxy group-containing silane, and having a good flowability. However, the amino group-containing silane used in the composition does not form a compound having &#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>group when hydrolyzed. This does not make the composition fast-curing.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been accomplished in view of the situation as described above, and an object of the present invention is to provide a room temperature fast-curing organopolysiloxane composition which has excellent fast curability as well as deep curability even if an organic compound having C&#x2550;O group and the organic compound having NH<sub>2 </sub>group which are the volatile components are not used. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for curing such a composition.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to realize the objects as described above, the inventors of the present invention have made a further study to use the water which has generated in the course of ketimine formation as a side product for an in depth curing agent. More specifically, instead of using an organic compound having C&#x2550;O group and an organic compound having NH<sub>2 </sub>group, the inventors tried to use an organic compound having C&#x2550;O group and an organic compound having NH<sub>2 </sub>group that had resulted in the course of crosslinking of the crosslinking agent for the in depth curing agent. After extensive study of various types of crosslinking agents and catalyst species, the inventors found that a room temperature fast-curing organopolysiloxane composition comprising (A) a diorganopolysiloxane having both ends terminated with hydroxy group and/or a hydrolyzable group, (B) a silane and/or a siloxane having at least 3 alkenoxysilyl groups in its molecule, (C) a silane and/or a siloxane having at least 3 aminosilyl groups in its molecule and being capable of forming a compound having &#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>group by hydrolysis, and (D) a curing catalyst has sufficient fast curability as well as excellent in depth curability. The present invention has been accomplished on the bases of such findings.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, the present invention provides a room temperature fast-curing organopolysiloxane composition comprising</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">(A) 100 parts by weight of a diorganopolysiloxane having both ends terminated with hydroxy group and/or a hydrolyzable group,</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">(B) 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of a silane and/or a siloxane having at least 3 alkenoxysilyl groups in its molecule,</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">(C) 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of a silane and/or a siloxane having at least 3 aminosilyl groups in its molecule and being capable of forming a compound having &#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>group by hydrolysis, and</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">(D) 0.01 to 10 parts by weight of a curing catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this case, it is preferred that the room temperature fast-curing organopolysiloxane composition is formulated as a two part composition comprising a first part composition containing the components (A), (B), and (D), and a second part composition containing the components (A), (C), and optionally (D).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">More preferably, the present invention provides a room temperature fast-curing organopolysiloxane composition consisting of a first part composition and a second part composition,</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">said first part composition comprising</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">(A) 10 to 90 parts by weight of a diorganopolysiloxane having both ends terminated with hydroxy group and/or a hydrolyzable group,</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">(B) 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of a silane and/or a siloxane having at least 3 alkenoxy silyl groups in its molecule, and</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">(D) 0.01 to 10 parts by weight of a curing catalyst, and</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">said second part composition comprising</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">(A) 10 to 90 parts by weight of a diorganopolysiloxane having both ends terminated with hydroxy group and/or a hydrolyzable group,</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">(C) 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of a silane and/or a siloxane having at least 3 aminosilyl groups in its molecule being capable of forming a compound having &#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>group by hydrolysis, and</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the room temperature fast-curing organopolysiloxane composition of the present invention is prepared as a one part-type composition or prepared as a two part-type composition so that the first and second part compositions are separately prepared and mixed before using, the resulting composition is applied on a desired substrate and cured.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Alternatively, when the first and second part compositions are separately prepared, the room temperature rapid-curing organopolysiloxane composition of the present invention may be used by coating a substrate with the first part composition and another substrate with the second part composition, and thereafter bonding the substrates by bringing the first part composition with the second part composition for curing.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Curing may be conducted at a temperature of 0 to 150&#xb0; C., especially 10 to 50&#xb0; C., although curing is usually conducted at room temperature. Curing time is not particularly limited, although the curing is conducted for 10 minutes to 3 days.</p>
