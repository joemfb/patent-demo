<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit of priority of International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2008/010844, filed Dec. 18, 2008, which application claims priority of German Application No. 102008004775.9, filed Jan. 16, 2008. The entire text of the priority application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a device for transporting objects such as the type used for transferring objects between two different conveyors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a device is known from DE 20 2004 012 848 U1. The known device contains a first and a second conveyor which run horizontally parallel with respect to each other and in different directions. The conveyors are embodied as belt conveyors and in particular consist of supporting plates connected to each other via hinges on which objects, such as bottles of plastics or the like, empty or filled, stand stably. Between the two conveyors, a transfer unit is arranged which, driven by an external travel drive, can move along the conveyors and relative with respect to them and takes care that objects can be exchanged between the first and the second conveyor. To this end, a third conveyor and a conveyor drive for the third conveyor are arranged on the transfer unit, of which the structural embodiment is identical to the first and the second conveyor. This third conveyor continuously runs on the transfer unit and alternately comes into transferring contact with the first and the second conveyor. Each conveyor runs on its own supporting rail which takes care that the conveyors can run at the same level.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">From WO 2005/102880, a conveyor/storage means with a first and a second conveyor which are at least regionally guided parallel with respect to each other and at a distance one next to the other is known. The two conveyors are arranged in a coiled manner or as conveyor tower or spirally in the plane. To be able to transfer objects between the conveyors, a slide can be traveled between the conveyors on which a guiding means in the form of a deflector and guiding surface is arranged. The guiding means projects into the first as well as into the second conveyor, such that the articles can be shifted over from the conveyor conveying towards the guiding means to the conveyor moving away from the guiding means. The slide is driven via the drive of the first and the second conveyor and runs on a guide which preferably also supports the drive for the slide, for example in the form of a belt or a chain or the like. The guide is arranged centrically between the two conveyors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">From EP 581 143, a conveyor means is known which is in particular designed for conveying cigarettes. The conveyor means contains a conveyor tower with first and second conveyors arranged in a coiled manner which are arranged vertically one above the other in one embodiment. At the outer periphery of the conveyor means, a belt wagon is guided and driven via a rotating arm, which on the one hand supports a deflection point between the two conveyors and on the other hand comprises a withdrawal conveyor consisting of two conveyor belts touching the conveying side of the conveyor on both sides. The belts of the withdrawal conveyor lift the stream of articles conveyed by the conveyor from its conveying side and move it tangentially to the coil to a deflection zone embodied as a vertical conveyor line and from there to a return conveyor that places the deflected articles onto the second conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is furthermore known, for example from WO 2005/073113, to arrange a continuous conveyor means divided into a first (conveying side) and a second (slack side) conveyor parallel to each other in a coiled and ascending and descending manner so that a conveyor tower is formed. The conveying side and the slack side can be driven independently with respect to each other. To here have the possibility of modifying the ratio of the capacities of the conveyors, the deflection points of the conveyors are, in the known device, arranged on a slide which can be traveled by the drive of the two sides such that the length ratio between the conveyor side and the slack side changes.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An aspect underlying the disclosure is to provide a structurally simple and reliably effective device for transporting objects.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disclosure is based on the finding that with a transfer unit which is provided with a separate (third) conveyor that can be driven independently of the first and the second conveyor, transfer can take place, with conveyors situated next to each other and guided in a coiled or spiral manner, in a structurally simple manner despite the difference of the radius of curvature between the two conveyors.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">By the embodiment of the supporting rails such that two adjacent conveyors each, i.e. the third with the first or the third with the second conveyor, share one supporting rail, on the one hand the work required for the construction if two adjacent supporting rails have to be aligned at the same level with respect to each other is reduced, particularly involving a lot of work in case of conveyors guided in a coiled or spiral manner. Moreover, it is much easier to observe wear on the mutual supporting rails than would be the case with individual rails, as the mutual rails are exposed at least on the side of the transfer unit outside the transfer unit and wear can be well observed there. Preferably, at least the running surface of the supporting rail is embodied as wearing part and antifrictional.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, a travel drive for the motion of the transfer unit along the first and the second conveyor is provided which in the preferred embodiment is also carried by the transfer unit, so that complex tracking of drive means can be eliminated. For such a travel drive, a gear drive on the transfer unit that cooperates with a stationary toothed rack is particularly suited.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The transfer unit, however, can also be driven by a stationary travel drive which preferably moves a catch fixed to the transfer unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The transfer unit is held by a supporting means which in a preferred embodiment contains rollers running on a running surface. In case of coiled conveyor lines, the supporting means can be located at the same level as the third conveyor. In particular for third conveyors embodied for a suspended conveyance, it is, however, preferred to provide the support and transfer at different decks, as in this manner a suspended conveyance can be structurally and procedurally realized much easier, or only becomes possible at all by this measure.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show in a highly schematized, perspective representation, a device <b>1</b> for transporting objects. The device <b>1</b> is particularly suited for the transport and intermediate storage of beverage containers, such as for example bottles and in particular plastic bottles. The device <b>1</b> contains a first conveyor <b>2</b> and a second conveyor <b>3</b> which are arranged at a horizontal distance A and parallel to each other and guided via a spiraling conveyor line, or, as represented, a conveyor line ascending and descending in a coiled manner about an axis of curvature <b>1</b><i>a</i>. In the represented embodiment, the device <b>1</b> is embodied as conveyor, intermediate storage and/or buffer tower, where the first conveyor <b>2</b> is embodied as ascending run-in and the second conveyor <b>3</b> as descending run-out.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the represented embodiment, the two conveyors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are embodied for an upright conveyance of objects, such as for example bottles, and contain correspondingly adjusted, belt-like conveyors with a base surface. Conveyors consisting of a circulating chain having a plurality of individual base plates <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>a </i>connected to each other via hinged joints, as they are used, for example in WO 2005/073113, are particularly suited. Such conveyors are well-known and do not have to be illustrated more in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">To increase or reduce the conveyor line between the run-in and the run-out, which is accomplished depending on the number of objects to be transported or stored intermediately, a transfer unit <b>4</b> in the form of a slide is provided between the conveyors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> running in parallel. The transfer unit <b>4</b> is moved in the gap A between the two conveyors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and parallel and relative to the movement of the conveyors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The transfer unit <b>4</b> is here in transferring contact with both conveyors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and to this end contains a third conveyor <b>5</b> which preferably is also a belt-like continuous conveyor provided with base plates <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the type also employed for the first and the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The transfer unit <b>4</b> furthermore supports a conveyor drive <b>6</b> in the form of a motor which rotates a drive wheel <b>7</b> for driving the third conveyor <b>5</b>. The conveyor drive <b>6</b> is guided along with the movement of the transfer unit <b>4</b>. Furthermore, various deflection rollers <b>8</b> are provided which impart a noncircular, preferably long stretched-out contour to the third conveyor <b>5</b>, forming a first transfer line <b>4</b>.<b>1</b> with the first conveyor <b>2</b> and a second transfer line <b>4</b>.<b>2</b> with the second conveyor <b>3</b>, in which the third conveyor <b>5</b> runs parallel, in the same direction and very close to the first or second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> no that transfer can take place. Here, the transfer line which is situated externally with respect to the axis of curvature of the conveyor line, in the represented embodiment the first transfer line <b>4</b>.<b>1</b>, is shorter than the internally situated transfer line <b>4</b>.<b>2</b>. The transfer is accomplished by guides or the like which are well-known in prior art and do not have to be illustrated again here.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the enlarged representation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> show, the first, second and third conveyors run at the same level, i.e. they are oriented to be aligned next to each other in the horizontal plane with their base plates <b>2</b><i>a </i>or <b>3</b><i>a </i>or <b>5</b><i>a</i>, respectively. The conveyors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> run on supporting rails <b>9</b> which are embodied as wearing parts and antifrictional. To this end, the supporting rails <b>9</b> preferably contain a friction lining <b>10</b> which is preferably exchangeable and covers the upper side of the supporting rail <b>9</b> facing the lower side of the plates <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, as well as the sides of the supporting rail <b>9</b><i>a </i>facing the respective contacting conveyor <b>2</b> and <b>5</b> or <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>, respectively. The friction lining <b>10</b> preferably consists of suited plastics.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The supporting rails <b>9</b> are also coiled and stationarily arranged at a bearing structure <b>17</b> for the first and/or the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, such that two adjacent conveyors each, i.e. the first conveyor <b>2</b> and the third conveyor <b>5</b> or the second conveyor <b>3</b> and the third conveyor <b>5</b>, share the supporting rail <b>9</b> located between them. This is advantageous in particular in case of conveyors guided in a coiled manner, as in this manner, wear becomes uniform and can be detected more easily. At the external sides facing away from the transfer unit <b>4</b>, the same supporting rails can be employed to facilitate the storage of the wearing linings <b>10</b>, or rails having a different design can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The transfer unit <b>4</b> can be traveled bidirectionally by means of a travel drive <b>11</b> in the gap A between the first and the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and independently of the motion of the first and the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, in the direction of the double arrow. In the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the travel drive <b>11</b> is accommodated on the transfer unit <b>4</b> and taken along by the transfer unit <b>4</b>. The travel drive <b>11</b> designed as motor contains a gear drive with a driven gearwheel <b>12</b> that meshes with a stationary toothed rack <b>13</b>. The toothed rack <b>13</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, arranged at the bearing structure <b>17</b> underneath the transition between one of the conveyors, in the represented embodiment the second conveyor <b>3</b>, and the transfer unit <b>4</b>, i.e. the third conveyor <b>5</b>, and it is coiled analogously to the conveyors.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The transfer unit <b>4</b> is held by a supporting means <b>40</b> preferably assigned to the first as well as to the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, which in the represented embodiment contains track rollers <b>14</b> and at least one running surface <b>13</b><i>a</i>, where the toothed rack <b>13</b> can serve as running surface at the side of the one conveyor, and a similar rack is assigned to the other conveyor. In the represented embodiment, both racks are embodied as web having a rectangular cross-section, where in the toothed rack <b>13</b> a narrow longitudinal side is provided with the tooth pitch and in both racks the upper and lower sides are embodied as running surfaces <b>13</b><i>a </i>for at least one track roller <b>14</b> each.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The drive of the transfer unit <b>4</b>, however, can also be accomplished by a stationary travel drive <b>15</b>, as it is represented, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The travel drive <b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in turn contains a motor which rotates a wheel <b>16</b> forward and backward about an axle <b>16</b>&#x2032; which is coincident with the axis of curvature <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the first and the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. A catch <b>17</b> in the form of a rigid rod or connecting brace is fixed to the wheel <b>16</b>, which preferably projects from above through the transfer unit <b>4</b> outside the area of motion of the third conveyor <b>5</b>, for example grips through an opening in the transfer unit embodied as guide bush or the like and is thereby vertically guided in the transfer unit <b>4</b>, and takes along the transfer unit <b>4</b> into the desired direction along the coiled travel as soon as the wheel <b>16</b> is rotated into the corresponding direction. The catch here extends across several coil levels of the conveyors, preferably across all of them.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, one can see a further embodiment of a device according to the disclosure <b>1</b> where the same or comparable components are designated with the same reference numerals and are not illustrated again.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The device <b>1</b> contains a first and a second conveyor which are here embodied for a suspended conveyance of objects, where bottles <b>50</b> are shown, and comprise corresponding mountings <b>51</b> of a conventional type, for example mountings of the type gripping with fork-like ends under a collar provided at the neck of the bottle for this purpose, or controllable gripping pliers known per se. The mountings <b>51</b> project from the conveyors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> such that the receiving ends of the mountings <b>51</b> project into the gap A in the area of the conveyor line guided in a coiled manner.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The device <b>1</b> furthermore contains a transfer unit <b>4</b> moving in the gap A between the first and the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The transfer unit <b>4</b> contains a third conveyor <b>52</b> which in turn is embodied as continuous conveyor. In the represented embodiment, the third conveyor <b>52</b> is embodied as conveyor wheel at the circumference of which the same mountings <b>51</b> as in the first and the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> project essentially horizontally. The pitch, i.e. the distance of the mountings <b>51</b>, on the first and the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and the third conveyor <b>52</b> is adjusted such that between the first conveyor <b>2</b> and the third conveyor <b>52</b> as well as the third conveyor <b>52</b> and the second conveyor <b>3</b>, a position-specific transfer can take place. The transfer can be accomplished in a well-known manner, for example by the fork-like ends overlapping, or by deflectors or guiding surfaces or other transfer means being provided.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">On the transfer unit <b>4</b>, furthermore the conveyor drive <b>6</b> for driving the third conveyor <b>52</b> and the travel drive <b>11</b> for moving the transfer unit <b>4</b> also move along and relative to the first and second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The transfer unit <b>4</b> is in turn supported via a supporting means <b>40</b> each in the area of the first and the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> which is similar to the supporting means <b>40</b> of the above embodiments with respect to its construction and function. The supporting means <b>40</b>, however, is arranged at an arm <b>53</b> of the transfer unit <b>4</b> having a vertical distance to the third conveyor <b>52</b> adapted to the vertical distance of the coils of the first and the second conveyor <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The travel drive <b>11</b> is in the represented embodiment arranged at the third conveyor <b>52</b>, connected to the arm <b>53</b> via a motor shaft <b>11</b><i>a </i>and drives the gearwheel <b>12</b> which meshes with the toothed rack <b>13</b> for a travel drive of the transfer unit <b>4</b> in the already described manner, the toothed rack <b>13</b> being assigned to at least one of the two stationary conveyors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The arm <b>53</b> furthermore supports the track rollers <b>14</b> of the supporting means <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The arm <b>53</b> is dimensioned such that the supporting means <b>40</b> and the travel drive via the gearwheel <b>12</b> and the toothed rack <b>13</b> on the one hand and the transfer between the third and the first or second conveyor on the other hand take place at two different decks I and II of the conveyor line guided in a coiled way. In the represented embodiment, the two decks I and II are situated adjacent one upon the other, where the transfer takes place at the lower deck I and the support as well as the drive at the deck II located thereabove.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To ensure transfer of the bottles from the first conveyor <b>2</b> via the inserted third conveyor <b>52</b> to the second conveyor <b>3</b> with a precise synchronization of the positions, the third conveyor <b>52</b> can be engaged at least with one of the two other conveyors <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> in a driving manner, preferably with a form fit via suited catches, teeth or the like. If the third conveyor <b>52</b> is mechanically synchronized at least with one of the two other conveyors, the precise position control of the travel drive <b>11</b> for a bottle transfer with precise positioning from a mounting <b>51</b> of a conveyor to that of an adjacent conveyor is less problematic, i.e. the position control of the travel drive is facilitated thereby. If the third conveyor is mechanically synchronized with both adjacent conveyors <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, a separate motive travel drive can be possibly dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In variation to the described and drawn embodiments, the disclosure can also be employed in differently constructed conveyors. The travel drive of the transfer unit can also be accomplished in a conventional way, for example via a tow rope. If the travel drive is taken along on the transfer unit, it can also be realized as frictional drive or also via a tow rope that can be wound and unwound. It can be easily seen that the supporting rails between the conveyors can also be mutually used between adjacent conveyors if these are employed in devices which comprise a straight conveyor line in addition or as an alternative to the helical conveyor line. It is furthermore clear that a transfer unit can take along its own travel drive even if the transfer unit is employed on a straight conveyor line in addition or as an alternative. It is furthermore possible to also drive the transfer unit which is effective at two decks via a catch of a stationary drive and to utilize the second deck only for supporting the transfer unit.</p>
