<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus, such as a copying machine, a printer, a facsimile machine, or a multi-function machine having a plurality of functions of these machines.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the image forming apparatus of an electrophotographic type, an image is conventionally formed through an electrophotographic process including processes of charging, exposure, development and transfer. In the charging process, a photosensitive member is electrically charged uniformly to a potential of a predetermined polarity by a corona charger.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Further, at an opening of a shield of the corona charger, a mesh-like grid electrode is provided so that a surface potential or the photosensitive member is a desired potential. Due to such a shape of the grid electrode, a contaminant such as airborne toner is liable to be deposited at an inner surface (close to a discharging electrode) of the grid electrode. When such a contaminant is deposit at the limes surface of the electrode in a large amount, improper charging occurs at the deposition portion resulting in image density non-uniformity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The grid electrode is contaminated with the toner, an external additive and dust particles which are scattered in a main assembly of the image forming apparatus and electrostatically or physically deposited on the grid electrode. In a conventional image forming apparatus, the grid electrode on which the contaminant is deposited becomes unstable in control property, so that a distribution of charging in the corona charger cannot be normally maintained. In this state, the photosensitive drum is electrically charged, with the result that an image defect occurs. As a countermeasure thereto, a means for cleaning a matter to be cleaned (contaminant) has been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A) 2005-338797, a cleaning device for cleaning the inner surface of the grid electrode is provided to prevent deposition of the toner on the grid electrode in a large amount. Specifically, the inner surface of the grid electrode is cleaned by reciprocal movement of a cleaning brush while bringing the cleaning brush into contact with the inner surface of the grid electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, the corona charger uses corona discharge, so that an electric discharge product such as ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) or nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When such an electric discharge product is deposited on the photosensitive member and takes up moisture, a so-called &#x201c;image deletion (flow)&#x201d; phenomenon such that a surface resistance at a portion on which the electric discharge product is deposited is lowered, thus failing to faithfully reproduce an electrostatic latent image depending on image information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">JP-A 2007-72212 discloses prevention of deposition of the electric discharge product on the photosensitive member during non-image formation by providing a shutter to the corona charger and by moving the shutter into and away from a gap between the corona charger and the photosensitive member so as to cover an opening of the corona charger.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Similarly, in order to prevent the image flow occurring below the charger in the case where the charger is left standing in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment after continuous use, a sheet-like member (shutter) is sandwiched between the grid electrode and the photosensitive member during non-charging to prevent the image flow below the charger (JP-A 2010-145851).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in the case where the corona charger is provided above the photosensitive member with respect to a direction of gravitation and a grid cleaning member and the shutter are operated by the same driving means, a grid electrode deposition matter (contaminant) scraped off by the grid cleaning member is dropped on the photosensitive member in some cases. In these cases, there arises a problem such that the photosensitive drum is rubbed with the contaminant to cause the image flow or incorporation of the contaminant into a developing device to result in improper coating or the like. During cleaning with the grid cleaning member, compared with during cleaning of the discharging electrode of the corona charger, a drop amount of the deposited matter (contaminant) dropped onto the photosensitive member is large and becomes problematic.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been accomplished in order to solve the above-described problems resulting from drop, into a photosensitive member, of a grid electrode deposition matter (contaminant) scraped off by a grid cleaning member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">That is, a principal object of the present invention is to provide an image forming apparatus capable of reducing an occurrence of image flow (deletion) caused by rubbing of the photosensitive member with a contaminant which is scraped off of a grid electrode by a cleaning member and is dropped on the photosensitive member and capable of reducing an occurrence of improper coating of a developer by incorporation of the contaminant into a developing container.</p>

That is, the corona charger <b>2</b> includes a discharging wire <b>2</b><i>h </i>as a discharging electrode, a U-shaped electroconductive shield <b>2</b><i>b </i>which is provided so as to surround the discharging wire <b>2</b><i>h</i>, and a grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>provided at an opening of the shield <b>2</b><i>b</i>. In this embodiment, the discharging wire <b>2</b><i>h </i>is a single wire. However, in order to meet high-speed image formation, the corona charger <b>2</b> may also include two discharging wires <b>2</b><i>h</i>. In this case, a partition shield may be provided so as to shield between the two discharging wires <b>2</b><i>h</i>. These constitutions are well known to those skilled in the art and therefore will be omitted from further description.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">In this embodiment, the corona charger <b>2</b> is provided along a generatrix direction of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>. Therefore, a longitudinal direction of the corona charger <b>2</b> is parallel to an axial (shaft) direction of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>. Further, in this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> and <b>5</b>, the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>has a planar mesh-like extending in the axial direction of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>. However, the shape of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">Further, to the corona charger <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a charging bias application source S<b>1</b> for applying a charging bias is connected. The corona charger <b>2</b> uniformly charges the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> to a potential of a negative polarity at a charging position a by the charging bias applied from the application source S<b>1</b>. Specifically, a DC charging bias (voltage) is applied to the discharging wire <b>2</b><i>h </i>and the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>from power sources S<b>1</b> (S<b>1</b><i>a</i>, S<b>1</b><i>b</i>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) controlled by a high-voltage controller <b>301</b> of a control device <b>300</b> for the main assembly of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(Exposure Device)</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">The exposure device <b>3</b> in this embodiment is a laser beam scanner including a semiconductor laser for irradiating the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> charged by the corona charger <b>2</b> with laser light L. Specifically, on the basis of an image signal (information) sent from a host computer connected to the image forming apparatus through a network cable, the image exposure device <b>3</b> outputs the laser light L. The charged surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is exposed to the laser light L along a main scan direction at an exposure position b. By repeating the exposure along the main scan direction during the rotation of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>, of the charged surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>, a portion irradiated with the laser light L is lowered in potential, so that an electrostatic latent image is formed correspondingly to the image information.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">Here, the main scan direction means a direction parallel to the generatrix of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> and a sub-scan direction means a direction parallel to the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(Developing Device)</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">The developing device <b>4</b> deposits a developer (toner) on the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> by the charging device <b>2</b> and the exposure device <b>3</b> to visualize the latent image. The developing device <b>4</b> in this embodiment employs a two component magnetic brush developing method and also employs a reverse developing method. The developing device <b>4</b> includes a developing container <b>4</b><i>a</i>, a developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b</i>, a magnet <b>4</b><i>c</i>, a developing blade <b>4</b><i>d</i>, a developer stirring member <b>4</b><i>f</i>, and a toner hopper <b>4</b><i>g</i>. Incidentally, a reference symbol <b>4</b><i>e </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represents a two component developer accommodated in the developing container <b>4</b><i>a</i>. The developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b </i>is a non-magnetic cylindrical member and is rotatably provided to the developing container <b>4</b><i>a </i>while a part of an outer peripheral surface thereof is outwardly exposed. The magnet <b>4</b><i>c </i>is provided in the developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b </i>in a state in which it is non-rotatable and fixed. The developing blade <b>4</b><i>d </i>regulates a thickness of the two component developer <b>4</b><i>e </i>coated on the developing sleeve surface. The developer stirring member <b>4</b><i>f </i>is disposed on a bottom side in the developing container <b>4</b><i>a </i>and feeds the two component developer <b>4</b><i>e </i>toward the developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b </i>while stirring the developer. The toner hopper <b>4</b><i>g </i>is a container containing toner to be supplied to the developing container <b>4</b><i>a</i>. The two component developer <b>4</b><i>e </i>in the developing container <b>4</b><i>a </i>is a mixture of the toner and a magnetic carrier and is stirred by the developer stirring member <b>4</b><i>f</i>. The magnetic carrier has a resistance of about 10<sup>13 </sup>ohm&#xb7;cm and a particle size of 40 &#x3bc;m. The toner is triboelectrically charged to a negative polarity by rubbing with the carrier. The above-described developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b </i>is disposed oppositely to the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> so as to provide the closest distance of 350 &#x3bc;m from the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>. A portion at which the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> and the developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b </i>oppose each other constitutes a developing portion c. The developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b </i>is rotationally driven so that a movement direction of its surface is opposite from the movement direction of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> surface at the developing portion c. That is, the developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b </i>is rotationally driven in a direction indicated by an arrow R<b>4</b> with respect to the arrow R<b>1</b> direction of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>. A part of the two component developer <b>4</b><i>e </i>in the developing container <b>4</b><i>a </i>is held as a magnetic brush layer at the outer peripheral surface of the developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b </i>by a magnetic force of the inner magnet <b>4</b><i>c </i>and is fed to the developing portion c by the rotation of the developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The magnetic brush layer is regulated as a predetermined thin layer by the developing blade <b>4</b><i>d</i>, so that the layer contacts the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> at the developing portion c.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">To the developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b</i>, a developing bias application source S<b>2</b> is connected, and the toner in the developer carried on the surface of the developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b </i>is selectively deposited correspondingly to the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> by an electric field generated by a developing bias applied from the application source S<b>2</b>. As a result, the electrostatic latent image is developed as the toner image. In this embodiment, the toner is deposited at an exposed portion (laser light irradiation portion) on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>, so that the electrostatic latent image is reversely developed. At this time, a charge amount of the toner subjected to the development on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is about &#x2212;25 &#x3bc;C/g. The developer on the developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b </i>having passed through the developing portion c is collected in the developing container <b>4</b><i>a </i>by subsequent rotation of the developing sleeve <b>4</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">Further, in order to keep the toner content of the two component developer <b>4</b><i>e </i>in the developing container <b>4</b><i>a </i>in a substantially constant range, an optical toner content sensor is provided in the developing container <b>4</b><i>a</i>. The toner in an amount corresponding to the toner content detected by the toner content sensor is supplied from the toner hopper <b>4</b><i>g </i>to the developing container <b>4</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(Transfer Device)</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">The transfer device <b>5</b> in this embodiment includes a transfer roller <b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The transfer roller <b>5</b> is rotated in an arrow R<b>5</b> direction and is urged against the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> with a predetermined urging force to form a nip therebetween as a transfer portion d. To the transfer portion d, the recording material P (e.g., paper or a transparent film) is sent from a sheet-feeding cassette with predetermined control timing.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">The recording material P sent to the transfer d is subjected to transfer of the toner image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> while being nip-conveyed between the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> and the transfer roller <b>5</b>. At this time, to the transfer roller <b>5</b>, a transfer bias (+2 KV in this embodiment) of an opposite polarity to the normal charge polarity (negative) of the toner is applied from a transfer bias application source S<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(Fixing Device)</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The fixing device <b>6</b> in this embodiment includes a fixing roller <b>6</b><i>a </i>and a pressing roller <b>6</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The recording material P on which the toner image is transferred by the transfer device <b>5</b> is conveyed to the fixing device in which the toner image is heated and pressed between the fixing roller <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the pressing roller <b>6</b><i>b </i>to be fixed on the recording material P. The recording material P subjected to the fixing is then discharged outside the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(Cleaning Device)</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">The cleaning device <b>8</b> in this embodiment includes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cleaning blade. After the toner image is transferred on the recording material P by the transfer device <b>5</b>, untransferred toner remaining on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> surface is removed by the cleaning blade.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">(Optical Discharging Device)</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">The optical discharging device <b>9</b> in this embodiment includes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a discharging exposure lamp. Residual charges remaining on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> subjected to the cleaning by the cleaning device <b>8</b> are removed by light irradiation by the discharging exposure lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">A series of the image forming process described above is completed and the image forming apparatus prepares for a subsequent image forming process.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">(Charger Shutter)</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">Then, a charger shutter <b>10</b> as a sheet-like member for opening and closing the opening of the corona charger <b>2</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a state in which the charger shutter <b>10</b> as the sheet-like member is opened by being moved in X direction by a winding-up device <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">In this embodiment, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a sheet-like shutter capable of being wound up in a roll shape by the winding-up device <b>11</b> is employed as the charger shutter <b>10</b> for opening and closing the opening of the corona charger <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">As a result, it is possible to prevent passing of the corona discharge product falling from the corona charger <b>2</b> onto the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>. In addition, it is possible to prevent the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> from being damaged to cause image defect when the charger shutter <b>10</b> contacts the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> by some possibility. Therefore, in this embodiment, as the charger shutter <b>10</b>, a 30 &#x3bc;m-thick sheet-like member formed of polyimide resin is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">Further, a constitution in which the charger shutter <b>10</b> is retracted (wound up) in a roll shape on one end side with respect to a longitudinal direction (main scan direction) of the corona charger <b>2</b> during the image formation is employed in order to reduce a space during the retraction (opening) of the charging shutter <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">(Charger Shutter Opening and Closing Mechanism)</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">An opening and closing mechanism (moving mechanism) for the charger shutter <b>10</b> will be described. As described above, (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an open state of the charger shutter <b>10</b> in this embodiment. Part (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a closed state of the charger shutter <b>10</b>, and (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic structure of the winding-up device <b>11</b>. Parts (a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are a sectional view and a perspective view, respectively, of the opening and closing mechanism <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">This opening and closing mechanism <b>20</b> includes, as shown in (a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and (a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a driving motor M as a driving source, a movable member <b>12</b>, a rotatable member <b>12</b><i>b</i>, a connecting member <b>12</b><i>d</i>, and the winding-up device <b>11</b> and moves the charger shutter <b>10</b> along the longitudinal direction (the main scan direction) of the charger shutter <b>10</b> so as to be opened and closed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">In this embodiment, a shutter detecting device <b>12</b><i>c </i>for detecting completion of an opening operation of the charger shutter <b>10</b> is provided. The shutter detecting device <b>12</b><i>c </i>includes a photointerrupter. When the movable member <b>12</b><i>a </i>reaches the opening operation completion position, the opening operation completion of the charger shutter <b>10</b> is detected by utilizing light-blocking of the photo-interrupter by a movable member <b>12</b><i>a</i>. That is, at the time when the shutter detecting device <b>12</b><i>c </i>detects the movable member <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the rotation of the motor M is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">The charger shutter <b>10</b> is connected to the movable member <b>12</b><i>a </i>at its one end as shown in (a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Further, the movable member <b>12</b><i>a </i>is integrally formed with the connecting member <b>12</b><i>d </i>which is drive-connected to the rotatable member <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">The rotatable member <b>12</b><i>b </i>is, as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, provided with a spiral groove and is, as shown in (a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, connected to the driving motor M. When the rotatable member <b>12</b><i>b </i>is rotationally driven by the driving motor M, the connecting member <b>12</b><i>d </i>threadly mounted on the rotatable member <b>12</b><i>b </i>is moved along the spiral groove in the main scan direction (X direction, Y direction). The connecting member <b>12</b><i>d </i>includes, as shown in (a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, recessed portions <b>12</b><i>e </i>at its end portions. The recessed portions <b>12</b><i>e </i>are configured to be engaged with rails <b>2</b><i>c</i>. As a result, the connecting member <b>12</b><i>d </i>can be reciprocated in the main scan direction on the rails <b>2</b><i>c </i>provided on the shield <b>2</b><i>b </i>by rotationally driving the rotatable member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">Therefore, when the rotatable member <b>12</b><i>b </i>is driven by the driving motor M, via the movable member <b>12</b><i>a </i>integrally formed with the connecting member <b>12</b><i>d</i>, a moving force in the opening and closing direction is transmitted to the charger shutter <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">Further, as shown in (a), (b) and (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the winding-up device <b>11</b> as the winding-up means includes a cylindrical winding-up roller (winding-up member) <b>11</b><i>a </i>for fixing one end of the charger shutter <b>10</b> and for winding up the charger shutter <b>10</b> at its peripheral portion. Further, the winding-up device <b>11</b> includes a shaft member <b>11</b><i>c </i>to be rotationally driven by the connected to a driving motor M<b>2</b> at its end. The winding-up device <b>11</b> includes a torque limiter <b>11</b><i>b</i>, fixed to the winding-up roller <b>11</b><i>a</i>, for transmitting a rotational driving force of the shaft member <b>11</b><i>c </i>to the winding-up roller <b>11</b><i>a </i>and sliding the shaft member in the case where a difference in rotational torque between the winding-up roller <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the shaft member <b>11</b><i>c </i>is not less than a predetermined value. The other end of the shaft member provided so as to penetrate through the winding-up roller <b>11</b><i>a </i>is engaged with the winding-up roller <b>11</b><i>a </i>via a bearing <b>11</b><i>d </i>so that the shaft member <b>11</b><i>c </i>can independently rotate without being fixed to the winding-up roller <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">Therefore, when the charger shutter <b>10</b> is opened ((a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), with movement of the charger shutter <b>10</b> in the X direction by the driving motor M, the winding-up device <b>11</b> is driven by the driving motor M<b>2</b> at a speed somewhat faster than the moving speed of the charger shutter <b>10</b> in the X direction. As a result, the charger shutter <b>10</b> is wound up on an as needed bias without sagging downward. That is, the charger shutter <b>10</b> is in a state in which the charger shutter <b>10</b> is always urged in the X direction by the torque limiter <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the winding-up device <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">On the other hand, when the charger shutter <b>10</b> is closed ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), with movement of the charger shutter <b>10</b> in the Y direction by the driving motor M, the winding-up device <b>11</b> is driven by the driving motor M<b>2</b> at a speed somewhat slower than the moving speed of the charger shutter <b>10</b> in the Y direction. As a result, the charger shutter <b>10</b> is pulled out without sagging downward. Incidentally, when the charger shutter <b>10</b> is in a completely closed state, an urging force in the X direction by the torque limiter <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the winding-up device <b>11</b> acts on the charger shutter <b>10</b>. For that reason, the charger shutter <b>10</b> does not sag downward and is placed in a state in which a tension to some extent is applied to the charger shutter <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">Therefore, when the charger shutter <b>10</b> is closed, it is possible to retain a state in which the corona product is less liable to be leaked from a gap between the charger shutter <b>10</b> and the corona charger <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">(Grid Cleaning Member)</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a grid cleaning device <b>30</b> as a cleaning means. The grid cleaning device <b>30</b> includes a grid cleaning member <b>14</b> slidable on the inner surface of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a</i>, a cleaning member supporting member <b>14</b><i>a </i>and a driving mechanism <b>13</b>. In this embodiment, the cleaning member supporting member <b>14</b><i>a </i>is integrally connected to the movable member <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">The grid cleaning member <b>14</b> removes a contaminant such as the toner or the like deposited on the inner surface of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is provided so as to contact the inner surface of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a</i>. Further, as described later, the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> cleans the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>while sliding on the inner surface of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>during reciprocation by the driving mechanism <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">Incidentally, in this embodiment, as the grid connect <b>14</b>, an acrylic brush which is subjected to flame-retardant treatment and is woven into a base cloth was used. Incidentally, it is also possible to use other members formed of nylon, PVC, PPS and the like. Further, the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is not limited to those of a fiber-planting type but may also be an elastic member such as felt or sponge or a sheet onto which an abrasive such as alumina or silicon carbide. That is, a material for the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is not limited to the above members so long as the resultant grid cleaning member can satisfactory perform the cleaning by sliding (rubbing) with the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">The cleaning member supporting member <b>14</b><i>a </i>is used for holding the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> at the screw shaft (rotatable member) <b>12</b><i>b </i>via the movable member <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the connecting member <b>12</b><i>d</i>. Therefore, in this embodiment, by rotating the screw shaft <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> can be moved along the longitudinal direction of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">The driving mechanism <b>13</b> includes, as shown in (a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the above-described screw shaft <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the driving motor M for rotationally driving the screw shaft <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, when the cleaning of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>is effected, the screw shaft <b>12</b><i>b </i>is rotated by driving the driving motor M. Thus, by rotating the screw shaft <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is moved, along the longitudinal direction of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a</i>, from a waiting (stand-by) position located at one longitudinal end side of the corona charger <b>2</b> to a reverse position located at the other longitudinal end side. Then, when the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> reaches the reverse position, the rotational direction of the driving motor M is reversed to reversely rotate the screw shaft <b>12</b><i>b</i>, so that the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is moved, along the longitudinal direction of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a</i>, from the reverse position toward the waiting position. In this embodiment, an operating time of the driving motor M from the time when the movement of the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is started from the waiting position is measured and at the time when the operating time reaches 15 seconds, the rotational direction of the driving motor M is reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">Thereafter, when the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> reaches the waiting position, the drive of the driving motor M is stopped and a series of the cleaning operations is ended. In this embodiment, as described above, the drive of the driving motor M is stopped by the shutter detecting device <b>12</b><i>c</i>. Further, as another method, it is also possible to stop the rotation of the driving motor M at the time when the operating time of the driving motor M from the time when the rotational direction of the driving motor M is reversed is measured and reaches 15 seconds. Therefore, in this case, a time required for reciprocal movement of the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">Incidentally, a series of drive control operations of the driving motor M is performed by a motor control portion <b>302</b> of the control device <b>300</b> functioning as an executing means shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Further, depending on a contamination state of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a</i>, the reciprocal movement of the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> may be repeated plural times.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">The cleaning (mode) of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>described above is effected when a main power switch of the image forming apparatus is turned on or effected every predetermined number of times (1000 times in this embodiment) of image formation. The number of times of image formation is counted by a counter <b>303</b> of the control device <b>300</b> and counted data is stored in a storing portion (ROM) <b>304</b>. Further, the motor controller <b>302</b> of the control device <b>300</b> actuates the driving motor M at the time when the counted data by the counter <b>303</b> reaches a predetermined value, so that the cleaning of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>is executed. When the cleaning of the grid electrode <b>2</b><i>a </i>is executed, the counted data stored in the storing portion <b>304</b> is reset.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">Incidentally, the grid cleaning can also be appropriately carried out in a manual manner. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when an operator (user) provides an instruction of the grid cleaning by operating an operating portion <b>400</b> of the image forming apparatus, the control device <b>300</b> can carry out the grid cleaning via an operating portion controller <b>305</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0075">In this case, the positional relationship between the charger shutter <b>10</b> and the cleaning member <b>14</b> is, as shown in (a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, such that the charger shutter <b>10</b> is disposed below the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> in a direction of gravitation. Further, as shown in (a), (b) and (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in the case of the forward path (Y direction) ((a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), an end <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the charger shutter <b>10</b> is protruded from a position corresponding to the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> in the movement direction of the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> by a length E=2 mm. For that reason, a substance (contaminant) S scraped off by the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> drops on the charger shutter <b>10</b> at an end portion close to the end <b>10</b><i>a </i>since the charger shutter <b>10</b> is present right below the grid cleaning member <b>14</b>, with respect to the direction of gravitation, at least in an image formation range. The substance S scraped off by the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is not dropped on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">Further, in the case of the backward path (X direction) ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), similarly, the substance S scraped off by the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> drops on the charger shutter <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">When the contaminant S scraped off by the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> drops on the winding-up portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the charger shutter <b>10</b>, the contaminant S is moved, when the charger shutter <b>10</b> is wound up, to the already-wound-up portion to be opposed to the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>. Then, in the case where subsequent cleaning is effected, the contaminant S drops on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> to cause the image flow or blocking of the developing device. For that reason, the contaminant S scraped off by the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is dropped on the non-winding-up portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the charger shutter <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">By the above-described operation, when the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is operated, it became possible to reduce a degree of the occurrence of the image flow due to the rubbing of the photosensitive drum with the contaminant (scraped matter) S dropped on the photosensitive drum and the occurrence of improper coating or the like due to the incorporation of the contaminant S into the developing device.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">Incidentally, the contaminant S on the charger shutter <b>10</b> is removed by a service person as needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">In Embodiment 1, the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> and the charger shutter <b>10</b> were integrally operated. In this embodiment, the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> and the charger shutter <b>10</b> are individually driven. Then, the control was effected so that an operation phase is shifted, with respect to the movement direction, between the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> and the charger shutter <b>10</b> so as to drop the substance S scraped off by the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> at the same position (region) during reciprocation for the cleaning. As a result, the non-winding-up portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the charger shutter <b>10</b> which is not wound up is narrowed, so that a size of the corona charger <b>2</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">In this embodiment, as described above, the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> and the charger shutter <b>10</b> are moved with different relative positions during the reciprocation and therefore they are operated by separate driving sources.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the driving mechanism <b>13</b> described in Embodiment 1 is provided individually for the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> and the charger shutter <b>10</b>. A screw shaft <b>12</b><i>b </i>of a first driving mechanism <b>13</b>A is threadably mounted on the connecting member <b>12</b><i>d</i>, and the connecting member <b>12</b><i>d </i>is connected to the movable member <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the charger shutter <b>10</b>. Further, a screw shaft <b>22</b><i>b </i>of a second driving mechanism <b>13</b>B is threadably mounted on a connecting member <b>22</b><i>d</i>, and the connecting member <b>22</b><i>d </i>is connected to a movable member <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the grid cleaning member <b>14</b>. Therefore, the charger shutter <b>10</b> and the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> are separately driven by the first and second driving mechanisms <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a operation flowchart in this embodiment. Also with reference to (a), (b) and (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, first, the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> and the charger shutter <b>10</b> are in a stand-by state as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. With timing of grid cleaning (S<b>101</b>), the first driving mechanism <b>13</b>A starts the reciprocation of the charger shutter <b>10</b> in Y direction in advance of the reciprocation of the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> (S<b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">At the time when the non-winding-up portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the charger shutter <b>10</b> gets ahead of the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> in the movement direction (Y direction) (S<b>103</b>), the second driving mechanism <b>13</b>B starts the operation of the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> (S<b>104</b>). The charger shutter <b>10</b> and the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> are synchronized and reciprocated.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">The positional relationship between the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> and the charger shutter <b>10</b> is as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in the forward operation in the Y direction. The first and second driving mechanisms <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B move the charger shutter <b>10</b> and the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> for a predetermined time until the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> reaches a position (right side) opposite from the position in the stand-by state (S<b>105</b>). As a result, the contaminant S scraped off by the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is dropped and held on the non-winding-up portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the charger shutter <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">In this embodiment, each of the first and second driving mechanisms <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B includes a toque limiter (sliding joint) or the like, and the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> and the charger shutter <b>10</b> are continuously operated even after they are driven for a predetermined time (<b>20</b> seconds) to be moved to the right side. However, it is also possible to employ such a constitution that a sensor similar to the above-described shutter detecting device <b>11</b><i>c </i>is mounted at the position opposite from the position in the stand-by state and based on the detection by the sensor, the drive of the first and second driving mechanisms <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">Next, in the direction in which the charger shutter <b>10</b> is closed, i.e., in the X direction, only the charger shutter <b>10</b> is moved by the first driving mechanism <b>13</b>A (S<b>106</b>). Then, as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, at the time when the non-winding-up portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the charger shutter <b>10</b> gets ahead of the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> in the X direction (S<b>107</b>), the second driving mechanism <b>13</b>B starts the backward operation of the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> in the X direction (S<b>108</b>). The charger shutter <b>10</b> and the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> perform the backward operation (X direction) in a synchronized manner.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">The positional relationship between the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> and the charger shutter <b>10</b> is as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in the backward path. As a result, the contaminant S scraped off by the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is dropped and held on the non-winding-up portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the charger shutter <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">When the charger shutter <b>10</b> reaches a home position as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the operation of the charger shutter <b>10</b> is stopped (S<b>109</b>) and then the grid cleaning member <b>14</b> is moved until it reaches the waiting (stand-by) position (S<b>110</b>). Thereafter, the grid cleaning operation is ended.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">By the grid cleaning as described above, the contaminant S is prevented from dropping on the photosensitive drum when the grid cleaning member is operated. As a result, it is possible to reduce a degree of the occurrence of the image flow due to the rubbing of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> with the contaminant S dropped on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> or the occurrence of the improper coating due to the incorporation of the contaminant S into the developing device. Further, it becomes possible to narrow the non-winding-up portion of the shutter <b>10</b>, so that the corona charger and the image forming apparatus can be downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">The present invention is applicable to electrophotographic image forming apparatuses of various types, including the photosensitive member and a corresponding charging member, such as a copying machine, a printer and a facsimile machine. As a result, it is possible to form a high-quality color image or the like through uniform charging and it is also possible to provide an inexpensive image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">While the invention has been described with reference to the structures disclosed herein, it is not confined to the details set forth and this application is intended to cover such modifications or changes as may come within the purpose of the improvements or the scope of the following claims.</p>
