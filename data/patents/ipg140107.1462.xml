<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a coupler for excavators. The invention relates particularly to couplers having power-operated latching hooks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well known for a coupler to have a hydraulically operated latching hook for engaging with the pins of an attachment, e.g., a bucket, for the arm of an excavator. Such couplers typically include a safety mechanism for preventing the attachment from becoming disengaged from the coupler in the event of hydraulic failure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides an alternative, improved safety mechanism for preventing an attachment to an excavator from becoming disengaged from the coupler in the event of hydraulic failure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, a first aspect of the invention provides a coupler for an excavator, the coupler comprising a body having first and second spaced-apart recesses for receiving respective pins of an excavator attachment; a first latching member movable into and out of a latching state in which it is capable of retaining the respective attachment pin in the first recess; means for actuating the first latching member into and out of the latching state, a second latching member movable into and out of a latching state in which it is capable of retaining a respective attachment pin in the second recess; and means for actuating the second latching member into and out of the latching state, wherein the coupler further comprises a blocking member movable into and out of a blocking state in which it lies in the path of the second latching member to prevent the second latching member from leaving its latching state, and wherein the blocking member is movable into and out of the blocking state under the influence of gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The blocking member may be movable into and out of its blocking state upon pivoting of the coupler between a working orientation and a non-working orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The blocking member, which may take the form of a bar, is pivotably mounted on the body. In one arrangement, the blocking member hangs substantially vertically from a pivot point under the influence of gravity, the pivot point being located substantially above the second recess when the coupler is in a normal working orientation. Further, the arrangement may be such that a gap is defined between the blocking member and the second latching member when the second latching member is in its latching state and when the blocking member is in its blocking state.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first and second actuating means may be inter-linked such that the operation of one of said first and second actuating means between the latching and non-latching states causes operation of the other of the first and second actuating means between the latching and non-latching states. The first and second actuating means may be operable by a single activation of a common control device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first and second actuating means may comprise at least one respective hydraulic actuator controlled by a common hydraulic circuit. Each actuator may share a common hydraulic fluid feed line and a common hydraulic fluid return line. At least one of, and preferably both of, the first and second actuators may have a pilot non-return valve at the extend side port, the pilot control line being connected to the respective retract side port.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A second aspect of the invention provides a coupler for an excavator, the coupler comprising a body having first and second spaced-apart recesses for receiving respective pins of an excavator attachment; a first latching member movable into and out of a latching state in which it is capable of retaining the respective attachment pin in the first recess; means for actuating the first latching member into and out of the latching state, a second latching member movable into and out of a latching state in which it is capable of retaining a respective attachment pin in the second recess; and means for actuating the second latching member into and out of the latching state, wherein the first and second actuating means are inter-linked such that the operation of one of said first and second actuating means between the latching and non-latching states causes operation of the other of the first and second actuating means between the latching and non-latching states.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A third aspect of the invention provides a coupler comprising a body having first and second spaced-apart recesses for receiving respective pins of an excavator attachment; a first latching member movable into and out of a latching state in which it is capable of retaining the respective attachment pin in the first recess; means for actuating the first latching member into and out of the latching state, a second latching member movable into and out of a latching state in which it is capable of retaining a respective attachment pin in the second recess; and means for actuating the second latching member into and out of the latching state, wherein the first recess is shaped and dimensioned to receive attachment pins in different locations corresponding to different attachment pin spacings, the first recess further including a lip at one side of its mouth, and wherein when the first latching member adopts a latching position corresponding to the smallest attachment pin spacing accommodated by the coupler, a gap is defined between the first latching member and said lip, and wherein the arrangement is such that the gap has a size that is less than the width of the respective attachment pin.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to the drawings and the illustrated embodiments therein, there is shown, generally indicated as <b>10</b>, a coupler, or hitch, for connecting a tool, or other attachment, such as a bucket, to a jib arm (not shown) of an excavator (not shown), or other apparatus. The coupler <b>10</b> has a body <b>14</b> typically comprising two spaced-apart side plates <b>15</b> (only one visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>). The body <b>14</b> is shaped to define pin-receiving apertures <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> by which the coupler <b>10</b> may be connected to the end of the jib arm. Typically, there are two spaced-apart apertures <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> in each of the two side plates <b>15</b>, the apertures in one side plate being aligned with the apertures in the other. When connected, the coupler <b>10</b> is able to pivot with respect to the arm about the axis of the apertures <b>16</b>. Usually, a hydraulic mechanism, or other power-operated mechanism (not shown), is provided, typically in association with a mechanical linkage, to pivot the coupler <b>10</b> with respect to the arm.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The body <b>14</b> includes first and second pin-receiving recesses <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> formed in each side plate <b>15</b>. Each recess <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> is shaped and dimensioned to receive a respective pin <b>26</b> (only one shown) of a bucket or other attachment. Normally, the recesses <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> face in mutually perpendicular directions. The recess <b>22</b> may be wider than is necessary to receive a single pin <b>26</b> in order to accommodate attachments with different pin spacings, as is illustrated by pins <b>26</b>&#x2032; and <b>26</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The coupler <b>10</b> also includes a power-operated latching mechanism typically comprising a latching member in the preferred form of a hook <b>30</b>, and an actuator <b>32</b> typically in the form of a linear actuator, such as a hydraulic ram. Other forms of powered actuators could be used (e.g., pneumatic or electrically operated), but hydraulic is convenient because excavators typically have a hydraulic system available at or near the end of the jib arm. The latching hook <b>30</b> and ram <b>32</b> are provided between the side plates <b>15</b>. The latching hook <b>30</b>, which may comprise one or more aligned hook elements, is pivotably mounted on the body <b>14</b> in any convenient manner and is pivotable about an axis A, which runs substantially perpendicular to the body <b>14</b>/plates <b>15</b>. The hook <b>30</b> is pivotable between an open state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and at least one latching state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>). In the open state, the latching hook <b>30</b> allows the pins <b>26</b>, <b>26</b>&#x2032;, <b>26</b>&#x2033; to be inserted into or removed from the recess <b>22</b>. In the latched state, the latching hook <b>30</b> prevents the pins <b>26</b>, <b>26</b>&#x2032;, <b>26</b>&#x2033; from being removed from the recess <b>22</b>. In alternative embodiments, the latching member may be slidably mounted on the body, or otherwise movable between the open state and the latching state(s), without necessarily being pivotable. Further, the latching member need not necessarily take the form of a hook.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the ram <b>32</b> has its butt end <b>34</b> pivotably mounted on the body <b>14</b> and the free end <b>38</b> of its piston rod <b>36</b> is pivotably connected to the latching hook <b>30</b>, in each case the pivoting movement being about a respective axis that is substantially perpendicular to the plates <b>15</b>. When the piston rod <b>36</b> adopts a retracted state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the latching hook <b>30</b> adopts its open state. When the piston rod <b>36</b> is extended, the hook <b>30</b> moves towards its latching state. Depending on the location of the pin <b>26</b>, <b>26</b>&#x2032;, <b>26</b>&#x2033; in the recess <b>22</b>, the amount by which the piston rod <b>36</b> is extended when the hook <b>30</b> reaches its latching state can vary. Conveniently, the ram <b>32</b> is operable via the excavaor's hydraulic system (not shown), the controls typically being located in the cab of the excavator.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The coupler <b>10</b> further includes a second latching member, which may be in the form of a hook <b>40</b> which has one end <b>42</b> pivotably mounted on the body <b>14</b> in any convenient manner, e.g., pin or bearing. The second hook <b>40</b> is pivotable about an axis substantially perpendicular to the side plates <b>15</b> between a non-latching state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a latching state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In the non-latching state, the hook <b>40</b> is clear of the recess <b>20</b> to the extent that it does not prevent the pin (not shown) of an attachment from being removed from the recess <b>20</b>, while in the latching state, the hook <b>40</b> prevents the pin from being removed from the recess <b>20</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the hook <b>40</b> includes a jaw <b>44</b> which, in the latching state, substantially, or at least partly, closes the otherwise open mouth of the recess <b>20</b>. The jaw <b>44</b> may form part of a recess <b>46</b> provided in the hook <b>40</b>, which recess <b>46</b>, in the latching state, embraces the pin located in the recess <b>20</b>. The preferred arrangement is such that the action of an attachment pin (located in recess <b>20</b> when the hook <b>40</b> is closed) on the jaw <b>44</b> urges the hook <b>40</b> into its latching state.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An actuator <b>41</b>, typically in the form of a hydraulic ram or other linear actuator, is coupled to the second latching hook <b>40</b> to actuate it between the latching and non-latching states. Other forms of powered actuator could be used (e.g., pneumatic or electrically operated). In the preferred embodiment, the ram <b>41</b> has its butt end <b>43</b> pivotably mounted on the body <b>14</b> and the free end <b>45</b> of its piston rod <b>47</b> is pivotably connected to the second latching hook <b>40</b>, in each case the pivoting movement being about a respective axis that is substantially perpendicular to the plates <b>15</b>. When the piston rod <b>47</b> adopts a retracted state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the latching hook <b>40</b> adopts its non-latching state. When the piston rod <b>47</b> is extended, the hook <b>40</b> adopts its latching state. Conveniently, the ram <b>41</b> is operable via the excavator's hydraulic system (not shown), the controls typically being located in the cab of the excavator.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In particular embodiments, the pivot location <b>42</b> for the hook <b>40</b> is on the opposite side of the recess <b>20</b> to the recess <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In alternative embodiments, the second latching member need not necessarily take the form of a hook and need not necessarily be pivotable with respect to the body <b>14</b>. For example, the second latching member may be slidably mounted on the body, or otherwise movable between the non-latching state and the latching state(s), without necessarily being pivotable.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A blocking member, which may be in the form of a bar <b>50</b> is pivotable with respect to the body <b>14</b> about an axis that is substantially perpendicular with the plates <b>15</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the bar <b>50</b> has one end <b>51</b> pivotably mounted on the body <b>14</b>, the other end <b>53</b> being free. The bar <b>50</b> is pivotable with respect to the body between the blocking and non-blocking states under the action of gravity. The bar <b>50</b> is movable between a blocking state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and a non-blocking state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). In the blocking state, the bar <b>50</b>, or at least its free end <b>53</b>, lies in the path of the second latching hook <b>40</b> such that it prevents the second latching hook from moving from its latching state to its non-latching state.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, arrangement is such that should the hook <b>40</b> engage with the bar <b>50</b> as it attempts to move out of its latching state, the action of the hook <b>40</b> on the bar <b>50</b> urges the bar <b>50</b> into its blocking state. In the illustrated embodiment, the bar <b>50</b> is prevented from moving anti-clockwise (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) from its blocking state, i.e., beyond its blocking state, by any convenient means, e.g., a stop (not shown) provided on the body <b>14</b>. The position of the bar <b>50</b> with respect to the hook <b>40</b> is such that the action of the hook <b>40</b> on the bar <b>50</b> tends to move the bar <b>50</b> anti-clockwise (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and therefore against the stop. A stop <b>54</b>, or other suitable means, may be provided for preventing the bar <b>50</b> from travelling beyond its non-blocking state (i.e., clockwise from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the coupler <b>10</b> in a normal working orientation, which is typically substantially horizontal, or at least relatively horizontal. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first latching hook <b>30</b> is shown in its latching state holding pin <b>26</b> in the recess <b>22</b>. The second latching hook <b>40</b> is also in its latching state holding a pin (not shown) in the recess <b>20</b>. During normal use, the latching hooks <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> are held in place by their respective rams <b>32</b>, <b>41</b>. Should one of the rams <b>32</b>, <b>41</b> fail, the other ram <b>41</b>, <b>32</b> provides a backup to retain at least one of the attachment pins in its recess <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and so to prevent the attachment from falling from the coupler <b>10</b>. The bar <b>50</b> provides an additional backup safety measure in that it prevents the second latching hook <b>40</b> from leaving its latching state. In particular embodiments, the actuators <b>31</b>, <b>42</b> are linked, e.g., hydraulically, such that operation of one actuator causes the operation of the other.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the coupler in the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but with both latching hooks <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> in their non-latching states. In this arrangement, the pins of an attachment can be removed from or placed into the respective recesses <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. It is noted that, in the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second latching hook <b>40</b> holds the bar <b>50</b> in its non-blocking state.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order to operate the coupler <b>10</b> from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the orientation of the coupler <b>10</b> has to be changed to cause the bar <b>50</b> to adopt the non-blocking state by pivoting relative to the body <b>14</b> under the influence of gravity. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, where the coupler <b>10</b> is shown in a non-working orientation in which the body <b>14</b> has been pivoted with respect to the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This may be effected by the operator from the cab of the excavator by appropriate operation of the mechanism(s) that couple the coupler <b>10</b> to the jib arm. As the body <b>14</b> is rotated, the bar <b>50</b> moves under gravity with respect to the body <b>14</b> until it adopts its non-blocking state. In the preferred embodiment, the bar <b>50</b> is arranged to hang substantially vertically from its pivot point <b>51</b> under the influence of gravity such that it is substantially vertically disposed when in the blocking state. As the coupler <b>10</b> is rotated, the bar <b>50</b> tends to maintain its substantially vertical orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is noted that in the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the open mouth of the recess <b>20</b> faces generally upwardly such that any attachment pin located therein will not fall out of the recess <b>20</b>. Hence, even when the latches <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> are disengaged from the pins, the recess <b>20</b> provides means for retaining the attachment on the coupler. This allows the operator to lower the attachment to the ground before pivoting the coupler <b>10</b> to release the attachment. In this embodiment, therefore, the arrangement of the bar <b>50</b> is such that it adopts the non-blocking state whenever, or at least not before, the open mouth of the recess <b>20</b> is facing generally upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the bar <b>50</b> is in the non-blocking state, the latching hook <b>40</b> can be withdrawn from its latching state whereupon it serves to hold the bar <b>50</b> in its non-blocking state irrespective of subsequent changes in the orientation of the coupler <b>10</b>. Hence, the coupler <b>10</b> can be returned to the working orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with both latches <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> open, ready to receive an attachment. Once the attachment pins are located within the respective recesses <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, the rams <b>32</b>, <b>41</b> are operated to close the latching hooks <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> into their latching states, whereupon the bar <b>50</b> falls under gravity into its blocking state, i.e., the coupler <b>10</b> adopts the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the arrangement is such that the bar <b>50</b> hangs substantially vertically when in the blocking state. A gap may be left between the free end <b>53</b> of the bar and the second latching hook <b>40</b> when the bar <b>50</b> is in its blocking state and the hook <b>40</b> is in its latching state (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). These features can be achieved by appropriate selection of the position of the pivot point <b>51</b> and the length of the bar <b>50</b>. For example, the pivot point <b>51</b> may be positioned substantially above the recess <b>20</b> and, more particularly, substantially above a pin located in the recess <b>20</b> during use (when in the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). Because the pivot point <b>51</b> and bar <b>50</b> occupy a relatively raised position with respect to the recesses <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, they are less susceptible to becoming jammed during use by, for example, dirt or other foreign matter. Further, the gap between the bar <b>50</b> and the hook <b>40</b> allows some flexibility in the operation of the coupler <b>10</b>: should the operator initiate the withdrawal of the hook <b>40</b> before pivoting the coupler <b>10</b> into the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, then provided he initiates the pivoting of the coupler a short time later, the hook <b>40</b> will not be blocked by the bar <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> of the drawings, operation of the rams <b>32</b>, <b>41</b> is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a hydraulic circuit for use in controlling the rams <b>32</b>, <b>41</b>. The circuit includes a source of hydraulic fluid (typically oil), which typically comprises a hydraulic pump <b>60</b>, and a sink for the hydraulic fluid in the form of tank <b>62</b>. The circuit may be controlled by an operator from the cab of the excavator, or other machine, conveniently using a single switch, or other operating device, to control valve <b>74</b> as is described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In use, high pressure oil is fed from the pump <b>60</b> into a pressure-reducing valve <b>68</b>. Reduced pressure oil is fed through a non-return valve <b>70</b> and restrictor <b>72</b> into valve <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When valve <b>74</b> is in a first mode of operation (corresponding to it being de-energized in this example), reduced pressure oil is fed from valve <b>74</b> via extend line <b>76</b> through pilot-operated check valve <b>78</b> into the extend side S<b>1</b> of the hydraulic chamber <b>64</b> of ram <b>32</b> via port P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At substantially the same time, reduced pressure oil is fed via extend line <b>76</b> through pilot-operated check valve <b>80</b> into the extend side S<b>3</b> of the hydraulic chamber <b>66</b> of the ram <b>41</b> via port P<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Low pressure oil from the retract side S<b>2</b> of the chamber <b>64</b> and from the retract side S<b>4</b> of the chamber <b>66</b> returns to tank <b>62</b> via P<b>2</b> and P<b>4</b>, respectively, through the retract line <b>82</b> and valve <b>74</b>. This causes the piston rod <b>36</b> of the main ram <b>32</b> to extend and causes the piston rod <b>84</b> of the secondary ram <b>41</b> to extend. This results in both hooks <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> adopting their latching states.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The arrangement may be such that the secondary ram <b>41</b> works first because frictional resistance is lower (smaller piston less friction) than for the main ram. Also, a smaller volume of oil is required to move the piston of the secondary ram <b>41</b> so it will travel faster. Oil volume to the cylinders may be reduced through the use of the restrictor fitted prior to the valve. When the secondary ram <b>41</b> moves, the actuating pressure seen by both rams <b>32</b>, <b>41</b> drops until the volume of oil is replaced. This then causes the secondary ram <b>41</b> to move again. Hence, the main ram <b>32</b> does not move until the secondary ram <b>41</b> stops moving, i.e., fully in or fully out.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When valve <b>74</b> is in a second mode of operation (corresponding to it being energized in this example), reduced pressure oil is fed from valve <b>74</b> via retract line <b>82</b> into the retract side S<b>2</b> of the chamber <b>62</b> of the main ram <b>32</b> via port P<b>2</b>. The oil is also fed into the pilot of the check valve <b>78</b> thereby opening the check valve <b>78</b> and allowing oil to flow through the check valve <b>78</b> out of the extend side S<b>1</b> of the chamber <b>62</b> via port P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At substantially the same time, reduced pressure oil is fed via retract line <b>82</b> into the retract side S<b>4</b> of the chamber <b>66</b> of the secondary ram <b>41</b> via port P<b>4</b>. The oil is also fed into the pilot of the check valve <b>80</b> thereby opening the check valve and allowing oil to flow through the check valve <b>80</b> out of the extend side S<b>3</b> of the chamber <b>66</b> via port P<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Low pressure oil from the extend side S<b>1</b> of the main ram <b>32</b> and from the retract side S<b>3</b> of the secondary ram <b>41</b> returns to tank <b>62</b> via P<b>1</b> and P<b>3</b>, respectively, through the extend line <b>76</b> and valve <b>74</b>. This causes the piston rod <b>36</b> of the main <b>32</b> to retract and the piston rod <b>82</b> of the secondary ram <b>41</b> to retract.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The arrangement may be such that the secondary ram <b>41</b> works first because frictional resistance is lower (smaller piston less friction) than for the main ram. Also, a smaller volume of oil is required to move the piston of the secondary ram <b>41</b> so it will travel faster. Oil volume to the cylinders may be reduced through the use of the restrictor fitted prior to the valve. When the secondary ram <b>41</b> moves, the actuating pressure seen by both rams <b>32</b>, <b>41</b> drops until the volume of oil is replaced. This then causes the secondary ram <b>41</b> to move again. Hence, the main ram <b>32</b> does not move until the secondary ram <b>41</b> stops moving, i.e., fully in or fully out.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The following advantageous features of the operation of the rams <b>32</b>, <b>41</b> using the hydraulic circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are noted: the use of a pressure reduction valve <b>68</b> on the inlet of valve <b>74</b>&#x2014;this extends hose life due to the lowered working pressure within the hoses; the use of a non-return valve <b>70</b> on the inlet of valve <b>74</b> which prevents oil pressure in the system being lost when the pump <b>60</b> output pressure is low, e.g., at low engine speeds; the use of a restrictor <b>72</b> on the inlet of valve <b>74</b> which reduces hose vibration when operating; the use of a pilot-operated check valve <b>78</b> on the inlet of ram <b>32</b> which effectively locks the ram <b>32</b> in the extended state in the event of hose or hydraulic pressure failure; the use of a pilot-operated check valve <b>80</b> on the inlet of ram <b>41</b> which effectively locks the ram <b>41</b> in the extended state in the event of hose or hydraulic pressure failure; and the connection of <b>41</b> such that it must retract to remove the secondary hook <b>40</b>, and works in tandem with the main ram <b>32</b>&#x2014;this prevents application of equal pressures of oil to both the retract and extend lines <b>76</b>, <b>82</b> causing a change of state to the extended secondary ram.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The primary ram <b>32</b> is connected to the first latching hook <b>30</b> and the secondary ram <b>41</b> is used to work the secondary hook <b>40</b>. The secondary ram <b>41</b> must retract in order to remove the secondary hook <b>40</b> to allow the main hook <b>30</b> to retract.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 9</figref>, there is described alternative embodiments of the invention and variations thereof. The couplers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref> are similar to the couplers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> and the same description applies as would be apparent to a skilled person. Like numerals are used to indicate like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a coupler <b>110</b> wherein resilient biasing means, conveniently in the form of a spring <b>190</b>, is provided on an actuator <b>132</b> and arranged to resiliently bias the actuator <b>132</b>, and in particular a rod <b>136</b>, into its extended position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the spring <b>190</b> takes the form of a compression spring. The spring <b>190</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> externally of the actuator <b>132</b>, for example, extending between a first abutment <b>191</b> provided on the piston housing and a second abutment <b>192</b> provided on the rod <b>136</b>. Alternatively, the spring, or other resilient biasing means, may be fitted internally of the piston housing. The biasing means may be a mechanical spring as illustrated but may take any suitable alternative form, e.g., a gas spring, or the like. The purpose of the spring <b>190</b> is to hold the actuator <b>132</b> in its extended state and so to hold the latching hook <b>130</b> in a forward or latching state in the event of the loss of actuating force from the actuator <b>132</b> due, for example, to a hydraulic or mechanical failure of the actuator <b>132</b> or its supply.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a coupler <b>210</b> embodying the invention wherein a locking member <b>293</b> is associated with a second latching hook <b>240</b>, the locking member <b>293</b> extending in a direction towards a first latching hook <b>230</b> and being shaped and dimensioned to engage with the first latching hook <b>230</b>. In one embodiment, the arrangement is such that, when the first latching hook <b>230</b> is in its latching state (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), a clearance is provided between the latching hook <b>230</b> and the locking member <b>293</b> in order to allow the second latching hook <b>240</b> to move out of its latching state, but that a retraction of the first latching hook <b>230</b> from the latching state causes the first latching hook <b>230</b> to engage with the locking member <b>293</b>. It is noted that, in the illustrated embodiment, the amount of retraction of the first latching hook <b>230</b> before engagement occurs is sufficiently small that the first latching hook <b>230</b> still holds the relevant attachment pin <b>226</b>&#x2033; in place, even though the actuator <b>232</b> may no longer be urging the hook <b>230</b> into engagement with the pin <b>226</b>&#x2033;, i.e., the hook <b>230</b> is not retracted to the extent that it adopts its non-latching state and may, therefore, be said to maintain the hook <b>230</b> in a latching state. In cases where the first latching hook <b>230</b> has more than one latching state (to accommodate attachments with different pin spacings), the locking member <b>293</b> is preferably arranged to engage with the latching hook <b>230</b> as it is retracted from the latching state that corresponds with the smallest pin spacing (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The locking member <b>293</b>, which is shown by way of example in the form of an arm, may be integrally formed with the second latching hook <b>240</b>, or fixed or coupled thereto. One arrangement is that the locking member <b>293</b> moves with the second latching hook <b>240</b>. The first latching hook <b>230</b> may include a seat <b>294</b> for engaging with the locking member <b>293</b>, the seat being arranged such that, when the locking member <b>293</b> is engaged therewith, the action of the first latching hook <b>230</b> on the locking member <b>293</b> serves to hold the second latching hook <b>240</b> in its latching state. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the seat <b>294</b> takes the form of a recess formed in the rear of the latching hook <b>230</b>, but it may, alternatively, take other forms.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In use of the illustrated embodiment, the free end of the locking member <b>293</b> mates with the recess <b>294</b> when the first latching hook <b>230</b> is retracted and the second latching hook <b>240</b> is in its latching state. This engagement prevents any subsequent movement of the second latching hook <b>240</b> out of the latching state. The purpose of this is to retain the second latching hook <b>240</b> in the latching state thereby preventing separation of the attachment from the coupler. This could occur, for example, if the main latching hook <b>230</b> of the coupler is unlocked when the coupler is in an incorrect attitude causing the movement of the second hook <b>240</b> to be prevented by the gravity safety device <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In particular embodiments, the profile of the bottom of the coupler <b>210</b> is extended at the rear of the rear pin receiving recess <b>222</b> in the side plate of the coupler in a direction towards the front of the coupler to provide a lip <b>295</b>. The purpose of the extended profile, or lip <b>295</b>, is so that a gap <b>296</b> is formed between the toe <b>297</b> of the first hook <b>230</b> (when the first hook <b>230</b> is in the position where it would just contact the rear pin of an attachment, with the attachment pin centres being at the minimum range for coupler) and the edge of the extended profile <b>295</b> is less than the diameter of the attachment pin <b>226</b>&#x2033;. As a result, the rear pin <b>226</b>&#x2033; of the attachment will not pass through the gap <b>296</b>. In order to facilitate the coupling of attachments with centres at the top end of the range of pin centres catered for by the coupler a curved surface, preferably with a relatively large radius, is preferred on the underside of the lip <b>295</b> to guide the rear pin into the receiving recess <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As may best be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the toe <b>297</b> of the first latch <b>230</b> may be shaped and dimensioned such that the pin <b>226</b>&#x2033; may be retained within the first latch <b>230</b> profile by its own weight as is characteristic with a load-bearing hook for supporting a load. To this end, the hook shape of the latch <b>230</b> may be such that the weight of the pin urges the hook <b>230</b> about its pivot point towards its latched state. In particular embodiments, the action of the spring <b>190</b>, advantageously together with the action of the bottom profiles, in conjunction with the shape of the hook <b>230</b> retain the rear pin within the rear recess of the coupler through the effort of the spring alone.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the coupler <b>210</b> is shown with a resiliently deformable member <b>298</b> provided on the blocking member <b>250</b>. The deformable member <b>298</b> is shown as being straight, although it may be curved, or a combination of straight and curved (for example, straight with a curved or bent free end). The deformable member <b>298</b> may, for example, take the form of a leaf spring. The member <b>298</b> is arranged to engage with an arm (not shown) of an excavator or other machine to which the coupler is mounted during use in certain orientations. It may be arranged to engage with the dipper arm (or other part) of the excavator when the coupler is in the full curl or dump position. The arrangement is such that the action of the resiliently deformable member <b>298</b> when engaged with the arm will bias the gravity blocking device <b>250</b> into its blocking state, thereby preventing movement of the second latch <b>240</b> into its unlatched state.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It will be understood that all of the features of all of the embodiments described herein may be used in combination with any features of the other embodiments described herein as would be understood by a skilled person.</p>
