<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The lead frame <b>13</b> includes a chip mounted section <b>13</b><i>a</i>, a lead section <b>13</b><i>b </i>for a ground terminal, and a plurality of lead sections <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>13</b><i>g </i>for various signals, and a connecting section (not shown) for connecting the chip mounted section <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the lead sections <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>13</b><i>g</i>.

The lead section <b>13</b><i>b </i>protrudes from a lower side of the chip mounted section <b>13</b><i>a </i>in an example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The lead sections <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>13</b><i>g </i>are arranged parallel to the lead section <b>13</b><i>b</i>. The connecting sections are removed when a manufacturing of the semiconductor device <b>11</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The semiconductor chip has a plurality of pads.

Other pad of the semiconductor chip <b>12</b> and the chip mounted section <b>13</b><i>a </i>integrated with the lead section <b>13</b><i>b </i>are also bonded through a wire <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The chip capacitors <b>14</b> are provided for reducing noise or static electricity. Each of the chip capacitors <b>14</b> is mounted vertically on a surface of one of the lead sections <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>13</b><i>g</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. That is, each of the chip capacitors <b>14</b> has a first end portion and a second end portion in a direction perpendicular to the surface of a corresponding one of the lead section <b>13</b><i>c</i>-<b>13</b><i>g</i>, and the first end portion is located on the surface. Each of the chip capacitors <b>14</b> has a first electrode <b>14</b><i>a </i>at the first end portion and a second electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>at the second end portion.
