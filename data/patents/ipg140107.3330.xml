<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method for providing a post-passivation and underbump metallization is provided. An embodiment comprises a post-passivation layer that is larger than an overlying underbump metallization. The post-passivation layer extending beyond the underbump metallization shields the underlying layers from stresses generated from mismatches of the materials' coefficient of thermal expansion.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Generally, a semiconductor die may be connected to other devices external to the semiconductor die through a type of packaging utilizing solder bumps. The solder bumps may be formed by initially forming a layer of underbump metallization on the semiconductor die and then placing solder onto the underbump metallization. After the solder has been placed, a reflow operation may be performed in order to shape the solder into the desired bump shape. The solder bump may then be placed into physical contact with the external device and another reflow operation may be performed in order to bond the solder bump with the external device. In such a fashion, a physical and electrical connection may be made between the semiconductor die and an external device, such as a printed circuit board, another semiconductor die, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">However, the material that comprises the underbump metallization is merely one more type of material placed onto a stack of many different materials, such as dielectric materials, metallization materials, etch stop materials, barrier layer materials, and other materials utilized in the formation of the semiconductor die. Each one of these different materials may have a unique coefficient of thermal expansion that is different from the other materials. This type of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch causes each one of the materials to expand a different distance when the semiconductor die is heated during later processing or use. As such, at elevated temperatures there is a coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch that causes stresses to form between the different materials and, hence, the different parts of the semiconductor die. This mismatch is especially prevalent between the underbump metallization and underlying metallization layers. If not controlled, these stresses can cause delamination to occur between the various layers of material, especially when the materials used include copper and a low-k dielectric layer. This delamination can damage or even destroy the semiconductor die during the manufacturing process or else during its intended use.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The making and using of the present embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the embodiments provide many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the embodiments, and do not limit the scope of the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The embodiments will be described with respect to embodiments in a specific context, namely a post-passivation interconnect underlying an underbump metallization. The embodiments may also be applied, however, to other metallization layers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a portion of a semiconductor die <b>100</b> including a semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> with metallization layers <b>103</b>, a contact pad <b>105</b>, a first passivation layer <b>107</b>, a second passivation layer <b>109</b>, a post-passivation interconnect (PPI) <b>111</b>, a third passivation layer <b>113</b>, an underbump metallization (UBM) <b>115</b>, and a contact bump <b>117</b>. The semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> may comprise bulk silicon, doped or undoped, or an active layer of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. Generally, an SOI substrate comprises a layer of a semiconductor material such as silicon, germanium, silicon germanium, SOI, silicon germanium on insulator (SGOI), or combinations thereof. Other substrates that may be used include multi-layered substrates, gradient substrates, or hybrid orientation substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Active devices (not shown) may be formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b>. As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, a wide variety of active devices such as capacitors, resistors, inductors and the like may be used to generate the desired structural and functional requirements of the design for the semiconductor die <b>100</b>. The active devices may be formed using any suitable methods either within or else on the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The metallization layers <b>103</b> are formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> and the active devices and are designed to connect the various active devices to form functional circuitry. While illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a single layer, the metallization layers <b>103</b> may be formed of alternating layers of dielectric (e.g., low-k dielectric material) and conductive material (e.g., copper) and may be formed through any suitable process (such as deposition, damascene, dual damascene, etc.). In an embodiment there may be four layers of metallization separated from the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> by at least one interlayer dielectric layer (ILD), but the precise number of metallization layers <b>103</b> is dependent upon the design of the semiconductor die <b>100</b></p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The contact pad <b>105</b> may be formed over and in electrical contact with the metallization layers <b>103</b>. The contact pad <b>105</b> may comprise aluminum, but other materials, such as copper, may alternatively be used. The contact pad <b>105</b> may be formed using a deposition process, such as sputtering, to form a layer of material (not shown) and portions of the layer of material may then be removed through a suitable process (such as photolithographic masking and etching) to form the contact pad <b>105</b>. However, any other suitable process may be utilized to form the contact pad <b>105</b>. The contact pad <b>105</b> may be formed to have a thickness of between about 0.5 &#x3bc;m and about 4 &#x3bc;m, such as about 1.45 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The first passivation layer <b>107</b> may be formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> over the metallization layers <b>103</b> and the contact pad <b>105</b>. The first passivation layer <b>107</b> may be made of one or more suitable dielectric materials such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, low-k dielectrics such as carbon doped oxides, extremely low-k dielectrics such as porous carbon doped silicon dioxide, combinations of these, or the like. The first passivation layer <b>107</b> may be formed through a process such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), although any suitable process may be utilized, and may have a thickness between about 0.5 &#x3bc;m and about 5 &#x3bc;m, such as about 9.25 K&#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">After the first passivation layer <b>107</b> has been formed, an opening may be made through the first passivation layer <b>107</b> by removing portions of the first passivation layer <b>107</b> to expose at least a portion of the underlying contact pad <b>105</b>. The opening allows for contact between the contact pad <b>105</b> and the PPI <b>111</b> (discussed further below). The opening may be formed using a suitable photolithographic mask and etching process, although any suitable process to expose portions of the contact pad <b>105</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second passivation layer <b>109</b> may be formed over the contact pad <b>105</b> and the first passivation layer <b>107</b>. The second passivation layer <b>109</b> may be formed from a polymer such as polyimide. Alternatively, the second passivation layer <b>109</b> may be formed of a material similar to the material used as the first passivation layer <b>107</b>, such as silicon oxides, silicon nitrides, low-k dielectrics, extremely low-k dielectrics, combinations of these, and the like. The second passivation layer <b>109</b> may be formed to have a thickness between about 2 &#x3bc;m and about 15 &#x3bc;m, such as about 5 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">After the second passivation layer <b>109</b> has been formed, an opening may be made through the second passivation layer <b>109</b> by removing portions of the second passivation layer <b>109</b> to expose at least a portion of the underlying contact pad <b>105</b>. The opening allows for contact between the contact pad <b>105</b> and the PPI <b>111</b> (discussed further below). The opening may be formed using a suitable photolithographic mask and etching process, although any suitable process to expose portions of the contact pad <b>105</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">After the contact pad <b>105</b> has been exposed, the PPI <b>111</b> may be formed to extend along the second passivation layer <b>109</b>. The PPI <b>111</b> may be utilized as a redistribution layer to allow the UBM <b>115</b> that is electrically connected to the contact pad <b>105</b> to be placed in any desired location on the semiconductor die <b>100</b>, instead of limiting the location of the UBM <b>115</b> to the region directly over the contact pad <b>105</b>. In an embodiment the PPI <b>111</b> may be formed by initially forming a seed layer (not shown) of a titanium copper alloy through a suitable formation process such as CVD or sputtering. A photoresist (not shown) may then be formed to cover the seed layer, and the photoresist may then be patterned to expose those portions of the seed layer that are located where the PPI <b>111</b> is desired to be located.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Once the photoresist has been formed and patterned, a conductive material, such as copper, may be formed on the seed layer through a deposition process such as plating. The conductive material may be formed to have a thickness of between about 1 &#x3bc;m and about 10 &#x3bc;m, such as about 5 &#x3bc;m, and a width along the substrate <b>101</b> of between about 5 &#x3bc;m and about 300 &#x3bc;m, such as about 15 &#x3bc;m. However, while the material and methods discussed are suitable to form the conductive material, these materials are merely exemplary. Any other suitable materials, such as AlCu or Au, and any other suitable processes of formation, such as CVD or PVD, may alternatively be used to form the PPI <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Once the conductive material has been formed, the photoresist may be removed through a suitable removal process such as ashing. Additionally, after the removal of the photoresist, those portions of the seed layer that were covered by the photoresist may be removed through, for example, a suitable etch process using the conductive material as a mask.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Once the PPI <b>111</b> has been formed, the third passivation layer <b>113</b> may be formed to protect the PPI <b>111</b> and the other underlying structures. The third passivation layer <b>113</b>, similar to the second passivation layer <b>109</b>, may be formed from a polymer such as polyimide, or may alternatively be formed of a similar material as the first passivation layer <b>107</b> (e.g., silicon oxides, silicon nitrides, low-k dielectrics, extremely low-k dielectrics, combinations of these, and the like). The third passivation layer <b>113</b> may be formed to have a thickness of between about 2 &#x3bc;m and about 15 &#x3bc;m, such as about 5 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">After the third passivation layer <b>113</b> has been formed, a PPI opening <b>108</b> may be made through the third passivation layer <b>113</b> by removing portions of the third passivation layer <b>113</b> to expose at least a portion of the underlying PPI <b>111</b>. The PPI opening <b>108</b> allows for contact between the UBM <b>115</b> and the PPI <b>111</b>. The PPI opening <b>108</b> may be formed using a suitable photolithographic mask and etching process, although any suitable process to expose portions of the PPI <b>111</b> may alternatively be used.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Once the PPI <b>111</b> has been exposed through the third passivation layer <b>113</b>, the UBM <b>115</b> may be formed in electrical contact with the PPI <b>111</b>. The UBM <b>115</b> may comprise three layers of conductive materials, such as a layer of titanium, a layer of copper, and a layer of nickel. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that there are many suitable arrangements of materials and layers, such as an arrangement of chrome/chrome-copper alloy/copper/gold, an arrangement of titanium/titanium tungsten/copper, or an arrangement of copper/nickel/gold, that are suitable for the formation of the UBM <b>115</b>. Any suitable materials or layers of material that may be used for the UBM <b>115</b> are fully intended to be included within the scope of the current application.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The UBM <b>115</b> may be created by forming each layer over the third passivation layer <b>113</b> and along the interior of the PPI opening <b>108</b> through the third passivation layer <b>113</b>. The forming of each layer may be performed using a plating process, such as electrochemical plating, although other processes of formation, such as sputtering, evaporation, or PECVD process, may alternatively be used depending upon the desired materials. The UBM <b>115</b> may be formed to have a thickness of between about 0.7 &#x3bc;m and about 10 &#x3bc;m, such as about 5 &#x3bc;m. Once the desired layers have been formed, portions of the layers may then be removed through a suitable photolithographic masking and etching process to remove the undesired material and to leave the UBM <b>115</b> in a desired shape, such as a circular, octagonal, square, or rectangular shape, although any desired shape may alternatively be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The contact bump <b>117</b> may comprise a material such as tin, or other suitable materials, such as silver, lead-free tin, or copper. In an embodiment in which the contact bump <b>117</b> is a tin solder bump, the contact bump <b>117</b> may be formed by initially forming a layer of tin through such commonly used methods such as evaporation, electroplating, printing, solder transfer, ball placement, etc, to a thickness of, e.g., about 100 &#x3bc;m. Once a layer of tin has been formed on the structure, a reflow may be performed in order to shape the material into the desired bump shape.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a top view of the UBM <b>115</b> overlying the PPI <b>111</b> and the PPI openings <b>108</b> along line A-A&#x2032; (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), with the contact bump <b>117</b>, the third passivation layer <b>113</b>, and the layers underlying the PPI <b>111</b> removed from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for clarity. Additionally in this view, the UBM <b>115</b> within the PPI opening <b>108</b> and the PPI opening <b>108</b> itself share the same boundary. As can be seen in this top-down view, the PPI opening <b>108</b> and the UBM <b>115</b> within the PPI openings <b>108</b> may have a first diameter D<sub>1 </sub>of between about 60 &#x3bc;m and about 500 &#x3bc;m, such as about 250 &#x3bc;m. The PPI <b>111</b> may have an interconnect region <b>204</b> and a first region <b>202</b>, e.g., a landing pad, underlying the UBM <b>115</b> that has a larger dimension in each direction than the PPI opening <b>108</b> and effectively, from this top-down point of view, surrounds the PPI opening <b>108</b> and the UBM <b>115</b> within the PPI opening <b>108</b>. In an embodiment the PPI <b>111</b> may have a first length L<sub>1 </sub>in one direction (e.g., parallel to line A-A&#x2032;) that is larger than a first width W<sub>1 </sub>in another direction (e.g., parallel to line B-B&#x2032;). By having the first length L<sub>1 </sub>larger than the first width W<sub>1</sub>, the PPI <b>111</b> may additionally have a longitudinal axis, represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by the dashed line <b>201</b>. Additionally, the interconnect region <b>204</b> may have a second width W<sub>2 </sub>less than the first width W<sub>1</sub>, such as between about 60 &#x3bc;m and about 550 &#x3bc;m, such as about 300 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As an example only, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first length L<sub>1 </sub>of the PPI <b>111</b> may extend beyond the PPI opening <b>108</b> a first distance A<sub>1</sub>, which may be between about 0.5 &#x3bc;m and about 100 &#x3bc;m, such as about 50 &#x3bc;m. In an opposite direction the first length L<sub>1 </sub>of the PPI <b>111</b> may extend beyond the PPI opening <b>108</b> a second distance A<sub>2</sub>, which may be between about 0.5 &#x3bc;m and about 100 &#x3bc;m, such as about 50 &#x3bc;m. As such, the first length L<sub>1 </sub>of the PPI <b>111</b> may be equal to the first diameter D<sub>1 </sub>of the PPI opening <b>108</b> plus the first distance A<sub>1 </sub>and the second distance A<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additionally, the first width W<sub>1 </sub>of the first region <b>202</b> of the PPI <b>111</b> may extend a third distance B<sub>1</sub>, which may be between about 0.5 &#x3bc;m and about 50 &#x3bc;m, such as about 5 &#x3bc;m. In an opposite direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>201</b>, the PPI <b>111</b> may extend a fourth distance B<sub>2</sub>, which may be between about 0.5 &#x3bc;m and about 50 &#x3bc;m, such as about 5 &#x3bc;m. As such, the first width W<sub>1 </sub>of the first region <b>202</b> of the PPI <b>111</b> may equal the first diameter D<sub>1 </sub>of the PPI opening <b>108</b> plus the third distance B<sub>1 </sub>and the fourth distance B<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment the first distance A<sub>1 </sub>and the second distance A<sub>2 </sub>may be equal to each other, although alternatively they may not be equal to each other. Similarly, the third distance B<sub>1 </sub>may be the same as the fourth distance B<sub>2</sub>, although alternatively they may be different distances as well. However, in an embodiment in which the first region <b>202</b> of the PPI <b>111</b> has an elongated shape and the PPI opening <b>108</b> is circular with the first diameter D<sub>1</sub>, the total of the sum of the first distance A<sub>1 </sub>and the second distance A<sub>2 </sub>is greater than the sum of the third distance B<sub>1 </sub>and the fourth distance B<sub>2</sub>. As such, the first length L<sub>1 </sub>of the first region <b>202</b> of the PPI <b>111</b> may be the sum of the first diameter D<sub>1 </sub>plus the first distance A<sub>1 </sub>and the second distance A<sub>2</sub>, while the first width W<sub>1 </sub>of the first region <b>202</b> of the PPI <b>111</b> beneath the UBM <b>115</b> may be the sum of the first diameter D<sub>1 </sub>plus the third distance B<sub>1 </sub>and the fourth distance B<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">By expanding the size of the PPI <b>111</b> such that the PPI <b>111</b> has larger dimensions that the PPI opening <b>108</b> in the first region <b>202</b>, and even beyond the UBM <b>115</b>, the PPI <b>111</b> can effectively shield the underlying layers, such as the metallization layers <b>103</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), that have a combination of metals and extremely low-k dielectric layers from the peeling stresses that can occur during thermal processing. In particular, the PPI <b>111</b> can effectively shield the underlying layers from stresses generated by thermal expansion mismatches between the layers. As such, delamination of the layers is less likely to occur, and the overall yield of the manufacturing processes may be increased. Additionally, by expanding the PPI <b>111</b> in the first region <b>202</b>, the remainder of the PPI <b>111</b> does not also have to be expanded, thereby allowing for an increase in the metal density of the PPI <b>111</b> layer than would otherwise be obtained if the entire PPI <b>111</b> were enlarged.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a top down view of the semiconductor die <b>100</b> with a plurality of UBMs <b>115</b> located thereon (the top down view illustrates only the UBMs <b>115</b> located on the die while the first example <b>305</b> and second example <b>307</b> illustrate both the UBMs <b>115</b> as well as the PPIs <b>111</b>). As illustrated, in an embodiment the longitudinal axis <b>201</b> of the PPI <b>111</b> beneath the UBMs <b>115</b> may be aligned in a direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch (represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by line <b>303</b>). As an example only, on the semiconductor die <b>100</b> the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b> radiates outward from the center of the semiconductor die <b>100</b>. As such, for each one of the UBMs <b>115</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b> may be determined by drawing a line (e.g., first line <b>309</b> and second liner <b>311</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) from the center of the semiconductor die <b>100</b> to the center of the individual UBMs <b>115</b>. Once the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b> for each of the individual UBMs <b>115</b> has been determined, the longitudinal axis <b>201</b> of each of the PPIs <b>111</b> underlying each of the individual UBMs <b>115</b> may be aligned along the same lines.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Two examples of this are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with a first example being represented by the dashed box <b>305</b> and a second example being represented by the dashed box <b>307</b>. In the first example the UBM <b>115</b> is located along an outer edge of the semiconductor die <b>100</b>, and the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b> may be determined by extending a first line <b>309</b> from the center of the semiconductor die <b>100</b> to a center of the UBM <b>115</b> within the dashed box <b>305</b>. Once the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b> has been determined for the UBM <b>115</b> within the dashed box <b>307</b>, the longitudinal axis <b>201</b> of the PPI <b>111</b> may be aligned with the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b>, thereby helping to shield the underlying layers from stresses caused by differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the second example, similar to the first example, the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b> may be determined by extending a second line <b>311</b> from the center of the semiconductor die <b>100</b> to a center of the UBM <b>115</b> within the dashed box <b>307</b>. Once the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b> has been determined for the UBM <b>115</b> within the dashed box <b>307</b>, the longitudinal axis <b>201</b> of the underlying PPI <b>111</b> may be aligned with the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b>, thereby also helping to shield the underlying layers from stresses caused by differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, as one of ordinary skill will recognize, the above described method of determining the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b> is not the only method that may be used. Alternative methods, such as experimentally measuring the actual direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b> may alternatively be utilized. Additionally, the first region <b>202</b> may be rotated relative to the remainder of the PPI <b>111</b> in order to have the longitudinal axis <b>201</b> of the first region <b>202</b> aligned with the direction of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch <b>303</b>. These methods and any other suitable method may alternatively be used and are fully intended to be included within the scope of the present embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates modeling results that help to illustrate the benefits of the embodiments. As can be shown, the relative stress level in the underlying metallization layers may be reduced by having the size of the PPI <b>111</b> be larger than the size of the overlying UBM <b>115</b>. As such, the PPI <b>111</b> is effectively shielding the underlying metallization layers <b>103</b> from the stresses resulting from the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch. As such, by reducing the stress level, the possibility of delamination can also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates another embodiment in which the PPI <b>111</b> may be formed as a discontinuous layer with a primary section <b>501</b> and a first periphery section <b>503</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the primary section <b>501</b> of the PPI <b>111</b> may extend from the contact pad <b>105</b> to underneath the UBM <b>115</b>, but may not fully extend beyond the UBM <b>115</b> on the other side. However, the first periphery section <b>503</b> of the PPI <b>111</b> may be formed in order to provide the shielding for the underlying layers by being laterally removed from the PPI opening <b>108</b> and by having a portion located beneath the UBM <b>115</b> and a portion extending beyond the UBM <b>115</b>. In an embodiment, the first periphery section <b>503</b> of the PPI <b>111</b> may be separated from the primary section <b>501</b> a fifth distance D<sub>5 </sub>of between about 0.5 &#x3bc;m and about 100 &#x3bc;m, such as about 10 &#x3bc;m, and may be laterally removed from the PPI opening <b>108</b> a sixth distance D<sub>6 </sub>of between about 1 &#x3bc;m and about 300 &#x3bc;m, such as about 5 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates a top-down view of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in which the PPI <b>111</b>, the PPI opening <b>108</b> and the entire UBM <b>115</b> (including those portions of the UBM <b>115</b> that are located outside of the PPI openings <b>108</b>) are illustrated. In this embodiment, the primary section <b>501</b> may have a second region <b>602</b> underlying the UBM <b>115</b> which may have a second diameter D<sub>2 </sub>that is smaller than the first diameter D<sub>1 </sub>of the UBM <b>115</b>. For example, the second region <b>602</b> may have a second diameter D<sub>2 </sub>that is between about 15 &#x3bc;m and about 450 &#x3bc;m, such as about 250 &#x3bc;m. Additionally, the PPI opening <b>108</b> in this embodiment may have a third diameter D<sub>3 </sub>of between about 5 &#x3bc;m and about 400 &#x3bc;m, such as about 50 &#x3bc;m.

In this embodiment the primary section <b>501</b> may retain its circular shape with the second diameter D<sub>2 </sub>ending without extending beyond the UBM <b>115</b>. However, the first periphery section <b>503</b>, the second periphery section <b>601</b> and the third periphery section <b>603</b> may have an inner edge that generally conforms to the outer shape of the primary section <b>501</b>. Additionally, the outer edge of the first periphery section <b>503</b>, the second periphery section <b>601</b> and the third periphery section <b>603</b> may extend beyond the outer limits of the UBM <b>115</b>.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment in which the first periphery section <b>503</b>, the second periphery section <b>601</b>, and the third periphery section <b>603</b> are shaped as ovals, and may be formed a tenth distance D<sub>10 </sub>away from the primary section <b>501</b> of between about 1 &#x3bc;m and about 300 &#x3bc;m, such as about 5 &#x3bc;m, while the periphery sections, such as the third periphery section <b>603</b> may be laterally separated from the PPI opening <b>108</b> an eleventh distance D<sub>11 </sub>of between about 2 &#x3bc;m and about 500 &#x3bc;m, such as about 8 &#x3bc;m. In this embodiment, the first periphery section <b>503</b>, the second periphery section <b>601</b>, and the third periphery section <b>603</b> may have a fifth length L<sub>5 </sub>of between about 3 &#x3bc;m and about 300 &#x3bc;m, such as about 20 &#x3bc;m, and a fifth width W<sub>5 </sub>of between about 3 &#x3bc;m and about 300 &#x3bc;m, such as about 20 &#x3bc;m.
