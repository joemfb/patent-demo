<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">With the scaling of integrated circuits, more devices are put into a chip. This not only requires the shrinkage of the device size, but it also requires an improvement in the manufacturing techniques. One example involves memory chips. Due to the high capacity requirement of the memory chips, reducing layout area of the devices is especially important. Therefore, the devices in the memory chips are arranged close to each other to save space.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the memory cell design, layout area, cell stability, and standby current are among the most important factors. Therefore, static random access memory (SRAM) cells have become the main stream in deep sub-micron technology. To achieve maximum density, the distance between devices in the SRAM cells, particularly the distance between N-well regions and P-well regions on which the devices of the SRAM cells are formed, needs to be as small as possible. This pushes the layout rules of lightly doped drain (LDD) regions of the MOS devices to their limit.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Increasingly more SRAM cells are formed of fin field-effect (FinFET) transistors, which have increased drive currents, and hence faster switching speed over that of planar transistors. Conventional formation of the LDD regions of the FinFETs in SRAM cells involves implants. The implantation, however, suffers from non-conformal doping, wherein the bottom portions of the fins have smaller LDD implantation depths than the top portions.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The making and using of the embodiments of the disclosure are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the embodiments provide many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative, and do not limit the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of forming fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs) is provided in accordance with various embodiments. The intermediate stages of forming the FinFETs are illustrated. The variations of the embodiments are discussed. Throughout the various views and illustrative embodiments, like reference numbers are used to designate like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a top view of a portion of wafer <b>20</b>. Fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are located at the surface of wafer <b>20</b>. Fins <b>22</b> are used for forming an n-type FinFET, and fins <b>24</b> are used for forming p-type FinFETs. The n-type FinFET and the p-type FinFETs may be portions of a static random access memory (SRAM) cell in some embodiments. Fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> have their longitudinal directions parallel to the Y directions. In an embodiment, fins <b>24</b> are located on opposite sides of fins <b>22</b>, although fins <b>24</b> may also be located on one side, but not the other side, of fins <b>22</b>. Gate electrode <b>26</b> is formed over middle portions of fins <b>22</b>. Gate dielectric <b>28</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) is formed between gate electrode <b>26</b> and fins <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, gate electrode <b>26</b> may further extend over one or more of fins <b>24</b>, and hence the respective p-type FinFETs that comprise fin(s) <b>24</b> may share the same gate with the FinFETs of fins <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 8</figref> are cross-sectional views of intermediate stages in the formation of an n-type FinFET in accordance with various embodiments, wherein the cross-sectional views are taken from the plane crossing line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are formed over substrate <b>30</b>. In an embodiment, fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are connected to bulk substrate <b>30</b> that is formed of a semiconductor material such as silicon. In alternative embodiments, substrate <b>30</b> may include semiconductor layer <b>30</b>A and insulation layer <b>30</b>B over semiconductor layer <b>30</b>A, wherein insulation layer <b>30</b>B may be formed of a dielectric material such as silicon oxide. Photo resist <b>34</b> is formed over wafer <b>20</b> and covers fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, lithography mask <b>36</b> is placed over photo resist <b>34</b>. Lithography mask <b>36</b> comprises transparent portions for allowing light (that is used to expose photo resist <b>34</b>) to pass through, and opaque portions for blocking the light. It is appreciated that although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates that portion <b>36</b>B (which is over fins <b>22</b>) of lithography mask <b>36</b> is opaque, portion <b>36</b>B may also be transparent, depending on whether photo resist <b>34</b> is a positive photo resist or a negative photo resist. Wafer <b>20</b> includes alignment marks <b>32</b>, and lithography mask <b>36</b> includes alignment marks <b>38</b>. Alignment marks <b>38</b> are aligned to the respective ones of alignment marks <b>32</b>. When alignment marks <b>38</b> and <b>32</b> are aligned, the interfaces <b>36</b>A that are between opaque portions and transparent portions of lithography mask <b>36</b> may be aligned to, or substantially aligned to, the middle lines <b>23</b> between neighboring fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Accordingly, interfaces <b>36</b>A may have substantially equal horizontal distances (marked as (S<b>1</b>)/<b>2</b>) to fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, lithography mask <b>36</b> is shifted in the +X direction (also refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which is parallel to the major surface of wafer <b>20</b> and perpendicular to the longitudinal direction (Y direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of fins <b>22</b>. The shift distance is marked as &#x394;S<b>1</b>. In an embodiment, assuming the distance between neighboring fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> is S<b>1</b>, the shift distance &#x394;S<b>1</b> may be between about 10 percent to about 45 percent distance S<b>1</b> (the distance between neighboring fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>), and may be between about 25 percent and about 50 percent distance S<b>1</b>. Accordingly, after the shift of lithography mask <b>36</b>, alignment marks <b>38</b> and <b>32</b> are misaligned, and the misalignment is equal to &#x394;S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Using the shifted lithography mask <b>36</b> as an exposure mask, photo resist <b>34</b> is exposed, wherein arrows <b>35</b> illustrate the light for the exposure. The exposed photo resist <b>34</b> is developed, and some portions of photo resist <b>34</b> are removed, while other portions are not removed. The resulting photo resist <b>34</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, wherein fins <b>22</b> are not covered by the remaining portions of photo resist <b>34</b>, while fins <b>24</b> are covered. Edges <b>34</b>A of photo resist <b>34</b> are misaligned from middle line <b>23</b> of neighboring fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, and one of edges <b>34</b>A (marked as <b>34</b>A<b>1</b>) is closer to a respective adjacent fin <b>22</b> than to the adjacent fin <b>24</b>, while the other one of edges <b>34</b>A (marked as <b>34</b>A<b>2</b>) is closer to the adjacent fin <b>24</b> than to the adjacent fin <b>22</b>. Edges <b>34</b>A may be parallel to the Y direction as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A first tilt implantation is then performed to form first portions of LDD regions <b>40</b>, wherein the first tilt implantation (symbolized by arrows <b>41</b>) is tilted from the right side of the illustrated fins <b>22</b>, and is tilted toward the &#x2212;X direction, which is opposite to the direction (+X direction) that lithography mask <b>36</b> is shifted toward (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The implanted impurity may include an n-type impurity such as phosphorous, arsenic, or combinations thereof. The tilt implantation may be performed at tilt angle &#x3b1;<b>1</b>, wherein the maximum tilt angle &#x3b1;<b>1</b> may be between about 20 degrees and about 60 degrees, for example. It is observed that this maximum value of tilt angle &#x3b1;<b>1</b> is greater than the maximum tilt angle &#x3b2; when edges <b>34</b>A of photo resist <b>34</b> is aligned to middle line <b>23</b>. The maximum value of tilt angle &#x3b1;<b>1</b> is such that if the tilt implantation is performed at a tilt angle greater than the maximum tilt angle &#x3b1;, at least bottom portions of fins <b>22</b> are blocked by photo resist <b>34</b> from receiving the implanted dopants. Accordingly, by shifting edges <b>34</b>A of photo resist <b>34</b> away from middle lines <b>23</b>, the conformity of the resulting LDD regions <b>40</b> is improved, and the sidewall portions of LDD regions <b>40</b> may have thickness T<b>2</b> close to thickness T<b>1</b> of top portions of LDD regions <b>40</b>. After the tilt implantation, photo resist <b>34</b> is removed, for example, by ashing.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate the formation and the patterning of photo resist <b>44</b>, and the tilt implantation for forming additional portions of LDD regions <b>40</b> using photo resist <b>44</b> as an implantation mask. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, photo resist <b>44</b> is formed. Mask <b>36</b>, which may be the same lithography mask <b>36</b> used in the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is used to expose photo resist <b>44</b>. When exposing photo resist <b>44</b>, lithography mask <b>36</b> is first aligned, so that alignment marks <b>38</b> are aligned to alignment marks <b>32</b> in wafer <b>20</b>. Lithography mask <b>36</b> is then shifted in &#x2212;X direction, which is the opposite direction that lithography mask <b>36</b> is shifted toward in the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The distance of the shift, which is illustrated as &#x394;S<b>2</b>, may be essentially the same as the magnitude &#x394;S<b>1</b> of the shift as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, although the shift distance &#x394;S<b>1</b> may be different from shift distance &#x394;S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Next, using lithography mask <b>36</b> as an exposure mask, photo resist <b>44</b> is exposed, as indicated by arrows. The exposed photo resist <b>44</b> is developed, and the resulting photo resist <b>44</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Fins <b>22</b> are not covered by photo resist <b>44</b>, while fins <b>24</b> are covered. Edges <b>44</b>A of the resulting photo resist are misaligned from the respective middle lines <b>23</b> of neighboring fins <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Similarly, one of edges <b>44</b>A is closer to fin <b>24</b> than to the respective fin <b>22</b>, while the other one of edges <b>44</b>A is closer to fin <b>22</b> than to the respective fin <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A second tilt implantation (represented by arrows <b>45</b>) is then performed to form additional portions of LDD regions <b>40</b>, wherein the second tilt implantation is tilt in the +X direction. The implanted impurity may be essentially the same as in the first tilt implant. The tilt may be performed at tilt angle &#x3b1;<b>2</b>, wherein the maximum value of tilt angle &#x3b1;<b>2</b> may be between about 20 degrees and about 60 degrees, for example, and may be substantially equal to the maximum tilt angle &#x3b1;<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Similarly, by shifting the position of the patterned photo resist <b>44</b>, the conformity of the implantation is improved, and the sidewall portions of LDD regions <b>40</b> may have thickness close to the thickness of the top portions of LDD regions <b>40</b>. After the tilt implantation, photo resist <b>44</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the formation of deep source/drain regions <b>48</b>, which may be formed by implanting an n-type impurity into fins <b>22</b>. Deep source/drain regions <b>48</b> may extend into entireties of fins <b>22</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, source/drain silicide regions <b>50</b> are formed on the top surface and sidewalls of fins <b>22</b>, and n-Type FinFET <b>100</b> is formed. Gate electrode <b>26</b> and gate dielectric <b>28</b> are also illustrated. Gate electrode <b>26</b> and gate dielectric <b>28</b> are illustrated using dashed lines since they are not in the illustrated plane. It is noted that at the time source/drain silicide regions <b>50</b> are formed, the LDD regions, source/drain regions, and the source/drain silicide regions of p-type FinFETs that are based on fins <b>24</b> may also be formed. The details of the p-type FinFETs formed from fins <b>24</b> are not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the cross-sectional views of an intermediate stage in the manufacturing of a FinFET in accordance with alternative embodiments. Unless specified otherwise, the materials and formation methods of the components in these embodiments are essentially the same as the like components, which are denoted by like reference numerals in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8</figref>. The initial steps of these embodiments are essentially the same as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, wherein photo resist <b>34</b> is formed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Next, as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, photo resist <b>34</b> is exposed.
