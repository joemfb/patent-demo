<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Korean patent application number 10-2009-73818, filed on 11 Aug. 2009, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same; more particularly, to a semiconductor device including a buried gate, a storage node and bit lines and a method of fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In semiconductor memory devices, DRAM has a multiplicity of unit cells, each consisting of a capacitor and a transistor. Among them, the capacitor is used to store data temporarily, and the transistor is used to transmit data between a bit line and the capacitor in response to a control signal (word line), while using the nature of a semiconductor having variable conductivity. The transistor has a gate, a source and a drain. According to a control signal applied to the gate, the charged particles are allowed to move between the source and the drain. The movement of charged particles between the source and the drain is realized via a channel region defined by the gate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to a method of fabricating a conventional transistor on a semiconductor substrate, a gate is first formed over the semiconductor substrate and impurities are doped into two sides of the gate to form a source and a drain. A region between the source and drain under the gate becomes a channel region for the transistor. The transistor having such a horizontal channel region occupies a certain area of the semiconductor substrate. A high density semiconductor memory device has numerous transistors formed therein so it is difficult to reduce the size of the semiconductor memory device (or the chip size).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Decreasing the chip size allows a larger number of semiconductor memory chips to be produced per wafer, leading to an improved yield. Indeed, a number of different techniques have been used to reduce the chip size. One technique is to use a recess gate instead of a traditional planar gate having a horizontal channel region, where a recess is formed on the substrate and then forming a gate in that recess so as to obtain a channel region along the curved surface of the recess. Another technique uses a buried gate that is formed by burying the entire gate within the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such a buried gate structure, an isolation gate has been used to form a bit-line contact as well as a storage node contact in a line type. However, in doing so, the cell area may become larger than the isolation gate structure and may experience a greater leakage current than for the existing trench-type device isolation film.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, a buried gate structure using such a trench-type device isolation film has a disadvantage in that during the patterning of a bit-line contact, a contact hole is generally require to be patterned as a hole by dry etching. If a Critical Dimension (CD) becomes smaller in size, the contact hole pattern may not be defined on a mask. Moreover, when the contact hole needs to be etched in an active region during a subsequent etching process, the active region may not open. Increasing the CD to prevent this may cause a short problem with the storage node.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Besides, there are other problems: for example, the storage node contact has to be formed as a Self Aligned Contact (SAC) after the formation of bit lines, and a reduced contact area between the active regions and the contact increases contact resistance.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same, wherein a storage node contact hole is made sufficiently large to facilitate the etching of a storage node contact hole with a small CD. Also, a landing plug is formed to have resistance that is lower than the plug resistance, and the SAC process is performed at the time of the bit line formation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a method of fabricating a semiconductor device, includes forming a device isolation film for defining a multiplicity of active regions in a semiconductor substrate; forming a multiplicity of buried word lines in the semiconductor substrate; forming a storage node contact hole for exposing a storage node contact region of two adjoining active regions; filling the storage node contact hole with a storage node contact plug material; forming a bit-line groove for exposing a bit-line contact region of the active region and splitting the storage node contact plug material into two; and forming a bit line into the bit-line groove. By making the storage node contact hole large, any problem caused during the etching of a storage node contact hole with a small CD can be solved, and the SAC process is no longer needed during the formation of bit lines.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method of fabricating a semiconductor device further comprises: forming a landing plug over the bit-line contact region and storage node contact region of the active region.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The formation of the landing plug preferably comprises: before the formation of the word lines, forming a hard mask oxide and a hard mask layer over the surface of the active region; after the formation of the word lines, removing the hard mask layer and the hard mask oxide from the surface of the active region; forming a landing plug in a space of the active region from which the hard mask layer has been removed; and implanting ions into the landing plug.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The formation of the storage node contact hole preferably comprises: forming an interlayer dielectric over the semiconductor substrate including the landing plug and the word lines; and etching the interlayer dielectric with the landing plug as an etch stop layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method further comprises: forming a selective epi growth (SEG) layer in the bit-line contact and storage node contact regions of the active region, so as to increase the height of a junction region (source/drain) of the active region by SEG layer to lower plug resistance and to reduce GIDL (Gate Induced Drain Leakage).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The formation of the buried word lines comprises: forming a trench in the semiconductor substrate; filling the trench with a gate conductive layer; and forming a capping layer over the gate conductive layer within the trench. In this manner, buried word lines are formed on the lower portion of the surface of the silicon substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method preferably further comprises: after the formation of the bit-line groove, forming a nitride spacer on the side walls of the bit-line groove.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the formation of the bit lines is performed by the damascene process comprising: forming a barrier metal layer on the side walls and bottom surface of the bit-line groove; and forming a bit-line conductive layer over the surface of the barrier metal layer.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Embodiments of a method of fabricating a semiconductor device according to the present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> are plan or sectional views sequentially illustrating a fabrication method of a semiconductor device according to the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, (a) is a sectional view taken along the Y direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, (b) is a sectional view taken along the X direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Other figures follow the same orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, active regions <b>12</b> and device isolation films <b>14</b> for defining the active regions <b>12</b> are formed over a semiconductor substrate. Each active region <b>12</b> is intersected by two word lines <b>20</b>. The active region defines an acute angle with respect to the word line <b>20</b> in the present embodiment. The word line <b>20</b> is formed within the semiconductor substrate as a buried word line, i.e., the upper surface of the word line <b>20</b> is lower than the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a hard mask oxide <b>15</b> and a nitride or a hard mask layer made of a polysilicon material are sequentially formed over the surface of the semiconductor substrate. The hard mask layer is etched using a mask that defines a device isolation film <b>14</b> region to form a hard mask pattern <b>16</b>. The semiconductor substrate is etched using this hard mask pattern <b>16</b> as a mask to form a trench therein, and the trench is filled with an oxide to form the device isolation film <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, a liner nitride (not shown) and a liner oxide (not shown) are formed over the trench surface of the semiconductor substrate before the device isolation film <b>14</b> is formed thereon. The device isolation film <b>14</b> made of an oxide material is obtained by forming an oxide, e.g., using a Spin On Dielectric (SOD) method, over the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate having a trench formed therein and then removing the oxide from the surface of the hard mask pattern <b>16</b> by the CMP method to fill the device isolation film <b>14</b> into the trench.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a conventional method, the active regions <b>12</b> were formed to have their surfaces to be the same height as the surface of the device isolation film <b>14</b>. In the present embodiment, since the hard mask <b>16</b> resides on the surface of the active regions <b>12</b>, the surface of the hard mask <b>16</b> is formed to have the same height as the surface of the device isolation film <b>14</b>, i.e., the upper surface of the active region <b>12</b> is provided to be lower than the upper surface of the device isolation <b>14</b>. This height difference between the active region <b>12</b> and the device isolation <b>14</b> facilitates the formation of a landing plug because interlayer dielectric need not be formed over the active region <b>12</b> when the hard mask pattern <b>16</b> is made of a nitride and then the nitride material is removed, or when the hard mask <b>16</b> is made of polysilicon and then the polysilicon is patterned to be used as a landing plug. In another embodiment of the present invention, instead of forming the hard mask <b>16</b> over the active region <b>12</b>, a selective epi growth (SEG) process is performed on the active region to make the surface of an SEG layer (not shown) of the active region <b>12</b> to have substantially the same height as the surface of the device isolation film <b>14</b>. In this case, although a storage node contact is formed directly on the surface of the SEG layer (not shown) over the active region <b>12</b> without forming a landing plug, since the SEG layer increases the height of a junction region (source/drain) of the active region <b>12</b>, plug resistance can be lowered and Gate Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL) is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a trench <b>22</b> having a predetermined depth for forming a buried gate <b>20</b> is formed in the semiconductor substrate having the active regions <b>12</b> and the device isolation films <b>14</b> formed thereon. The surface of the trench <b>22</b> is oxidized to form a gate oxide <b>24</b>, and the trench <b>22</b> having the gate oxide <b>24</b> formed thereon is filled with a gate electrode <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The gate electrode <b>26</b> includes TiN and tungsten (W) in the present embodiment. A capping film <b>28</b> for protecting the gate electrode <b>26</b> is formed over the gate electrode <b>26</b> within the trench <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the hard mask layer <b>16</b> is removed and a landing plug <b>30</b> is formed in a space created by removing the hard mask layer <b>16</b>. The landing plug <b>30</b> electrically connects the junction region (source/drain) of the semiconductor substrate to the bit-line contact plug and the storage node contact plug. The landing plug <b>20</b> is formed of conductive material (e.g., polysilicon). The landing plug formation process includes depositing a landing plug material such as polysilicon within the space created by the removal of the hard mask layer <b>16</b> and over the capping film <b>28</b>. Excess landing plug material that protrudes above the capping film <b>28</b> is removed using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) or etch-back. The landing plug <b>30</b> can be formed by depositing doped polysilicon, or by depositing polysilicon and then implanting ions for doping.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Rather than forming a bit-line contact plug and a storage node contact plug directly on the junction region of the semiconductor substrate, the landing plug <b>30</b> on the junction region of the semiconductor substrate since bit lines are to be formed by the damascene process (to be described) in the present embodiment. The landing plug <b>30</b> (or an SEG layer grown on the active region <b>12</b>) couples the bit lines and the junction regions of the active region <b>12</b>. By the use of landing plug <b>30</b>, loss of the semiconductor substrate can be avoided during the damascene process used to form the bit lines. As a result, a junction region having a low depth can be utilized. In addition, since a metal plug is not formed directly on the active region, the landing plug <b>30</b> serves as a buffer, and the contact surface between the active regions <b>12</b> and the contact plug (landing plug) is increased, thereby lowering plug resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A sealing nitride <b>32</b> is formed over the landing plug <b>30</b>, buried gate <b>20</b> and device isolation film <b>14</b> to protect the buried gate <b>20</b> and the landing plug <b>30</b>. A gate is formed in a peripheral region (not shown), not in the cell region that has been described thus far.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an interlayer dielectric (ILD) <b>40</b> is formed over the sealing nitride <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A portion of the ILD <b>40</b> is etched to form a storage node contact hole <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Hole <b>42</b> exposes the landing plug <b>30</b> and is used to form a storage node contact plug. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) shows a cross sectional view along the X direction of the semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The storage node contact hole <b>42</b> includes a storage node region of two adjacent active regions <b>12</b> in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a conventional method, a storage node contact hole <b>42</b> of each active region <b>12</b> is formed individually, i.e., one contact hole for each active region. In the present embodiment, one storage node contact hole <b>42</b> is formed for two adjacent active regions <b>12</b>. As a result, a bigger contact hole pattern may be used for the contact hole. The occurrence of a contact hole pattern not being defined on the mask produced during the formation of a contact hole pattern may be minimized. The storage node contact hole pattern including two storage node contact regions is split into two to electrically isolate the two, the process of which is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the present embodiment, a storage node contact plug is formed before a bit line contact plug so that the bit line formation process may proceed in a similar way with the buried gate formation process.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the storage node contact hole <b>42</b> exposing the landing plug <b>30</b> is filled with a conductive material to form a storage node contact plug <b>44</b>. This storage node contact plug <b>44</b> is made of the same material as the landing plug <b>30</b> (e.g., polysilicon) in the present embodiment. For example, after a polysilicon layer is deposited on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate having the storage node contact hole <b>42</b> formed therein, the polysilicon layer on the upper portion of the surface of the interlayer dielectric <b>40</b> is removed by CMP or etch-back.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a hard mask pattern <b>55</b> is formed to define a bit line region over the interlayer dielectric <b>40</b> having the storage node contact plug <b>44</b> formed therein. The hard mask pattern <b>55</b> may be a nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With the hard mask pattern <b>55</b> as a mask, a bit-line groove <b>51</b> for forming bit lines is etched to a predetermined depth so as to expose the surface of the landing plug <b>30</b> in a portion of the bit line region.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The bit-line groove <b>51</b> is used to form bit lines by a damascene process. The bit-line groove <b>51</b> formed also splits the storage node contact plug <b>44</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> (<i>b</i>)) that extends across two adjacent active regions <b>12</b> into two separate pieces, where each separated piece connecting the respective active region <b>12</b>. As a result, the SAC process does not need to be used at the time of the formation of a bit-line contact hole and a storage node contact hole.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, as the storage node contact plug <b>44</b> is formed in each of a multiplicity of active regions <b>12</b>, bit lines are also formed in an intersecting manner with those active regions <b>12</b>. Therefore, by forming a bit-line groove <b>51</b>, one storage node contact plug <b>44</b> formed over two active regions can be split.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, dielectric spacers <b>52</b> for insulating the bit-line groove <b>51</b> are formed on the bottom and side walls of the bit-line groove <b>51</b>. This dielectric spacer <b>52</b> is preferably made of a material having a low dielectric constant, such as a nitride or oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A contact mask (not shown) opens only a bit-line contact node portion (the left side bit-line groove <b>51</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>b</i>)) where a bit-line contact is supposed to be formed so as to remove the dielectric spacer <b>52</b> on the bottom surface of the bit-line groove <b>51</b>, thereby exposing the landing plug <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, bit lines <b>50</b> are formed in the bit-line grooves <b>51</b> having the dielectric spacer <b>52</b> formed thereon. To be more specific, a bit-line barrier metal layer <b>53</b> is formed first on the bottom and sidewall surfaces of the bit-line groove <b>51</b>. The barrier metal layer <b>53</b> includes Ti/TiN or Ti<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>x </sub>material in one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the barrier metal layer <b>53</b> is thermally treated for silicidification, where an interface region is converted to silicide while the bulk material (not shown) remains non-silicided. The upper portion is removed to leave the lower portion that has been converted to silicide remaining in the bit line groove <b>51</b>. Since the portion where the bit-line contact is to be formed is free of the dielectric spacer <b>52</b>, the bit lines are electrically connected with the landing plug <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A bit-line conductive layer <b>54</b> is formed over the surface of the barrier metal layer <b>53</b> (silicide in one embodiment), the bit-line conductive layer <b>54</b> may be made of tungsten (W). Meanwhile, to increase adhesion between the barrier metal layer <b>53</b> and the bit-line conductive layer <b>54</b>, an adhesive layer or TiN layer (not shown) may additionally be formed on the interface between these two layers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A bit-line hard mask <b>56</b> made of a nitride material is formed over the barrier metal layer <b>53</b> and bit-line conductive layer <b>54</b>. The bit-line hard mask formation process includes depositing a nitride over the entire surface, and leaving the bit-line hard mask <b>56</b> only inside the bit-line groove <b>52</b> using CMP or etch-back.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although subsequent processes are not shown, it should be understood that a capacitor consisting of a lower electrode, an upper electrode and a dielectric is formed over the storage node contact plug <b>44</b>. Additional layers are formed thereover to complete the fabrication process of a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The above embodiments of the present invention are illustrative and not limitative. Various alternatives and equivalents are possible. The invention is not limited by the embodiments described herein. Nor is the invention limited to any specific type of semiconductor device.
