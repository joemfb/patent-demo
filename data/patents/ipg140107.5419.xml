<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for conducting a transaction for products or services and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for presenting, delivering, displaying or otherwise providing a transaction outcome to a customer via an entertainment interface.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Transactions for products or services often may involve receiving one or more transaction inputs or entries from a customer, customer device, etc. and then computing one or more transaction outputs based on the transaction inputs. For example, for each item presented at a point-of-sale terminal at a grocery store, the point-of-sale terminal may determine the number of each item being purchased and multiply it by the item's associated price. The inputs of the transaction may include the quantity of each item, the item's price, applicable item discounts or rebates, etc. The outputs of the transaction may include the pre-tax and post-tax prices for all of the items. Similarly, a web site used to sell items, such as books, on the World Wide Web may total the unit costs for all of the books being purchased, the selections of the books being included in the transaction inputs, and then compute a total price to be charged to the customer. The total price is a transaction output for this example.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unfortunately, many transactions are complicated and often take more than an insubstantial amount of time to complete or to provide a resolution to a customer. If a customer conducting a transaction is provided with entertainment prior to, or during, the presentation or delivery of one or more transaction outputs, the customer will be more likely to enjoy the transaction experience and may place great value in the entertainment itself, even if the customer's desired transaction is not ultimately successful or completed. Such entertainment may also reduce any negative opinions formed by the customer towards the web site, retailer, manufacturer, etc. conducting the transaction and any hesitation the customer may have to initiate or conduct another transaction. Therefore, despite the state of the art in transaction processing for products and services, there remains a need for a method and apparatus for conducting a transaction for products or services wherein a customer is provided with entertainment or other diversion during or prior to the delivery of one or more transaction outputs or outcomes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for conducting a transaction for a product and/or service, wherein one or more outputs of the transaction are provided to a customer via an entertainment interface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention shall be set forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by the practice of the invention. The objects and the advantages may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and in combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the foregoing and other objects and in accordance with the purposes of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method for conducting a transaction includes providing a transaction interface; receiving at least one transaction input; determining at least one transaction output; and providing at least one of the at least one transaction outputs integrated with an entertainment interface.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A need exists for a method and apparatus for providing one or more transaction outputs, also called transaction outcomes, to a customer, customer device, etc. via an entertainment interface into which one or more of the transaction outputs preferably are integrated. A first embodiment <b>100</b> of a method in accordance with the principles of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The method <b>100</b> allows a customer (also referred to as a &#x201c;user&#x201d; or &#x201c;shopper&#x201d;) to initiate, complete, or otherwise conduct a transaction for purchasing, renting, leasing, etc. one or more products or services during which the customer will provide one or more transaction inputs in response to a transaction interface being provided or displayed to the customer. In addition, or alternatively, one or more transaction inputs may be obtained from one or more sources other than the customer. Upon receipt of appropriate transaction inputs, one or more transaction outcomes or outputs preferably will be determined, based at least in part on or using one or more transaction inputs. A transaction output may represent a numerical number, an indication of a selection, an affirmation or rejection of the transaction inputs or the customer's transaction offer created by the customer provided transaction inputs, etc. Preferably, either prior to providing a transaction output to the customer, or during the presentation of the transaction output to the customer, the customer is provided with entertainment or other diversion via an entertainment interface thereby making the transaction, and/or any delay in receiving a transaction output, a more positive experience for the customer. More specifically, in accordance with the present invention, one or more transaction outputs preferably are provided, displayed, etc. to the customer in an integrated manner with an entertainment interface such that the entertainment interface and the transaction output(s) create a singular or unified impression or appearance to the customer. The entertainment provided to the customer via the entertainment interface may have great value to the customer in that the customer enjoys the entertainment, the entertainment simplifies a presentation or understanding of a transaction output to the customer, the entertainment is fun for the customer to watch or participate in, the entertainment helps the customer &#x201c;kill&#x201d; or bide time prior to a transaction output being determined and/or presented to the customer, the entertainment reduces any hesitation the customer may have as to initiating or conducting another transaction, etc. As a result, the entertainment may reduce, or even eliminate, any ill will or negative opinions formed by the customer towards the transaction enabler or provider, such as a web site, web site operator or owner, retailer, manufacturer, etc., particularly if the customer is unhappy with an outcome of the transaction or an unfavorable transaction outcome is determined. In addition, the entertainment may create a situation in which a customer believes that he or she may be able to influence the outcome of a transaction or that one or more of the transaction outcomes or outputs were based on different transaction inputs or in accordance with different rules than the inputs or rules actually used to determine the transaction outcome. The term &#x201c;customer&#x201d; as used herein should be construed broadly and no specific limitation or definition is implied by use of the term &#x201c;customer.&#x201d; In addition, the term &#x201c;customer&#x201d; should include any user, shopper, transaction participant, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The method <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a step <b>102</b> during which a transaction display, screen, menu, framework, layer or other interface is presented to a customer or other user or initiated by the customer or other user for a transaction for at least one product and/or service. The transaction interface preferably provides information, test material, graphics, banners, software, video, audio, displays, guidelines, etc. needed by the customer so that the customer can conduct or otherwise participate in the transaction and provide one or more transaction inputs which will be received during a step <b>104</b>. In addition, or in contrast, transaction inputs from sources other than the customer may also be received during the step <b>104</b> and used to conduct or complete the transaction. The transaction interface preferably is associated with a transaction being completed, initiated or otherwise conducted by the customer for the purchase, rental, lease, etc. of one or more products and/or services. The transaction interface also preferably requests, explicitly or inherently, that a customer to whom the transaction interface is presented or displayed provide transaction information or inputs to a central source, controller, computer, etc. For example, a customer placing an online order via a web site for an airline flight reservation may be presented during the step <b>102</b> with an online order form requesting that the customer fill in desired departure date, desired departure time, desired departure airport, desired arrival airport, and perhaps a maximum price that the customer is willing to pay. The order form displayed to the customer forms some or all of the transaction interface presented during the step <b>102</b>. During the step <b>104</b>, information provided by the customer regarding the customer's desired departure date, time and airport, the desired arrival airport, and the maximum price are some or all of the transaction inputs received during the step <b>104</b> by the central source, controller, computer, etc. During a step <b>106</b>, a transaction outcome preferably is determined, selected, calculated, identified, etc. (all of which will herein be used interchangeably with &#x201c;determined&#x201d;) based, at least in part, on one or more of the transaction inputs received from a customer, customer device, or other source during the step <b>104</b>. Then, during a step <b>108</b>, the transaction outcome is presented or otherwise provided, transmitted, displayed, etc. to the customer, customer device, etc. preferably in conjunction with or after the presentation or delivery of an entertainment framework, display, or other interface to the customer, customer device, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The entertainment interface may comprise a graphic or video display, animation, banner, text message, advertisement, display, audio clip, etc. and may be unnecessary, and possibly even unrelated, to the transaction. In addition, the entertainment interface and the transaction outcome preferably are presented in an integrated fashion so that the transaction outcome forms part of, and is expressed in or during, the entertainment interface. That is, the transaction outcome is needed to complete the entertainment provided by the entertainment interface and the transaction outcome and the entertainment interface create a unified impression on the customer. The transaction outcome may also represent something of great value to the customer, such as the size of a rebate, discount, etc. in addition to the value provided by the entertainment interface itself. The method <b>100</b>, and each of the steps <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an apparatus or system <b>200</b> usable with the method <b>100</b> is illustrated. The apparatus <b>200</b> includes a controller <b>202</b> that may communicate with one or more customer or user devices <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> via a computer, data, or communications network <b>210</b>. The controller <b>202</b> preferably performs the steps <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> of the method <b>100</b> and receives information, inputs, etc. from customers who may be using the customer devices <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. The customer devices <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> preferably allow customers to interact with the controller <b>202</b> and the remainder of the apparatus <b>200</b>. The customer devices <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> may also enable a customer to receive communications from the controller <b>202</b>. If desired, the customer devices <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> may also be connected to or otherwise in communication with other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The computer network <b>210</b> might be the Internet, the World Wide Web, or some other public or private computer or communications network or intranet, as will be described in further detail below. The communications network <b>210</b> is only meant to be generally representative of cable, computer or other communication networks for purposes of elaboration and explanation of the present invention. Thus, other devices, networks, etc. may be connected to the communications network <b>210</b> without departing from the scope of the present invention. The communications network <b>210</b> is also intended to be representative of, and include all or a part of, the Internet, the World Wide Web, and other privately or publicly operated networks. The communications network <b>210</b> can also include other public and/or private wide area networks, local area networks, data communication networks or connections, intranets, routers, satellite links, microwave links, cellular or radio links, fiber optic transmission lines, ISDN lines, T1 lines, DSL, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Now referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the method <b>100</b> and the steps <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> will be discussed in more detail in relation to the system <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As previously discussed above, the method <b>100</b> includes a step <b>102</b> during which one or more transaction interfaces are displayed, presented or otherwise provided to a customer. The transaction interface(s) preferably is/are associated with a transaction being conducted or initiated by, for or under the control of the customer for the purchase, rental, lease, sale, etc. of one or more products or services. A transaction interface may be created, displayed or otherwise provided by the controller <b>202</b>, a customer device, and/or some other device. Different types of transactions may have different transaction interfaces associated with them. For example, a transaction wherein a customer purchases gasoline may have a different transaction interface than a transaction wherein a customer purchases dresses. Presumably, the transaction interface for the gasoline would not request that the customer provide information regarding the customer's dress size, and the transaction interface for the dresses would not request that the customer provide information regarding the customer's preference for &#x201c;premium&#x201d; or &#x201c;regular&#x201d; gasoline.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A transaction may have more than one transaction interface associated with it that are provided or displayed to a customer during the transaction. A transaction interface may have more than one associated display, screen, graphic image, form, banner, check box, menu, fill-in-the-blank area, etc. associated with it that are provided or displayed to a customer, either simultaneously or sequentially during a transaction. The number and order of presentation or delivery of screen displays, banners, menus, graphic images, forms, etc. for a transaction interface may be variable and change during or between transactions. Each transaction interface may request or require that a customer provide one or more transaction inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As the transaction interface or display may comprise or include an order form, check box, fill-in-the-blank form, menu, audio signal, text message, banner, animation, video signal, graphic display, etc., the method <b>100</b> is not limited to any specific type of transaction interface or display or components thereof. For example, a transaction interface displayed or presented during the step <b>102</b> for a transaction wherein a customer is buying products and/or services may comprise or include a list or menu of grocery products, flowers, clothing items, theater tickets, long distance telephone service providers, cars, rental cars, books, software products, gasoline products, airline flights, hotel accommodations, etc. that a customer can select or select from. As a further example, a transaction interface displayed or presented during the step <b>102</b> may comprise or include a display with blocks or areas to be filled in with financial and personal information related to insurance or a mortgage that a customer is attempting to acquire during the transaction. The financial and personal information provided by the customer will form one or more transaction inputs that will be received during the step <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">During the step <b>104</b>, the controller <b>202</b>, a customer device, or some other device may receive one or more transaction inputs from a customer, customer device, etc. Preferably, the transaction inputs will be in response to the transaction interface provided to the customer during the step <b>102</b>, or at least will relate to the same transaction as does the transaction interface provided to the customer during the step <b>102</b>. However, transaction inputs received during the step <b>104</b> may also include information, data, etc. obtained from sources other than the customer or from the customer during previous transactions. Thus, for example, if the transaction interface is associated with a transaction during which a customer is buying grocery items online via a web site, the transaction interface may include one or more screens displayed to a customer with which the customer can select items to be purchased, the quantity to be purchased for each item, etc. The product selection and product quantity information provided by the customer are among the transaction inputs for the transaction. In addition, transaction inputs also may include information or data from a credit agency or other source other than the customer regarding the customer's credit history or credit limit, the quantity of the each of the desired items in inventory, the existence of a discount or rebate provided by one or more manufacturers, the current temperature, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As another example, a transaction interface may be provided to a potential renter during the step <b>102</b> that relates to apartment rentals for a specific building. The potential renter is engaged in a transaction for apartment rental services. The potential renter may provide transaction inputs in response to the presented transaction interface regarding the renter's credit risk, employment, monthly income, number of pets, number of children, rental history, etc. The transaction inputs preferably are received from the potential renter by the controller <b>202</b>, a customer device, or another device during the step <b>104</b>. The controller <b>202</b> may also obtain other transaction inputs, such as the potential renter's credit rating, rental history, criminal record, etc. from sources other than the potential renter. Transaction outputs may include whether or not the renter's application for an apartment rental in the building is approved or denied, the amount of security deposit the renter may have to pay, the specific apartment the renter may be offered, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As a third example, a transaction interface may be provided during the step <b>102</b> to a high school student interested in attending a particular college. Thus, the student is engaged in a transaction for education services. The student may provide transaction inputs such as SAT score, high school grade point average, extra-curricular activities, family finances, educational goals, desired major, etc. The transaction inputs preferably are received from the student by the controller <b>202</b>, a customer device, or another device during the step <b>104</b>. The controller <b>202</b> may also access information such as university admission standards, availability of scholarships, number of admissions already made, etc. to obtain one or more transaction inputs that may be used to determine a transaction outcome for the student, such as whether the student will be accepted at the college, whether a scholarship can be provided to the student, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If desired, the controller <b>202</b>, a customer device, or another device may access or update a transaction database or transaction input database during the step <b>102</b> or the step <b>104</b> to log or store inputs, time, date and other information regarding a transaction being conducted by a customer, the transaction interface presented to the customer during the step <b>102</b>, the transaction inputs received from a customer during the step <b>104</b>, the transaction inputs received from other sources during the step <b>104</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The transaction interface provided during the step <b>102</b> may be provided a short or long time before the transaction inputs are received during the step <b>104</b>. The transaction inputs received during the step <b>104</b> may be received a fixed, random, or variable time after the transaction interface is provided during the step <b>102</b>. Furthermore, the transaction interface provided during the step <b>102</b> may be provided with a different channel or medium of communication (e.g., email, U.S. mail, telephone, facsimile, radio transmission, Federal Express service, online downloading or serving of information, etc.) than the entertainment interface provided during the step <b>108</b>. In addition, the transaction interface provided during the step <b>102</b> may be provided with a different channel or medium of communication than the channel or medium of communication via which transaction inputs are received during the step <b>104</b>. For example, a transaction interface for a transaction may be provided via U.S. mail to a customer, who then some time later (e.g., an hour, day, week, etc.) sends or provides one or more transaction inputs via telephone for the transaction. During the step <b>108</b>, a transaction interface integrated with one or more transaction outputs may be provided to the customer in an animation sent to the customer via email. The step <b>106</b> may occur or be completed, initiated, etc. a short or long time after the completion of the step <b>104</b> or a fixed, random, or variable time later and the step <b>108</b> may occur or be completed, initiated, etc. directly after the completion of the step <b>106</b> or a fixed, random, or variable time later.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">During the step <b>106</b>, one or more transaction outcomes or outputs preferably are computed by the controller <b>202</b>, a customer device, or some other device for the transaction being conducted by the customer. Thus, the transaction outcomes determined during the step <b>106</b> preferably relate to, or are associated with, the transaction interface presented during the step <b>102</b>. A transaction outcome may take many different forms and have many different meanings depending on the context of the transaction being conducted, or participated in, by the customer. For example, a transaction outcome of &#x201c;40&#x201d; may represent that the customer is able to purchase a product for forty dollars, that the customer is purchasing forty of a product, that the customer now has a forty percent chance of winning a prize in a store's lottery, that the customer is getting a forty percent discount off the customer's next purchase, etc. A transaction outcome may also be a text message. For example, transaction outcome of &#x201c;YES&#x201d; may indicate to a customer that an offer provided by the customer during the transaction has been accepted, that the customer will be able to buy a specific product at a specific price, that the customer will be receiving a discount or rebate on the customer's next purchase, that the customer's offer to buy a specified plane ticket at a specified price has been accepted, that the customer will be allowed to rent an apartment, that the customer will be admitted to a certain college, etc. A transaction outcome of &#x201c;NO&#x201d; may indicate just the opposite. A transaction outcome of &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; may indicate that the customer's offer to buy a specific grocery item will be accepted if the customer increases a price offered for the grocery item or if the customer agrees to perform another function or condition, that the customer is on a waiting list for acceptance into an apartment complex, college, etc., that the customer needs to provide additional information, etc. A transaction outcome of &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; might also indicate that the transaction outcome is pending or still being determined, that a transaction outcome close to a customer's desired transaction outcome is possible, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While one or more of the transaction outcomes may also be associated with the transaction inputs received from a customer, customer device, etc. during the step <b>104</b>, a transaction outcome may also be based solely on a transaction input received from a source other than the customer during the step <b>104</b>. For example, a customer may be conducting a transaction during which the customer offers a price bid for a specific car being auctioned off on a web site. The customer's price bid may be considered as a transaction input. In some situations, the web site operator conducting the auction may accept or reject the customer's offer solely base on the customer's price bid. In other situations, the web site operator may request from a third party to receive a status of the customer's credit limit or rating, which may also be considered as a transaction input for the car auction transaction, even though the customer did not provide the transaction input. If the customer's credit limit or rating is too low, the web site operator may reject the customer's stated price bid, the rejection constituting a transaction output, without even considering or taking into account the customer's price bid. Thus, the transaction output is determined solely based on a transaction input that was not received from the customer and the customer provided transaction input was not used to determine the transaction output.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The transaction outcomes or outputs determined during the step <b>106</b> may be determined according to one or more rules, which may include one or more formulas, calculations, algorithms, methods, processes, heuristics, procedures, etc. A rule database may be kept or accessed by the controller <b>202</b>, a customer device, or other device performing the step <b>106</b>. The rule database may store information regarding rules that may be applied to transaction inputs. Different transaction interfaces, transactions, transaction inputs, etc. may use one or more different rules to generate their associated one or more transaction outputs.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">During the step <b>106</b>, the controller <b>202</b>, a customer device or another device may identify or select a rule to apply to one or more of the transaction inputs received during the step <b>102</b> and apply the rule to the transaction inputs to determine one or more transaction outputs. A transaction input might affect both the rule identified and how the identified rule is used, along with the transaction input, to create at least one transaction output. For example, in a transaction being conducted by a customer wherein the controller <b>202</b> determines a discount to be received by a customer purchasing grocery items, transaction inputs A and B, both representing numerical numbers, may be received from the customer during the step <b>104</b>. The transaction input A may represent the number of cases of soda that the customer is willing to purchase during a transaction and the transaction input B may represent the number of bags of potato chips that the customer is willing to purchase during the transaction. If desired, the size of the discount can also be considered as a transaction input received during the step <b>104</b>, even though the discount information did not come from the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this example, when identifying a rule to apply to the transaction inputs to determine a transaction output, for example, the total price of the transaction, one of the following three rules may be applied:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0057">If A&#x3e;B then apply Rule 1, wherein total price pretax equals ($1.69&#xd7;0.90&#xd7;A)+($0.75&#xd7;B),</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0058">if A&#x3c;B then apply Rule 2, wherein total price pretax equals ($1.69&#xd7;A)+($0.75&#xd7;0.90&#xd7;B), or</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0059">if A=B then apply Rule 3, wherein total price pretax equals ($1.69&#xd7;0.95&#xd7;A)+($0.75&#xd7;0.95&#xd7;B),
<br/>
wherein each case of soda has a price of $1.69 and each bag of potato chips has a price of $0.75. In this example transaction, a customer gets a ten percent discount for the one of the two products that the customer is buying the most of, except when Rule 3 applies in which case the customer is buying the same number of both products and a five percent discount is applied to both products, and a rule is selected to compute a final price based on the transaction inputs. The transaction output includes the total price of the cases of soda and bags of potato chips the customer is buying.
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0060">As another example of a transaction for grocery items, a customer may receive a discount for one or more grocery items or products if the customer is willing to try to purchase a third grocery product, the amount of the discount depending on the number of items of the third product that the customer purchases. In addition, assume that transaction inputs C, D and E are received from a customer during the step <b>102</b>. The transaction input C may represent the number of boxes of a new cereal that the customer is willing to purchase during the transaction, and the transaction inputs D and E may represent the number of some other products, for example, laundry detergent and frozen dinners, that the customer is willing to purchase during the transaction. In this example, the higher the number of boxes of cereal the customer purchases, i.e., the higher the value for C, the greater the discount the customer will receive for the laundry detergent and the frozen dinners. The size of the discounts can also be considered as transaction inputs, even though the discount information did not come from the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0061">When identifying a rule to apply to the transaction inputs to determine a transaction output, for example, the total price of the transaction, one of the three following rules may be applied in the example transaction:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0062">If C=0 then apply Rule 1, wherein total price pretax equals ($1.50&#xd7;C)+($2.75&#xd7;D)+($0.75&#xd7;E),</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0063">if C=1 then apply Rule 2, wherein total price pretax equals ($1.50&#xd7;C)+(($2.75&#xd7;D)+($0.75&#xd7;E))&#xd7;0.90, or</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0064">if C&#x3e;1 then apply Rule 3, wherein total price pretax equals ($1.50&#xd7;C)+(($2.75&#xd7;D)+($0.70&#xd7;E))&#xd7;0.85,
<br/>
wherein each box of cereal has a price of $1.50, each box of laundry detergent has a price of $2.75, and each frozen dinner has a price of $0.75. In this example transaction, the customer gets different prices for the laundry detergent and the frozen dinners depending on the number of boxes of new cereal that the customer purchases. However, the price for each box of cereal remains constant.
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">As previously discussed above, the identification or selection of which rule to apply may also depend on or use information or transaction inputs not provided by a customer. For example, during a transaction for a product, different rules may apply for different levels of available inventory, the status of a customer as new customer, frequent customer, etc., whether the product is soon to expire or otherwise become unsellable or unusable, whether the transaction is occurring during a special event or promotion, such as a sale, a birthday, etc., the day of the week or year, the time of day, the location of the customer conducting the transaction, etc. In some embodiments, multiple rules may be selected or used to create or determine one or more transaction outputs during the step <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">During the step <b>108</b>, the controller <b>202</b>, a customer device, or some other device preferably provides, sends, or otherwise makes available one or more transaction outcomes or outputs to the customer, or to some other person or device designated by the customer, the controller <b>202</b>, etc., via an entertainment interface such that the transaction outcomes are integrated into the entertainment interface. The term &#x201c;entertainment interface&#x201d; should be interpreted broadly and is not limited to games of amusement, information presentation, flashy visual or audible presentations, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067">Preferably, the entertainment interface provided during the step <b>108</b> is unnecessary for the transaction and/or how the transaction outcome is determined. In addition, the entertainment interface preferably is unrelated to the transaction and is integrated with the presentation or delivery of one or more transaction outputs. An &#x201c;unnecessary&#x201d; entertainment interface includes interfaces that are not needed to conduct the transaction or to provide a transaction output to a customer. For example, the car driving and race simulation entertainment interface described above is not needed to conduct a transaction for selling insurance, grocery items, gasoline, airline tickets, or other products or services to a customer. Rather, the entertainment interface provides an ancillary and separate impression for the customer with regard to a transaction interface, thereby enhancing the value of the entertainment interface itself. Furthermore, the car driving and race simulation entertainment interface is completely unrelated to the subject matter or context of the transactions. While graphics, animations, etc. may be used during a transaction or as part of a transaction interface, the entertainment interface preferably is separate and distinct from those graphics, animations, etc. such that a clear end to the transaction interface and a clear start to the entertainment interface is created. Moreover, the entertainment interface and the transaction interface preferably create separate and distinct impressions to or for a customer. In some embodiments, the entertainment interface may relate to a transaction being conducted by a customer. For example, a customer participating in a transaction during which the customer is buying golf clubs receives a golf related entertainment interface.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">An integrated entertainment interface and one or more transaction outputs preferably is more than just simultaneous appearance on a display of the entertainment interface and the one or more transaction outputs. That is, an integrated entertainment interface and one or more transaction outputs preferably creates a singular or unitary impression and appearance to a customer such that the entertainment or diversion presented by the entertainment interface is not complete without the presentation or use of, or relationship to, one or more transaction outputs. Thus, while the transaction outputs may be presented in isolation, the entertainment interface preferably cannot be presented separately from the transaction outputs. A transaction output may affect the behavior, operation, and/or look of an entertainment interface. By being unnecessary or unrelated to a transaction, or to the method or rule for determining a transaction output, an entertainment interface presents a clearer impression and appearance to a customer that the entertainment is something extra of value being provided to the customer during the transaction. As a result, the entertainment provided via the entertainment interface becomes a valuable commodity to the customer in its own right, even if the transaction is not completed for any reason. Furthermore, the entertainment may also help distance or reduce any negativity towards a merchant or other operator of the method <b>100</b> if the customer's transaction is not completed, if the customer's transaction offer is not accepted, if the transaction takes a significant amount of time to complete, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">The entertainment interface presented or provided during the step <b>108</b> can be created or modified dynamically or retrieved from a database as needed. In some embodiments, a software script may be used to generate, display and modify the entertainment interface. In addition, the presentation or display of an entertainment interface may require a fixed or variable time to complete. Preferably, the entertainment interface provides an animation or some other changing format, picture, video, etc. so that it is not a static and unchanging presentation of a graphic, image or text message.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">The entertainment interface presented or provided during the step <b>108</b> may appear to be a game of luck or skill, but the outcome of the game preferably will be interpreted as or with a transaction output. For example, an entertainment interface presented during the step <b>108</b> to a customer conducting a transaction may include a car driving game that a customer may play via a customer device. The car driving game is a game of skill in that the customer must control a virtual car and drive it along a race track towards a finish line. The customer competes against a computer controlled car for first place. Such an entertainment interface may be used when a customer submits a price, such as in an auction, for a product or service and the controller <b>202</b> determines whether or not to accept the customer's submitted price. If the transaction is not completed or if the customer's price is rejected as a result of the transaction inputs received during the step <b>104</b>, e.g., the customer submitted too low a price for a product and the transaction output is a rejection by the controller <b>202</b> of the customer's submitted price, the outcome of the game may be that the customer loses the car race. For example, regardless of how skilled the customer is at the game, the play level of the computer may be increased as necessary in order for the computer to beat the customer at the game. Alternatively, if the transaction is completed or approved as a result of the transaction inputs received during the step <b>104</b>, e.g., the customer submitted an acceptable price for the product and the transaction output is an acceptance by the controller <b>202</b> of the customer's submitted price, the outcome of the game may be that the customer wins the car race. Thus, regardless of how skilled the customer is at the game, the play level of the computer may be decreased as necessary in order for the customer to beat the computer at the game.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0071">Other examples of an entertainment interface include an entertainment interface for displaying a transaction output for an auction or other transaction wherein the entertainment interface displays a transaction output of &#x201c;YES&#x201d; or an acceptance or approval of transaction inputs or a customer's transaction offer. Such entertainment interfaces include an illustration of a golf ball going into a hole, an illustration of a basketball going into a basketball hoop, an illustration of a football field goal attempt being successfully completed, etc. Note that the words or phrases &#x201c;YES,&#x201d; &#x201c;OFFER ACCEPTED,&#x201d; etc. may, in some embodiments, not be used in the entertainment interface as a successful completion of the transaction, acceptance of the customer's transaction offer or inputs, as indicated as a transaction output exemplified by the illustration of the golf ball going into a hole, the illustration of the basketball going into the basketball hoop, and the illustration of the football field goal attempt being successfully completed. Therefore, the positive or affirmative transaction output is integrated into the entertainment interface such that the entertainment provided via the entertainment interface is not completed without the presentation or display of the representation of the transaction output.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0072">Other examples of an entertainment interface for an auction or other transaction wherein the entertainment interface displays a transaction output of &#x201c;NO&#x201d; or a rejection or non acceptance of transaction inputs or transaction offer include an illustration of a golf ball not going into a hole, an illustration of a basketball not going into a basketball hoop, an illustration of a football field goal attempt not being successfully completed, etc. Note that the words or phrases &#x201c;NO,&#x201d; &#x201c;OFFER REJECTED,&#x201d; etc. may, in some embodiments, not be used in the entertainment interface as an unsuccessful completion of the transaction, acceptance of the customer's transaction offer or inputs, etc. is indicated as a transaction output exemplified by the illustration of the golf ball not going into a hole, the illustration of the basketball not going into the basketball hoop, and the illustration of the football field goal attempt not being successfully completed. Therefore, the negative transaction output is integrated into the entertainment interface such that the entertainment provided via the entertainment interface is not completed without the presentation or display of the representation of the transaction output.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0073">Examples of an entertainment interface for an auction or other transaction wherein the entertainment interface displays a transaction output of &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; or a possible acceptance of transaction inputs or a customer's transaction offer include an illustration of a golf ball moving towards a hole but not yet going into the hole, an illustration of a basketball going toward the basketball hoop but not yet going into the basketball hoop, an illustration of a football field goal attempt being partially completed with the final outcome still in doubt, etc. As in the previous examples, the transaction output is integrated into the entertainment interface.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074">As illustrated in the previous examples, a transaction output may be presented to a customer during the step <b>108</b> in such a way that the customer does not realize or know that the transaction output has already been determined prior to the presentation of the entertainment interface or how the transaction output was determined. Furthermore, in some embodiments, a transaction output may appear to a customer to have been determined randomly, according or relative to the customer's skill at a game presented as part of an entertainment during the step <b>108</b>, or in accordance with a rule other than the rule or procedure actually used during the step <b>106</b> to determine the transaction outcome. As another example, a customer bidding for groceries or otherwise attempting to buy groceries via a web site may be presented with a slot machine reel simulation as an entertainment interface, the outcome of which lets the customer know if the customer's order or offer for grocery items (i.e., the transaction inputs) has been accepted or rejected, the acceptance or rejection being a transaction output. The customer may be asked to &#x201c;start the slot machine reels spinning when ready&#x201d; and/or to &#x201c;stop the slot machine reels from spinning when desired&#x201d; as a way of incorporating action or activity by the customer into the entertainment interface, thereby giving the customer a feeling of participation in the determination of the transaction output or allowing the customer to control initiation, progression and/or completion or the entertainment interface or any stage of the entertainment interface. In fact, the acceptance or rejection (i.e., the transaction output) of the customer's offer or order (i.e., the transaction input) preferably has previously been determined during the step <b>106</b> according to one or more specific rules, which is likely non-random and unrelated to slot machine operation, and the transaction outcome presented via the slot machine simulation preferably follows or accords with the transaction outcome determined during the step <b>106</b>. Thus, the outcome of the entertainment interface, i.e., the result of the slot machine reel simulation, reflects and incorporates the transaction output determined during the step <b>106</b> and the transaction output is integrated into the entertainment interface such that the entertainment provided by the entertainment interface is not completed until the transaction output represented in the entertainment interface is displayed or provided to the customer during the step <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075">As illustrated in the previous examples, the entertainment interface provided during the step <b>108</b> may allow a customer to be passive and merely watch the entertainment interface, such as in the slot machine simulation example previously discussed above where a customer does nothing specific to initiate starting or stopping of the spinning of the simulated slot machine's reels. Alternatively, the entertainment interface provided during the step <b>108</b> may allow a customer to actively participate at one or more points, such as in the slot machine simulation where a customer hits a button, clicks on a graphic or icon, etc. to initiate spinning of the slot machine's reels and/or to stop spinning of the slot machine's reels. As a further alternative, the entertainment interface provided during the step <b>108</b> may allow a customer to actively and continuously participate throughout some or all of the entertainment provided via the entertainment interface, such as in the car driving example entertainment interface previous discussed above. In some embodiments, a customer may be offered the opportunity to select the type of entertainment interface to be used during the step <b>108</b> and the level of the customer's involvement or number of customer actions required in the entertainment interface.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0076">In some embodiments, a transaction input can affect the entertainment interface. For example, if a customer offers a large amount of money for a product during a transaction where customers bid on products, such as in an auction, and the controller <b>202</b> accepts the offer, a transaction output indicating an acceptance of the customer's offer may be embodied as an easy basketball lay-up shot, as opposed to a more difficult three-point shot, that falls right into basketball hoop. In contrast, if the customer offers a smaller amount of money for the product during the transaction, and the controller <b>202</b> accepts the offer, a transaction output indicating an acceptance of the customer's offer may be embodied as a difficult three-point shot, that rolls around the basket rim before falling into the basketball hoop. In addition, in order to convince or motivate the customer to submit an even higher price in the future, or to otherwise indicate that the customer is &#x201c;pushing his luck,&#x201d; the basketball may just barely fall into the basketball hoop. The customer may be given a chance to change a low offer or a transaction input by, for example, showing a basketball player shooting from half-court if the customer makes the change or indicates a willingness to make the change. The transaction output, i.e., the acceptance of the customer's offer, preferably is integrated into the entertainment interface as represented by the basketball falling or going into the basketball hoop. Furthermore, the entertainment provided by the entertainment interface would not be complete without an indication as to whether the basketball would or would not fall or go into the basketball hoop.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0077">In some embodiments, a transaction input received during the step <b>104</b>, but relating to an offer or input from someone else, could affect the entertainment interface presented to a customer. For example, one way to encourage a more conservative offer from a customer the next time that the customer submits a transaction input or offer for a product during a transaction is to include in the entertainment interface representations of other customers who have previously provided or who are currently providing transaction inputs or offers. For example, the entertainment interface may create a basketball type simulation wherein a customer sees himself or herself waiting in line to shoot a three point shot, and each customer in front of the customer, i.e., the other customers, is missing the three point shot as a result of one or more of their transaction inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0078">In some embodiments, something other than a transaction input may affect the selection or operation of an entertainment interface presented or provided during the step <b>108</b>. For example, in the slot machine simulation previously discussed above, a customer may have to mouse click on a simulated slot machine reel in order for the simulated slot machine reel to stop spinning and deliver a transaction outcome embodied as a slot machine outcome. Alternatively, the customer may have to mouse click for a ping-pong ball to be ejected out of a jar, the color of the ping-pong ball indicating the transaction output. In such scenarios, the customer may feel like he or she has controlled influenced the offer output, even though he or she has not. As another example, if a customer initiating a transaction has previously conducted five similar transactions, the entertainment interface provided to the customer during the step <b>108</b> may be altered or changed to maintain or further develop the customer's interest in or commitment to conducting additional transactions.

<p id="p-0112" num="0117">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-20</figref>, an exemplary implementation or embodiment of the method <b>100</b> will now be discussed. The exemplary implementation or embodiment is directed to online transactions wherein a customer or user accesses a web site or web server to purchase gasoline. In addition, the transaction is implemented as a &#x201c;name your own price&#x201d; or conditional purchase offer transaction wherein the customer gets to provide a price quote or bid for gasoline and a list of one or more gas stations where the customer will be willing to purchase the gasoline for the customer's price bid. In such transactions, the customer is generally willing to exchange flexibility as to where the customer will purchase the gasoline and the brand of gasoline for a lower price for the gasoline. For example, a customer may state or otherwise indicate that the customer is willing to pay up to $1.55 a gallon for gas and that the customer is willing to purchase the gasoline at any one of three indicated gas stations for the $1.55 a gallon price. A customer's price bid or offer and list of acceptable gasoline stations are transaction inputs for the transaction. Other possible transaction inputs that may be provided by a customer include desired gasoline product description (e.g., regular, premium, high octane, etc.), the amount of gasoline in gallons, tank size, number of tanks of gasoline, etc. that the customer desires to purchase, and whether the customer will be using tokens, coupons, or other promotional items as part of the customer's payment for the gasoline. These transaction inputs preferably will be provided by the customer and received by a controller, customer device, or some other device during the step <b>104</b>. Transaction inputs received during the step <b>104</b> from sources other than the customer may include the gasoline inventory of the customer's listed acceptable gas stations, any rebate offers or discounts provided directly by the customer's listed acceptable gas stations, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0118">These and additional transaction inputs for this example implementation of the method <b>100</b> will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0119">Upon receipt of the transaction inputs for the gasoline during the step <b>104</b>, a controller, customer device, or some other device preferably will determine if the customer's price offer or bid is acceptable during the step <b>106</b>. That is, a controller, customer device, or some other device will determine if the customer can purchase the customer's desired amount of gasoline at the customer's desired price at one or more of the customer's stated acceptable gas station locations. The determined acceptance or rejection will constitute a transaction output. In addition, if the customer's offer is accepted and one of the customer's indicated acceptable gas stations is identified or selected for the customer during the step <b>106</b>, such indication or selection also is a transaction output. These and additional transaction outputs for this example implementation of the method <b>100</b> will be discussed in further detail below.</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0121">First referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, another representative controller <b>750</b> usable with the method <b>100</b> and in the system <b>200</b> is illustrated. The controller <b>750</b> includes the processor or CPU <b>250</b>, communication port <b>252</b>, clock <b>254</b>, output device <b>256</b>, input device <b>258</b>, memory or data storage device <b>260</b>, and the control program <b>262</b> previously described above. In addition, the controller <b>750</b> includes a transaction input database <b>752</b>, customer database <b>754</b>, rule database <b>756</b>, product/service database <b>758</b>, a transaction database <b>760</b> and an entertainment interface or presentation database <b>274</b> that work in a manner similar to the databases described above. In addition, the controller <b>750</b> includes a subsidy database <b>762</b> which is a type of transaction input database. Each of the databases <b>752</b>, <b>754</b>, <b>756</b>, <b>758</b> and <b>762</b> will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0122">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a tabular representation of a possible implementation of, or data structure for, the transaction input database <b>252</b> is illustrated. For purposes of this example implementation of the method <b>100</b>, the transaction inputs from a customer include a type of gasoline, a price bid or offer, whether or not a token is used as part of the customer's payment, a list of gas stations acceptable to the customer to purchase the gasoline, the gas tank size of the customer's vehicle and the desired number of gas tank fills that the customer desires to purchase. Therefore, the transaction input database <b>752</b> includes a transaction/offer identifier field <b>780</b> to identify specific customer transactions, a product identifier field <b>782</b> to identify specific gasoline products selected by customers, a price bid or offer field <b>784</b> to identify the desired price bids made by customers for the gasoline products identified in the field <b>782</b>, a token use field <b>786</b> to identify if a token is used as part of the payment made by a customer for the gasoline products identified in the field <b>782</b>, an acceptable gas stations field <b>788</b> that lists one or more gas stations acceptable to the customer or desired by the customer for the gasoline products identified in the field <b>780</b>, a vehicle tank size field <b>790</b>, and a number of tanks of gas field <b>792</b> for which customers desire to purchase the products identified in the field <b>782</b> for the price specified in the field <b>784</b>. The transaction inputs will be received from customers by the controller <b>750</b>, a customer device, or some other device during one or more implementations of the step <b>104</b> in response to a transaction interface provided to the customers during one or more implementations of the step <b>102</b> that requests or requires that the customer provide the transaction inputs. All of the transaction inputs from a customer that are received during the step <b>104</b> can be deemed to be the customer's transaction offer.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0123">The transaction input database field <b>752</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> includes information for three transactions <b>794</b>, <b>796</b>, <b>798</b> identified by the transaction identifiers &#x201c;T-31292,&#x201d; &#x201c;T-31416&#x201d; and &#x201c;T-31738,&#x201d; respectively. The transaction inputs for the transaction &#x201c;T-31292&#x201d; indicate that a customer desires to purchase &#x201c;89 OCTANE GRADE GASOLINE&#x201d; for $1.53 a gallon at either one of the two gas stations identified in the field <b>788</b>. Furthermore, the customer desires to purchase fifty tanks of gasoline for his or her vehicle, which contains a twelve gallon tank. As indicated by the entry in the field <b>786</b> for the transaction identified as &#x201c;T-31292,&#x201d; the customer will not be using a token, coupon, or other promotional item as part of payment for the gasoline. The transaction inputs for the transaction &#x201c;T-31738&#x201d; indicate that a customer desires to purchase &#x201c;91 OCTANE GRADE GASOLINE&#x201d; for $1.25 a gallon at either one of the two gas stations identified in the field <b>788</b>. Furthermore, the customer desires to purchase one tank of gasoline for his or her vehicle, which contains a twelve gallon tank.

<p id="p-0119" num="0124">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a tabular representation of a possible implementation of, or data structure for, the subsidy database <b>762</b> is illustrated. For purposes of this example implementation of the method <b>100</b>, the transaction inputs include information as to whether a subsidy exists that can be used to provide a lower price for gasoline sold to customers or to augment a customers price bid provided by the customer as a transaction input. For example, if a customer provides a price bid of $1.35 per gallon as a transaction input and a subsidy exists that would allow the customer's effective price bid to be increased by up to ten cents per gallon, the customer's effective price bid is $1.45 per gallon, thereby increasing the chance that the customer's transaction offer will be accepted.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0125">The subsidy database <b>762</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> includes information for three subsidies <b>800</b>, <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> being provided by &#x201c;VISA,&#x201d; &#x201c;MOBIL&#x201d; and &#x201c;TIME,&#x201d; respectively, as identified in the subsidy identifier or name field <b>806</b>.

More specifically, if a customer will apply for a credit card and if the gap between the customer's price bid per gallon of gasoline and the price for which the gasoline can be sold is less than ten cents, a subsidy will be provided to the customer equal to the gap between the customer's price bid per gallon of gasoline and the price for which the gasoline can be sold. The remaining amount of subsidy money is $40,324.50.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0127">As illustrated by the entries in the fields <b>808</b>, <b>810</b>, <b>812</b> for the &#x201c;TIME&#x201d; subsidy <b>804</b>, a subsidy will be provided if a customer applies for a subscription to Time Magazine under certain conditions. More specifically, if a customer applies for a subscription to Time Magazine and if the gap between the customer's price bid per gallon of gasoline and the price for which the gasoline can actually be sold is less than fifteen cents but greater than or equal to ten cents, a subsidy will be provided to the customer equal to the gap between the customer's price bid per gallon of gasoline and the price for which the gasoline can be sold. The remaining amount of subsidy money is $54,312.12.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0128">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a tabular representation of a possible implementation of, or data structure for, the customer database <b>754</b> is illustrated. The customer database <b>754</b> includes information for three customers <b>820</b>, <b>822</b>, <b>824</b> identified as &#x201c;ANDY,&#x201d; &#x201c;SCOTT&#x201d; and &#x201c;JAMES,&#x201d; respectively in a customer identifier field <b>826</b>. The customer database <b>754</b> includes a field <b>828</b> which contains information regarding how many times the customers identified in the field <b>826</b> have visited the web site or server conducting the gasoline purchase transaction, a dollar value to date field <b>830</b> which contains information regarding how much money the customers identified in the field <b>826</b> have spent on gasoline purchase transactions, a financial account identifier field <b>834</b> which contains credit card, debit card, or other financial account information for the customers identified in the field <b>826</b>, a token balance field <b>836</b> which contains information regarding how many tokens are possessed or usable by each customer identified in the field <b>826</b>, and a target brand identifiers field <b>838</b> which contains information regarding brand preferences of customers, indications of the product brands previously supplied to customers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0129">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a tabular representation of a possible implementation of, or data structure for, the rule database <b>756</b> is illustrated. The rule database <b>756</b> includes information for three rules <b>840</b>, <b>842</b>, <b>844</b> as described in a condition field <b>846</b> and a result field <b>848</b>. As previously discussed above, one or more rules preferably are applied during the step <b>106</b> to the transaction inputs received during the step <b>104</b> to create or determine one or more transaction outputs.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0130">As illustrated by the information in the fields <b>846</b> and <b>848</b> for the rule <b>840</b>, an offer may be made to a customer by a controller during a transaction may allow the customer to effectively increase the customer's bid price per gallon of gasoline or to otherwise increase the chances of the customer's transaction offer being accepted. For example, in situations where a Visa credit card cross subsidy has been selected for potential offer to a customer and the customer is trying to purchase &#x201c;89 OCTANE GRADE GAS&#x201d; during a transaction, if the difference between the customer's price bid per gallon of gasoline and the internal price hurdle for the gasoline is zero or less, i.e., the customer's price bid meets or exceeds the internal price hurdle for the gasoline, the customer's transaction offer is accepted. If, on the other hand, the difference between the customer's price bid per gallon of gasoline and the internal price hurdle for the gasoline is greater than zero but less than ten cents per gallon, i.e., the customer's price bid is less than the internal price hurdle for the gasoline but is not more than ten cents less, the customer will be offered an opportunity to accept the Visa credit card cross subsidy. Therefore, if the customer accepts the Visa credit card cross subsidy and applies for a credit card, the customer's transaction offer will be accepted. If, however, the customer does not accept the Visa credit card cross subsidy, the customer's transaction will not be accepted. In the situation where the difference between the customer's price bid per gallon of gasoline and the internal price hurdle for the gasoline is greater than ten cents per gallon, the customer's transaction offer is rejected. The determination of whether to offer the Visa credit cross subsidy of rule <b>840</b>, the Mobil cross subsidy of rule <b>842</b>, or the Time Magazine cross subsidy of rule <b>844</b> may be determined by another rule, a transaction input, etc. The concept, operation and use of cross subsidies are described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/274,281 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING CROSS-BENEFITS VIA A CENTRAL AUTHORITY, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/282,747, entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING CROSS-BENEFITS BASED ON A CUSTOMER ACTIVITY, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0131">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a tabular representation of a possible implementation of, or data structure for, the product/service database <b>758</b> is illustrated. The product/service database <b>758</b> includes information for three products <b>860</b>, <b>862</b>, <b>864</b> identified as &#x201c;89 OCTANE GRADE GASOLINE,&#x201d; &#x201c;89 OCTANE GRADE GASOLINE&#x201d; and &#x201c;91 OCTANE GRADE GASOLINE,&#x201d; respectively, in the product identifier field <b>866</b>. The product/service database <b>758</b> also includes a gas station field <b>868</b> listing or describing one or more gas stations or other locations at which the gasoline products listed in the field <b>866</b> may be purchased or found. In addition, the product/service database <b>758</b> includes an internal price hurdle or lowest acceptable price field <b>870</b> which contains information regarding the lowest price at which the gasoline products identified in the field <b>866</b> can be purchased at the gas stations listed or described in the field <b>868</b>. An internal price hurdle or lowest acceptable price for a product may be set by a manufacturer, a supplier, a specific retailer, controller, customer device, etc. and may vary between manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0132">As a further description of the operation and use of the controller <b>750</b> and the databases <b>752</b>, <b>754</b>, <b>756</b>, <b>758</b> and <b>762</b>, assume that a customer has provided the transaction inputs in the transaction input database for the transaction identified as &#x201c;312&#x201d; in the transaction database <b>752</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Therefore, the customer is offering to pay $1.53 a gallon for &#x201c;89 OCTANE GRADE GAS&#x201d; gasoline at a Mobil gas station and a Shell gas station. As shown in the product database <b>758</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, &#x201c;89 OCTANE GRADE GAS&#x201d; is available at both of customer's desired gas stations. However, the internal price hurdle or lowest acceptable price of $1.56 per gallon of &#x201c;89 OCTANE GRADE GAS&#x201d; at both gas stations is three cents higher than the customer is willing to pay. In order to enable the customer to purchase the customer's desired gasoline at the customer's desired price at the customer's desired location, the controller <b>750</b> may determine if a subsidy can be used to lower the effective internal price hurdle of the gasoline or to raise the effective price bid made by the customer. For example, a reference to the subsidy database <b>762</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows that a Visa cross subsidy can be used or applied if the gasoline is not purchased at a Mobil gas station and the customer is willing to apply for a Visa credit card or a Mobil cross subsidy which can be used or applied if the gasoline is purchased at a Mobil gas station and the customer is willing to purchase a Mobil speed pass. Thus, by using either one of these cross subsidies, the customer's effective price bid can be raised three cents to $1.56 to meet the internal price hurdle for the &#x201c;89 OCTANE GRADE GAS&#x201d; that the customer desires to purchase. The controller <b>750</b> can decide which of the cross subsidies to offer the customer and the customer's response becomes a transaction input. The selection between available subsidies may be based on a variety of factors, including size of remaining subsidy balance, customer preference, etc. If the customer is &#x201c;Andy&#x201d; as indicated in the customer database <b>754</b>, the customer is known to prefer &#x201c;SHELL&#x201d; gasoline or it is otherwise desired or economical to provide &#x201c;SHELL&#x201d; gasoline to the customer (e.g., perhaps the customer obtained &#x201c;SHELL&#x201d; gasoline on a previous transaction and it is desired to provide consistent transaction results to customers or to attempt to lock in a brand preference with the customer), therefore the Visa cross subsidy may be chosen by the controller <b>750</b> to be offered to the customer. If the customer is &#x201c;James&#x201d; as indicated in the customer database <b>754</b>, the customer is known to prefer &#x201c;MOBIL&#x201d; gasoline or it is otherwise desired or economical to provide &#x201c;MOBIL&#x201d; gasoline to the customer, therefore the Mobil cross subsidy may be chosen by the controller <b>750</b> to be offered to the customer. The determination of an acceptance of the customer's transaction offer is determined during the step <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0133">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a tabular representation of a possible implementation of, or data structure for, the transaction database <b>760</b> is illustrated. The transaction database <b>760</b> includes information for three users or customers <b>880</b>, <b>882</b>, <b>884</b> identified as &#x201c;ANDY,&#x201d; &#x201c;SCOTT&#x201d; and &#x201c;JAMES&#x201d; in a customer identifier field <b>886</b>, each of which has initiated, conducted or otherwise participated in a transaction identified as &#x201c;T-31214,&#x201d; &#x201c;T-76553&#x201d; and &#x201c;T-78924,&#x201d; respectively, in a transaction identifier field <b>888</b>. In addition, each of the three transactions &#x201c;T-31214,&#x201d; &#x201c;T-76553&#x201d; and &#x201c;T-78924,&#x201d; has at least one transaction output indicated in a transaction outputs field <b>890</b> and a corresponding entertainment interface indicated in an entertainment interface field <b>892</b>. For example, the customer &#x201c;ANDY&#x201d; is associated with the transaction &#x201c;T-31214&#x201d; for which a &#x201c;YES&#x201d; transaction output and a &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; transaction output have been determined during the step <b>106</b>. During the step <b>108</b>, the two transaction outputs &#x201c;YES&#x201d; and &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; will be integrated into, or provided to the customer &#x201c;ANDY&#x201d; via an entertainment interface using or including two simulated slot machine reels, one reel of which stop on &#x201c;YES&#x201d; and the other reel of which will stop on &#x201c;MAYBE.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0134">As shown by this example, a transaction interface is provided or otherwise presented to a customer during the step <b>102</b>, one or more transaction inputs are received from the customer during the step <b>104</b>, and one or more transaction outputs are determined during the step <b>106</b>. During the step <b>108</b>, the transaction output(s) preferably are presented to the customer via an entertainment interface. For example, a transaction output for the gasoline purchase described above may be presented in the form of a simulated slot machine reel, the possible transaction outcomes provided on the reel being &#x201c;YES,&#x201d; &#x201c;NO&#x201d; and &#x201c;MAYBE,&#x201d; as illustrated by the three positions <b>900</b>, <b>902</b>, <b>904</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> of the simulated slot machine reel. Thus, the simulated slot machine reel is or comprises at least part of the entertainment interface provided during the step <b>108</b> and the stopping of the simulated slot machine reel on &#x201c;YES,&#x201d; &#x201c;NO&#x201d; or &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; provides the transaction outcome for the transaction in accordance with the transaction outcome determined during the step <b>106</b>. Therefore, the presentation or delivery of the transaction outcome is integrated into, or provided in conjunction with, the entertainment interface such that the entertainment provided via the entertainment interface is not completed until the presentation or display of the transaction outcome. In addition, while the transaction outcome preferably is determined during the step <b>106</b> and prior to the presentation or completion of the entertainment interface during the step <b>108</b>, a customer viewing the entertainment interface may believe that the transaction outcome has not been determined until the entertainment interface is completed or that the transaction outcome has been determined randomly or in accordance with a rule different than the actual rule(s) applied during the step <b>106</b> to determine the transaction outcome. Thus, should the customer received a negative or undesired transaction outcome, the customer may not associate the transaction outcome with or otherwise blame the controller <b>750</b> or the entity implementing the method <b>100</b> or the apparatus <b>200</b>. The duration of the entertainment interface may be fixed, random, or variable depending on one or more transaction inputs, one or more transaction outputs, etc. A transaction output of &#x201c;YES&#x201d; may indicate that a transaction input or transaction offer received during the step <b>102</b> have been accepted or are acceptable while a transaction output of &#x201c;NO&#x201d; may indicate that transaction inputs or transaction offers received during the step <b>104</b> have not been accepted or are not acceptable. A transaction output of &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; may indicate that transaction inputs or transaction offers received during the step <b>104</b> might be accepted if the customer accepted a cross subsidy offer, such as the Visa credit card offer, Mobil speed pass offer, or subscription to Time Magazine offer, or increased his or her price bid for the gasoline.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0135">In embodiments or transactions where multiple transaction outputs may occur, a simulated slot machine reel or reels may be used during or as part of an entertainment interface to indicate multiple &#x201c;YES,&#x201d; &#x201c;NO&#x201d; or &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; transaction outputs, such as in the entertainment interface or presentation <b>920</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> for a transaction for grocery items where a customer is trying to purchase trash bags, soda, and detergent. The transaction outputs in the entertainment interface <b>920</b> show that the customer's transaction offer has been accepted for trash bags; rejected for soda, and is a &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; for detergent. The transaction output of &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; may indicate that a customer's transaction offer for detergent might be accepted if the customer accepted a cross subsidy offer or increased his or her price bid for the detergent. Thus, the presentation or delivery of the transaction outcomes is integrated into or with the presentation or delivery of the entertainment interface.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0136">As another example of embodiments or transactions where multiple transaction outputs may occur or be possible, a golf related entertainment interface may be used to indicate a rejection of a transaction offer, an acceptance of a transaction offer, or a situation where the transaction output is &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; or unclear, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. For example, if a transaction output of &#x201c;NO&#x201d; or a rejection of transaction offer is determined during the step <b>106</b>, such transaction output may be indicated by showing a golf ball roll by a hole without going in, as illustrated in golf ball putting scenario <b>940</b>. Alternatively, if a transaction output of &#x201c;MAYBE&#x201d; is determined during the step <b>106</b>, such transaction output may be indicated by showing a golf ball rolling towards a hole but not reaching the hole, as illustrated in golf ball putting scenario <b>942</b>. Further, if a transaction output of &#x201c;YES&#x201d; or an acceptance of transaction offer is determined during the step <b>106</b>, such transaction output may be indicated by showing a golf ball rolling into a hole, as illustrated in golf ball putting scenario <b>944</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0137">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a second embodiment <b>950</b> of a method in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. The method <b>950</b> includes the steps <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> as previously discussed above. In addition, the method <b>950</b> includes a step <b>952</b> during which one or more rules are identified or selected to apply to one or more of the transaction inputs received during the step <b>104</b> and which will be used, along with one or more of the transaction inputs to determine one or more transaction outcomes during the step <b>106</b>. The method <b>950</b> also includes a step <b>954</b> during which one or more entertainment interfaces are identified or selected, such as one of the entertainment interfaces from the entertainment interface database <b>274</b> previously described above. If desired, the steps <b>106</b> and <b>954</b> may be performed in the opposite order or combined as single step. During steps <b>956</b> and <b>958</b>, the entertainment interface(s) selected during the step <b>954</b> and the transaction outcome(s) determined during the step <b>106</b> are presented or otherwise provided, in a manner similar to the step <b>108</b> previously described above, preferably in a manner such that the entertainment interface and transaction outputs are provided in an integrated manner. If desired, the steps <b>956</b> and <b>958</b> can be combined or otherwise treated as a single step so that the entertainment interface(s) selected during the step <b>954</b> and the transaction outcome(s) determined during the step <b>106</b> may be presented simultaneously or in an integrated manner.</p>
