<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to computer software, and more particularly to graphical tools for allowing a user to input information.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many software applications require, as input, one or more ranges of numbers. Merely by way of example, in a business application (such as an electronic commerce application, a financial application, enterprise resource planning (&#x201c;ERP&#x201d;) application, customer relationship management (&#x201c;CRM&#x201d;) application, supply chain management application, and/or the like), a set of business rules might be used to perform actions on business records according to the characteristics of the records. Different rules, then, might apply to different records, depending on the values of various data elements in those records. In particular, one business rule might apply to a set of records having a data element with a value that falls within a first range, while a different business rule might apply to records having data element with a value that falls within a second range.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hence, in business software (as well as other software), the application of various rules or operations to data often requires the user to define a variable whose values consist of a set of ranges (upon which the rule or operation is dependent). For example, if a wine merchant developed a set of rules to automatically apply discounts to online purchases, one of the many variables that might be in that ruleset could depend on the quantity of the purchase, or number of bottles ordered. The values for QUANTITY, then, and the corresponding discounts, might include the following: a QUANTITY greater than 0 and less than 8 has no discount, a QUANTITY greater than or equal to 8 and less than 12 has a 2% discount, a QUANTITY equal to 12 has a 5% discount, a QUANTITY greater than 12 and less than 24 has an 8% discount and a QUANTITY greater than or equal to 24 has a 10% discount.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An important feature of the set of ranges in the example above is that it is continuous: It accounts for all nonzero values. Range continuity for a given variable is critical in the area of business rules because it enables the ruleset to respond to any occurrence of that variable. Without continuity, if the ruleset encounters values that are not defined in the variable's set of ranges, then an error will occur, thus breaking the ruleset. Consider, for example, a case in which, instead of the rules above, the wine merchant's e-commerce application had the following rules: a QUANTITY greater than 0 and less than 8 has no discount, a QUANTITY greater than 10 and less than 12 has a 2% discount, a QUANTITY equal to 12 has a 5% discount, a QUANTITY greater than 12 and less than 24 has an 8% discount, and a QUANTITY greater than or equal to 24 has a 10% discount. This set of ranges leaves a gap between 8 and 10, breaking the continuity of the ruleset; as a result, if a customer orders, say, 9 bottles of wine, the system will not know how to respond.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Translating the ranges for a variable into something that can be read by computers generally requires a user to enter the relevant values into the computer using mathematical comparison symbols (or other comparison operators). The following are examples of methods that individuals might use to rewrite the ranges defining QUANTITY for the first example above:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0022">Unfortunately, using such text-based methods to translate natural-language rules into a machine-readable format raises a host of problems. Merely by way of example, the system in question must either constrain users to one particular textual format for entering ranges or be able to handle many different formats. The former option places strain on the users if they have to adapt to an unfamiliar method, as well as on the user interface if it has to instruct users on what method to use; the latter option places strain on the developers and the system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0023">Moreover, such text-based lists are difficult to scan quickly, making it difficult to detect errors such as gaps. For this reason and others, text-based methods of defining a set of ranges are prone to errors. Among other problems, users may make typographical errors, in which they accidentally enter a number or comparison symbol incorrectly; errors of comprehension or reading, in which they either misunderstand or misread the comparison symbols (e.g., confusing the &#x3c; symbol for the &#x3e; symbol); and/or errors of omission, in which individuals forget to include one or more values in the set of ranges, leading to a broken set, such as when, for example, a user forgets to include an include an endpoint value in defining adjacent ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0024">For these reasons, among others, there is a need for a more intuitive facility to allow a user to define ranges of values (and/or to view such definitions) within the context of a software application.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0025">Embodiments of the invention, therefore, provide tools to allow more intuitive display and/or definition of ranges in software applications. In a set of embodiments, for example, a software application might include a user interface that has a graphical element (such as a line, a bar, and/or the like) that represents a spectrum of values. The application might further include one or more markers that serve to define boundaries of one or more ranges within the spectrum. By allowing a user to move the markers (through manipulation of the markers using a mouse, typing values for the markers, and/or the like), the interface can allow the user to quickly and easily define different ranges of values and/or to view defined ranges. In an aspect of some embodiments, a marker (and/or an accompanying indicator) may be configured to indicate to the user whether the value represented by the marker falls within or outside the range bounded by the marker.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0026">Various sets of embodiments provide user interfaces, methods, systems, and software products. Certain methods of the invention might implement user interfaces of the invention, might be implemented as software programs and/or might be implemented as instructions to be performed by a computer system. Similarly, systems of the invention can include computers configured with software (e.g., sets of instructions) executable to perform methods of the invention and/or to implement user interfaces of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0027">An exemplary set of embodiments, for example, provides a computer software application comprising a user interface for allowing a user to define one or more ranges of values (which might be continuous ranges). The user interface, in some embodiments, comprises a graphical element (e.g., a slider, a number line, and/or the like) representing a spectrum of values and/or a plurality of markers. Merely by way of example, the interface might include a first marker representing a beginning of a first range of values within the spectrum of values and/or a second marker representing an end of the first range of values. Hence, the first marker and the second marker might define the first range of values.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0028">In some embodiments, the user interface is configured to allow a user to provide a set of inputs to define a range of values. The inputs might comprise a first input to set a position of the first marker, thereby setting a first value representing the beginning of the First range of values, and/or a second input to set a position of the second marker, thereby setting a second value representing the end of the first range of values. Any of a variety of inputs might be supported, including without limitation, inputs from a pointing device, inputs from a keyboard device, and/or the like. In some cases, the user interface might allow a user to manipulate a marker with a mouse cursor (using, for example, a click-and-drag operation to set a position of a marker). In other cases, the user interface might provide a text input field, which can be used, for example, to type in a text entry for a value for a marker.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0029">In specific embodiments, the set of inputs might include further inputs to allow a user to specify a behavior of a marker (e.g., to specify whether the marker is part of an adjacent range of values) and/or to add a marker, delete a marker, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0030">Based on the positions of the first and/or second markers, the interface might be configured to provide, as input to the software application, the first range of values, as defined by the position of the first marker and the position of the second marker.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0031">An exemplary method of graphically presenting information to a user, in accordance with another set of embodiments, might comprise displaying on a display device a graphical element representing a spectrum of values, displaying on the display device a first marker representing a beginning of a range of values within the spectrum of values, and/or displaying on the display device a second marker representing an end of the range of values. Such that the first marker and the second marker define the range of values. The method, in some embodiments, includes receiving, (e.g., from a user), a first input and setting a position of the first marker, based on the first input (thereby setting a first value representing the beginning of the range of values), and/or receiving a second input and setting a position of the second marker, based on the second input (thereby setting a second value representing the end of the range of values). Optionally, the method might include providing, as input to a software application, the range of values, as defined by the positions of the first and second markers. In some cases, the displayed position of a marker might be adjusted in response to receiving an input that sets a position of the marker.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0032">In certain embodiments, the method might further comprise providing one or more interface elements (such as combo boxes, check boxes, text fields, etc., to name but a few examples) for the user to define one or more business rules that apply to one or more ranges of values. Alternatively and/or additionally, additional markers might be displayed. These additional markers might represent the beginning and/or end of additional ranges of values, and additional interface elements can be provided to define business rules that apply to these additional ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0033">In some cases, the method might comprise receiving additional input (e.g., displaying a menu for the user and/or receiving a selection from the menu) to indicate whether the value represented by a marker should be considered part of a range defined by the marker. Merely by way of example, if a particular marker represents the end of a first range of values and the beginning of a second range of values, the additional input might indicate that the marker should be considered part of the first range, part of the second range, or neither. In such cases, the method might further comprise modifying a display of the marker, based on this additional input.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0034">Another set of embodiments provides systems. An exemplary system, as noted above, might comprise a processor, a display device, and a computer readable medium comprising a set of instructions executable by the processor. The set of instructions might comprise instructions to perform methods of the invention. Similarly, a computer program embodied on a computer readable medium, might comprise a set of instructions executable by one or more computer to perform methods of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0035">Another exemplary computer system might comprise a database having a plurality of records, each of which might comprise a data element that corresponds to a field in the database, and/or a software application. The software application might comprise a set of instructions executable by the computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0036">The set of instructions might comprise, inter alia, instructions to display a user interface. The user interface, in a set of embodiments, comprises a graphical element representing a spectrum of values for a first field in the database and a first marker representing a beginning of a first range of values within the spectrum. The user interface might comprise a second marker representing an end of the first range of values and a beginning of a second range of values within the spectrum, and/or a third marker representing an end of the second range of values.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0037">In some embodiments, the set of instructions further comprises instructions to receive from the user a set of inputs and/or instructions to set, perhaps based on the set of inputs, a position of the first marker, a position of the second marker, and a position of the third marker. The positions of the first and second markers might define a first set of boundaries of the first range of values, and/or the positions of the second and third markers might define a second set of boundaries of the second range of values.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0038">There might be further instructions to sort the plurality of records into a plurality of sets of records. Merely by way of example, the plurality of sets of records might comprise a first set of records and a second set of records. The first set of records might comprise one or more records each comprising a data element having a value falling within the first set of boundaries, and the second set of records might comprise one or more records each comprising a data element having a value falling within the second set of boundaries. There set of instructions, then, might include instructions to apply a first business rule to each record in the first set of records and/or instructions to apply a second business rule to each record in the second set of records.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0039">Hence, embodiments of the invention overcome a variety of shortcomings of previous solutions, including without limitation those described above, as well as others that will become apparent to one of skill in the art upon review of this disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0046">Various embodiments of the invention provide a graphical tool for users to create and view a set of ranges. In an aspect, certain embodiments comprise a number line onto which users can add multiple markers, which represent boundaries of the ranges. As with a slider GUI widget, users can slide those markers to particular values. In an embodiment, however, the given value for a marker represents the end of one range and the beginning of another. Hence, multiple markers can function to partition the number line into a set of ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0047">Advantageously, because humans have a sophisticated visual system, graphically portraying a set of ranges can capitalize on that system to facilitate the user's ability to scan and understand the set. In an aspect, the graphical interface of some embodiments presents the range information in a visual form that likely more accurately reflects the user's mental representation of a range; moreover, in some (but not necessarily all) embodiments, it does so by mimicking a number line, which is a familiar construct to most people.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0048">Generally, using a single number line to represent a continuous set of ranges whose endpoints must be in one and only one range has been difficult. The problem is that few simple visual methods currently exist to indicate whether a given endpoint value is included in the range to the left or to the right, or to let users easily set the range in which the value is included. In other words, looking at the number line, there would be no indication as to which range a particular range boundary value belongs. Indicating a single point among a group of ranges is even more difficult, and perhaps because of those challenges, graphical means of defining ranges seem not to have been explored much&#x2014;despite the usefulness of graphics in this area.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0049">In an aspect, one set of embodiments overcomes those challenges by using partially filled markers (which might be circles and/or any other appropriate graphical indicators) to mark the endpoints of defined ranges on the number line. Merely by way of example, in one embodiment, only the left or right side of a given marker is filled; the location of the filled hemisphere indicates whether the value of the marker's position on the number line is included in the range to the left or to the right. (In another aspect, to indicate a single point which is not a member of either adjacent range, neither half of the marker is filled, but a vertical line might run through the center of the marker.) As a result, the markers provide a method of conveying range information that is easily scannable and understandable by users. It should be noted that any of a variety of shapes or indicators could be used for markers, advantageously, however, many embodiments incorporate some sort of intuitive signaling method into the marker to indicate in which range the given value belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0050">Moreover, by employing a graphical representation (as opposed, for example, to a purely textual representation), some embodiments of the invention alleviate many problems endemic to existing systems, including (merely by way of example, the following: Neither the system nor the user needs to accommodate different formats for entering ranges. Because the user does not use text to describe the ranges, no formatting is necessary: The user instead positions markers along a graphical element representing a spectrum of values (such as a number line, to name but one example), which is representation familiar to most users. Further, rather than having to read a text-based list in a two-dimensional pattern, the graphical interface of many embodiments lets users scan the set of ranges along a single dimension (left to right), allowing at-a-glance comprehension.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0051">Other embodiments can also eliminate many of the errors that can occur with traditional methods of range entry, such a typographical errors (which can be prevented, for example, by allowing users to manipulate markers with a mouse or other pointing device, eliminating the need for text input altogether). Similarly, errors of comprehension or reading, which can be mitigated or eliminated by a clear visual signaling mechanism, which decreases the likelihood that the user will select or type in the incorrect comparison symbol to indicate which (if either) adjacent range an endpoint should be considered a part of&#x2014;also, the potential ambiguity or misuse of typical comparison symbols can be minimized by using graphical shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0052">Further, errors of omission, which manifest themselves as &#x201c;gaps&#x201d; in the set of ranges in the spectrum, can be mitigated or eliminated in some embodiments, because in such embodiments, every marker on the slider represents the end of one range and the beginning of another: Users can slide a given fob to any value, and by default that value may be set to be included in one of the adjacent ranges (i.e., a range to the left of the marker, or a range to the right of the marker). Users might be given the option to modify the behavior of the marker, such that the value is included in the range that is not the default, or they can assign the marker to a single point (in effect, a range of 1), such that it is included in neither of the adjacent ranges. However, in such embodiments, users have no way to create a gap in the number line by (accidentally or otherwise) leaving a value undefined. Hence, in an aspect, these embodiments provide a tool to define a continuous set of ranges (i.e., a set of ranges that has no discontinuities or gaps between them). It should be noted, however, that other embodiments of the invention may allow users to define ranges that are not continuous (i.e., where there are gaps or discontinuities between the ranges). Optionally, these gaps can be considered ranges unto themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0053">To illustrate some of these advantages of various embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> depicts an exemplary user interface <b>100</b> in accordance with a set of embodiments, which can be used to display for a user a set of ranges and/or to allow a user to define one or more ranges within a spectrum of values. (For ease of description, the user interface <b>100</b>, and/or components thereof, sometimes is referred to herein as a &#x201c;slider.&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0054">In some cases, the interface <b>100</b> comprises a graphical element <b>105</b>, which represents a spectrum of values. (In the illustrated example, the graphical element <b>105</b> comprises a number line, although other types of graphical elements, including circles (e.g., pie graphs), exponential curves, and/or the like might be used to illustrate a spectrum of values.)</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0055">As used herein, the term &#x201c;spectrum&#x201d; means any array of values, which may be continuous or discrete (i.e., divided into whole numbers, etc.). The values may be numeric, alphabetic and/or the like, and they may (but need not) be associated with units of measurement (of money, time, wavelength, frequency, etc.). A spectrum may be bounded (at either the upper and/or lower end), infinite (at either the upper and/or lower end) and/or mixed (i.e., bounded at one end and infinite at the other end). Merely by way of example, a spectrum in some embodiments might have a lower bound of zero and might have no upper bound. In some embodiments, a user might be given the option to set (or unset) the boundaries at each end of the spectrum. In other embodiments, the user might be given the option to set a scale of the graphical element <b>105</b> with respect to the spectrum. The graphical element <b>105</b> may or may not have labels, tick marks and/or the like (as illustrated, the graphical element <b>105</b> has tick marks but no labels).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0056">The user interface <b>100</b> might also have a plurality of markers <b>110</b>, which, in an embodiment of the invention, serve to define boundaries for ranges within the spectrum of values. Merely by way of example, in the interface <b>105</b>, a first marker <b>110</b><i>a </i>defines a first range <b>115</b><i>a </i>(which, in this case, is unbounded at the lower end, but might also be bounded by the boundary of the spectrum represented by the graphical element <b>105</b> and/or by another marker) of values within the spectrum represented by the graphical element <b>105</b>, while the first marker <b>110</b><i>a </i>and second marker <b>110</b><i>b </i>define a second range <b>115</b><i>b</i>, the second marker <b>110</b><i>b </i>and a third marker <b>110</b><i>c </i>define a third range <b>115</b><i>c</i>, and the third marker <b>110</b><i>c </i>also defines a fourth range <b>115</b><i>d </i>(which, in this case, is unbounded at the upper end, but might also be bounded by an upper boundary of the spectrum and/or by another marker). It should be noted as well that the third marker <b>110</b><i>c </i>also defines a fifth range <b>115</b><i>e</i>, which is merely the value of the marker <b>110</b><i>c </i>itself. (In other words, the marker <b>110</b><i>c </i>is configured not to be a member of either of the adjacent ranges <b>115</b><i>c </i>or <b>115</b><i>d</i>, but instead is a range <b>115</b><i>e </i>unto itself.) In the illustrated embodiment, the markers comprise graphical circles, but, as noted above, any other suitable indica might be used as markers in various embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0057">In a set of embodiments, the interface <b>100</b> also provides one or more interface elements that allow the user to define business rules (or other operations) that should be applied to the various ranges <b>115</b> defined by the markers <b>110</b>. Merely by way of example, in the illustrated embodiment, the interface <b>105</b> provides a plurality of &#x201c;combo boxes&#x201d; <b>120</b> known in the art, which allow the user identify business rules to apply to each defined range <b>115</b>. For example, a first combo box <b>120</b><i>a </i>allows a user to select a business rule to apply to the first range <b>115</b><i>a </i>of values, a second combo box <b>120</b><i>b </i>allows a user to select a business rule to apply to the second range <b>115</b><i>b </i>of values, and so forth. There also might be an interface element corresponding to range <b>115</b><i>e</i>, although that element, for purposes of clarity, is not displayed on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. (It should be noted that, while the interface <b>105</b> illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides combo boxes for this purpose, a variety of other interface elements, including merely by way of example, radio buttons, check boxes, text entry fields, lists, and the like may be used in addition, or as an alternative, to such combo boxes. One skilled in the art will appreciate, based on the disclosure herein, that there are a variety of interface elements available for this purpose, and any of such elements may be used in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.)</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0058">As used herein, the term &#x201c;business rule&#x201d; means any statement that defines or constrains a computer program's operation or an aspect of the business that the computer program is designed to model, simulate and/or analyze. A typical example of a business rule in the e-commerce context is the application of a discount to a purchase. Within the context of the present invention, for example, a set of business rules might comprise a rule that provides that a first discount applies to a purchase of a quantity within a first range, and another rule that provides that a second discount amount applies to a purchase of a quantity within a second range. Another example might be a business rule that applies SQL &#x201c;SELECT&#x201d; statements to records in a database, based on the value of a data element in each record. Hence, for example, an application might select for one type of report all records with a sale amount within a first range, and select for another type of report all records with a sale amount within a second range. One skilled in the art will appreciate, based on the disclosure herein, that there are a wide variety of business rules that might be implemented based on ranges defined by the user interface <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0059">In an aspect, the markers <b>110</b> can be positioned by the user. In some embodiments, the markers are configured to be manipulated, for example, by selecting (i.e., clicking and holding) a marker <b>110</b><i>a </i>with a mouse and dragging the marker <b>110</b><i>a </i>to the desired position on the slider <b>105</b>. In other embodiments, the markers <b>110</b> are configured to be positioned based on textual input from a user (such as a user typing a value into a field <b>125</b> corresponding to each marker <b>110</b>). In such embodiments, a marker <b>110</b> may be configured to reposition itself after a valid value has been input into the corresponding field <b>125</b>. Still further embodiments might support both manipulation/positioning with a pointing device and positioning through textual input.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0060">In some embodiments, the interface <b>100</b> may also include textual indicators (such as the indicators <b>130</b> highlight by broken lines on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) to indicate a value corresponding to a current position and/or behavior of the marker. In other embodiments, however, these textual indicators <b>130</b> may be omitted. For example, in cases in which a text-entry field <b>125</b> is provided, the text entry field <b>125</b> may also serve as an indicator (which, for example, might be updated with a new value corresponding to a marker's new position after manipulation with a pointing device, thereby also serving as both a means for positioning the marker and an indicator of the marker's position). The indicators <b>130</b>, then, might be unnecessary and could be omitted (or included) as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0061">In some cases (for example, as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), an indicator <b>130</b> may include a textual and/or graphical indication of the behavior of the corresponding marker <b>110</b>. Such as a &#x3c; symbol or a &#x2266; symbol on either side of a numeric representation of the marker's value, indicating which, if either, adjacent range the marker belongs to. Merely by way of example, the first indicator <b>130</b><i>a </i>includes a &#x3c; symbol to the left of the value of the corresponding marker <b>110</b><i>a </i>(which is 10, in the illustrated example), and a &#x2266; symbol to the right of the value, indicating that the marker is part of the range <b>115</b><i>b </i>to the right of the marker <b>110</b> (Such that the range <b>115</b><i>b </i>includes values from 10 to 15, and the range <b>115</b><i>a </i>includes values up to, but not including 10.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0062">In other cases, the markers <b>130</b> themselves might be configured to provide a graphical indication of the markers' respective behavior. Merely by way of example, in the interface <b>100</b> illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, half of each marker is shaded to indicate which (if either) adjacent range the marker is a member of. So, for example, the right half of the first marker <b>110</b><i>a </i>is dark, indicating that the marker <b>110</b><i>a </i>is a member of the range <b>115</b><i>b</i>, not range <b>115</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the left half of the second marker <b>110</b><i>b </i>is dark, indicating that the marker <b>110</b><i>b </i>is also a member of the range <b>115</b><i>b</i>. In some cases, such as marker <b>110</b><i>c</i>, neither half of the marker is shaded, indicating that the marker is a member of neither adjacent range <b>115</b><i>c </i>or <b>115</b><i>d</i>, but instead is a range <b>115</b><i>e </i>unto itself.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0063">For purposes of clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the interface <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> without reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0064">In a variety of embodiments, the interface <b>100</b> is quite flexible. Merely by way of example, the scale of the interface element (slider) <b>105</b> may be modified, perhaps by selecting and dragging on either end of the slider <b>105</b> itself, or through any other appropriate method. Alternatively and/or additionally, the overall range of values within the spectrum represented by the slider <b>105</b> can be modified, perhaps through similar means. Additional interface elements, such as an element <b>135</b> to add an additional marker and/or an element <b>140</b> to delete an existing marker, may be provided as well. (In some cases, when a marker is deleted, the interface is configured to adjust the adjacent ranges to account for the deleted markers. For example, if the marker <b>110</b><i>b </i>were deleted, the ranges <b>115</b><i>b </i>and <b>115</b><i>c</i>, which were defined by the marker <b>110</b><i>b</i>, would be left undefined. The interface <b>110</b> might be automatically configured to define a new range that would encompass prior ranges <b>115</b><i>b </i>and <b>115</b><i>c</i>; that is, a range that is defined by markers <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>c</i>. In another sense, this operation might be thought of as re-defining range <b>112</b><i>b </i>to include the values previously included in range <b>112</b><i>c</i>, or vice-versa.) In an aspect of some embodiments, the element <b>140</b> for deleting a marker is presented upon the user taking some action, such as hovering a mouse cursor over a marker and/or the corresponding text input box, right-clicking the same, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0065">As noted above, in an aspect of some embodiments, the user is provided the opportunity to define the behavior of a particular marker <b>110</b>. Merely by way of example, the user may be given the option to select a marker <b>110</b> (e.g., by hovering a mouse cursor over the marker <b>110</b>, right-clicking on the marker <b>110</b>, pressing a hotkey, etc.) to thereby invoke a behavior selection interface. An exemplary behavior selection interface <b>205</b> is illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which depicts the user interface <b>100</b> after the user has invoked the behavior selection interface <b>205</b> for marker <b>110</b><i>b</i>. Although a behavior selection interface can take many forms in accordance with various embodiments of the invention, the behavior selection interface <b>205</b> illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is configured to allow a user to choose one of three behavior options <b>210</b> for the marker <b>110</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0066">Specifically, the user can select a first behavior option <b>210</b><i>a</i>, in which the value represented by the marker <b>110</b><i>b </i>is part of the range <b>115</b><i>c </i>of values to the right of the marker <b>110</b><i>b</i>, a second behavior option <b>210</b><i>b</i>, in which the value represented by the marker <b>110</b><i>b </i>is part of the range <b>115</b><i>b </i>of values to the left of the marker <b>110</b><i>b</i>, or a third behavior option <b>210</b><i>c</i>, in which the marker <b>110</b><i>b </i>is part of neither range <b>115</b><i>b </i>nor range <b>115</b><i>c </i>(in which case, the marker <b>110</b><i>b </i>would become a range unto itself, as described in further detail above). In the illustrated embodiment, each behavior option <b>210</b> is represented by a depiction of the marker with the appropriate shading, according to the convention described above (although it is worth noting, again, that any appropriate convention may be used to indicate marker behavior&#x2014;merely by way of example, as depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the behavior interface <b>205</b> additionally and/or alternatively might include textual indica of marker behavior, such as appropriate &#x3c; and/or &#x2266; symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0067">In many cases, a user interface for displaying and/or defining ranges (such as the interface <b>105</b> described above, to name but one example) may be part of (and/or employed by) a larger software application, which might be a browser-based application (e.g., an application implemented in Java, JavaScript and/or the like and designed to be used within a web browser), a business application (such as those described elsewhere herein, for example), a database application, and/or the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a generalized relationship between such an application and a user.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0068">In accordance with the embodiments illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a computer system <b>300</b> is configured with an operating system <b>305</b>, which executes a software application <b>310</b>. The operating system <b>305</b> might be any of several well-known operating systems, including without limitation those described elsewhere herein. The software application can be any of a variety of applications, such as business applications, e-commerce applications, web application, desktop applications, and the like. In a particular aspect, the software application comprises a set of functional components <b>315</b> that provide the business logic and/or functional operation of the application <b>310</b>. In some cases, the software application <b>310</b> comprises (and/or is in communication with) a database <b>330</b>, which might be configured to store data created and/or used by the software application <b>310</b>. Merely by way of example, if the software application <b>310</b> is a business application, the database <b>330</b> might be used to store data (such as sales data, customer data, inventory data, and/or the like) necessary to the business.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0069">The software application <b>310</b> also comprises a user interface <b>325</b> that serves to provide communication between these functional components <b>315</b> and a user <b>325</b>. The user interface <b>320</b> communicates with the user <b>325</b> through a variety of hardware interfaces, including without limitation a display device <b>335</b> and/or a set of input devices <b>340</b> (which might include one or more pointing devices, such as a mouse, trackball and/or the like, as well as, in many cases, a keyboard). More particularly, the user interface <b>325</b> generally will provide information to the user via the display <b>335</b> and receive information from the user via the input devices. Merely by way of example, the interface <b>325</b> might include the user interface <b>100</b> described in detail above, and in such a case would include instructions to display the interface elements (such as the slider <b>105</b>, markers <b>110</b>, etc.) on the display <b>335</b> and receive input (such as input to manipulate a marker <b>110</b><i>a</i>) via the input devices <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0070">The operating system <b>305</b> generally will comprise a variety of device drivers to provide interaction between the operating system <b>305</b> (and/or the software application <b>310</b>) and the hardware of the computer <b>300</b>. In particular, the device drivers might comprise a display driver <b>345</b>, which provides communication between the operating system <b>305</b> and/or software application <b>310</b> and the display <b>335</b> (usually via a video chipset and hardware interface, not pictured) and/or a set of input device drivers <b>350</b>, which provide communication between the software <b>305</b>, <b>310</b> and the input devices <b>340</b> (e.g., via a USB port, etc., not pictured).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0071">Hence, in a set of embodiments, the user interface <b>325</b> (which again, might comprise the user interface <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is configured to allow a user to provide a set of inputs (e.g., via the input devices <b>340</b>) to define a first range of values. Such inputs might include one input (such as manipulation by a mouse, text input from a keyboard, etc.) to set a position of a first marker, which would represent the beginning of a range, as well as another input to set a position of a second marker, which would represent the end of the range. The interface <b>325</b>, then, could provide, as input to the application, the range of values defined by the markers.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0072">There are a variety of ways in which the software application <b>3</b> <b>10</b> might invoke an interface such as the interface <b>100</b> described above. Merely by way of example, a business application might include a decision table (a tool known to those skilled in the art). The decision table might be configured to allow the user <b>330</b> to textually enter a range of values, but it might also include a prompt (such as a button, etc.) that would allow the user <b>330</b> to invoke the interface <b>100</b> to facilitate the range definition process. In other cases, the user <b>330</b> might not even be given the option to manually enter the range values into the decision table&#x2014;for example, when a field requiring a range value is given focus (e.g., if the user <b>330</b> selects the field with a mouse, tabs into the field, etc.), the interface <b>100</b> might automatically be presented to the user. Based on this disclosure, one skilled in the art will appreciate the wide variety of ways in which the interface <b>110</b> could be invoked by the software application <b>3</b> <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0073">It should be noted that the software components of the computer <b>300</b>, such as the operating system <b>305</b> and software application <b>310</b>, and drivers <b>345</b> and <b>350</b> might be implemented as one or more sets of instructions stored on a computer-readable medium and executable by a processor within the computer <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, described in further detail below, illustrates an exemplary hardware configuration of a computer such as the computer <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. It should also be noted, as described in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> below, that some or all of these software components and/or the database <b>325</b> might reside on and/or be executed by another computer, such as a server. Hence, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> should be considered merely a generalized illustration of one set of embodiments (among many) that provide computer systems and/or applications.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a method <b>400</b> that utilizes a user interface (such as the interface <b>100</b> described above) to display ranges of values to a user and/or to allow a user to define one or more ranges of values. In an embodiment, the method comprises displaying (e.g., on a display device, as part of a user interface) a graphical element that represents a spectrum of values (block <b>405</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0075">In some embodiments, the method further comprises displaying one or more markers (block <b>410</b>), each corresponding to a value along the spectrum. The interface <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example of three markers <b>110</b> being displayed along with a graphical element <b>105</b>, in accordance with one set of embodiments (although it should be appreciated that other embodiments might display such components in a different fashion).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0076">At block <b>415</b>, user interface elements are provided. A variety of user interface elements might be provided to receive user input, including without limitation the components of the interface <b>100</b> described above. Merely by way of example, the markers themselves, as described above, might be user elements capable of receiving user input. Additionally and/or alternatively, there might be user interface elements for changing the scale and/or inputs of the slider itself, text input elements to allow a user to textually define the position of a marker, interface elements to allow a user to set the behavior of a marker (e.g., which, if either adjacent range a marker&#x2014;or, more properly, the value represented by the marker&#x2014;should be a member of). In a particular aspect, there might be provided one or more user interface elements (as described above, for example) that allow a user to assign a business rule to a particular range or ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0077">Hence, at block <b>420</b>, user input (such as input from a pointing device, keyboard and/or the like) is received. A variety of types of user input might be received, corresponding, in many cases, to the types of interface elements provided (as described above, for instance). Merely by way of example, as noted above, user inputs may be received for adding a new marker, deleting an existing marker, setting the position of a marker, changing the behavior of a marker, assigning a business rule to a range, and/or the like. Merely by way of example, a first input might set the position of a first marker, thereby setting a value representing the beginning of a first range, while a second input might set a position of a second marker, which sets a value representing the end of the first range. To continue the example, a third input might set the position of a third marker, and the values of the second marker and third marker might define a second range (i.e., represent the beginning and ending, respectively, of the second range).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0078">Accordingly, at block <b>425</b>, the positions and/or behavior of one or more markers. In some cases, the positions and/or behavior of the marker(s) are set based on, and/or responsive to, the received input; there are a variety of ways described herein by which the position of a marker can be set (e.g., by manipulation with a mouse cursor, by text input, and/or the like). In other cases, the positions of the markers may be set without receiving any input (for example, there might be default marker positions). In further cases, there may be provided no markers until a user provides input to add one or more markers to the interface. (It should be noted that at least one, and in many cases two, markers are required to define a range&#x2014;a single marker can define a range that is coextensive with the value of the marker, and two markers can define a range of values between those of each marker. Hence, adding a marker can, in many cases, define a new range, and perhaps redefine another range. Merely by way of example, if two markers, with values of 0 and 10, define a range from 0-10, and a marker with a value of 12 is added, a new range, with values from &#x3e;10 to 12, might be defined. Similarly, if a new marker with a value of 5 is added, a new range, with values of &#x3e;5 to 10 might be defined, and the existing range might be redefined to include values of 0 to 5. Alternatively, this second operation could be thought of as defining two new ranges and deleting&#x2014;or undefining&#x2014;an existing range.)</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0079">As noted above, the interfaces provided by various embodiments may (but need not necessarily) be used to assign specific business rules to various ranges of values (e.g., as defined by the markers) (block <b>430</b>). A wide variety of business rules (including without limitation the types of rules described above) may be assigned to ranges in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In some cases, an interface element might be used (as described above, for example) to assign rules to various ranges. The interface element might be configured to provide one or more pre-defined rules for selection by a user and/or to allow a user to define new rules. Those skilled in the art, based on the disclosure herein, will appreciate the wide variety of rules that can be defined and assigned to ranges in accordance with embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0080">At block <b>435</b>, the ranges of values defined by the markers, and/or, optionally, any associated business rules assigned to the ranges, are provided as input to a software application. The software application might be (but need not necessarily be) the application that presented the interface to the user. One skilled in the art will appreciate, based on the disclosure herein, that there are a variety of methods that allow a software application to receive input from a user interface. Merely by way of example, if the interface is constructed in an event-based environment (such as a Java environment and/or the like), an event might be associated with a particular interface element (such as a button), and the event might collect data from various other elements (such as markers, a slider, etc.) and encapsulate that data for input to an underlying application. Other procedures may be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0081">At block <b>440</b>, business rules assigned to one or more ranges of values might be applied to data falling within those ranges. Merely by way of example, if a range of 0 to 10 for values of a QUANTITY variable is assigned business rule A, and a range of &#x3e;10 to 20 for values of that variable is assigned business rule B, the application might sort a set of records into those two ranges, and apply business rule A to all records with a QUANTITY value between greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10 . Similarly, the application might apply business rule B to all records with a QUANTITY value greater than 10 and less than or equal to 20 . As noted above, a wide variety of business rules can be supported, and the types of business rules applied generally will vary by implementation.</p>

In some embodiments of the invention, the web server may be configured to serve web pages that can be operated within a web browser on one or more of the user computers <b>605</b> to perform methods of the invention. Merely by way of example, in a set of embodiments, a business application comprising an interface (such as the interface <b>100</b> described above) might be provided as a web-based application from a web server.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0090">The server computers <b>615</b>, in some embodiments, might further include one ore more file and or/application servers, which can include one or more applications accessible by a client running on one or more of the client computers <b>605</b> and/or other servers <b>615</b>.

<claim-text>9. A computer-readable memory device comprising a set of instructions stored therein which, when executed by a processor, causes the processor to graphically present information to a user by:
<claim-text>displaying on a display device a graphical element representing a spectrum of values;</claim-text>
<claim-text>displaying on a display device a first marker, wherein the first marker represents a beginning of a first range of values within the spectrum of values;</claim-text>
<claim-text>displaying on a display device a second marker, wherein the second marker represents an end of the first range of values and a beginning of a second range of values within the spectrum of values;</claim-text>
<claim-text>displaying on a display device a third marker, wherein the third marker represents an end of the second range of values within the spectrum of values;</claim-text>
<claim-text>displaying on a display device a first interval representing the first range of values bounded by the first and second markers;</claim-text>
<claim-text>displaying on a display device a second interval representing the second range of values bounded by the second and third markers;</claim-text>
<claim-text>graphically indicating within the first marker whether a first value represented by a position of the first marker is part of the first range of values or is outside of the first range of values;</claim-text>
<claim-text>graphically indicating within the second marker whether a second value represented by a position of the second marker is part of only the first range of values, part of only the second range of values, part of both ranges of values or excluded from both ranges of values;</claim-text>
<claim-text>graphically indicating within the third marker whether a third value represented by a position of the third marker is part of the second range of values or is outside of the second range of values;</claim-text>
<claim-text>receiving, from a user, a first input setting the position of the first marker, thereby setting the first value;</claim-text>
<claim-text>receiving, from a user, a second input setting the position of the second marker, thereby setting the second value;</claim-text>
<claim-text>receiving, from a user, a third input setting the position of the third marker, thereby setting the third value;</claim-text>
<claim-text>receiving, from a user, a fourth input specifying a behavior of the first marker, the behavior of the first marker defining whether the first value represented by the position of the first marker is part of the first range of values or is outside of the first range of values;</claim-text>
<claim-text>representing the fourth input graphically within the first marker;</claim-text>
<claim-text>receiving, from a user, a fifth input specifying a behavior of the second marker, the behavior of the second marker defining whether the second value represented by the position of the second marker is part of only the first range of values, part of only the second range of values, part of both ranges of values, or part of neither ranges of values;</claim-text>
<claim-text>representing the fifth input graphically within the second marker;</claim-text>
<claim-text>receiving, from a user, a sixth input specifying a behavior of the third marker, the behavior of the third marker defining whether the third value represented by the position of the third marker is part of the second range of values or is outside of the second range of values;</claim-text>
<claim-text>representing the sixth input graphically within the third marker;</claim-text>
<claim-text>providing, as input to a software application, the first range of values, as defined by the positions and behaviors of the first and second markers, and the second range of values, as defined by the positions and behaviors of the second and third markers.</claim-text>
