<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of performing maintenance on printheads of an imaging device includes the detection of at least one missing or defective inkjet in a printhead. A first pressure is applied to ink in printheads in which at least one missing or defective inkjet was detected. The first pressure is configured to discharge ink from the plurality of apertures in an aperture plate of the printhead to reestablish fluid continuity through the inkjet. A second pressure is applied to all of the printheads to be wiped. The second pressure is configured to form a convex meniscus at the plurality of apertures in the aperture plate of all of the printheads to be wiped. A single actuator is then operated to move one or more wipers into engagement with the printheads to be wiped. During wiping the convex meniscus is encountered by a wiper to lubricate a printhead and prevent the printhead from being damaged by wiping. The single actuator then retracts the one or more wipers from the printheads.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates generally to printheads of an inkjet imaging device, and, in particular, to maintenance methods for use with such printheads.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Solid ink or phase change ink printers conventionally receive ink in a solid form, which in some printers is referred to as solid ink sticks and in other printers, solid ink pastilles are used. The solid ink forms are typically inserted through an insertion opening of an ink loader for the printer and are moved by a feed mechanism and/or gravity toward a heater plate. The heater plate melts the solid ink impinging on the plate into a liquid that is delivered to a printhead assembly for jetting onto a recording medium. In the direct printing architecture, the recording medium is typically paper, while for an offset printing architecture, the ink is printed onto a liquid layer supported by an intermediate imaging member, such as a metal drum or belt.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A printhead assembly of a phase change ink printer typically includes one or more printheads each having a plurality of inkjets from which drops of melted solid ink are ejected towards the recording medium. The inkjets of a printhead receive the melted ink from an ink supply chamber, or manifold, in the printhead which, in turn, receives ink from a source, such as a melted ink reservoir or an ink cartridge. Each inkjet includes a pressure chamber that is fluidly connected to the manifold to receive ink The pressure chamber is aligned with an actuator and a diaphragm is disposed between the actuator and the pressure chamber. The pressure chamber is also fluidly connected through a channel to an aperture in an aperture plate. During printing, firing signals activate the actuators, which expand and distend the diaphragm into the pressure chamber. This action propels ink from the pressure chamber through the channel to an aperture where a drop of ink is expelled onto the recording medium. By selectively activating the actuators of the inkjets to eject drops as the recording medium and/or printhead assembly are moved relative to each other, the drops can be precisely deposited on the media to form particular text and graphic images.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One difficulty faced by fluid inkjet systems is partially or completely blocked inkjets. Partially or completely blocked inkjets may be caused by a number of factors including contamination from dust or paper fibers, dried ink, etc. In addition, when the solid ink printer is turned off, the ink that remains in the printhead can freeze. When the printer is turned back on and warms up, the ink melts and air that was once in solution in the ink emerges to form air bubbles or air pockets. This air may partially or completely block the fluid path through one or more inkjets and cause missing, undersized or misdirected ink drops on the recording media.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some partially or completely blocked inkjets may be recovered by performing printhead maintenance. Printhead maintenance generally includes pressurizing the space in a printhead to force ink through the ink pathways of a printhead. This forced ink flow clears contaminants, air bubbles, dried ink, etc. from the fluid paths in the printhead and some of the ink is expelled from the apertures onto the area of the aperture plate surrounding the apertures. A wiper is then swiped across the aperture plate to remove the ink from the aperture plate of the printhead. While the printhead maintenance may restore some inkjet ejectors, the purging action expels some ink that does not contribute to the recovery of weak or missing jets.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Printheads may be arranged in rows within a printer to print across a width of the recording medium. Previously known purging methods allow individual printheads to be selected for maintenance so printheads in which no inoperative or malfunctioning inkjets were detected can skip a printhead maintenance procedure. In this manner, ink can be better preserved. The printers using these purging methods, however, require each printhead to have a separate wiper. A separate wiper is necessary for each printhead because wiping inkjets that do not have ink present on the front face of the printhead may damage the inkjets. Apparently, the presence of the ink helps reduce the friction caused by wiping the face plate and this friction is thought to be the cause of the inkjet damage that may occur during wiping. Improving printhead maintenance procedures and systems to enable the use of fewer wipers without subjecting each printhead to a purging operation is a desirable goal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For a general understanding of the present embodiments, reference is made to the drawings. In the drawings, like reference numerals have been used throughout to designate like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, the term &#x201c;imaging device&#x201d; generally refers to a device for applying an image to print media. &#x201c;Print media&#x201d; may be a physical sheet of paper, plastic, or other suitable physical print media substrate for images, whether precut or web fed. The imaging device may include a variety of other components, such as finishers, paper feeders, and the like, and may be embodied as a copier, printer, or a multi-function machine. A &#x201c;print job&#x201d; or &#x201c;document&#x201d; is normally a set of related sheets, usually one or more collated copy sets copied from a set of original print job sheets or electronic document page images, from a particular user, or otherwise related. An image generally may include information in electronic form which is to be rendered on the print media by the marking engine and may include text, graphics, pictures, and the like. As used herein, the process direction is the direction in which an image receiving surface, e.g., media sheet or web, or intermediate transfer drum or belt, onto which the image is printed, moves through the imaging device as it passes the printhead(s). The cross-process direction, along the same plane as the image receiving surface, is substantially perpendicular to the process direction.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are schematic block diagrams of an embodiment of an inkjet printing apparatus that includes a controller <b>10</b> and printheads <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> that may include a plurality of inkjet drop ejectors for ejecting drops of ink <b>33</b> either directly onto a print output medium <b>15</b> or onto an intermediate transfer surface <b>30</b>. A print output medium transport mechanism <b>40</b> may move the print output medium in a process direction P relative to the printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>. The printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> receive ink from a plurality of on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>, which are attached to the printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, respectively. The on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> receive ink from a plurality of remote ink containers <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> via respective ink supply channels <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Although not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>2</b>, the inkjet printing apparatus includes an ink delivery system for supplying ink to the remote ink containers <b>51</b>-<b>54</b>. In one embodiment, the ink utilized in inkjet printing apparatus is a &#x201c;phase-change ink &#x201d; Phase-change ink is ink that is substantially solid at room temperature and substantially liquid when heated to a phase change ink melting temperature for jetting onto an imaging receiving surface. Accordingly, the ink delivery system comprises a phase change ink delivery system that has at least one source of at least one color of phase change ink in solid form. The phase change ink delivery system also includes a melting and control apparatus (not shown) for melting the solid form of the phase change ink into a liquid form and delivering the melted ink to the appropriate remote ink container. The phase change ink melting temperature may be any temperature that is capable of melting solid phase change ink into liquid or molten form. In one embodiment, the phase change ink melting temperate is approximately 90&#xb0; C. to 140&#xb0; C. In alternative embodiments, however, any suitable marking material or ink may be used including, for example, aqueous ink, oil-based ink, UV curable ink, or the like and may or may not need to be melted to achieve the correct properties for jetting.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The remote ink containers <b>51</b>-<b>54</b> are configured to release melted phase change ink held in the containers to the on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b>. The on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> and the remote ink containers <b>51</b>-<b>54</b> are configured in one embodiment to contain melted solid ink and are heated. In one embodiment, the remote ink containers <b>51</b>-<b>54</b> may be selectively pressurized, for example, by compressed air that is provided by a pressure source <b>67</b> via a plurality of valves <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, and <b>84</b>. The flow of ink from the remote containers <b>51</b>-<b>54</b> to the on-board reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> may be under pressure or by gravity, for example. Output valves <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> may be provided to control the flow of ink to the on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b>. The pressure source <b>67</b> may be configured to deliver air under pressure to the on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> at a plurality of different pressure levels. The plurality of pressure levels may be provided by using a variable speed air pump and/or by controlling valves <b>81</b>-<b>84</b> to bleed off pressure from the pressure supplied by the air pump until a desired pressure level is reached. As explained below, the plurality of pressure levels include at least a purge pressure and an assist pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> may be selectively pressurized, for example, by selectively pressurizing the remote ink containers <b>51</b>-<b>54</b> via valves <b>81</b>-<b>84</b> and pressurizing an air channel <b>75</b> via a valve <b>85</b>. Alternatively, the ink supply channels <b>71</b>-<b>74</b> may be closed, for example, by closing the output valves <b>91</b>-<b>94</b>, and the air channel <b>75</b> may be pressurized. The on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> may be pressurized to perform a cleaning or purging operation on the printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, for example. The ink supply channels <b>71</b>-<b>74</b> and the air channel <b>75</b> may also be heated. The pressure supplied by pressure source <b>67</b> to the on-board reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> is provided at a plurality of pressure levels including the purge pressure and the assist pressure. The on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> are vented to atmosphere during normal printing operation, for example, by controlling the valves <b>81</b>-<b>85</b> to vent the air channel <b>75</b> to atmosphere. The on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> may also be vented to atmosphere during non-pressurizing transfer of ink from the remote ink containers <b>51</b>-<b>54</b> (i.e., when ink is transferred without pressurizing the on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b>). Another embodiment of a direct to paper inkjet printing apparatus in which the method disclosed herein is used is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/026,988, which is entitled &#x201c;Test Pattern Less Perceptible To Human Observation And Method Of Analysis Of Image Data Corresponding To The Test Pattern In An Inkjet Printer&#x201d; and which was filed on Feb. 14, 2011, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated in this document in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of an indirect inkjet printing apparatus that is similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Rather than directly printing on the media, however, the printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> eject ink onto an image receiving member <b>30</b> and the ink image is subsequently transferred to media carried by the media transport mechanism <b>40</b>. A transfix roller <b>17</b> selectively engages the image receiving member <b>30</b> in synchronization with the arrival of a print media to transfer the image printed on the image receiving member <b>30</b> to the print output medium <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a portion of the ink supply channels <b>71</b>-<b>74</b> and the air channel <b>75</b> may be implemented as conduits <b>71</b>A, <b>72</b>A, <b>73</b>A, <b>74</b>A, <b>75</b>A in a multi-conduit cable <b>70</b>, which is shown in phantom in the figure. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each printhead <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> receives ink from attached on-board ink reservoirs <b>61</b>-<b>64</b>, respectively. Once pressurized ink reaches a printhead <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> via an ink supply channel <b>71</b>-<b>74</b>, it is collected in the on-board reservoir <b>61</b>-<b>64</b>. The on-board reservoir <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> is configured to supply ink to a plurality of inkjets in a jet stack (not shown) for each of the printheads. These inkjet ejectors are operated by a controller using image data to eject ink onto a print medium <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or an intermediate transfer member such as image receiving member <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an embodiment of printhead <b>21</b>, by way of example, including on-board reservoir <b>61</b> and jet stack <b>101</b>. The description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> referring to printhead <b>21</b> also pertains to printheads <b>22</b>-<b>24</b> and their corresponding elements. The jet stack <b>101</b> can be formed in many ways, but in this example, it is formed of multiple laminated sheets or plates, such as stainless steel and polymer plates. Cavities etched into each plate align to form channels and passageways (not shown) that define the inkjets for the printhead <b>21</b>. In one embodiment, the inkjets of printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> may be aligned in the cross-process direction. In another embodiment, the inkjets of printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> may be aligned in the process direction.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An outer plate of the jet stack <b>101</b> comprises the aperture plate <b>131</b> that includes a plurality of apertures (not shown) corresponding to each inkjet through which drops of ink <b>33</b> are ejected. During operation, ink from the on-board printhead reservoir <b>61</b> fills the ink manifolds, inlet channels, pressure chambers, and outlet channels of the inkjets and forms a convex meniscus (not shown) at each aperture prior to being expelled from the apertures in the form of a droplet. As used in this document, &#x201c;convex meniscus of ink&#x201d; refers to ink present at an aperture of an inkjet ejector that bulges outwardly away from the aperture of the inkjet ejector, yet remains in place at the aperture until the surface tension of the convex meniscus is broken. The meniscus of the melted ink is maintained at the apertures of the printhead <b>21</b> and prevented from leaking or drooling from the apertures by controlling the surface properties of the aperture plate <b>131</b> as well as the use of a slightly negative pressure, i.e., back pressure, to the ink inside the reservoir <b>61</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;drooling&#x201d; refers to the emission or leakage of ink from one or more apertures of a printhead at any time other than when the inkjet aperture is actuated to emit a drop of ink The back pressure is usually in the range of &#x2212;0.5 to &#x2212;5.0 inches of water. Any suitable method or device may be used to provide the slight negative pressure required to maintain the ink at the apertures. For example, as is known in the art, the positioning of the on-board reservoir <b>61</b> with respect to the jet stack <b>101</b> and the dimensioning of the ink chambers and passageways in the on-board reservoir <b>61</b> and jet stack <b>101</b> of the printhead <b>21</b> may be selected to provide the requisite back pressure to pin the ink menisci at the apertures and to prevent ink from drooling from the apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One difficulty faced by fluid inkjet systems is inkjet contamination, causing what is referred to herein as missing or defective jets. As used herein, the term &#x201c;missing or defective jet&#x201d; is used to refer to an inkjet that is partially or completely blocked as a result of air bubbles within the printhead or contamination, such as paper dust and debris particles, in and around the corresponding apertures in the aperture plate. In order to recover from and/or prevent contaminated jets, imaging devices may include a maintenance system for periodically performing a maintenance procedure on the printhead(s). Maintenance procedures typically include purging ink through apertures of the printhead, also referred to as burping, and wiping the aperture plate to remove ink and debris from the surface of the aperture plate. In order to purge ink from the printhead <b>21</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a purge pressure may be applied to ink in the on-board reservoir <b>61</b> using the pressure source (i.e., air pump) <b>67</b> through an opening, or vent, operably coupled to the air channel <b>75</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>). As used herein, the term &#x201c;purge pressure&#x201d; refers to the pressure of air applied to ink in an on-board reservoir that is configured to urge ink from the reservoir through the inkjet ejectors and be released from the apertures in the aperture plate. Purge pressures are typically a few to several psi, and, in one embodiment, is approximately 4.1 psi. After ink is purged through the apertures of the printhead <b>21</b>, a wiper blade <b>108</b> may be drawn across the aperture plate <b>131</b> to squeegee away any excess liquid phase change ink, as well as any paper, dust or other debris that has collected on the aperture plate <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The controller <b>10</b> operates an actuator <b>120</b> that enables the wiper blade <b>108</b> to be moved in the B direction with respect to the printhead <b>21</b> to engage the face of the printhead and enable a wiping operation and then retract the wiper from the face of the printhead. Another actuator, not shown, moves the wiper during a wiping procedure. As used herein, the term &#x201c;wiping procedure&#x201d; or &#x201c;wiping&#x201d; with respect to the aperture plate refers to the process of moving the wiper into contact with the aperture plate at a first location, e.g., above the apertures in the aperture plate, and drawing the wiper blade across the face of the aperture plate to a second location on the aperture plate, e.g., below the apertures in the aperture plate. To enable a wiping procedure, the actuator <b>120</b> operates the wiper blade <b>108</b> so that the wiper blade <b>108</b> may be moved toward and away from the aperture plate <b>131</b> along an axis B, which is substantially normal to the aperture plate <b>131</b>, to move the wiper into and out of contact with the aperture plates <b>131</b>. In addition, the other actuator enables relative movement of the wiper <b>108</b> along an axis A substantially parallel to the front surface of the aperture plate <b>131</b> to move the wiper <b>108</b> across the face of the aperture plate <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In previously known printing systems, each printhead had a corresponding wiper that was independently operated to move the wiper in the B direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This type of operation made the purging of a single printhead or selected printheads in a plurality of printheads possible because only those printheads that were purged were engaged for wiping. This arrangement, however, is expensive as it requires an actuator for the independent movement of each wiper with reference to the printhead engaged by the wiper. In the system and method described below, a single actuator is operatively connected to a plurality of wipers for the simultaneous movement of a plurality of wipers in the B direction. In order to prevent damage from a wiper engaging and wiping a printhead face that does not have ink on its face from a purging operation, the ink reservoirs supplying ink to printheads that need purging to clear inkjet ejectors are pressurized at an appropriate purging pressure and then all of the ink reservoirs are pressurized at an assist pressure that enables a convex meniscus of ink to form at the apertures of the inkjet ejectors of all of the printheads connected to the pressurized ink reservoirs. A single actuator can bring all of the wipers into engagement with the printheads for a wiping operation and retract all of the wipers once the wiping operation is finished. For those printheads that were not subjected to the purging pressure, the assist pressure still enables an amount of ink to be displaced from the bulges of ink from the inkjet ejectors onto the face of the printhead during the wiping operation that lubricates the face of the printhead and helps prevent damage to the printhead face.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the wiper blade <b>108</b> is located in a position that enables it to move across the face of the aperture plates <b>131</b>-<b>134</b> of multiple printheads in the configuration of printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> shown in the figure. In an inkjet printing apparatus having an intermediate transfer member, such as image receiving member <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the wiper blade <b>108</b> extends across the width of the image receiving member <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, the wiper blade <b>108</b> is connected to parallel tracks <b>200</b>. In one embodiment, the wiper blade <b>108</b> is connected to the parallel tracks <b>200</b> by a pin received in a slot, for example, or by any other structure that allows the wiper blade <b>108</b> to be moved by a single actuator before wiping the faces of the aperture plates <b>131</b>-<b>134</b> as the wiper moves along the tracks <b>200</b>. In other embodiments, four independent wipers may be operatively connected to one another to enable a single actuator to enable the wipers to be moved into and out of engagement with the printheads for a wiping procedure on the aperture plates <b>131</b>-<b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The wiper <b>108</b> may be moved into and out of contact with the aperture plates <b>131</b>-<b>134</b> at a plurality of locations along the axis A to enable dabbing procedures. As used herein, the term &#x201c;dabbing&#x201d; or &#x201c;dabbing procedure&#x201d; refers to the process of moving the wiper blade into and out of contact with an aperture plate of a printhead in an effort to remove debris particles from the wiper blade. Wiper dabbing may be performed at any suitable time such as before and/or after a wiping procedure. The wiper blade <b>108</b> may be dabbed against the aperture plates <b>131</b>-<b>134</b> at any suitable location on the aperture plates <b>131</b>-<b>134</b>, such as below the apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Previously known purging methods required that ink be purged through each inkjet of a printhead in which a missing or defective inkjet was detected. Often, however, printheads may have only one or a few contaminated jets at any given time. While purging ink through each inkjet aperture may be effective in recovering missing or defective inkjets, the ink mass moved through operational inkjets does not contribute to the recovery of the missing or defective inkjets and is not effectively used. As an alternative to purging each inkjet of a printhead during a purge procedure, some prior maintenance systems use selective maintenance of inkjets to increase the efficiency of jet recovery for a given amount of purged ink In one system, only those inkjets in a printhead that are contaminated are purged and only the portions of the aperture plates near those inkjets that are purged are wiped. However, this type of selective wiping requires a selective purge pressure to be applied to an ink reservoir in a printhead, a wiper for each printhead, and an actuator for movement of the wiper to contact only particular locations on the aperture plate. A wiper and actuator for each printhead for movement in the B axis is required because wiping inkjets, which have not had the purge pressure applied to them, may damage the inkjet ejectors in the printhead. This damage may arise from the lack of ink at the apertures that increases friction between the wiper and the aperture plate. Additionally, missing or defective inkjets are not likely to be aligned on different printheads in the cross-process direction so the benefit of precise wiper manipulation is lost as a greater area must be swept on the multiple printheads to cover the missing and defective inkjets on each printhead. Accordingly, the method and system presented in this document proposes applying a purge pressure to those printheads with missing and/or defective inkjets and then applying a different, lighter pressure to all of the printheads to be wiped to enable ink to be present on the face of all of the pressurized printheads during the time of the wiping procedure. This type of operation enables the printhead faces to be wiped at substantially the same time with less ink loss than would be experienced if all of the printheads were pressurized to the full purge pressure. Consequently, the printheads can be properly maintained without requiring a separate wiper and wiper control for each printhead in a printer. Thus, the cost of a maintenance system in a printer is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To provide an appropriate amount of ink to lubricate the aperture plates <b>131</b>-<b>134</b> for wiping without wasting ink by purging a printhead without missing or defective inkjets, the pressure source <b>67</b> is configured to deliver a low pressure assist (LPA) pressure to the on-board reservoir <b>61</b> of the printhead <b>21</b>. As used herein, an LPA is a pressure applied to the ink in an on-board reservoir at a level that forms a convex meniscus of ink at the apertures of the inkjet ejectors in the printhead before the wiping procedure. The LPA may be any suitable pressure level capable of forming a convex meniscus of ink at the apertures. In one embodiment, the suitable pressure level is in a range of about 0.5 inches of water to about 1.5 inches of water. The controller <b>10</b> operates the pressure source <b>67</b> to apply either the purge pressure or the LPA to the on-board reservoir <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In operation, the controller <b>10</b> determines which printheads have missing or defective inkjets. The controller operates the pressure source <b>67</b> to apply a pressure to printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> based on that determination. The controller <b>10</b> applies during a first time period a purge pressure to printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> determined to have at least one missing or defective inkjet. The first time period corresponds to an appropriate amount of time for subjecting the inkjet ejectors to the purge pressure that is effective for clearing defective inkjet ejectors clogged by air bubbles or debris. The controller then operates the pressure source to terminate application of the purge pressure to the printheads having missing or defective inkjets and operates the pressure source to apply for a second time period an LPA to all of the printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>. The controller <b>10</b> also operates the actuator <b>120</b> to move the wiper blade <b>108</b> into engagement with the printhead faces to enable the wiping procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart of an embodiment of a method of selectively purging printheads that utilizes purge pressure and LPA to enable wiping of printheads having at least one missing or defective inkjet and printheads having no missing or defective inkjets with a single wiper blade or multiple wiper blades moved by a single actuator during one wiping procedure. The reader should note that as used in this document, the term &#x201c;single wiper&#x201d; refers to a mechanism that is configured for maneuvering either one wiper blade that extends across at least two printheads or at least two wiper blades in a substantially simultaneous motion with each wiper blade extending across only one printhead. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> begins with the detection of at least one missing or defective inkjet in at least one printhead in a plurality of printheads (block <b>500</b>). Methods and systems for detecting missing or defective inkjets are known in the art. In one embodiment, missing or defective inkjets may be detected by printing test patterns, using an inline image sensor <b>58</b> to generate image data of the printed test pattern, and processing the image data. Alternatively, an image sensor external to the printer, such as a flatbed scanner, may be used to generate the image data of the printed test pattern and the image data processed by a processor outside of the printer. The missing or defective inkjet identifying information is then entered by an operator or communicated electronically to the printer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once at least one missing or defective inkjet has been detected, the controller operates the pressure source to apply a purge pressure for a first time period to the ink in the one or more printheads containing missing or defective inkjets (block <b>504</b>). As mentioned, the purge pressure is configured to discharge ink through the apertures in an aperture plate of the printhead to recover the missing or defective inkjets. After a purge pressure is applied to the ink in the one or more printheads containing the missing or defective inkjets for a first period of time that enables the missing or defective inkjets to be recovered, an LPA is applied to the ink in all of the printheads in the plurality of printheads (block <b>508</b>). As mentioned, the LPA is configured to form a convex meniscus of ink at the apertures. After the LPA has been applied to the ink in all of the printheads in the plurality of printheads, the controller operates a single actuator to move a single wiper into engagement with at least a portion of the apertures on the aperture plates of at least some of the printheads in the plurality of printheads (block <b>512</b>). The single wiper is then operated to wipe the printheads in the plurality of printheads during a second time period in which the LPA is applied to the printheads in the plurality of printheads. For example, as the wiper <b>108</b> moves downwardly past the printheads <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, printheads <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are wiped substantially simultaneously and then printheads <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> are wiped substantially simultaneously. Even though printhead <b>21</b> may have no missing or defective inkjets and printhead <b>22</b> may have missing or defective inkjets, this simultaneous wiping is able to occur without damage to the inkjet ejectors of printhead <b>21</b> because the LPA provides a sufficient amount of ink to lubricate the wiper as it moves downwardly across the aperture plate of printheads <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. Likewise, even if only one or none of the printheads <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> have missing or defective inkjets, the wiper can still continue its movement past those printheads because the LPA enables the wiper to wipe those printheads with an appropriate amount of friction between the wiper and the faces. In one embodiment, one wiper blade may be used to wipe all printheads on a print bar, all printheads using a common color of ink, or all printheads in the printing apparatus, for example. In this embodiment, the pressures in the printheads to be wiped are set, then the printheads are wiped, and the pressure removed from the printheads.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the wiper blade may move across the aperture plate of one printhead at a time during the wiping procedure because each printhead is as wide as the imaging member. The wiper blade may move across a printhead having a missing or defective inkjet first, or the wiper blade may move across a printhead not having a missing or defective inkjet first. In an alternative embodiment, the wiper blade may move simultaneously across the aperture plates of more than one printhead to be wiped during the wiping procedure.</p>

Various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives, modifications, variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims.</p>
