<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e), of provisional patent application No. 61/531,395 filed Sep. 6, 2011; the prior application is herewith incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a bearing connection having a connecting rod connected rigidly to a piston and a crankshaft driven by the connecting rod, the connecting rod being connected on the crankshaft side to a transverse bearing for a sliding block, the sliding block being mounted such that it can move to and fro in the transverse bearing and a rolling contact bearing being arranged in the sliding block in order to receive the crank pin of a crankshaft. Furthermore, the invention relates to an engine cylinder having at least one piston. Finally, the invention relates to an engine and an opposed-piston engine, each of which is connected to a crankshaft by a bearing connection according to the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The object of the invention is to establish a bearing connection having a long service life at high rotational speeds. A cylinder or engine having such a bearing connection, just like the bearing connection, is intended to be simple and inexpensive to manufacture and suitable for all operating situations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the invention, in a bearing connection of the type mentioned at the beginning, these objects are achieved with the invention as claimed, namely, in that at least one cavity is formed in the piston crown and, in the area thereof close to the piston longitudinal axis, is connected to an oil feed line running through the connecting rod and in that the oil feed line in the connecting rod is led or extended to the end region thereof remote from the piston and, from there, is led onward into the interior of the transverse bearing via a transfer channel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The bearing connection constructed in accordance with the invention has a long life and low friction and offers high wear resistance. The throughput of oil for cooling purposes is made possible and configured optimally by the accelerations during the reciprocating movements of the piston. Furthermore, there is a structurally simple construction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A simple structure with a long service life is achieved if the transverse bearing and the connecting rod are formed in one piece or from one part, in particular a precision cast part.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is also provided an engine cylinder having a piston and a connecting rod and having a bearing connection as summarized above, and which has a guide, in which the connecting rod is mounted and guided, in the base area remote from the combustion chamber of said cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In terms of construction, friction and cooling, it is advantageous if the sliding block is formed in two parts, and the two parts enclose the rolling contact bearing, preferably a needle bearing, for the crank guide, or if the sliding block is formed in one piece and if the rolling contact bearing has a filling groove and the rolling contact bearing is threaded onto the crank guide and/or if the sliding block is guided in the transverse bearing such that it can be displaced on rollers in a direction transverse with respect to the cylinder longitudinal axis and/or the transverse bearing or the bearing recess thereof has a rectangular internal cross section, if appropriate with internal corners having a rounded course.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve an improvement to the cooling, provision is made that the cavity is formed by a number of channels preferably running radially in the piston crown, possibly connected to one another, in particular connected to one another and/or branching in the circumferential region of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In practice, it has been shown that it is advantageous for the flow of oil if the cavity or the channels forming the cavity and/or the return line are inclined at an angle of 1&#xb0; to 4&#xb0;, preferably 1&#xb0; to 3&#xb0;, to a plane perpendicular to the piston longitudinal axis, the peripheral end of the cavity or of the channels forming the cavity being closer to the piston surface on the combustion chamber side than the return line.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The cooling of the piston is carried out by means of oil that is supplied, which oil is supplied to the piston crown by the accelerations during the reciprocating movements of the piston and is transported away from the piston crown. With such an arrangement, a high throughput of oil for cooling the piston is possible. Furthermore, the oil transported away can be used to lubricate the crankshaft and led away into the crankshaft chamber for further use. Efficient cooling of the piston via the piston crown takes place, the cooling above all also being possible in the edge regions of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A simple structure results if the cavity or the channels forming the cavity in the circumferential region of the piston are connected, possibly via a collecting line running peripherally, to at least one return line leading to the connecting rod, the return line being connected to an oil return line guided in the connecting rod, and the cavity or the channels forming the cavity being closer to the end face of the piston than the return lines.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For a simple structure, provision can advantageously be made that the oil feed line is guided centrally in the connecting rod and/or that an oil return line connected to the return line is arranged peripherally or off-centre in the connecting rod.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Simple manufacture and a stable structure of the bearing connection and of the piston result if the piston is formed centrally symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal mid-axis thereof and/or if the piston is connected to the connecting rod via a connecting part, preferably in the form of a hollow screw, firmly and rigidly, but if appropriate detachably and divisibly, the oil feed line being extended into a recess in the connecting part which, in the top area of the connecting part, has outlet openings which open into the cavity or the channels forming the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Simple guidance of the oil drawn in for cooling purposes results if a connecting bore is formed in the connecting rod at a distance from the piston and leads radially from the surface of the connecting rod to the centrally placed oil feed line.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is also advantageous if the transfer channel opens into a bearing recess enclosed by the transverse bearing and/or if a bore is formed in the sliding block and passes through the sliding block between the opposite wall faces of the latter and/or if, in the wall surface of the sliding block close to the piston, a depression located opposite the connecting rod is formed, in the area of which the transfer channel opens, which depression has at least one transverse extent which corresponds to the offset of the sliding block during the to and fro movement of the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is also possible that the transverse bearing is connected to a respective connecting rod on opposite sides, the two connecting rods preferably being aligned coaxially.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It may be advantageous for the operation if the sliding block and the transverse bearing are fixed in one plane by a guide unit and are secured against mutual rotation about the piston axis.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is advantageous for the interaction of cylinder, engine piston and bearing connection if the cylinder has a guide, in which the connecting rod is mounted, in the base area of the cylinder remote from the combustion chamber. Provision is made that the guide closes off the cylinder or the end thereof remote from the combustion chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, provision is made that the guide closes off the cylinder or the end thereof remote from the combustion chamber and/or that at least one groove is formed in the guide, in which there is arranged a metallic oil scraper ring for the connecting rod, sealing off on the inside. Therefore, the oil used for cooling purposes and leaving the piston can be used directly for lubricating the connection of the connecting rod to the crank rocker or the crankshaft, preferably the bearing connecting the connecting rod to the crankshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is advantageous if an oil supply line is formed in the guide along the guide path for the connecting rod and communicates with the connecting bore, at least over half the piston travel, beginning with the upper dead point of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The pressures in the cooling oil are high, caused by the acceleration/deceleration of several hundred g. The connecting bore is not connected to the oil supply line in the region of the bottom dead center or at the bottom dead center, with the result that the static pressure which prevails in the oil can escape only via the transfer channel, to the benefit of the lubrication of the sliding block.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An opposed-piston engine according to the invention comprises two cylinders constructed in accordance with the invention, in each of which a piston is mounted, provision being made that the cylinders are connected to each other by the cylinder wall on the combustion chamber side, are advantageously formed in one piece or one part and form a continuous cylinder wall, and that the pistons arranged in the cylinder execute opposed strokes, and that the two pistons are connected to one crankshaft respectively via a bearing connection according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Advantageously, a bearing connection according to the invention can be used for 180&#xb0; V engines, to which end provision can be made that the two cylinders are arranged on both sides of the crankshaft, and the connecting rod of each cylinder is connected, preferably in one piece, to the transverse bearing placed on the crankshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a bearing connection, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic section of an engine cylinder <b>1</b>, of which the combustion chamber can be closed by a cylinder head, not shown, in which ignition units and/or units for the introduction of fuel and/or fuel-air mixtures can be arranged. In the end area of the cylinder <b>1</b> remote from the combustion chamber there is formed a guide <b>15</b>, which closes off the volume of the cylinder <b>1</b> remote from the combustion chamber and is connected to the cylinder wall and at the same time guides a connecting rod <b>3</b> which is connected rigidly to a piston <b>2</b>. The connection between connecting rod <b>3</b> and piston <b>2</b> can be made detachably with a connecting part <b>19</b> formed by a cap or hollow screw which has an oil guide <b>30</b> and at least one oil outlet opening <b>18</b>. In the end area remote from the combustion chamber, the connecting rod <b>3</b> bears a transverse bearing <b>6</b>, in which a sliding block <b>5</b> is mounted such that it can be displaced at right angles to the axis of the connecting rod. This sliding block <b>5</b> is displaceably mounted by means of rollers <b>8</b> in a bearing recess <b>27</b> in the transverse bearing <b>6</b>. The sliding block <b>5</b> is formed in two parts, it being possible for the two parts to be connected firmly to each other by means of screws <b>17</b>. Arranged in the sliding block <b>5</b> is a rolling contact bearing <b>7</b>, advantageously a needle bearing, to receive a crank pin <b>24</b> of a crankshaft <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Formed in the connecting rod <b>3</b> is an oil feed line <b>9</b>, which is connected via a connecting bore <b>13</b> to an oil supply line <b>22</b> coming from the crankshaft casing or an oil sump, which oil supply line <b>22</b> is led through the guide <b>15</b>. Starting from the area of top dead center, the oil supply line <b>22</b> and the connecting bore <b>13</b> communicate over a certain length of the stroke, so that oil can be conveyed into the oil feed line <b>9</b>. In the present case, in the guide <b>15</b> along the guide path for the connecting rod <b>3</b> there is formed an oil supply line <b>22</b>, which communicates with the connecting bore <b>13</b> at least over half the piston travel to and from top dead center of the piston <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The oil feed line <b>9</b> is located centrally in the connecting rod <b>3</b> and is led onward in the connecting or retaining part <b>19</b>, which is inserted into the connecting rod <b>3</b> and is placed in the center of the piston <b>2</b>. This connecting or retaining part <b>19</b> is used firstly to form oil guide channels, as will be explained below. Secondly, this retaining or connecting part <b>19</b> also serves to configure the connection between piston <b>2</b> and connecting rod <b>3</b> to be rigid and firm, but in particular also divisible or detachable. The connecting or retaining part <b>19</b>, extending the oil feed line <b>9</b> through the connecting rod <b>3</b> with a central recess, has outlet openings <b>18</b>, with which the oil supplied can be fed to cavities <b>10</b>, or cavities <b>10</b> formed by channels, which cavities <b>10</b> are formed in the piston crown of the piston <b>2</b>. As the piston <b>2</b> is braked as the piston <b>2</b> approaches top dead center, oil located in the oil feed line <b>9</b> is forced into the cavities <b>10</b> through the connecting or retaining part <b>19</b> and the outlet openings <b>18</b>. This oil flows via annular or reversing chambers <b>28</b> formed peripherally in the piston crown <b>21</b> and into return lines <b>11</b> likewise formed in the piston crown <b>21</b> and from these return lines <b>11</b> into at least one oil return line <b>12</b>, which is formed in the connecting rod <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The cavities <b>10</b> or the channels forming these cavities <b>10</b>, starting from the connecting rod <b>3</b> or from the connecting or retaining part <b>19</b>, run to the circumference of the piston <b>2</b>, rising slightly at an angle W. The reversal chambers <b>28</b> are formed by peripherally located cavities or channels. The return lines <b>11</b> leading back from these reversal chambers <b>28</b> to the connecting rod <b>3</b> are likewise of inclined design, but the openings of the return lines <b>11</b> into the reversal chambers <b>28</b> and into the oil return line <b>12</b> are located further away from the combustion chamber and from the piston face <b>31</b> on the combustion chamber side than the connections of the cavities <b>10</b> to the retaining part <b>19</b> or to the reversal chamber <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is expedient if the cavity <b>10</b> or the channels forming the cavity <b>10</b> and/or the return line <b>11</b> are inclined at an angle W of 1&#xb0; to 4&#xb0;, preferably 1&#xb0; to 3&#xb0;, to a plane perpendicular to the piston longitudinal axis K, the peripheral end of the cavity <b>10</b> or of the channels forming the cavity <b>10</b> being located closer to the piston face <b>31</b> on the combustion chamber side than the return line <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Formed in the guide <b>15</b> is at least one groove <b>23</b>, in which there is arranged a metallic oil scraper ring <b>20</b> for the connecting rod <b>3</b>, sealing off on the inside, the inlet opening <b>14</b>&#x2032; of an oil return channel <b>14</b> adjoining or opening in the surface of the guide <b>15</b> on the side of the oil scraper ring <b>20</b> remote from the combustion chamber, the other end of said channel being led into the crankcase. The oil return channel <b>14</b> is led in the guide <b>15</b> and in the cylinder <b>1</b> in such a way that, in the position of use of the cylinder <b>1</b>, it is directed downward and permits return delivery of oil under gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The oil feed line <b>9</b> formed in the connecting rod <b>3</b> has, in the end area thereof remote from the combustion chamber, a transfer channel <b>16</b>, which opens into the bearing recess <b>27</b> of the transverse bearing <b>6</b>, in order to perform lubrication of the sliding block <b>5</b>. Therefore, the to and fro movement of the sliding block <b>5</b> and of the rollers <b>8</b> in the bearing recess <b>27</b> is pressure-lubricated. As a result of the braking of the piston <b>2</b> as the latter approaches top dead center, oil located in the oil feed line <b>9</b> is forced into the bearing recess <b>27</b> through the transfer channel <b>16</b> on account of the mass inertia.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> reveals, the transverse bearing <b>6</b> and the bearing recess <b>27</b> thereof have a rectangular inner cross section, possibly with inner corners having a rounded course. Furthermore, it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that the oil return line <b>12</b> opens directly into the bearing recess <b>27</b> via the transfer channel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The mounting of the crankpin <b>24</b> in the needle bearing <b>7</b> of the sliding block <b>5</b> can be gathered from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. It can also be gathered from these two FIGS. that the oil return line <b>12</b> in the connecting rod <b>3</b> is designed in the form of parts of a cylindrical ring.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a schematic section through an opposed-piston engine according to the invention having pistons and cylinders according to the invention. With regard to a mid-plane <b>52</b>, this opposed-piston engine is for the most part constructed symmetrically or in mirror-image fashion and with cylinders rotated through 180&#xb0;. The opposed-piston engine comprises two cylinders <b>1</b> according to the invention, which are connected to each other by the circumferential walls thereof on the combustion chamber side. In principle, such a cylinder could also be formed in one piece. In the cylinder <b>1</b> there are arranged two pistons <b>2</b> according to the invention, to each of which a connecting rod <b>3</b> is rigidly fixed. The connecting rods <b>3</b> are guided in guides <b>15</b> which are connected to the cylinder at the two ends thereof remote from the combustion chamber and close off said ends. Molded onto the connecting rods <b>3</b> are transverse bearings <b>6</b>, in each of which a sliding block <b>5</b> is mounted such that it can move to and fro and in which the crankshaft <b>4</b> is mounted by the crankpin <b>24</b>. Apart from the oil return channels <b>14</b>, in the present case the structure of the opposed-piston engine according to the invention is symmetrical with respect to the mid-plane <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The sliding block <b>5</b> can also be placed on crankshafts <b>4</b> formed in one piece, by the rolling contact bearing <b>7</b> being chosen to be appropriately large or having a groove for the insertion of the rollers after the sliding block <b>5</b> has been placed on the respective crank rocker or the crankpin <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The sliding block <b>5</b> and the transverse bearing <b>6</b> can be fixed in one plane by a guide unit <b>53</b>, <b>32</b> and secured against mutual rotation about the piston axis K. In order to connect sliding block <b>5</b> and transverse bearing <b>6</b> and crankpin <b>24</b> and piston <b>2</b> in an angularly fixed manner, in the sliding face of the sliding block <b>5</b> that is remote from the combustion chamber there can be formed a groove <b>53</b>, into which at least one bolt or pin or profiled part <b>32</b> can be introduced or screwed, which is inserted through that wall part of the transverse bearing <b>6</b> which is preferably remote from the combustion chamber, projects into the groove <b>53</b> and guides the sliding block <b>5</b> relative to the transverse bearing <b>6</b>. It is also possible for such guides <b>32</b> to be used in a plurality or on both sides of the piston axis. As a result of forming such an anti-rotation or axial safeguard, it is possible to avoid the situation where the transverse bearing <b>6</b> comes into contact with the crankshaft <b>4</b> or the crank rocker <b>24</b> during operation. It is also possible to insert into the transverse bearing <b>6</b> profiled parts configured in a different way from the profiled parts illustrated, for example a plate-like piece, which is held by securing screws and projects into the groove <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an embodiment of an engine in which there are arranged two identically configured cylinders <b>1</b>, in particular rotated through 180&#xb0; in relation to each other, the two connecting rods of the pistons <b>2</b> respectively arranged in the cylinders <b>1</b> being connected to one and the same transverse bearing <b>6</b>. This connection is advantageously made in such a way that the connecting rods <b>3</b> and the transverse bearing <b>6</b> are fabricated from a single part, in particular a precision cast part. The two pistons <b>2</b> are driven in opposite directions in the respective cylinders <b>1</b>, so that both pistons <b>2</b> simultaneously exert force on the transverse bearing <b>6</b> and therefore on the crankshaft <b>4</b> in the same direction. In this way, a 180&#xb0; V engine is created.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an arrangement of cylinders <b>1</b> of an engine for driving a crankshaft <b>4</b>. The cylinders <b>1</b> are each located opposite one another in pairs and the connecting rods <b>3</b> of the respective pistons <b>2</b> located opposite one another in pairs are each connected to a transverse bearing <b>6</b>, in which the sliding block <b>5</b> can be displaced to and fro. In this way, the 4-cylinder star arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> of two 180&#xb0; V engines having a bank angle of 90&#xb0; is implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">However, it is readily also possible to create a double star arrangement, which means having two times four 180&#xb0; V engines, i.e. with a total of 8 cylinders. The bank angle between the individual engines can be chosen as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an embodiment of a cylinder <b>1</b> having an offset crank guide <b>24</b>. The crank guide <b>24</b> is arranged to be offset with respect to the connecting rod <b>3</b> and the axis of the connecting rod <b>3</b> is located at a distance A from the longitudinal mid-plane L of the transverse bearing <b>6</b>, the longitudinal mid-plane L being perpendicular to the direction of movement of the sliding block <b>5</b> and parallel to the piston axis K.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an embodiment of a cylinder <b>1</b> having a transverse bearing <b>6</b> inclined in relation to the connecting rod <b>3</b>. The crank guide <b>24</b> is of inclined design and the transverse mid-plane Q of the transverse bearing <b>6</b> forms an angle B of 84 to 89&#xb0;, preferably 85 to 89&#xb0;, with the connecting rod <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The angle B and the distance A are matched to the respective intended use.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">If the crank drive is offset in order to reduce the lateral piston force, an improvement in the dynamics and a reduction in the bending moment in the area of the connecting rod bearing are achieved. Advantageously, in the event of an offset, the cylinder mid-line is offset by about 4 to 10% of the cylinder bore before the crankshaft mid-line in the direction of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The transverse bearing <b>6</b> is advantageously formed with the connecting rod <b>3</b> as a component consisting of one piece. In principle, it is also possible to connect, for example to weld and/or to screw, the connecting rod <b>3</b> to the transverse bearing <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The annular chamber <b>28</b> is advantageously continuously open and constitutes the area of the cavity <b>10</b> closest to the combustion chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The crankshaft is advantageously formed in one piece.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a schematic sectional view of a piston <b>2</b> as can be used in a cylinder <b>1</b>. The piston crown has been left out, so that the cavities <b>10</b> and the return lines <b>11</b> which communicate with the annular chamber <b>28</b> running around peripherally can be seen. The guide component <b>15</b> is matched closely to the rear wall or the wall form of the piston <b>2</b> remote from the combustion chamber, in order in any case to be able to perform compression of the charge air. The cavities <b>10</b> have a base area in the form of a circular sector and are separated by lands <b>50</b> which, if appropriate, can also specifically delimit the inlet openings <b>51</b> into the cavities <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The volume and the cross-sectional course of the cavities <b>10</b> and of the return lines <b>11</b> are formed specifically in order to exert an influence on the flow of oil.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a detail view from which the oil return channel <b>14</b> running in the guide <b>15</b> can be seen, the inlet opening <b>14</b>&#x2032; of which opens into the guide chamber in which the connecting rod <b>3</b> is mounted such that it can move up and down. The angle of inclination W of the cavities <b>10</b> and of the return lines <b>11</b> in relation to the piston axis K can be seen clearly.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a cylinder <b>1</b> in which a charge-air cooler or heat exchanger <b>40</b> which lies in the pre-compression chamber is carried by the guide part <b>15</b>. The heat exchanger <b>40</b> could also be arranged on or fixed to the wall of the cylinder <b>40</b>. The heat exchanger <b>40</b> is located in the volume which is formed and bounded by wall surfaces of the guide <b>15</b>, of the cylinder <b>1</b> and of the piston rear wall and permits cooling of the charge air led through this chamber. In this pre-compression chamber, the heat exchanger <b>40</b> can be operated with engine oil as a cooling liquid or with a coolant formed with water and glycol. The coolant circuit could be connected to the water cooling of the engine cylinder. In the case of oil cooling, the cooling oil which is used for the cooling of the piston <b>2</b> could also be used as heat exchanger fluid. The operating temperatures of the cooling oil are about 120&#xb0; to 140&#xb0;, whereas the temperature of the water cooling in a two-stroke cylinder is kept low and is around 55&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C. Cooling of the heat exchanger <b>40</b> with water or a water-antifreeze agent is thus to be preferred, since water, as compared with oil, also has a more beneficial specific heat, with which more effective transport of heat away is achieved. The guides for the charge air are not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
