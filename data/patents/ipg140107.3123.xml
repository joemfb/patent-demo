<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An electro-optical inspection apparatus prevents adhesion of dust or particles to a sample surface, wherein a stage on which a sample is placed is disposed inside a vacuum chamber that can be evacuated, and a dust collecting electrode is disposed to surround a periphery of the sample. The dust collecting electrode is applied with a voltage having the same polarity as a voltage applied to the sample and an absolute value that is the same or larger than an absolute value of the voltage. Because dust or particles adhere to the dust collecting electrode, adhesion of the dust or particles to the sample surface can be reduced. Instead of using the dust collecting electrode, it is possible to form a recess on a wall of the vacuum chamber, or to dispose on the wall a metal plate having a mesh structure to which a predetermined voltage is applied.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an electro-optical inspection apparatus and method for inspecting a sample surface using an electron beam, and more particularly, to an electro-optical inspection apparatus and method that is capable of inspecting a sample surface at high sensitivity using an electron beam while preventing adhesion of dusts or particles to sample surfaces (of front and back sides and peripheral edges).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The electro-optical inspection apparatus is used for obtaining an image of a sample surface of a semiconductor wafer or the like by irradiating the sample surface with a primary electron beam, and detecting secondary electrons or mirror electrons emitted from the sample surface, to perform inspection of defects on the sample surface and/or pattern evaluation of the sample surface on the basis of the obtained image.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, it is known that while a sample such as a semiconductor wafer is conveyed in the air or in vacuum for inspection or processing, if adhesion of dusts such as particles having a diameter of 100 nm or smaller to the sample surface can be prevented to reduce adhesion of dusts or particles to be killer defects on a pattern to the sample surface, production yield can be greatly improved. In a semiconductor or LSI manufacturing process, if the killer defects are on the sample surface, a width of wiring or insulation resistance becomes insufficient so that performance is significantly deteriorated. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures against the killer defects, such as correction or detection of the defects.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, the electro-optical inspection apparatus can provide a measurement or inspection result with high accuracy by reducing adhesion of dusts or particles generated by the inspection apparatus to a sample surface. Thus, a process of dusts or particle adhesion to the sample surface can be identified and improved so that defects in an exposure process can be reduced, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, in relation to conveyance of samples, measures have been taken for reducing generation of dusts or particles as much as possible. For instance, as to an air conveyance system, a mini-environment having a high-performance filter and down flow is provided, and the air conveyance system is housed in the mini-environment. Further, a static electricity remover removes static electricity of the sample so as to prevent particles from adhering to the sample surface. In addition, in a vacuum conveyance system for samples, control of fluctuation of pressure is performed by a load lock. However, it is usually difficult to reduce dusts or particles having very small sizes, in particular, of 100 nm or smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of this problem, the applicant has proposed a method of removing dusts or particles from a sample surface (refer to Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2009-4161 (Patent Document 1)). In this method, the dusts or particles on the sample surface are detected, the sample is moved in a horizontal direction, a collection electrode disposed close and opposite to the sample surface is charged to have the polarity opposite to the charge polarity of the dusts or particles, and hence approaching dusts or particles are electro-statically attracted by the xollection electrode. Thus, the dusts or particles on the sample surface are detected, and the detected dusts or particles are removed from the sample surface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, there is also proposed a particle monitor (refer to Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2010-56270 (Patent Document 2)), in which particles floating in a plasma processing apparatus are collected actively by a dusts or particle collecting electrode and are accumulated in a specific place using a quadrupole linear trap or the like so that the particles are detected electrically or by using laser scattered light.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a design rule of LSI has become very fine, a size of dusts or particles to be prevented from adhering to a sample surface has become very small. Adhesion of dusts or particles generated by an operation of the inspection apparatus to the sample surface has become a critical problem, and it is necessary to take a countermeasure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in the conventional dusts or particle adhesion prevention mechanism, it is difficult to prevent dusts or particles such as fine particles of 100 nm or smaller, for example, from adhering to the sample surface. In particular, if a sample is placed on a stage or the like in a vacuum chamber for inspecting the sample surface by the electro-optical inspection apparatus, there has been no consideration about suppressing generation of dusts or particles from the apparatus itself.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The prior art described in Patent Document 1 detects that dusts or particles have adhered to the sample surface, and afterward removes the adhered dusts or particles from the sample surface. Therefore, conventional example described in Patent Document 1 cannot prevent dusts or particles from adhering to the sample surface. In addition, in the prior art described in Patent Document 2, the dusts collecting electrode is provided to the tip of the particle monitor, for collecting particles floating in the plasma processing apparatus. Therefore, adhesion of particles to the sample surface cannot be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, there is a case that, when a vacuum chamber is evacuated, air flow causes static electricity, which electrifies dusts or particles remaining in the vacuum chamber, and the electrified dusts or particles such as particles are electro-statically attracted by the sample surface to be inspected and adhere thereto so that the sample surface is contaminated. A conventional vacuum chamber used for inspecting a sample surface has no countermeasure against the electrostatic attraction of dusts or particles remaining in the vacuum chamber to the sample surface, and cleaning has been the only way to cope with such remaining particles. Therefore, it is strongly required to prevent such remaining particles in the vacuum chamber that could not be removed by cleaning from adhering to the sample surface.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned problem, and a first object thereof is to provide a method of preventing as many dusts or particles as possible from adhering to a sample surface, and an electro-optical inspection apparatus for inspecting a sample surface using an electron beam while preventing as many dusts or particles as possible from adhering to the sample surface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2005-235777 (Patent Document 3) describes a method of observing a sample surface using an electro-optical inspection apparatus. This conventional method utilizes gradation differences of an image generated in a part where an open defect or a short defect exists. In the part where a defect such as an open defect or a short defect exists, gradation differences appear in the image, which never appear in a normal part. Therefore, in the conventional method, a wafer surface image obtained from a semiconductor wafer surface is compared with an original surface image (of a wafer without any defect). If a gradation difference, which must not appear when using a normal wafer, appears in a part, it is determined that the part has an open defect or a short defect.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, in an observation method disclosed in Patent Document 3, there is a problem that the gradation difference in an observation part is originally small depending on a structure or material of the sample to be observed, and that it is difficult to detect a short defect or an open defect in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, particularly in the case of the open defect, the image of the part where the open defect exists becomes darker (blacker) than the image of the normal part in one case, and becomes lighter (whiter) than that of the normal part in another case. Therefore, there has been a problem that it is very difficult to detect a defect and/or to classify a type of the defect.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In view of this problem, the inventors of the present invention have studied to provide a sample surface observation method that can obtain a sample surface image having large gradation differences between a defect part and a normal part in defect detection of a wiring structure and a clear difference between gray levels of white and black, so that a defect can be easily detected. As a result, the inventors of the present invention have found that the problem of the sample surface observation method disclosed in Patent Document 3 is due to simultaneous detection of a short defect and an open defect in the same condition. Hence, they have proposed a new sample surface observation method (see Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2009-87893 (Patent Document 4)).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Patent Document 4 discloses a sample surface observation method in which an electron beam irradiates a sample surface on which a wiring pattern containing insulation material and conductive material is formed, and hence electrons having structural information of the sample surface are detected so that an image of the sample surface is obtained for observing the sample surface. The sample surface is irradiated by the electron beam in the state where the insulation material and the conductive material have the same luminance in the sample surface image so that a part other than the insulation material and the conductive material can be easily and reliably detected. In addition, a point having a luminance which is different from the luminance of the insulation material and the conductive material in the sample surface image is detected as an open defect on the sample surface, so that the open defect can be easily and reliably detected.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, Patent Document 4 also discloses a sample surface observation method that can effectively detect a short defect, in which an electron beam irradiates a sample surface in a state that a luminance difference between the insulation material and the conductive material becomes maximum in the sample surface image, and hence the sample surface image that facilitates distinction between the short defect and its surrounding part is obtained, so that the short defect can be easily and reliably detected. In addition, a state that the luminance difference becomes the maximum is determined in a mirror electron region in which electrons having the structural information of the sample surface become mirror electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, the inventors of the present invention have further studied a method and apparatus that enables observation of a sample surface with high contrasts in a case where an insulation region and a conductive region are formed on the sample surface, and facilitates not only detection of a short defect or an open defect but also classification of a type of the defect. As a result, the inventors of the present invention have reached a conclusion that the method disclosed in Patent Document 4 still has room for improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, a second object of the present invention is to provide a sample observation method and apparatus that can achieve the above-mentioned first object, and further enables high contrast observation of a sample surface on which an insulation region and a conductive region are formed, and facilitates detection of a short defect or an open defect as well as classification of a type of the defect, and to provide a sample inspection method and apparatus using the sample observation method and apparatus.</p>

A position of the NA aperture <b>361</b> can be adjusted in a plane, and hence electrons having structural information of a conductive region and electrons having structural information of an insulation region, which are directed in different directions by the function of the E&#xd7;B <b>340</b> which will be described later, can be selectively guided to the detector <b>400</b>. Note that, this electro-optical inspection apparatus may have a structure including charged electron beam irradiation means <b>700</b> for irradiating the surface of the sample <b>200</b> with an electron beam to electrify the sample surface as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The surface of the sample <b>200</b> has insulation and conductive regions, and observation of the sample surface is performed by irradiating with an electron beam from the electron beam source <b>310</b>. The electron beam source <b>310</b> includes, for example, an electron source <b>311</b>, a Wehnelt electrode <b>312</b>, and an anode <b>313</b>. The electron source <b>311</b> generates electrons, which are led out by the Wehnelt electrode <b>312</b> and are accelerated by the anode <b>313</b> so that the sample surface is irradiated with the electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The electron beam source <b>310</b> may have a structure to generate a surface electron beam having a predetermined area including a plurality of pixels so that a plurality of pixels can be imaged simultaneously. Thus, a plurality of pixels can be imaged simultaneously by one irradiation of the sample surface with the electron beam, and hence a two-dimensional image of a large area can be obtained at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The landing energy adjust/supply unit <b>600</b> is used to set landing energy of the electron beam emitted from the electron beam source <b>310</b>. The landing energy adjust/supply unit <b>600</b> includes a variable voltage source having a negative electrode connected to the electron source and supplies electric power to the electron beam source <b>310</b> so that the electron source <b>311</b> generates electrons. The landing energy of the electron beam is determined by a difference between a potential of the sample <b>200</b> and a potential of a cathode of the electron source <b>311</b> of the electron beam source <b>310</b>. Therefore, the landing energy adjust/supply unit <b>600</b> can adjust the voltage of the variable voltage source (hereinafter, referred to as an &#x201c;acceleration voltage&#x201d;) so that the landing energy can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In the electro-optical inspection apparatus according to the present invention, the landing energy adjust/supply unit <b>600</b> sets the landing energy of the electron beam to an appropriate value, and contrast of an obtained image is enhanced. In the present invention, the landing energy of the electron beam is set in a transition region in which the electrons having structural information of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> by irradiation of the imaging electron beam include both the mirror electrons and the secondary electrons. A specific method of setting the landing energy is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Each of the primary lenses <b>320</b> deflects the electron beam emitted from the electron beam source <b>310</b> by an electromagnetic field, to thereby guide the electron beam to a desired irradiation region on the surface of the sample <b>200</b>. Note that, there may be a plurality of primary lenses <b>320</b> or a single primary lens <b>320</b>. For example, a quadrupole lens can be used as each of the primary lenses <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> applies an electric field and a magnetic field to the electron beam or the electrons, and directing the electron beam or the electrons by Lorentz force so that the electron beam or the electrons are directed in a predetermined direction. The E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> sets the electric field and the magnetic field so as to generate the Lorentz force that directs the electron beam emitted from the electron beam source <b>310</b> to the surface of the sample <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In addition, the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> sets the electric field and the magnetic field so that the electrons having the structural information of the sample surface by irradiation of the sample surface with the electron beam propagate straight upward and are directed to the direction of the detector <b>400</b>. As described later, the electrons having the structural information of the sample surface emitted by irradiation of the sample surface with the imaging electron beam are directed by the electric field and the magnetic field as the function of the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> according to propagation speed of the electron beam in the direction opposite to the incident direction.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">By the function of the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b>, it is possible to separate the electron beam entering the sample surface from the electrons that are generated from the sample surface and propagate in the direction opposite to the incident electron beam. Note that, the E&#xd7;B deflector may be referred to as a Wien filter.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The condenser lens <b>330</b> is a lens that forms an image of the electron beam on the surface of the sample <b>200</b> and condenses electrons having structural information of the sample surface. Therefore, the condenser lens <b>330</b> is disposed closest to the sample <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The transfer lens <b>350</b> guides the electrons after passing through the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> to the direction of the detector <b>400</b> and forming a crossover in a vicinity of the NA aperture <b>361</b> of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> can adjust the number of passing electrons. The NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> has the NA aperture <b>361</b> in the center portion, which is an aperture determining the numerical aperture (NA). The NA aperture <b>361</b> transmits the electrons that are emitted from the sample surface and are guided by the transfer lens <b>350</b>, to be a passage to the detector <b>400</b>. The NA aperture <b>361</b> can prevent electrons which may be noise in imaging, from propagating to the detector <b>400</b> and adjusts the number of passing electrons. In addition, as described above, a position of the NA aperture <b>361</b> in the plane can be adjusted, and hence electrons having structural information of a conductive region and electrons having structural information of an insulation region, which are directed in different directions by the function of the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b>, can be selectively guided to the detector <b>400</b>. Details thereof are described later. There may be disposed a plurality of types of the NA apertures <b>361</b> having different aperture diameters. In this case, an NA aperture having a desired aperture diameter is selected by an NA aperture moving mechanism (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The projection lens <b>370</b> is final focus adjusting means for forming an image of electrons that have passed the NA adjusting aperture <b>361</b> on a detection surface of the detector <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The detector <b>400</b> detects electrons having structural information of the sample surface when the electron beam irradiates the sample surface so as to obtain an image of the sample surface. Various detectors can be used as the detector <b>400</b>. For example, a charge coupled device (CCD) detector capable of obtaining parallel images or a time delay integration (TDI)-CCD detector can be used. Using a two-dimensional imaging type detector <b>400</b> such as a CCD or a TDI-CCD, and using a surface beam that can irradiate a predetermined area including a plurality of pixels as the electron beam source <b>310</b>, it is possible to obtain an image of wide area by parallel imaging with beam irradiation in one spot so that the sample surface can be observed at high speed. The CCD or the TDI-CCD is a detection element that detects light and outputs an electric signal. If the CCD or the TDI-CCD is used as the detector <b>400</b>, a fluorescent screen that converts electrons into light or a micro channel plate (MCP) that multiplies electrons is necessary and should be included in the detector <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">An EB-CCD or an EB-TDI may be used as the detector <b>400</b>. The EB-CCD and the EB-TDI are two-dimensional imaging type detectors similarly to the CCD and the TDI-CCD, but directly detect electrons and output the electric signal as it is without conversion between light and electrons. Therefore, the above-mentioned fluorescent screen or MCP is not necessary, and a signal loss in the process is reduced so that an image with high resolution can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The image processing device <b>500</b> is a device that stores the electric signal output from the detector <b>400</b> and generates an image of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> based on the stored signal. Specifically, a two-dimensional image is generated based on coordinate information and luminance information output from the detector <b>400</b>. In order to observe the sample <b>200</b> having the surface containing insulation material and conductive material, it is preferred that a luminance difference be generated between the insulation region and the conductive region so that an image with high contrast is obtained. The image processing device <b>500</b> performs necessary image processing and image generation so that a good image can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The stage <b>100</b> has an upper surface on which the sample <b>200</b> placed so that the sample <b>200</b> is supported. The stage <b>100</b> can be moved in the X direction and in the Y direction of the horizontal plane (X-Y plane) and can be rotated in the horizontal plane so that the electron beam can irradiate the entire region to be observed of a sample surface <b>201</b>. In addition, it is possible to constitute the stage <b>100</b> to be movable in the vertical direction (Z direction) as necessary so that a height of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> can be adjusted. In order to constitute the stage <b>100</b> to be movable, for example, moving means such as a motor or an air actuator should be disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The charged electron beam irradiation means <b>700</b> is provided for electrifying the sample <b>200</b> before the sample <b>200</b> is irradiated with the imaging electron beam for imaging from the electron beam source <b>310</b>. The charged electron beam irradiation means <b>700</b> is provided as necessary. Assuming that the sample surface is irradiated with the electron beam in advance before imaging of the sample surface, the conductive region is not electrified so that the potential thereof remains to be the ground potential, while the insulation region is negatively electrified. Therefore, it is possible to form a potential difference between the conductive region and the insulation region according to their materials. Then, the potential difference can enhance the contrast between the conductive region and the insulation region. Therefore, if it is desired to irradiate the sample surface with the charged electron beam before the imaging electron beam irradiates, the charged electron beam irradiation means <b>700</b> should be disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">It is possible that the electron beam source <b>310</b> works also as the charged electron beam irradiation means without separately providing the charged electron beam irradiation means <b>700</b>. In other words, the charged electron beam may be irradiated from the electron beam source <b>310</b> instead of using the charged electron beam irradiation means <b>700</b>. Then, after irradiation with the charged electron beam, the surface of the sample <b>200</b> may be irradiated with the electron beam for imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Therefore, charged electron beam irradiation means <b>700</b> may be disposed, for example, in the case where the charged electron beam should irradiate the sample surface <b>201</b> and the electron beam for imaging should be irradiated promptly after the irradiation with the charged electron beam. In general, the imaging electron beam and the charged electron beam have different landing energy. By disposing the charged electron beam irradiation means <b>700</b>, adjustment of landing energy between the charged electron beam irradiation and the imaging electron beam irradiation becomes unnecessary so that the imaging can be performed promptly. Therefore, if there is high requirement for reducing observation time, the charged electron beam irradiation means <b>700</b> should be disposed to satisfy the requirement for reducing observation time.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The surface of the sample <b>200</b> usually includes an insulation region made of insulation material and a conductive region made of conductive material. Samples <b>200</b> having various shapes can be used. For instance, a wafer-like sample such as a semiconductor wafer or a reticle is used. It is preferred that the electro-optical inspection apparatus according to the present invention have a structure in which the sample surface can be observed appropriately also in the case where an area ratio of the insulation region to the sample surface is larger than that of the conductive region. With this structure, an image of the sample surface can be obtained and observed appropriately also for a contact plug of a semiconductor wafer or a contact structure of a reticle, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Various materials can be used as the conductive material or the insulation material. For instance, plug material such as tungsten (W) can be used as the conductive material, and silicon oxide film (SiO<sub>2</sub>) that is used as an insulation layer of a semiconductor wafer can be used as the insulation material.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The electro-optical inspection apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is the mapping projection type electro-optical inspection apparatus as described above, but an SEM type electro-optical inspection apparatus can also be used as the electro-optical inspection apparatus of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating a general structural example of a sample observation system (inspection system) of the first embodiment including an electro-optical inspection apparatus according to the present invention. This sample observation system is constituted as a combination type sample observation system capable of observing a sample with the mapping projection type electro-optical system and an optical microscope and of observing a sample with the SEM type electro-optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The combination type sample observation system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a load port <b>1900</b>, a mini-environment <b>1800</b>, a load lock <b>1620</b>, a transfer chamber <b>1610</b>, a main chamber <b>1600</b>, a mapping projection type electro-optical system <b>1300</b>, and the image processing device <b>500</b>. The mini-environment <b>1800</b> is provided with an air conveyance robot, a sample alignment device, a clean air supply mechanism, and the like (not shown). In addition, the transfer chamber <b>1610</b> that is always in a vacuum state is provided with a vacuum conveyance robot (not shown), which can suppress occurrence of particles due to pressure fluctuation to a minimum level.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The main chamber <b>1600</b> is provided with the stage <b>100</b> that can move in the X direction, in the Y direction, and in &#x3b8; (rotational) direction in the horizontal plane (XY plane). On the stage <b>100</b>, there is disposed an electrostatic chuck (denoted by <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The sample itself or the sample placed on a palette or a jig is placed on the stage <b>100</b> by the electrostatic chuck.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The inside pressure of the main chamber <b>1600</b> is controlled by a vacuum control system <b>1500</b> so that the vacuum state is maintained. In addition, the main chamber <b>1600</b>, the transfer chamber <b>1610</b>, and the load lock <b>1620</b> are placed on a vibration isolation table <b>1700</b> so that vibration is not transmitted from the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The main chamber <b>1600</b> is provided with the electro-optical system <b>1300</b>. This electro-optical system <b>1300</b> is equipped with a primary optical system including the electron beam source <b>310</b> and the primary lens <b>320</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a secondary optical system including the condenser lens <b>330</b>, the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b>, the transfer lens <b>350</b>, the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>, and the projection lens <b>370</b>, and the detector <b>400</b> for detecting secondary electrons and mirror electrons from the sample <b>200</b>. In addition, as elements related to the electro-optical system <b>1300</b>, there are disposed an optical microscope <b>1400</b> that is used for alignment of the sample, and an SEM <b>1450</b> that is used for review observation.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">A signal from the detector <b>400</b> is sent to the image processing device <b>500</b> for signal processing. The signal processing can be performed both in real time process for a currently observed image and in off line process in which an image is obtained and is later processed. The data processed by the image processing device <b>500</b> is stored in a recording medium such as a hard disk or a memory. In addition, it is possible to display on a monitor of a console as necessary, for example, as an observation region, a defect map, a defect classification, a patch image, and the like. In order to perform the signal processing, there is disposed a system control part <b>950</b>. In addition, in order to supply electric power to the electro-optical system <b>1300</b>, there is disposed an electro-optical system control power supply <b>1180</b>. The electro-optical system control power supply <b>1180</b> includes a power supply <b>600</b> for supplying electric power to the electron source <b>311</b> of the electron beam source <b>310</b>, and landing energy control means for controlling the power supply. The electro-optical system control power supply <b>1180</b> also includes a power supply for setting a potential of the sample, which is described later, and control means thereof, and a power supply for a voltage to be applied to a dust collecting electrode, which is described later, and control means thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Next, a conveyance mechanism for the sample is described. The sample such as a wafer or a mask is conveyed from the load port <b>1900</b> to the mini-environment <b>1800</b>, in which alignment is performed. Further, the sample is conveyed by the air conveyance robot to the load lock <b>1620</b>. In the load lock <b>1620</b>, air is exhausted by a vacuum pump (not shown) from the atmospheric state to a vacuum state. When the pressure inside the load lock <b>1620</b> becomes a predetermined pressure (for example, approximately 1 Pa) or lower by this exhaustion, the sample is conveyed from the load lock <b>1620</b> to the main chamber <b>1600</b> by the vacuum conveyance robot disposed in the transfer chamber <b>1610</b> and is placed on an electrostatic chuck mechanism of the stage <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sample <b>200</b> is placed on the stage <b>100</b> that is common to the mapping projection type electro-optical apparatus, namely the electro-optical system <b>1300</b>, and the SEM type electro-optical system <b>1450</b>. Therefore, when the sample <b>200</b> moves between the mapping projection type electro-optical system <b>1300</b> and the SEM type electro-optical system <b>1450</b>, the coordinate relationship is uniquely determined so that the same part can be identified easily with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In other words, when the sample is moved between separate inspection apparatuses, it is necessary to place the sample on separate stages. Therefore, it is necessary to perform alignment of the sample individually, and even if the sample alignment is performed in this way, specific error of the same place becomes 5 to 10 &#x3bc;m or larger. In particular, if the sample has no pattern, a position reference cannot be specified so that the error is further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">According to this example, if the sample <b>200</b> moves between the mapping projection type electro-optical system <b>1300</b> and the SEM type electro-optical system <b>1450</b>, the same place can be identified with high accuracy. Therefore, a place can be identified with high accuracy, for example, an accuracy of 1 &#x3bc;m or smaller. Thus, if the inspection of a pattern and a pattern defect is performed by the mapping projection type electro-optical system <b>1300</b>, it is very effective to perform identification and detailed observation (review) of the detected defect with the SEM type electro-optical system <b>1450</b>. In other words, because a place can be identified, it is possible to detect presence or absence of defect (pseudo-detection in the case of absence), and accurate size and shape of the defect can be detected at high speed. If separate apparatuses are used, detection of a pattern defect and identification thereof take much time.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">According to the present invention, because a system in which the mapping projection type electro-optical system and the SEM type electro-optical system are disposed in the same chamber, is used, it is possible to perform inspection, decision, and classification of an ultrafine pattern of 100 nm or smaller, in particular, with high efficiency and at high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 23</figref>, the structure for preventing dust or particles such as particles from adhering to a sample surface according to the present invention is described in detail. In the example described below, a rectangular mask or a circular semiconductor wafer having a conductive thin film, for example, Si (including dope), Cr, TaN, TaBN, CrN, Ru, Ta, W, or Cu thin film as a surface layer is used as the sample <b>200</b>. The uppermost surface of the thin film may be an insulation film made of TaBO, TaO, SiO<sub>2</sub>, or the like. In addition, the mask may be constituted of a quartz substrate on which a thin film is formed, for example, or a Si wafer on which a circuit pattern film structure for LSIs is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a front vertical cross sectional view that illustrates in detail the stage <b>100</b> and its peripheral portions of the electro-optical inspection apparatus according to the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross sectional plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the electro-optical inspection apparatus according to the present invention includes a vacuum chamber <b>112</b> that can perform vacuum evacuation. Inside the vacuum chamber <b>112</b>, there is disposed the stage <b>100</b> that can move in the X direction and in the Y direction. Then, on the upper surface of the stage <b>100</b>, in this example, a holder <b>118</b> holding the sample <b>200</b>, which is a rectangular mask, is placed via the electrostatic chuck <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The stage <b>100</b> has a stroke movement region of an effective distance of the sample <b>200</b> plus a run-up distance (inspection maximum speed&#xd7;speed stabilization time) so that imaging of an effective region of the sample (mask) <b>200</b> and the defect inspection can be performed. For instance, supposing that the effective distances of the sample <b>200</b> in the X direction and in the Y direction are 300 mm each, and the run-up distance is 50 mm (=100 mm/s&#xd7;0.5 sec), the stage <b>100</b> has the stroke movement region of 400 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">A dust (or particle) collecting electrode <b>122</b> that has a rectangular cross section and extends continuously in a shape of a rectangular frame is disposed at a position surrounding the entire periphery of the sample <b>200</b> with a predetermined interval between the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> and the sample <b>200</b> placed on the stage <b>100</b>. Further, a gap control plate <b>124</b> having a center through hole <b>124</b><i>a </i>is disposed above the sample (mask) <b>200</b> placed on the stage <b>100</b> and the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> in a horizontal posture with a small gap between the inner surface of the vacuum chamber <b>112</b> and the gap control plate <b>124</b>. In this through hole <b>124</b><i>a</i>, there is an optical system element, namely the condenser lens <b>330</b> of the electro-optical inspection apparatus. The electron beam is irradiated through this condenser lens <b>330</b> to the surface of the sample <b>200</b> placed on the stage <b>100</b>. A size of the through hole <b>124</b><i>a </i>is set to be slightly larger than the outside shape of the condenser lens <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is made of non-magnetic material such as phosphor bronze or Ti so as to eliminate a curve of the electron beam or a change of orbit due to the magnetic field. The electron beam includes a primary irradiating electron beam, a secondary emission electron beam emitted from the sample <b>200</b>, a mirror electron beam reflected in a vicinity of the sample <b>200</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The gap control plate <b>124</b> is made of phosphor bronze, Ti, or SUS sheet having a thickness of 0.3 to 5 mm, for example. It is preferred that the gap control plate <b>124</b> be coated with Au, Pt, Ru, or Os so that the potential is stabilized and contamination is prevented. Further, the gap control plate <b>124</b> has a size that is set so that the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> covers a region that does not go out of the region of the gap control plate <b>124</b> when the stage <b>100</b> moves within its movement region. Thus, it is prevented that the electric field distribution is disturbed and that the orbit of the particle changes when the stage <b>100</b> moves and the sample <b>200</b> placed on the stage <b>100</b> moves to the most distant position in the vacuum chamber <b>112</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the particles from moving to the sample <b>200</b> and adhering to the sample surface. Note that, the gap control plate <b>124</b> is not always necessary. The same is true in the following examples.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In this example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> that is continuous in a shape of a rectangular frame is used, and the entire periphery of the sample <b>200</b> placed on the stage <b>100</b> is surrounded integrally by the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent particles from entering the inside surrounded by the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> through a so-called electric field gap when a gap occurs at a position along a length direction of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> so that an uneven part of the electric field occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">It is not always necessary that the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> surrounds the entire periphery of the sample <b>200</b>. It is sufficient that the electric field formed by the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> can surround the periphery of the sample <b>200</b>. For instance, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, four dust collecting electrodes <b>122</b><i>a </i>extending linearly may be disposed along substantially the entire length of the individual sides of the sample <b>200</b> so that the dust collecting electrodes <b>122</b><i>a </i>surround substantially the entire periphery of the sample <b>200</b> except for the vicinities of the corners. Alternatively, though not illustrated, it is possible that the dust collecting electrodes extending linearly are separated from each other at a mid position. In this case, a distortion of electric field occurs between adjacent dust collecting electrodes, but it is sufficient if necessary potential distribution is obtained by the dust collecting electrode. For instance, in a two-dimensional case, when a width of the dust collecting electrode is denoted by D, and a distance between dust collecting electrodes is denoted by L, there is no problem if D/L&#x2267;4 is satisfied. The same is true in the following examples.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the rectangular mask is used as the sample <b>200</b>. When the circular semiconductor wafer is used as the sample, a circular sample (semiconductor wafer) <b>200</b><i>a </i>held by a circular holder <b>118</b><i>a </i>is placed on the stage <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and a dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>b </i>that is continuous in a shape of a ring is disposed around the sample so that the entire periphery of the sample <b>200</b><i>a </i>is surrounded integrally. In this case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is possible to dispose a pair of semicircular dust collecting electrodes <b>122</b><i>c </i>to be opposed to each other to form a circle, to thereby surround substantially the entire periphery of the circular sample (semiconductor wafer) <b>200</b><i>a </i>placed on the stage <b>100</b> by the dust collecting electrodes <b>122</b><i>c</i>. In addition, though not illustrated, it is possible to dispose three or more dust collecting electrodes extending along circumferential direction of a circle with a space between adjacent dust collecting electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In any case, a predetermined voltage is applied to all of one or more dust collecting electrodes <b>122</b> surrounding the sample <b>200</b> placed on the stage <b>100</b> so as to collect dust, and afterward the electron beam source <b>310</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) generates the electron beam, which irradiates the sample <b>200</b> on the stage <b>100</b>. Thus, secondary electrons emitted from the sample or mirror electrons reflected from the sample surface and its vicinity are detected by the detector <b>400</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and the image processing device <b>500</b> performs image processing so that an image of the sample surface is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an enlarged view of the sample <b>200</b>, the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>, and the gap control plate <b>124</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the sample <b>200</b> is connected to a first power supply <b>128</b> for applying a predetermined voltage to the sample surface, and the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is connected to a second power supply <b>130</b> for applying a predetermined voltage to the dust collecting electrode. A thickness of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is 0.1 to 5 mm, for example. It is better as a width W<b>1</b> of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is larger. However, as the width W<b>1</b> of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is larger, a size of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> occupying the space in the vacuum chamber <b>112</b> becomes larger. Therefore, the width W<b>1</b> of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is usually set to 5 to 50 mm. A distance L<b>1</b> between the sample <b>200</b> and the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is related to the width W<b>1</b> of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>, and it is preferred that the relationship of 0.5L<b>1</b>&#x3c;W<b>1</b>&#x3c;5L<b>1</b> be satisfied, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In this example, a voltage of &#x2212;1 to &#x2212;5 kV is applied to the surface of the sample <b>200</b> via the first power supply <b>128</b>, and a voltage having the same polarity as the voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> and an absolute value larger the voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> by 0.5 to 5 kV, for example, is applied to the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> via the second power supply <b>130</b>. In other words, when a voltage of, for example, &#x2212;3 kV is applied to the sample <b>200</b>, a voltage of &#x2212;3.5 to &#x2212;8 kV, for example, &#x2212;5 kV is applied to the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The vacuum chamber <b>112</b> is made of metal such as iron or aluminum, and has the ground potential. Further, when dust or particles such as particles existing inside the vacuum chamber <b>112</b> are electrified by static electricity or the like, if a potential of the sample <b>200</b> is negative, the dust or particles such as particles that are positively electrified are attracted by the electric field and move toward the sample <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">According to this example, the entire periphery of the sample <b>200</b> to which a negative potential is applied is surrounded by the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>, and a voltage more negative than the voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> is applied to the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>. Therefore, most undesired objects such as dust or particles attracted by the electric field can be trapped by the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>. Thus, a probability that the dust or particles such as particles reach the sample <b>200</b> and adhere to the sample surface can be largely reduced. In this way, adhesion of dust or particles to the surface of the sample <b>200</b> can be reduced largely.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In this example, the gap control plate <b>124</b> is further disposed, which prevents dust or particles such as particles from moving along an orbit distant from the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> and adhering to the surface of the sample <b>200</b>. By disposing the gap control plate <b>124</b>, attraction force of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> for dust or particles such as particles moving along an orbit distant from the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is decreased, and for this reason, a probability that the dust or particles such as particles are trapped by the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is decreased in inverse proportion to a distance. In order to prevent the decrease of probability of trapping the dust or particles, when a negative voltage is applied to the sample <b>200</b>, electric field intensity A between the sample <b>200</b> and the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is set to be negative (A&#x3c;0). Thus, attraction force of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is increased, and hence the probability that the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> traps the dust or particles such as particles can be increased. In addition to that, electric field intensity (absolute value) B between the gap control plate <b>124</b> and the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is adjusted so that 0.1&#x2266;B (absolute value)&#x2266;10 kV/mm is satisfied. Thus, the probability that the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> traps the dust or particles such as particles can be further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">For instance, a negative voltage of &#x2212;1 to &#x2212;5 kV is applied to the sample <b>200</b>, and a negative voltage of &#x2212;1.5 to &#x2212;10 kV that is more negative than the negative voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> by &#x2212;0.5 to &#x2212;5 kV is applied to the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>. It is supposed that the gap control plate <b>124</b> has the ground potential, the distance L<b>1</b> between the sample <b>200</b> and the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is 10 mm, and a distance Z<b>1</b> between the gap control plate <b>124</b> and the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is 8 mm. Then, the electric field intensity A between the sample <b>200</b> and the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> becomes negative (A&#x3c;0), and the electric field intensity (absolute value) B between the gap control plate <b>124</b> and the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> becomes 0.19 to 1.25 kV/mm (=1.5 to 10 kV/8 mm). In particular, when a voltage of &#x2212;5 kV is applied to the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>, the electric field intensity (absolute value) B becomes 0.625 kV/mm (=5 kV/8 mm), which is an effective condition. In this case, the voltage is set not to exceed 10 kV/mm as a withstand voltage of the space so that occurrence of discharge in the space can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates details of the stage <b>100</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the stage <b>100</b> is constituted of an X stage <b>132</b> and a Y stage <b>134</b> that are stacked on each other. An ultrasonic motor <b>136</b> is disposed between the X stage <b>132</b> and the Y stage <b>134</b>. In a position surrounding the outside of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> on the upper surface of the stage <b>100</b>, there is disposed a first dust cover <b>140</b> whose upper edge reaches above the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>, and there is disposed a second dust cover <b>142</b> on the outside of the ultrasonic motor <b>136</b> so as to close an open end of a housing portion for the ultrasonic motor <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">By disposing the first dust cover <b>140</b> is disposed, it is possible to prevent dust or particles such as particles from scattering toward the surface of the sample <b>200</b> and adhering to the sample surface. In addition, by disposing the second dust cover <b>142</b> on the outside of the ultrasonic motor <b>136</b> to be a source of particles, it is possible to prevent dust or particles such as particles scattering from the ultrasonic motor <b>136</b> from entering inside the vacuum chamber <b>112</b>. Prevention of dust or particles such as particles from scattering from the source thereof to the inside of the vacuum chamber <b>112</b> is effective particularly in the case where a wall friction drive type motor such as a Piezo-actuator is used.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In this example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> in detail, a wiring box <b>150</b> having an airtight structure is disposed inside the vacuum chamber <b>112</b>. This wiring box <b>150</b> is used for preventing undesired objects such as particles generated from cables due to bending or friction of the cables from scattering inside the vacuum chamber <b>112</b>. In this example, portions of cables <b>152</b> that are bent accompanying movement of the stage <b>100</b> on which the sample <b>200</b> is placed are all housed inside the wiring box <b>150</b>. More specifically, the power supply for applying a predetermined voltage to the sample <b>200</b> (<b>800</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, and <b>128</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 14</figref>) and the power supply for applying a predetermined voltage to the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> (<b>130</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 13</figref>) are disposed outside the wiring box <b>150</b>. These external power supplies and a terminal strip <b>156</b> are electrically connected via a cable (not shown) extending from the terminal strip <b>156</b> and a feed-through disposed in the vacuum chamber <b>112</b>. The terminal strip <b>156</b> includes two pairs of terminals for applying power supply voltages to the sample and to the dust collecting electrode. In addition, the cable <b>152</b> includes two pairs of power supply lines for transferring power supply voltages, and one end of each of the two pairs of power supply lines is connected electrically to corresponding one of the two pairs of terminals of the terminal strip <b>156</b>. Note that, one end of the cable <b>152</b> is mechanically fixed to a movement plate <b>158</b> disposed in a vicinity of the terminal strip <b>156</b> in a movable manner as illustrated in the figure. A length of the cable between the movement plate <b>158</b> and the terminal strip <b>156</b> has a margin in view of a movement range of the movement plate <b>158</b>. On the other hand, a fixing plate <b>154</b> is fixed to the stage <b>100</b>, and the fixing plate also includes two pairs of terminals for applying voltages to the sample and the dust collecting electrode. These terminals are electrically and mechanically connected to the corresponding power supply lines of the cable <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Further, as illustrated in the figure, the cable <b>152</b> connected to the fixing plate <b>154</b> fixed to the stage <b>100</b> extends linearly from the stage <b>100</b> to the wiring box <b>150</b>, passes through a slit <b>150</b><i>a </i>provided to the wiring box <b>150</b> to enter the inside of the wiring box <b>150</b>, and then turns downward and is reversed by 180 degrees. Then, as described above, the other end of the cable <b>152</b> is mechanically fixed to the movement plate <b>158</b> disposed inside the wiring box <b>150</b>, and the tip thereof is connected to the terminal strip <b>156</b>. Thus, when the stage <b>100</b> moves in the X direction, the cable <b>152</b> is bent only at the flexion part <b>152</b><i>a </i>in the wiring box <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Inside the wiring box <b>150</b>, there is disposed guide rollers <b>160</b> extending in the Y direction (perpendicular to the paper plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) so as to guide the cable <b>152</b>. When the stage <b>100</b> moves in the Y direction, the cable <b>152</b> moves along the guide rollers <b>160</b> in the Y direction, and hence the movement plate <b>158</b> moves. Therefore, a stress in the Y direction is not applied to the cable <b>152</b> extending to the movement plate <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Note that, the movement plate <b>158</b> is disposed in a movable manner in the above-mentioned embodiment, but it is possible to absorb a variation of the cable <b>152</b> due to movements of the stage <b>100</b> in the X direction and in the Y direction only by expansion and contraction of the flexion part <b>152</b><i>a </i>of the cable <b>152</b>. Then, a fixing plate may be used instead of the movement plate to fix the cable <b>152</b> mechanically.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In this way, the bending part of the cable <b>152</b> is entirely inside the wiring box <b>150</b>, and the hole communicating inside and outside of the wiring box <b>150</b> is small. Therefore, the probability that dust or particles generated in the wiring box <b>150</b> go outside the wiring box <b>150</b> is significantly decreased, and most of the dust or particles adhere to the inner wall of the wiring box <b>150</b>. Further, in this example, a dust collecting electrode <b>162</b> for wiring box is disposed inside the wiring box <b>150</b>, and a voltage for attracting the dust or particles is applied to the dust collecting electrode <b>162</b>. Thus, the probability that the dust or particles such as particles scatter from the wiring box <b>150</b> to the outside can be reduced more.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">It is possible to take measures of (1) using cables of equal length, (2) fixing and correcting cables with an insulock tie or the like, or (3) using a flat cable as cables. Thus, generation of particles due to friction among cables can be reduced. In other words, when a plurality of cables of equal length are fixed, the cables become one bunch. When the stage moves, flexion occurs in the cables. In this case, friction among cables can be reduced so that occurrence of dust or particles such as particles can be reduced. Alternatively, if a flat cable is used instead of the cables, a plurality of wires can be replaced by one cable so that friction among cables can be eliminated. If a flat cable having many wires is not immediately available, it is effective to combine the above-mentioned (1) and (2).</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">In the example described above, the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> having a rectangular cross section is used, but a dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>d </i>having a circular cross section may be used as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. A diameter D of this dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>d </i>is related to a distance L<b>2</b> between the sample <b>200</b> and the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>d</i>, and it is preferred to satisfy the relationship 0.5L<b>2</b>&#x3c;D&#x3c;5L<b>2</b>. If the diameter D of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>d </i>is smaller than 0.5L<b>2</b>, the trapping probability of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>d </i>is decreased. If the diameter D of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>d </i>is larger than 5L<b>2</b>, the trapping probability of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>d </i>does not change, and the trapping of excessive dust or particles such as particles may be induced in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In addition, in the above-mentioned example, the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b> is disposed at a position having a predetermined interval from the sample <b>200</b>, and a voltage having the same polarity as the voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> and an absolute value larger than the voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> is applied to the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, it is possible to dispose a dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>e </i>that has a rectangular cross section so that the inner edge portion thereof contacts with the outer edge portion of the sample <b>200</b>, and is continuous in a shape of a rectangular frame so as to surround the entire periphery of the sample. Further, a voltage that is the same as the voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> via the first power supply <b>128</b> may be applied to the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>e </i>via the second power supply <b>130</b>. A thickness of this dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>e </i>is 0.1 to 5 mm, for example, and a width W<b>2</b> is the same as that of the above-mentioned dust collecting electrode <b>122</b>, for example, 5 to 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>e </i>having an inner shape smaller than an outer shape of the sample <b>200</b> is used so that the inner edge portion of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>e </i>contacts with the outer edge portion of the sample <b>200</b>. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, it is possible to use a dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>f </i>in a shape of a rectangular frame having an inner shape slightly larger than an outer shape of the sample <b>200</b> and to dispose the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>f </i>so as to surround the entire periphery of the sample <b>200</b> with a slight gap S between the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>f </i>and the sample <b>200</b>. This gap S is 1 to 500 &#x3bc;m, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a voltage of &#x2212;1 to &#x2212;5 kV is applied to the sample <b>200</b> via the first power supply <b>128</b>, and a voltage that is the same as the voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> is applied to the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>e </i>via the second power supply <b>130</b>. In other words, when a voltage of, for example, &#x2212;3 kV is applied to the sample <b>200</b>, a voltage of &#x2212;3 kV is applied to the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Similarly to the above-mentioned example, if a potential of the sample <b>200</b> is negative, the dust or particles that are positively electrified are attracted by the electric field and move toward the sample <b>200</b>.

In this way, because the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>e </i>disposed around the sample <b>200</b> can trap most of the dust or particles, it is possible to reduce dust or particles that scatter to the surface of the sample <b>200</b> and adhere to the sample surface.

<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the distance between the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>e </i>and the gap control plate <b>124</b> is denoted by Z<b>2</b>, and in terms of a relationship between Z<b>2</b> and the width W<b>2</b> of the dust collecting electrode <b>122</b><i>e</i>, the effect becomes large particularly when W<b>2</b>&#x3e;4Z<b>2</b> is satisfied.

<p id="p-0214" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates still another example in which the above-mentioned example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and the above-mentioned example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> are combined. In this example, a first dust collecting electrode <b>170</b> that has a rectangular cross section and is continuous in a shape of a rectangular frame, for example, is disposed so as to surround the entire periphery of the sample and so that the inner edge portion contacts with the outer edge portion of the sample <b>200</b>.

Then, the first dust collecting electrode <b>170</b> is connected to a second power supply <b>174</b>, and the second dust collecting electrode <b>172</b> is connected to a third power supply <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Note that, as described above, second dust collecting electrodes extending linearly may be disposed along substantially the entire length of the individual sides of the first dust collecting electrode so that the second dust collecting electrodes surround substantially the entire periphery of the first dust collecting electrode.

<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, similarly to the above-mentioned example, a voltage of &#x2212;1 to &#x2212;5 kV, for example, is applied to the sample <b>200</b> via the first power supply <b>128</b>, and a voltage that is the same as the voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> is applied to the first dust collecting electrode <b>170</b>. For instance, when &#x2212;3 eV is applied to the sample <b>200</b>, &#x2212;3 eV is applied to the first dust collecting electrode <b>170</b>. Further, a voltage having the same polarity as the voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> and an absolute value larger than the voltage applied to the sample <b>200</b> by 0.5 to 5 kV, for example, is applied to the second dust collecting electrode <b>172</b>.

<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Also in this example, in a manner substantially similar to the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and the like described above, when a negative voltage is applied to the sample <b>200</b>, electric field intensity A between the sample <b>200</b> and the second dust collecting electrode <b>172</b> is set to be negative (A&#x3c;0). Thus, attraction force of the second dust collecting electrode <b>172</b> is increased, and hence the probability that the second dust collecting electrode <b>172</b> traps the dust or particles such as particles can be increased. In addition to that, electric field intensity (absolute value) B between the gap control plate <b>124</b> and the second dust collecting electrode <b>172</b> is adjusted so that 0.1&#x2266;B (absolute value)&#x2266;10 kV/mm is satisfied.

<p id="p-0220" num="0219">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 17</figref>, the prevention of adhesion of dust or particles such as particles is described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, if a particle made of insulation material exists in a uniform electric field (q+=q&#x2212;) between electrodes constituted of parallel plates, the particle does not scatter though the particle is polarized by electrostatic induction from the electric field. However, if the electric field is a non-uniform electric field, a particle is scattered by the charge generated by the dielectric polarization. In addition, if a particle made of insulation material exists in a non-uniform electric field (q+&#x2260;q&#x2212;) between a pair of electrodes one of which is a plate as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the particle is polarized and scattered by electrostatic induction from the electric field.

<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In this way, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, it is considered that probability that dust or particles' scatter is highly dependent on initial charge q<b>0</b> of the dust or particles such as particles before dielectric polarization.

Inside the vacuum chamber <b>112</b><i>a</i>, there are disposed the stage <b>100</b> on which the sample <b>200</b> is placed, and a primary electro-optical system and a secondary electro-optical system of the electro-optical inspection apparatus. The vacuum chamber <b>112</b><i>a </i>is connected two vacuum pumps <b>190</b><i>a </i>and <b>190</b><i>b</i>, which are connected to a common dry pump <b>192</b>.

<p id="p-0224" num="0223">According to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the static electricity remover <b>194</b> is activated at the same time as the vacuum evacuation inside the vacuum chamber <b>112</b><i>a </i>is started or before the vacuum evacuation. In addition, also during the vacuum evacuation of the inside of the vacuum chamber <b>112</b><i>a</i>, the static electricity remover <b>194</b> is continued to work. In other words, until there is no air flow in the vacuum chamber <b>112</b><i>a </i>and no generation of static electricity by the air flow, the static electricity remover <b>194</b> is continued to work. In this way, dust or particles (remaining undesired objects) in the vacuum chamber <b>112</b><i>a </i>are prevented from being electrified so that the initial charge q<b>0</b> thereof is 0 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>).

<p id="p-0225" num="0224">In addition, even if the amount of the dust or particles such as particles is small, remaining in the vacuum chamber without being removed by cleaning of the vacuum chamber, the dust or particles are deposited on the upper surface of the planar structure in the vacuum chamber by action of gravity.</p>

<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Next, there is described a structure for enabling to image the sample surface with high contrast in the case where the insulation region and the conductive region are formed on the surface of the sample <b>200</b> according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref> are diagrams illustrating an example of a relationship between landing energy of the electron beam for imaging and material contrast in the obtained image when the image is obtained using the mapping projection type electro-optical inspection apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The material contrast means contrast due to a difference between electrons generated from the conductive material and electrons generated from the insulation material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the image obtained depending on the landing energy band, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref> is a graph illustrating correlation between the landing energy of the electron beam for imaging and detector current.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, the horizontal axis represents landing energy (LE) of the electron beam for imaging, and the vertical axis represents a value of the detector current of the detector <b>400</b>. In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, the solid line is a characteristic curve in a case where the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> having an aperture diameter of 10 to 300 &#x3bc;m is used. The dot-dashed line is characteristic curve in a case where the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> having an aperture diameter of 1,000 to 3,000 &#x3bc;m is used. In the example illustrated in this diagram, the landing energy (LE) of 2 to 10 eV is a &#x201c;secondary electron region&#x201d;, the same of &#x2212;2 to 2 eV is the &#x201c;transition region&#x201d;, and the same of &#x2212;2 eV or lower is the &#x201c;mirror electron region&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The term &#x201c;secondary electron&#x201d; means an electron emitted from the sample <b>200</b> when the electron beam collides with the surface of the sample <b>200</b>. The secondary electrons may include reflection electrons having reflection energy that is substantially the same as incident energy and backward scattering electrons that scatter backward in addition to the so-called secondary electrons, as long as the electrons are emitted from the sample <b>200</b> when the electron beam collides with the sample surface. Electrons that are mainly detected in the &#x201c;secondary electron region&#x201d; are secondary electrons that are emitted from the sample <b>200</b> in a manner according to the cosine rule.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">In addition, the &#x201c;mirror electron&#x201d; means an electron that is reflection of the electron beam that is irradiated toward the surface of the sample <b>200</b> and does not collide with the sample surface but changes the propagation direction oppositely in the vicinity of the sample surface. For instance, if the sample surface has a negative potential and landing energy of the electron beam is small, there is a phenomenon that the electron beam does not collide with the sample surface but changes the propagation direction oppositely due to the electric field near the sample surface. In the sample observation apparatus and the sample observation method according to the present invention, such electrons that do not collide with the sample surface but change the propagation direction oppositely as reflection are referred to as mirror electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, in the secondary electron region having a landing energy (LE) of 2 to 10 eV, detection current is greatly different due to a difference of aperture diameter of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>. This is because a sample surface emission angle of the secondary electron is expressed by the cosine rule, and hence spread of electrons at a position of the NA adjusting aperture <b>360</b> is large.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Then, as the landing energy (LE) is decreased to 2 eV or lower, the mirror electrons increase gradually to be the &#x201c;transition region&#x201d; in which the mirror electrons and secondary electrons are mixed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, a detector current difference due to the difference of aperture diameter of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> is small.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">In addition, when the landing energy (LE) becomes &#x2212;2 eV or lower, the mirror electron region appears in which emission of the secondary electrons does not occur and emission amount of the mirror electrons is constant. In this region, the detector current does not depend on an aperture diameter of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>. Therefore, it can be considered that the mirror electrons are concentrated in a range of &#x3c6;300 &#x3bc;m or smaller and &#x3c6;10 &#x3bc;m or larger at the position of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>. This is because the mirror electron does not collide with the sample surface but is reflected, and therefore has good directivity and high straightness.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Note that, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, the characteristic curve is considered to be the same as illustrated in the solid line in the case where the aperture diameter is smaller than 10 &#x3bc;m and to be the same as illustrated in the broken line in the case where the aperture diameter is larger than 3,000 &#x3bc;m. However, it is supposed here that the aperture diameter is 10 &#x3bc;m or larger and 3,000 &#x3bc;m or smaller because of a limit of measurement due to increasing noise.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a difference of angle between the mirror electron having structural information of the sample surface and the secondary electron, in which the horizontal axis represents the effective landing energy (LE). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, a relationship between the effective landing energy and behavior of the electron is illustrated for each of the mirror electron region and the transition region.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates an example in which a region having effective landing energy (LE) smaller than 0 eV becomes the mirror electron region. As illustrated in this diagram, the mirror electron is generated when the irradiation electron beam does not collide with the sample surface but is reflected to the front of the sample surface. In this case, if the irradiation beam enters the sample surface perpendicularly, the mirror electron is reflected perpendicularly to the sample surface. As a result, propagation direction of the mirror electron is constant.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">In contrast, in the transition region, some of the irradiation electron beams do not collide with the sample surface but are reflected to the front of the sample surface to be mirror electrons, and others of the irradiation electron beams collide with the sample surface so that the secondary electrons are emitted from the inside to the outside of the sample. Here, in the same manner as in the mirror electron region, if the irradiation beam enters the sample surface perpendicularly, the mirror electron is reflected perpendicularly to the sample surface so that the propagation direction of the mirror electron is constant. On the other hand, the secondary electrons are emitted in various directions so that the emission amount is proportional to cosine of an angle between the normal of the sample surface and the emission direction (observation direction), namely according to the so-called &#x201c;cosine rule&#x201d;. Then, a ratio of the secondary electrons to the mirror electrons becomes higher as the landing energy becomes higher (toward the right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">In other words, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the mirror electrons have a constant propagation direction and good directivity, but the secondary electrons propagate in various directions according to the cosine rule so that the directivity is not high.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">In the above-mentioned example, the range of landing energy from &#x2212;2 eV to 2 eV corresponds to the transition region, namely the region where the mirror electrons and the secondary electrons are mixed. However, this landing energy range can change depending on the sample to be observed. The inventors of the present invention have found from various experiments that use of the irradiation electron beam having landing energy in the transition region is effective for high contrast observation of a sample surface pattern, in particular, high contrast observation of a sample surface on which an insulation region and a conductive region are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">According to study by the inventors of the present invention, it is found that when the lowest landing energy of the transition region is denoted by LEA while the highest landing energy is denoted by LEB, it is preferred to set the primary landing energy (LE) of the electron beam for imaging to a value that satisfies LEA&#x2266;LE&#x2266;LEB or LEA&#x2266;LE&#x2266;LEB+5 eV. Hereinafter, this is described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a diagram illustrating a variation of the gradation of the sample surface with respect to the landing energy (LE). The gradation is proportional to the number of electrons obtained by the detector <b>400</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the region where the landing energy (LE) is LEA or lower is the mirror electron region, the region where the landing energy (LE) is LEB or higher is the secondary electron region, and the region where the landing energy (LE) is LEA or higher and LEB or lower is the transition region.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">According to various experiments carried out by the inventors of the present invention, it is confirmed that the range in which LEA to LEB is &#x2212;5 eV to +5 eV is a preferred range in many cases.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Further, a gradation difference occurs due to a difference of forming state of mirror electrons between the insulation region and the conductive region. As the gradation difference is larger, higher contrast is formed. In other words, a difference of material or structure causes a difference of forming state of mirror electrons so that the gradation difference is formed. In order to generate high contrast between the insulation region and the conductive region in the obtained image, it is very important how the above-mentioned landing energy (LE) is set. Specifically, it is very effective for obtaining high contrast to use the landing energy (LE) in the region satisfying LEA&#x2266;LE&#x2266;LEB (for example, &#x2212;5 eV to +5 eV) or the region satisfying LEA&#x2266;LE&#x2266;LEB+5 eV (for example, &#x2212;5 eV to +10 eV (=(5+5)eV)).</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref> again, contrast between the insulation material and the conductive material in each generated electron region is described. It should be noted that, various materials made of conductor or insulator can be used for the conductive material and the insulation material. For instance, tungsten (W) can be used for the conductive material, and silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) film can be used for the insulation material.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> illustrates an example of material contrast in the image obtained by the irradiation electron beam having the landing energy (LE) of each generated electron region. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> illustrates an example of material contrast in the secondary electron region, the transition region and the mirror electron region. First, noting the material contrast in the mirror electron region, there is no difference of luminance between the conductive material and the insulation material so that the material contrast is not obtained. This is because every irradiation electron is reflected before the sample surface in the mirror electron region, and therefore there is no difference of luminance, namely no difference of the number of electrons between the conductive material and the insulation material.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">In addition, there is a luminance difference between the conductive material and the insulation material in each of the transition region and the secondary electron region. The transition region has a higher luminance difference between the conductive material and the insulation material, and as a result, has a higher material contrast. The reason is considered to be that not only the secondary electrons but also mirror electrons having high directivity are detected in the transition region, and therefore the signal amount is increased so that the luminance is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">In this way, if a sample surface image is obtained in the transition region in which the secondary electrons and the mirror electrons are mixed, material contrast between the conductive material and the insulation material can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">When the electron beam irradiates the sample surface in the transition region in advance before imaging, the potential of the conductive material remains to be the ground potential while the insulation material is electrified so that the potential is changed by a few eV negatively. As a result, energy (speed) of electron is different between the electron having structural information of the conductive material and the electron having structural information of the insulation material.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Further, when the electrons having different speeds pass through the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), an orbit shift occurs according to the speed due to the following reason.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">The E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> is a means for generating an electric field E and a magnetic field B. An electron passing through the E&#xd7;B <b>340</b> receives a force FE=e&#xb7;E from the electric field and a force FB=e&#xb7;(v&#xd7;B) from the magnetic field. Here, e is the charge of electron that is 1.602&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;19 </sup>C, and E and B are the electric field (V/m) and the magnetic field (Wb/m<sup>2</sup>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">In these forces, the force FE=e&#xb7;E due to the electric field does not depend on the electron speed v (m/s), but the force FB=e&#xb7;(v&#xd7;B) due to the magnetic field depends on the electron speed v (m/s).</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Usually, a condition (Wien condition) is set for the electron emitted from the conductive substrate, namely the sample, to propagate straight through the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b>. However, because of the above-mentioned reason, when the electron speed v (m/s) changes, the force affected by action of the magnetic field changes, and hence the orbit of the electron after passing through the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> is shifted.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">In other words, as described above, the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> is a means for directing the orbit of the electron having structural information of the sample surface when the electron beam irradiates according to the speed of the electron beam propagating in the direction opposite to the incident direction. Further, utilizing the above-mentioned shift of the electron orbit, it is possible to guide selectively the electrons having structural information of the conductive region or the electrons having structural information of the insulation region to pass through the NA aperture <b>361</b> and to reach the detector <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Note that, the transition region is the energy region in which the secondary electrons and the mirror electrons are mixed. Therefore, in this energy region, electron orbits of the secondary electron and the mirror electron from the insulation region are both shifted.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating an example of orbit of the electron having structural information of the surface of the sample <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref> is a side view of the electron orbit, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref> is a partially enlarged diagram of the electron orbit viewed from the underside of the movable NA aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, a negative potential is applied to the sample <b>200</b> from the power supply <b>128</b> for the sample. The sample <b>200</b> includes conductive material <b>202</b> and insulation material <b>203</b> covering the conductive material <b>202</b>. The conductive material <b>202</b> is exposed at a hole <b>204</b> as a break in the insulation material <b>203</b>. For instance, a reticle usually has a contact structure in which the bottom of the hole <b>204</b> is constituted of the conductive material <b>202</b> like the sample <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>. Note that, for simplification, only the E&#xd7;B reflector <b>340</b>, the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>, and the detector <b>400</b> are illustrated as elements of the electro-optical inspection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, an electron beam EB is emitted from the upper right and is deflected by the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> so as to enter the sample <b>200</b> perpendicularly. Then, among electrons having structural information of the sample surface, the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> propagate straight and passes through the NA aperture <b>361</b> of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>. On the other hand, the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> are shifted in orbit by action of the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b> and collide with the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> around the NA aperture <b>361</b> so as not to pass through the NA aperture <b>361</b>. As a result, the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> reach the detector <b>400</b>, while the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> do not reach the detector <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">A reticle usually has a contact structure in which most part of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> is occupied by the insulation material <b>203</b>, and a part (the bottom of the hole <b>204</b>) includes the conductive material <b>202</b>. In this structure, only the electrons ec having surface structural information of the conductive material <b>202</b> are guided to the detector <b>400</b> while the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation material <b>203</b> are not allowed to reach the detector <b>400</b>. Thus, an image with very high contrast can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">To the contrary, only the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation material <b>203</b> are guided to the detector <b>400</b> while the electrons ec having surface structural information of the conductive material <b>202</b> are not allowed to reach the detector <b>400</b>. Thus, an image with very high contrast can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">This method of reverse of contrast is effective in particular for detecting a short defect and an open defect existing in a pattern in which areas of the conductive material and the insulation material are substantially the same on the sample surface. If an area of one of the conductive material and the insulation material is conspicuously smaller than an area of the other material in the pattern, material regions having the conspicuously small area are dotted in the material region of the large area. The electrons from the material region of the large area are slightly diverged in a light path to a detector. Because of this diverging action, an image obtained by the electrons from the material region having small area is smaller than an original image, and hence the defect detection becomes difficult. For instance, in a structure (contact plug structure) in which conductive regions having a contact plug shape of conspicuously small area are dotted in the large insulation region formed on a silicon substrate, an image formed by the electrons from the conductive region has an area smaller than the original area because of diffusion (diffraction) of electrons from the insulation region.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">It is supposed that the electrons ec and ei include both the mirror electrons and the secondary electrons.

<p id="p-0267" num="0266"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref> is an enlarged diagram illustrating a relationship among the NA aperture <b>361</b>, the electrons ec having surface structural information of the conductive material <b>202</b>, and the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation material <b>203</b> viewed from the underside of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref>, a position of the NA aperture <b>361</b>, which is formed in a part of the rectangular NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>, is adjusted so that the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> pass through the NA aperture <b>361</b>, while most of the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> are blocked by the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> and cannot pass through the NA aperture <b>361</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">As to the mirror electrons, electron orbits of the conductive material <b>202</b> and the insulation material <b>203</b> cross over at the position of the NA adjusting aperture plate <b>360</b>, and form a minimum spot of 100 &#x3bc;m. Therefore, it is easy to separate the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive material <b>202</b> selectively without losing optical resolution by the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> by utilizing the orbit shift by the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">As the above-mentioned potential difference between the conductive material and the insulation material due to electrification is larger, positional movement in the position of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> is also larger. Therefore, when the electrified potential difference is increased, even if the NA aperture <b>361</b> having a large aperture diameter is used, it is possible to separate the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b>.

<p id="p-0271" num="0270">Note that, when the charged electron beam is to irradiate the insulation region <b>203</b> of the sample <b>200</b> before the electron beam for imaging irradiates, the charged electron beam only has to irradiate the surface of the sample <b>200</b> without performing imaging by the detector <b>400</b>, while using the electron beam source <b>310</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or the charged electron beam irradiation means <b>700</b>, if disposed. In this case, it is possible to irradiate only the insulation region <b>203</b> with the charged electron beam, but the surface potential of the conductive region <b>202</b> is 0 even if it is irradiated with the charged electron beam.

<p id="p-0272" num="0271"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref> are diagrams illustrating an optimal position of the NA aperture <b>361</b> for obtaining high material contrast in the case of the mirror electrons and in the case of the secondary electrons. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> is a diagram illustrating an optimal position of the NA aperture <b>361</b> of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> in the case of the mirror electrons. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref> is a diagram illustrating an optimal position of the NA aperture in the case of the secondary electrons. In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref>, a circle filled with black color indicates the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b>, and a circle filled with gray color indicates the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b>. As illustrated in these figures, the optimal position of the NA aperture <b>361</b> at the position of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> is different depending on a difference of spread of the orbit of the mirror electrons or the secondary electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>, at the position of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>, a difference of electron orbit shift between the secondary electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> and the secondary electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> is approximately 100 &#x3bc;m, and the electron distributions are overlapped with each other in most part. This is because that the secondary electrons propagate in various directions according to the cosine rule so that the directivity is not high, as described above. Therefore, it is considered to be optimal to adjust the center of the NA aperture <b>361</b> of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> to a position substantially identical to the center of the orbit of the electrons ec emitted from the conductive region <b>202</b>, in order to increase the material contrast by the secondary electrons. When the center of the NA aperture <b>361</b> is adjusted to the position, the electrons ec can be detected with reference to the center of the part having the highest electron density of the electrons ec emitted from the conductive region <b>202</b> of the sample <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>, the electron orbit of the electrons ei emitted from the insulation region <b>203</b> substantially overlaps with the orbit of the electrons ec emitted from the conductive region <b>202</b>, and hence the electrons cannot be detected separately. Therefore, in the secondary electron emission region, the material contrast is distinguished between the secondary electrons ec emitted from the conductive region <b>202</b> and the secondary electrons ei emitted from the insulation region <b>203</b>, based on a signal difference thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">In contrast to the above, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, there is a conspicuous difference of the electron orbit shift between the mirror electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> and the mirror electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, at the position of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>, a difference of electron orbit shift between the mirror electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> and the mirror electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> is approximately 100 &#x3bc;m. The electron distributions are not overlapped with each other in most part but are substantially separated. This is because the mirror electron has a constant propagation direction and good directivity as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">In this case, for example, it is easy to set an arrangement in which all the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> pass through the NA aperture <b>361</b> while the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> hardly pass through the NA aperture <b>361</b>. Then, if the position adjustment of the NA aperture <b>361</b> is performed in such a manner, the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region can be separated from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region, and many of only the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region can be guided to the detector <b>400</b>. As a result, material contrast between the conductive region <b>202</b> and the insulation region <b>203</b> can be enhanced. In other words, by using the mirror electrons generated in the transition region, the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region can be separated from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b>. As a result, it becomes easy to obtain an image with high material contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Usually, in order to perform such separation, a chromatic aberration corrector (monochrometer) is necessary which is constituted of a plurality of magnetic fields and electric fields. According to the electro-optical inspection apparatus and the sample observation method of the present invention, an image with high material contrast can be obtained only by position adjustment of the NA aperture <b>361</b> formed in the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> without disposing a chromatic aberration corrector.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Note that, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref> and <b>27</b>A and <b>27</b>B illustrate the case where the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> are selectively guided to the detector <b>400</b> and the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> are not guided to the detector <b>400</b>. However, it is possible to adopt a structure in which the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> are selectively guided to the detector <b>400</b> and the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> are not guided to the detector <b>400</b>, by setting of the E&#xd7;B deflector <b>340</b>, layout of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b>, and adjustment of diameter of the aperture <b>361</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0280" num="0279">As described above, the electro-optical inspection apparatus according to the present invention includes the electron beam source for irradiating the sample surface having the insulation region and the conductive region with the electron beam for imaging, the electromagnetic field generation means (E&#xd7;B deflector) for directing, by an electric field and a magnetic field, the electrons having structural information of the sample surface by the irradiation with the electron beam for imaging, according to speed of the electrons propagating in the direction opposite to the incident direction of the electron beam for imaging, the detector for detecting the electrons directed by the electromagnetic field generation means (E&#xd7;B) so as to obtain the sample surface image from the detected electrons, the landing energy setting means for setting the landing energy of the electron beam for imaging to the transition region in which the electrons include both the mirror electrons and the secondary electrons, the NA aperture moving mechanism for enabling adjustment of the NA aperture position defining the numerical aperture (NA) in the plane, and the charged electron beam irradiation means for irradiating the sample surface with the electron beam so as to electrify the insulation region. Then, through the position adjustment of the NA aperture by the NA aperture moving mechanism, the electrons having structural information of the conductive region and the electrons having structural information of the insulation region, which are directed differently by action of the E&#xd7;B deflector, can be selectively guided to the detector.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">In addition, the image processing device <b>500</b> is provided with a calculation function (calculation part), which determines whether or not a short defect exists from the image obtained from the electron having structural information of the conductive region, and determines whether or not an open defect exists from the image obtained from the electron having structural information of the insulation region. Thus, the electro-optical inspection apparatus can be used as a detection apparatus for a short defect and an open defect.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Further, the sample observation method of the present invention can be performed by using the electro-optical inspection apparatus having the above-mentioned structure. In the method, an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, and another image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region. Thus, the sample surface on which the insulation region and the conductive region are formed can be observed with high contrast, and detection of a short defect or an open defect, as well as classification of a type of the defect can be performed easily. Hereinafter, the sample observation method of the present invention is described.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">In the sample observation method of the present invention, in the sample surface having the insulation region and the conductive region, the landing energy (LE) of the imaging electron beam is adjusted to the transition region in which the electrons having structural information of the sample surface include both the mirror electrons and the secondary electrons, and an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region while another image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region. In other words, in the sample observation method of the present invention, an image is obtained under the condition of a relationship where contrast is reversed between the conductive region and the insulation region.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">As described above, by using the mirror electrons generated in the transition region, the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region can be separated from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b>.

In order to easily understand the feature of the method, the results of a basic study about formation of contrast between the conductive region and the insulation region are described in advance.</p>

<p id="p-0288" num="0287">In this way, by separating the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b>, the contrast can be enhanced.

<p id="p-0289" num="0288">On the contrary, if the position of the NA aperture <b>361</b> of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> is adjusted so that the electrons generated from the insulation region <b>203</b> are selectively detected, an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region.

<p id="p-0300" num="0299">According to the results illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref>, when the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region are not separated from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region, the obtained contrast is approximately 0.4 at most, which is conspicuously lower than the contrast (for example, 0.8 as described above) obtained when the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region are separated from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">In other words, as in the present invention, by utilizing the mirror electrons generated in the transition region, the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region are separated from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region, and then an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, or an image is obtained under the opposite condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region.

<p id="p-0303" num="0302">According to the LEEM type electro-optical inspection apparatus and sample observation method, mainly the conductive region <b>202</b> has high luminance as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>. Therefore, if the ratio of area of the conductive region <b>202</b> is decreased, the contrast increases because of little interference from the surroundings. On the other hand, in the SEM type (for example, the landing energy is approximately 1,000 eV), the insulation material <b>203</b> is brighter by the secondary electron emission coefficient of the material. If the ratio increases, a signal of the conductive region <b>202</b> is eliminated by spread of the orbit of the secondary electron, and hence the contrast becomes very low.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref>, when the ratio of area between the conductive region <b>202</b> and the insulation region <b>203</b> is small, a difference of contrast is relatively small. When the ratio of area between the conductive region and the insulation region is 1:2, the difference of contrast is controlled to be approximately 0.3. However, as the area of the insulation region <b>203</b> in the sample surface increases, contrast of the LEEM type is increased, but contrast of the conventional SEM type is decreased. When the ratio of area between the conductive region and the insulation region is 1:10, the difference of contrast reaches 0.75.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">In this way, the LEEM type sample observation is effective particularly for observation of the sample <b>200</b> having a low ratio of the conductive material <b>202</b>.

In addition, on the contrary, when an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region, observation can be performed effectively also for the sample <b>200</b> having a low ratio of the insulation material <b>203</b> and a high ratio of the conductive material <b>202</b> in the sample surface.</p>

<p id="p-0309" num="0308">In the electro-optical inspection apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b><i>a </i>has a plurality of NA apertures <b>361</b> and <b>362</b> having different sizes, and is moved in the horizontal direction so that the NA aperture <b>361</b> and the NA aperture <b>362</b> can be switched.

<p id="p-0310" num="0309">As described above, because the NA moving mechanism is disposed, signals from the sample surface can be selected effectively so that high contrast can be obtained.

It is necessary to eliminate or reduce as much as possible dust or particles generated by the apparatus itself in ultrafine pattern inspection or foreign matter inspection according to the present invention. It is because that the inspection using this apparatus is usually performed after cleaning or before exposure of the sample, and if dust or particles adhere in this case, the dust or particles cause increase of defects in the exposure process or increase of defects in a process after the cleaning Therefore, using the method and apparatus described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 14</figref>, the adhesion of the dust or particles can be prevented as much as possible so that reliability of the apparatus can be maintained. In addition, if the apparatus includes the SEM mounted on the same chamber as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the generated dust or particles can be confirmed promptly after the inspection. Therefore, efficiency of the process can be improved effectively. In addition, there is an effect of preventing adhesion of dust or particles that may be caused when a sample is put in another independent review apparatus.</p>

<p id="p-0317" num="0316"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a structure of the detector <b>400</b> of the electro-optical inspection apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 33</figref>, which is suitable for high resolution observation. When an electron direct incident type EB-CCD or EB-TDI is used as the detector <b>400</b>, compared with the conventional MCP, fiber optical plate (FOP), fluorescent screen, and TDI, an image having three times higher contrast than the conventional one can be obtained because no deterioration occurs due to MCP and FOP transmission. In particular, when light from the bottom of the hole of the contact structure (<b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>) is detected, the spot (dot) becomes blurred in the conventional detector. In contrast, according to the detector <b>400</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, high contrast can be obtained. In addition, because no deterioration of gain occurs due to use of MCP, unevenness of luminance on the effective screen does not occur so that the exchange period is long. Therefore, it is possible to reduce cost and time for maintaining the detector <b>400</b>. In this way, the EB-CCD and the EB-TDI are preferred for obtaining a high contrast image and in view of durability.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, an example of the form of using the EB-CCD and the EB-TDI is described. The detector <b>400</b> illustrated as an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> has a structure in which an EB-TDI <b>482</b> and an EB-CCD <b>481</b> are switched so as to be exchanged according to the use. The EB-CCD <b>481</b> and the EB-TDI <b>482</b> are electron sensors for receiving an electron beam, and the electrons enter the detection surface directly. The EB-CCD <b>481</b> is used for optical axis adjustment of the electron beam and for adjusting and optimizing imaging conditions. On the other hand, when the EB-TDI <b>482</b> is used, the EB-CCD <b>481</b> is moved away from the optical axis by a moving mechanism M, and imaging is performed by the EB-TDI <b>482</b> by using conditions determined when the EB-CCD <b>481</b> is used or by referring to the conditions so that the sample surface is observed.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">As described above, the detector <b>400</b> having the above-mentioned structure can obtain an image of a semiconductor wafer by the EB-TDI <b>482</b> using the electro-optical conditions determined when the EB-CCD <b>481</b> is used or referring to the conditions. It is also possible to evaluate a defect of the pattern by taking a review image using the EB-CCD <b>481</b> after inspection of the sample surface by the EB-TDI <b>482</b>. In this case, the EB-CCD <b>481</b> can accumulate images so that noise can be reduced. Thus, it is possible to take a review image of a defect detection part with a high S/N ratio. In this case, it is further effective to use the EB-CCD <b>481</b> having a smaller pixel than the EB-TDI <b>482</b>. In other words, it is possible to take an image with a large number of pixels with respect to a size of the signal enlarged by a mapping projection optical system. Thus, an image for inspection or classification/determination of the type of the defect or the like can be taken with higher resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">Note that, the EB-TDI <b>482</b> has a rectangular shape, for example, in which pixels are arranged in a two-dimensional manner so as to receive the electrons directly for forming an electron image. A pixel size thereof is 12 to 16 &#x3bc;m, for example. On the other hand, a pixel size of the EB-CCD <b>481</b> is 6 to 8 &#x3bc;m, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">In addition, the EB-TDI <b>482</b> is formed in a shape of a package <b>485</b>. The package <b>485</b> itself works as a feed-through, and pins <b>483</b> of the package are connected to a camera <b>484</b> on the air side.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">Adopting the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, it is possible to eliminate drawbacks such as an optical conversion loss due to the FOP, optical glass for hermetic seal, an optical lens, or the like, aberration and distortion in optical transmission, deterioration of image resolution due to the aberration and distortion, a detection failure, high cost, and a large scale.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">As described above, as in the present invention, by utilizing the mirror electrons generated in the transition region, the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region are separated from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region, and then an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, or an image is obtained under the opposite condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region. Thus, conspicuously higher contrast can be obtained than the image obtained by sample observation without separating the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">In addition, it is very effective to use the method and apparatus described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> and further use the method and apparatus described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. In the method of using the EB-CCD or the EB-TDI, the deterioration factor due to the detector can be reduced significantly. Therefore, it is possible to obtain an image with little deterioration of contrast and with high contrast. Therefore, a variation of contrast of the image due to a difference of the NA position can be clearly known with high accuracy when forming conditions for obtaining an image having high contrast by the NA position adjustment or performing inspection. Therefore, the NA position adjustment can be performed with high accuracy. Further, because a high contrast image can be obtained, inspection sensitivity in the pattern inspection or the foreign matter inspection can be increased. Therefore, in the apparatus including the SEM in the same chamber as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is possible to perform review of a finer defect in short time even if the defect review is performed based on the inspection result. In addition, it is necessary to prevent dust or particles from adhering by using the apparatus, and it is very effective to use the method and apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 14</figref> as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. The adhesion amount of dust or particles increases only by introducing the sample to another apparatus for review or the like. If the same chamber is used, the number of times of conveying the sample and the number of times of passing through the load lock can be reduced, and operations of the stage can be reduced. Further, on the same stage, the position shift in the review is small (&#x2155; to 1/20), and a period of time for searching for a defect position or the number of times of changing the field of view (FOV) can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">However, according to the study performed by the inventors of the present invention, it has been found that if the insulation region and the conductive region are formed on the sample to be observed, and if it is necessary to detect both a short defect and an open defect on the sample surface with high accuracy, there could be a case where one type of defect can be detected easily while the other type of defect can be hardly detected only by obtaining an image under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, or obtaining an image under the opposite condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">Specifically, if an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, there is a case where a short defect can be detected easily, but an open defect can be hardly detected.

<p id="p-0327" num="0326">Based on this knowledge, according to the sample observation method of the present invention, an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, and another image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region. Then, based on those images, a short defect and an open defect on the sample surface are both detected with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">In other words, in the sample observation method according to the present invention, the sample surface including the insulation region and the conductive region is irradiated with the imaging electron beam having landing energy (LE) adjusted to the transition region in which the electrons having structural information of the sample surface include both the mirror electrons and the secondary electrons. Then, images of the sample surface irradiated with the imaging electron beam are taken under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region (Condition A) and under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region (Condition B).

<p id="p-0342" num="0341">The reason why this phenomenon occurs is considered as follows. Specifically, when an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region (Condition A), electrons emitted from the conductive material in the vicinity of a short defect or an open defect are diffused, and due to the action, the short defect part is imaged to be wider, while the open defect part is imaged to be narrower. On the contrary, when an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region (Condition B), electrons emitted from a short defect or an open defect are diffused, and due to the action, the short defect part is imaged to be narrower, while the open defect part is imaged to be wider.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">In this way, an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, and another image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region. Thus, based on the images having reverse contrast, both a short defect and an open defect on the sample surface can be detected with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">Hereinafter, description is given based on a specific example.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">The sample used in this example has a pattern of line and space (L&#x26;S) similarly to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A to 36C</figref> and <b>37</b>A to <b>37</b>C. On the surface of the sample, there are formed a region (conductive region) <b>202</b> of Cu as conductive material and a region (insulation region) <b>203</b> of SiO<sub>2 </sub>as insulation material, and a width of line and a width of space are both 43 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38A and 38B</figref> show results of experiment performed for determining an optimal value of the landing energy (LE) of the imaging electron beam that irradiates the sample surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</figref> is a table showing the landing energy (LE), luminance values [DN] of the conductive material and the insulation material, and the contrast. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref> is a graph of this table, in which the horizontal axis represents the landing energy (LE), the left vertical axis represents the luminance values [DN] of the conductive material and the insulation material, and the right vertical axis represents the contrast. Note that, imaging in this case was performed by adjusting the center of the NA aperture <b>361</b> of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to substantially the same position as the center of orbit of the electron ec emitted from the conductive region <b>202</b>.

<p id="p-0347" num="0346">In this example, when the landing energy (LE) is 3.2 eV, the highest contrast (0.41) is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A and 39B</figref> show results of experiment performed for determining an optimal value of dose of the charged electron beam that irradiates the sample surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</figref> is a table showing beam dose [mC/cm<sup>2</sup>], luminance values [DN] of the conductive material and the insulation material, and the contrast. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39B</figref> is a graph of this table, in which the horizontal axis represents the beam dose [mC/cm<sup>2</sup>], the left vertical axis represents the luminance values [DN] of the conductive material and the insulation material, and the right vertical axis represents the contrast. Imaging in this case was also performed by adjusting the center of the NA aperture <b>361</b> of the NA aperture plate <b>360</b> to substantially the same position as the center of orbit of the electron ec emitted from the conductive region <b>202</b>. The beam dose is defined as a product of beam current density and irradiation time.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">In this example, the contrast increases along with the dose, but the contrast is saturated at a dose of approximately 2 mC/cm<sup>2</sup>.

<p id="p-0350" num="0349">In the present invention, the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region are separated from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region so that high contrast is obtained. Thus, a short defect and an open defect are both detected with high sensitivity and high accuracy. Such separation between the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region and the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region can be performed by position adjustment of the NA aperture. Therefore, in the present invention, distributions of electrons from the conductive region and the insulation region of the sample surface are directly observed in an NA imaging mode, and hence the position adjustment of the NA aperture can be performed with high accuracy. Hereinafter, an example of a specific procedure is described.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">The projection lens <b>370</b> disposed between the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> and the detector <b>400</b> was set to a predetermined voltage of 5,500V, and a positional relationship at the position of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> between distributions of the electrons ec having surface structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> and the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> was checked in the NA imaging mode. Specifically, the dose of the charged electron beam was changed so as to check how much the change of the dose caused a shift of the distribution state (center of orbit) of the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> from the distribution state (center of orbit) of the electrons ec having surface structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A and 40B</figref> are diagrams illustrating results of position confirmation of the electron distribution in the NA imaging mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref> is a table showing the beam dose [mC/cm<sup>2</sup>] and a shift of a distribution state of the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation material <b>203</b>, namely a shift from a distribution state of the electrons ec having surface structural information of the conductive material <b>202</b>, when being irradiated with the charged electron beam of the dose. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40B</figref> is a graph of this table, in which the horizontal axis represents the beam dose [mC/cm<sup>2</sup>], and the left vertical axis represents a shift of the distribution state of the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation material <b>203</b>. Here, the shift direction was set to the Y direction. Note that, the shift of the distribution state of the electrons ei indicated in the left vertical axis is a normalized value. The normalization of the shift was performed by setting 0 as the position of the NA aperture transmitting the electrons from the conductive material, and setting 1 as the position of the NA aperture of the condition where the contrast was reversed. In addition, based on the results of the experiment for optimizing the dose of the charged electron beam described above, an upper limit value of the irradiation amount of the charged electron beam was set to 2 mC/cm<sup>2</sup>. Further, as a reference, the same experiment was performed on a sample having an L&#x26;S width of 35 nm and a sample having an L&#x26;S width of 65 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">According to the results illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A and 40B</figref>, the dose of the charged electron beam is substantially proportional to a shift of the distribution state of the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b>. Therefore, considering the results of the experiment for optimizing the dose of the charged electron beam, it is understood that in order to separate the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region so as to obtain high contrast, the irradiation amount of the charged electron beam should be set to approximately 2 mC/cm<sup>2</sup>, and further the NA aperture <b>361</b> of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> should be shifted in the Y direction by a predetermined amount, so that imaging is performed under the condition where the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region <b>202</b> are selectively guided to the detector <b>400</b> and under the condition where the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region <b>203</b> are selectively guided to the detector <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">In addition, according to the results illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A and 40B</figref>, in the sample having a large wiring width (L&#x26;S width), a variation of the substrate potential (&#x394;V) becomes large because of a large volume of the insulation region. Therefore, the shift of the distribution of the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation material <b>203</b> is also large. On the contrary, as the wiring width (L&#x26;S width) decreases, the volume of the insulation material decreases. Therefore, a variation of the substrate potential (&#x394;V) becomes small so that high contrast can be hardly obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">As described above, through the irradiation with the charged electron beam, the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region can be easily separated from the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region. As a result, high contrast can be obtained easily. This is because the irradiation with the charged electron beam causes a variation of the substrate potential (&#x394;V) so that the distribution of the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation material is shifted. This means that the shift of the distribution of the electrons ei having surface structural information of the insulation material can be estimated from the variation of the substrate potential (&#x394;V).</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A and 41B</figref> show results of experiment performed for determining an optimal value of the landing energy (LE) of the imaging electron beam irradiated to the sample surface in an electrified state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref> is a table showing the landing energy (LE), luminance values [DN] of the conductive material and the insulation material, and the contrast. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref> is a graph of this table, in which the horizontal axis represents the landing energy (LE), the left vertical axis represents the luminance values [DN] of the conductive material and the insulation material, and the right vertical axis represents the contrast. Note that, imaging in this case was also performed by adjusting the center of the NA aperture <b>361</b> of the NA adjustment aperture plate <b>360</b> to substantially the same position as the center of orbit of the electron ec emitted from the conductive region <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">Comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref>, it is understood that higher contrast (7.8) was obtained in the case where the sample surface in the electrified state was irradiated with the imaging electron beam (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref>) than in the case where the sample surface in a non-electrified state was irradiated with the imaging electron beam (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref>). The landing energy (LE) corresponding to this is shifted to the low energy side. This is because, as described above, the substrate potential changed (by approximately 1V) because the insulation region of the sample surface was electrified, and as a result, the center of orbit of the electron ei omitted from the insulation region <b>203</b> was conspicuously shifted from the center of orbit of the electron ec emitted from the electrified region <b>202</b>, and hence the degree of separation between the electrons ec having structural information of the conductive region and the electrons ei having structural information of the insulation region was increased.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">Therefore, it is possible to estimate the shift of the center of orbit of the electron ei emitted from the insulation region <b>203</b> by knowing in advance how the optimal landing energy (LE) varies due to the electrified state (substrate potential) of the sample surface. In other words, the shift of the center position of orbit of the electron ei can be estimated from the substrate potential. Specifically, a shift of the substrate potential is read from a shift of the landing energy (LE) before and after the electrification. As described above, when the electrified state changes, energy (speed) of the electron changes, and hence the force received when the electron passes through the electromagnetic field generation means (E&#xd7;B deflector) that is expressed by F=e&#xb7;(v&#xd7;B) also changes. Therefore, an orbit shift when the electron passes through the E&#xd7;B deflector can be calculated. Further, the shift at the NA aperture position can be calculated from the orbit shift when the electron passes through the E&#xd7;B deflector. Therefore, an actual shift of the center position of orbit of the electron ei can be verified.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A and 42B</figref> are diagrams illustrating reverse of contrast by the NA aperture position adjustment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref> is a table showing luminance values [DN] of the conductive material and the insulation material, and the contrast, when the center position of the NA aperture was changed from substantially the same position as the center of orbit of the electron ec emitted from the conductive region (normalized position of 0) to a position in the Y direction (normalized position of 1.0). In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref> is a graph of this table, in which the horizontal axis represents the center position of the NA aperture [normalized position], the left vertical axis represents the luminance values [DN] of the conductive material and the insulation material, and the right vertical axis represents the contrast. Note that, imaging in this case was performed by irradiating the sample surface with the charged electron beam at 2 mC/cm<sup>2</sup>, with the center position of the NA aperture where the luminance of the conductive material became maximum being set as a normalized position of 0. Here, the &#x201c;normalized position&#x201d; means, as described above, a relative coordinate when the NA aperture position passing through the electrons from the conductive material is set as 0 while the NA aperture position where the contrast is reversed is set as 1.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A and 42B</figref>, as the NA aperture position is shifted in the Y direction from the normalized position of 0, the luminance of the conductive material is decreased while the luminance of the insulation material is increased. As a result, the contrast is decreased gradually. Further, when the center position of the NA aperture is a normalized position of 0.6, the luminance of the conductive material is the same as the luminance of the insulation material so that contrast cannot be obtained. As the NA aperture position is further shifted in the Y direction, the luminance of the conductive material is further decreased while the luminance of the insulation material is further increased. As a result, contrast is reversed and is increased gradually. In this way, by adjusting the NA aperture position, the contrast can be reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> is a diagram conceptually illustrating the reverse of contrast due to the NA aperture position adjustment. When the center position of the NA aperture is at substantially the same position as the center of orbit of the electron ec emitted from the conductive region (normalized position NP=0), the electrons ec are mainly guided to the detector. As the center position of the NA aperture is shifted in the Y direction, the amount of the electrons ec that can pass through the NA aperture is decreased while the amount of the electrons ei that can pass through the NA aperture is increased. At a normalized position NP=0.6, the amounts of both the electrons become the same so that there is no difference of luminance and contrast cannot be obtained. As the center position of the NA aperture is further shifted in the Y direction, the amount of the electrons ec that can pass through the NA aperture is further decreased while the amount of the electrons ei that can pass through the NA aperture is further increased. At a normalized position NP=1.0, the amounts of both the electrons are reversed so that the contrast is reversed.</p>

<p id="p-0363" num="0362">First, the landing energy (LE) of the imaging electron beam is adjusted to the above-mentioned transition region (Step <b>102</b>), and the sample surface to be observed including the insulation region and the conductive region is irradiated with the imaging electron beam (Step <b>103</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">The NA aperture position is adjusted in the plane by the NA aperture moving mechanism, and hence the center position of the NA aperture is adjusted to the center of orbit of the electron ec having structural information of the conductive region (Step <b>104</b>). Then, in this state, the landing energy (LE) of the imaging electron beam is adjusted so that a difference of luminance between the insulation region and the conductive region, namely the material contrast, becomes maximum (Step <b>105</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">Next, the sample surface is irradiated with the charged electron beam having a predetermined dose so that the insulation region is electrified (Step <b>106</b>), and it is checked how much degree the center of orbit of the electron ei from the insulation region in the electrified state is shifted at the NA aperture position (Step <b>107</b>). After that, Step S<b>106</b> and Step <b>107</b> are repeated, to thereby determine dependence on the dose of the orbit shift of the electron ei from the insulation region in the electrified state (Step <b>108</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">When the dependence on the dose of the orbit shift of the electron ei from the insulation region in the electrified state is determined (Yes in Step <b>108</b>), an appropriate dose is determined based on the data (Step <b>109</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">After the appropriate dose is determined, the landing energy (LE) of the imaging electron beam is adjusted again. Specifically, the sample surface is irradiated with the charged electron beam of the appropriate dose determined by the above-mentioned procedure, and in this state, the landing energy (LE) for obtaining the maximum material contrast is determined (Step <b>110</b>). Then, an image of the sample surface irradiated with the imaging electron beam of this landing energy (LE) is obtained to measure the material contrast (Step <b>111</b>). As described above in relation to Step <b>107</b>, the center position of the NA aperture in this case is at the center of orbit of the electron ec having structural information of the conductive region. Therefore, the luminance of the obtained image is relatively high in the conductive region and relatively low in the insulation region.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">Next, the center position of the NA aperture is moved by the amount of the orbit shift of the electron ei when the irradiation with the charged electron beam of the appropriate dose is performed, so that the center position of the NA aperture coincides with the center of orbit of the electron ei. Then, in this state, the material contrast is measured again (Step <b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">As described above, when this adjustment of the center position of the NA aperture is performed, the material contrast is reversed so that an image must be obtained in which the luminance of the insulation region is relatively high while the luminance of the conductive region is relatively low. Therefore, when the reverse of the material contrast is confirmed (Yes in Step <b>113</b>), the process is finished (Step <b>114</b>). When the reverse of the material contrast is not confirmed (No in Step <b>113</b>), which means a certain problem has occurred in the procedure up to here, the process flow returns to Step <b>102</b> and the process is performed again.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">According to the above-mentioned procedure, the dependence on the dose of the electron orbit shift is determined and the reverse of the material contrast is confirmed, thereby completing setting of conditions necessary for the sample observation of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> is a flowchart illustrating, by means of an example, a procedure of the sample observation method of the present invention. Some steps have been described above and hence details thereof are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">The sample observation method according to a preferred aspect of the present invention includes Step <b>203</b> in which the sample surface including the insulation region and the conductive region is irradiated with the imaging electron beam having the landing energy (LE) for obtaining the maximum material contrast, and Steps <b>205</b> and <b>207</b> in which the electrons having structural information of the sample surface irradiated by the imaging electron beam are detected so that a sample surface image is obtained.

<p id="p-0383" num="0382">As described above, when an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, a short defect can be detected easily, but there is a case where it is difficult to detect an open defect. In addition, on the contrary to this, when an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region, an open defect can be detected easily, but there is a case where it is difficult to detect a short defect. Therefore, in order to detect both the short defect and the open defect on the sample surface including the insulation region and the conductive region with high accuracy, it is not sufficient to obtain an image only under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, or on the contrary, to obtain an image only under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">According to the sample observation method of the present invention, an image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, and another image is obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region. Thus, based on the images, both a short defect and an open defect on the sample surface can be detected with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">In other words, by using the sample surface image obtained by the above-mentioned sample observation method according to the present invention, it is possible to detect presence or absence of a short defect with high sensitivity and high accuracy from the image obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, and to detect presence or absence of an open defect with high sensitivity and high accuracy from the image obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region. Therefore, the method can be used also as a high-sensitivity and high-accuracy sample inspection method.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">Hereinafter, an example is described in which the sample surface defect inspection was performed by the above-mentioned method.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">A sample to be observed was prepared similarly to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A to 36C</figref> and <b>37</b>A to <b>37</b>C, having a line and space (L&#x26;S) pattern of a region of Cu as conductive material (conductive region) and a region of SiO<sub>2 </sub>as insulation material (insulation region). Note that, the line width and the space width were both set to 43 nm. Various sizes of short defects and open defects were formed in a part of the conductive region of the L&#x26;S pattern, and those defects were detected.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">When the sample observation was performed, an acceleration voltage of the electron source beam was set to &#x2212;4,005V, and a surface potential of the sample <b>200</b> was set to &#x2212;4,002.6V. Therefore, the landing energy (LE) of the imaging electron beam was 2.4 eV in the transition region in which the electrons having structural information of the sample surface included both the mirror electrons and the secondary electrons. In addition, the aperture diameter of the NA aperture <b>361</b> was set to 100 to 300 &#x3bc;m, the insulation region was electrified by being irradiated with the charged electron beam prior to imaging (electrified amount was 2 mC/cm<sup>2</sup>), and current density of the imaging electron beam was set to 1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. Imaging was performed in this state. Note that, an inspection pixel size for defect inspection was set to 29 nm square by setting the magnification of the electro-optical system lens. In addition, an inspection speed was set to 50 mega pixels per second (MPPS).</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A to 47C</figref> are tables showing results of the defect inspection performed in the above-mentioned condition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47A</figref> is a table showing whether or not a defect could be detected from the image obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region was higher than the luminance of the insulation region. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47B</figref> is a table showing whether or not a defect could be detected from the image obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region was higher than the luminance of the conductive region. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47C</figref> is a table showing whether or not a defect could be detected as a combination of the above-mentioned two defect detection results. In those tables, a circle means that a defect could be detected, a cross means that a defect could not be detected, and a double circle means that a defect could be detected in both inspections.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">As understood from those results, according to the image obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, a short defect can be detected with high accuracy, and on the other hand, according to the image obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region, an open defect can be detected with high accuracy. This means that an open defect may be overlooked according to the image obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region, while a short defect may be overlooked according to the image obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">In contrast, as in the present invention, if it is determined whether or not a defect exists from an image obtained under the condition where the luminance of the conductive region is higher than the luminance of the insulation region and an image obtained under the condition where the luminance of the insulation region is higher than the luminance of the conductive region, both a short defect and an open defect having a size larger than at least 25 nm can be detected with high sensitivity and high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">The electro-optical inspection apparatus and the sample observation method of the present invention described above can be used, for instance, in a semiconductor manufacturing process, for observation or inspection of a surface of a semiconductor wafer after processing the semiconductor wafer. Using the electro-optical inspection apparatus and the sample observation method according to the present invention for observing the semiconductor wafer whose sample surface includes an insulation region and a conductive region, an image with high contrast can be obtained for inspecting quality of the semiconductor wafer. Thus, the electro-optical inspection apparatus and the sample observation method of the present invention can be effective means for manufacturing a semiconductor wafer without a defect. In this way, the electro-optical inspection apparatus and the sample observation method according to the present invention can be used appropriately in a semiconductor manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">Here, when a scanning type or mapping projection type electron microscope, namely an electro-optical inspection apparatus, is used for wiring inspection or defect inspection of a sample surface, the sample surface may be charged up (electrified) due to friction with air during air conveyance or irradiation with an electron beam in vacuum. When the charge-up occurs on the sample surface, there is a problem that the electron beam irradiating the sample surface is detected as being affected by the secondary electrons charged up in the sample, and hence an image of the sample is blurred.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">As a measure against the above-mentioned problem that an image of the sample is blurred because the charge-up occurs on the sample surface, for example, there is proposed a method of inspecting a defect of a sample as described in PCT 1999-046798 (Patent Document 5). In this method of inspecting a defect of a sample, a difference of distance to be focused is converted into a charge-up amount on the sample. In addition, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2002-033068 (Patent Document 6) discloses a sample defect inspection, in which a scanning type electron microscope is used, and a retarding voltage is applied to the sample for suppressing the charge-up of the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">In a static electricity removing method for the charged-up sample, ionized gas in air or in a certain type of gas is usually used. However, in this static electricity removing method, there is a fear that the sample is charged up again after the removal of static electricity due to friction with air during air conveyance. In addition, when removing static electricity due to the charge-up of the sample by the irradiation with the electron beam in vacuum, it is also necessary to return the sample once to the air side, which is not efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">However, in the method disclosed in Patent Document 5, a map indicating a difference of distance to be focused of the charged-up sample (voltage map) is generated, and the focus of the charged-up sample is merely changed based on the map. Therefore, static electricity due to the charge-up on the sample surface is not removed. In addition, in the method disclosed in Patent Document 6, in order to suppress the charge-up of the sample due to the irradiation with the electron beam, a retarding voltage RTD is merely applied. Therefore, there is a fear that the sample surface is charged up again, and static electricity due to the charge-up on the sample surface by natural electrification is not removed.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">Hereinafter, an inspection method for a sample surface according to the present invention is described, which is capable of efficiently removing static electricity due to the charge-up on the sample surface caused not only by electrification of an electron beam but also by natural electrification of air.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example, it is supposed that the potential of the sample <b>200</b> before being irradiated with the electron beam EB is a constant value (here, 0 V, for example). The mean luminance meanDN when the sample surface is irradiated with the electron beam EB having the effective landing energy LEeff of 0V is denoted by &#x201c;A&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>.

<p id="p-0405" num="0404">For instance, it is supposed that an arbitrary region of the sample surface is irradiated with the electron beam, and mean luminance distribution (luminance difference) &#x394;DN on the sample surface is detected.

Luminance Difference &#x394;DN=(Mean Luminance meanDN)&#x2212;(Standard Luminance A)</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">Then, the case where the mean luminance distribution (luminance difference) &#x394;DN is positive, namely, the luminance difference &#x394;DN is higher than the standard luminance A, and the case where the mean luminance distribution (luminance difference) &#x394;DN is negative, namely, the luminance difference &#x394;DN is lower than the standard luminance A are studied. It is supposed that an arbitrary region of the sample surface is irradiated with the electron beam having the reference landing energy LE<b>0</b> of 2.5 eV, for example. If the mean luminance meanDN is higher than the standard luminance A, it means that the sample surface potential &#x394;V is shifted to the negative side, namely, the sample surface is electrified negatively as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>. If the mean luminance meanDN is lower than the standard luminance A, it means that the sample surface potential &#x394;V is shifted to the positive side, namely, the sample surface is electrified positively as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>. Specifically, first, the luminance that is detected when the arbitrary region of the sample surface is irradiated with the electron beam having the reference landing energy LE<b>0</b> of, for example, 2.5 eV is regarded as 100, for example, and the detected luminance of 100 is referred to as the standard luminance A. Next, the arbitrary region of the sample surface was irradiated with the electron beam whose arbitrary landing energy LE was set to, for example, 3.5 eV, the luminance was 130.

<p id="p-0413" num="0412"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> is a diagram illustrating a change of the sample surface potential &#x394;V when an arbitrary region of the sample surface is irradiated with the electron beam while changing the arbitrary landing energy LE, namely, when the &#x201c;Pre-Dose&#x201d; is performed and then the electron beam whose reference landing energy LE<b>0</b> is set is irradiated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, first, the &#x201c;Pre-Dose&#x201d; is performed on an arbitrary region of the sample surface. When this &#x201c;Pre-Dose&#x201d; is performed, an arbitrary region of the sample surface is irradiated with the electron beam whose arbitrary landing energy LE is set to 3, 8, 14, and 22 eV, for example. Next, the arbitrary region of the sample surface is irradiated with the electron beam whose reference landing energy LE<b>0</b> is set to 2.5 eV, for example. The luminance difference &#x394;DN is determined from the mean luminance meanDN detected by the irradiation with the electron beam including the &#x201c;Pre-Dose&#x201d; and the standard luminance A. Then, using this luminance difference &#x394;DN, the sample surface potential &#x394;V is determined with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">As to the sample surface potential &#x394;V determined from the luminance difference &#x394;DN illustrated in (a) to (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, it is understood that the landing energy LE that becomes brighter than the standard luminance A (electrified negatively) and the landing energy LE that becomes darker than the standard luminance A (electrified positively) are present when an arbitrary region of the sample surface is irradiated in advance with the electron beam whose arbitrary landing energy LE is set, namely when the Pre-Dose is performed. From this, it is understood that a potential of the sample surface can be electrified positively or negatively in advance by adjusting the landing energy LE of the electron beam arbitrarily when being irradiated with the electron beam by the Pre-Dose.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">According to the above-mentioned result, the sample surface potential &#x394;V can be electrified positively or negatively by changing the effective landing energy LEeff to be set for the electron beam irradiating the sample surface. Thus, it is possible to reset the electrified state of an arbitrary region of the sample surface to a standard potential (or to an arbitrary potential state) by irradiating the region with the electron beam having the luminance difference &#x394;DN obtained by subtracting the standard luminance A, which is obtained when the sample surface is irradiated with the electron beam having the reference landing energy LE<b>0</b>, from the mean luminance meanDN, which is obtained when the sample surface is irradiated with the electron beam having an arbitrary landing energy LE, namely the electron beam having the landing energy LE that acts opposite electrification with respect to a result of determination as to whether the sample surface is electrified positively or negatively. The following embodiment has a feature in that the function of removing static electricity of the electrification on the sample surface or setting a potential of the sample surface to an arbitrary potential using this principle is applied to an apparatus for inspecting a sample surface.</p>

<p id="p-0418" num="0417">Using position information (XY coordinates) of each region of the sample surface and potential information of each region of the sample surface obtained from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53A and 53B</figref>, and also using the potential of the sample surface that can be adjusted by the Pre-Dose illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, thereby irradiating the region in which the sample surface potential &#x394;V illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53B</figref> is +1V with the electron beam having the arbitrary landing energy LE for electrifying the potential of the sample surface to &#x2212;1V by the Pre-Dose, the region in which the potential &#x394;V is +1V can be set to 0V. Similarly, by irradiating other regions electrified to potentials of &#x2212;1V and +0.5V with the electron beam having an arbitrary landing energy LE by the Pre-Dose, the other regions can be also set to 0V. Further, in addition to setting each region of the potential of the sample surface to 0V uniformly by the Pre-Dose, it is possible to set each region of the potential of the sample surface to an arbitrary potential so as to set a uniform potential distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">In addition, by adjusting the effective landing energy LEeff of the electron beam irradiating the sample surface by using the above-mentioned Pre-Dose, it is possible to set the sample surface to a dark field (electrified positively) or a bright field (electrified negatively). The sample surface is set to the dark field mainly for inspecting dust or particles (made of insulation material) on the sample (conductor such as Si or Cr). In this case, the entire sample surface is set to the dark field so that the dust or particles on the sample glitter for detection.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a specific example of the sample to be inspected.

If a pattern inspection is mainly performed on this sample, it is necessary to set the sample surface to the bright field. In the pattern inspection of this sample, in order to detect black and white contrast for inspecting a defect or the like of the pattern portion <b>240</b> (for example, in the case of inspecting a top surface of the sample made of an oxide under which there is a conductor containing mainly Cr or Si), the effective landing energy LEeff of the electron beam irradiating the entire sample is adjusted so that the portion to be inspected has high brightness according to the material to be detected as &#x201c;white&#x201d; (one of different materials constituting the pattern), namely so that the portion to be inspected is set to the bright field.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">As described above, in the method of setting the potential distribution of the sample surface according to the embodiment of the present invention, the electron beam having an arbitrary landing energy LE is irradiated to scan the region in which the potential distribution of the sample surface should be known. Then, luminance of the region is detected, and the luminance difference between the standard luminance and the luminance of the scanned region is determined, to thereby determine the (X,Y) distribution of the luminance difference &#x394;DN of each scanned region. As to this (X,Y) distribution of the luminance difference &#x394;DN, a difference from the standard luminance is determined, and hence it is possible to determine a shift of the landing energy LE from the reference landing energy LE<b>0</b> corresponding to the standard luminance in a certain region, namely a variation of the potential &#x394;V [V] of the sample surface in a certain region. In addition, the above-mentioned Pre-Dose may be performed according to the variation of the potential &#x394;V [V] of the sample surface so that the potential distribution of the sample surface can be adjusted.</p>

<p id="p-0434" num="0433">The transmittance &#x3b1; is a function of landing energy LE of the electron beam for irradiation and a thickness t of the sample (in particular, a thickness of the resist), and hence an increase of the sample surface potential &#x394;V can be 0 under the condition satisfying f(LE, t)=1&#x2212;&#x3b7; where &#x3b1;=f(LE, t). Thus, an influence of the charge up (electrification) of the sample surface can be minimized. On the contrary, if the thickness t of the sample is known, the transmittance a can be controlled by combination with the landing energy LE, and hence the condition can be used differently so that the sample surface is electrified positively if f(LE, t)=&#x3b1;&#x3e;1&#x2212;&#x3b7; holds, while the sample surface is electrified negatively if f(LE, t)=&#x3b1;&#x3c;1&#x2212;&#x3b7; holds. Using this principle, it is possible to equalize the potential distributions by examining a potential distribution existing locally on the sample surface and by irradiating with the electron beam having the landing energy LE for canceling the potential.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">As described above, in a sample surface observation apparatus or a sample surface inspection apparatus using an electron beam for inspecting a sample, energy of the electron beam irradiating the sample is set according to physical properties of the surface material occupying most of the sample surface to be observed or inspected. In this setting, by setting the energy of the electron beam so that f(LE, t)=1&#x2212;&#x3b7; holds as described above, an influence of electrification of the sample surface can be minimized so that a clear image or an inspection result with high sensitivity can be obtained. For instance, when the electron beam irradiates a sample surface of a sample having regions of different thicknesses t made of the same material, if the secondary electron emission ratio &#x3b7; of the sample surface can be determined first by irradiating the primary electron beam having a condition (&#x3b1;=0) such that the electron beam cannot penetrate absolutely, it is possible to calculate the transmittance a of the electron beam in the region having a small thickness t made of the same material (such thickness that the irradiated electron beam can penetrate). In addition, by using the above-mentioned parameters such as the luminance difference (&#x394;DN), the dose, and the variation of the sample surface potential &#x394;V, it is also possible to examine the distribution of capacitance C of the sample surface, the distribution of the secondary electron emission ratio &#x3b7;, and the distribution of the thickness t of the sample.</p>

<p id="p-0438" num="0437">A thermal electron emission type electron gun <b>2132</b> is used as the electron beam generating source <b>2120</b>. This thermal electron emission type electron gun <b>2132</b> uses mainly lanthanum hexaboride (LaB<sub>6</sub>), but it is possible to use a filament made of tungsten, or a cathode made of a tungsten-based compound such as thoriated tungsten (Th&#x2014;W) or tungsten carbide (W2C), or made of oxide such as (barium (Ba), strontium (Sr), or calcium (Ca))CO<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0438">The primary electro-optical system <b>2130</b> is means for guiding the first electron beam generated from the thermal electron emission type electron gun <b>2132</b> to the sample <b>200</b>, and includes an aperture <b>2122</b> and an electrostatic lens <b>2124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0439">The first electron beam generated from the thermal electron emission type electron gun <b>2132</b> has a circular, elliptical, or rectangular cross section formed by the aperture <b>2122</b> and the electrostatic lens <b>2124</b> of the primary electro-optical system <b>2130</b>, and is guided to the sample <b>200</b> for irradiation. It is desired that a size (beam diameter) of the first electron beam formed in a circular, elliptical, or rectangular shape be generally slightly larger than an element area of the TDI, the EB-TDI, the CCD, or the EB-CCD as the image sensor <b>2150</b>. In addition, the size of the primary electron beam may be adjusted for each image sensor <b>2150</b>, or may be set conforming to a size of the largest image sensor <b>2150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">As to the primary electron beam, a combination of the acceleration voltage Vacc for accelerating to arbitrary energy in the primary electro-optical system <b>2130</b> and the retarding voltage RTD is adjusted so as to adjust the landing energy LE of the first electron beam when the sample <b>200</b> is irradiated.

The combination of the acceleration voltage Vacc for setting energy of the primary electron beam and the retarding voltage RTD is changed according to desired information obtained from the sample <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">For instance, when a secondary electron image of the sample <b>200</b> is obtained, the acceleration voltage Vacc is set to 100 eV to a few thousands eV, for example, and the retarding voltage RTD is set to a set voltage of the secondary electro-optical system <b>2140</b> (straight propagation condition of an E&#xd7;B filter <b>2134</b> of the secondary electro-optical system <b>2140</b>). In the case of obtaining an electron (mirror electron) image generated by perfectly elastic collision between the primary electron beam irradiating the sample <b>200</b> and material of the sample <b>200</b>, the retarding voltage RTD is adjusted. In addition, in the case of obtaining an image of mirror electrons as reflection of the primary electron beam that irradiates the sample and is reflected in the vicinity of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> due to an influence of the electrified surface potential of the sample <b>200</b>, the landing energy LE is set to 0 eV to a few tens eV. In other words, by changing the combination of the acceleration voltage Vacc and the retarding voltage RTD, it is possible to obtain a relationship between the landing energy LE and the luminance difference as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">The X-Y stage <b>2112</b> is a support table for supporting the sample <b>200</b> and can move at least in the horizontal direction.

<p id="p-0444" num="0443">The secondary electro-optical system <b>2140</b> includes the E&#xd7;B filter <b>2134</b> and a plurality of electrostatic lenses <b>2136</b>. In the case of the mapping projection type electron microscope illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the primary electro-optical system <b>2130</b> is disposed obliquely to the optical axis of the secondary electro-optical system <b>2140</b>. The primary electron beam generated from the thermal electron emission type electron gun <b>2132</b> irradiates the sample <b>200</b> perpendicularly or substantially perpendicularly by action of the E&#xd7;B filter <b>2134</b> constituted of an electric field and a magnetic field, and the secondary electron beam coming back from the sample <b>200</b> propagates straight through the E&#xd7;B filter <b>2134</b> of the secondary electro-optical system <b>2140</b> in the vertical direction in the figure so as to be guided to the image sensor <b>2150</b> by action of the plurality of electrostatic lenses <b>2136</b>. Note that, the E&#xd7;B filter <b>2134</b> is included in both the primary electro-optical system <b>2130</b> and the secondary electro-optical system <b>2140</b>. Here, in the E&#xd7;B filter <b>2134</b>, the magnetic field and the electric field are orthogonal. The electric field is denoted by E, the magnetic field is denoted by B, and a speed of a charged particle (electron beam in this embodiment) is denoted by v. Then, the E&#xd7;B filter <b>2134</b> allows only charged particles satisfying the Wien condition of E=vB to propagate straight and bends orbits of other charged particles. In other words, the E&#xd7;B filter <b>2134</b> generates a force FB due to the magnetic field and a force FE due to the electric field with respect to the primary electron beam so that the orbit of the primary electron beam is bent and guided to the sample. On the other hand, with respect to the secondary electron beam, the E&#xd7;B filter <b>2134</b> generates the force FB due to the magnetic field and the force FE due to the electric field that act in opposite directions. Therefore, the forces are cancelled by each other, and hence the secondary electron beam is guided to the image sensor <b>2150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">The image sensor <b>2150</b> can also perform scan imaging by time delay integration (TDI). Before the TDI, there are disposed the micro channel plate (MCP) for amplifying the electron, the fluorescent screen for converting the amplified electron into light, a fiber optic plate (FOP) for guiding the light to the TDI, and the like. In addition, instead of the TDI, it is possible to use the EB-TDI that can directly receive the electrons (second electron beam) and convert the same to an image. In addition, in the case of taking a still image other than a scan image, it is possible to use a charge coupled device (CCD) instead of the TDI and to use an EB-CCD instead of the EB-TDI. Further, it is possible to dispose the EB-CCD before the TDI so as to use the TDI for the scan image and to use the EB-CCD for the still image. As the image sensor <b>2150</b>, various types of image sensors can be used, which can detect the electrons (second electron beam) generated from the sample surface simultaneously by a plurality of pixels as a plane.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0445">The image sensor <b>2150</b> is connected to a storage device <b>2152</b>. The storage device <b>2152</b> is connected to a control part <b>2160</b>.

<p id="p-0448" num="0447">Next to the vacuum chamber <b>2174</b> housing the X-Y stage <b>2112</b>, there is disposed a preliminary environmental chamber <b>2214</b> that can communicate with the vacuum chamber <b>2174</b> via a gate valve <b>2218</b> that is opened and closed. The preliminary environment chamber <b>2214</b> includes a temporary waiting place <b>2216</b> for the sample <b>200</b> before and after the inspection to wait. In addition, the preliminary environment chamber <b>2214</b> is provided with a dry pump <b>2210</b> and a turbo molecular pump <b>2212</b> that can perform vacuum evacuation so that the vacuum chambers <b>2172</b>, <b>2174</b>, and <b>2176</b> and the preliminary environment chamber <b>2214</b> can be evacuated to vacuum.

<p id="p-0450" num="0449">The potential distribution determination part <b>2163</b> determines the potential distribution of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> using the method described above as the principle.

<p id="p-0451" num="0450">Here, the adjustment method of the potential distribution of the sample surface performed by the control part <b>2160</b> is described with reference to a flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>. As illustrated in Step S<b>401</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, the retarding voltage adjustment part <b>2166</b> and the acceleration voltage adjustment part <b>2162</b> perform adjustment of the effective landing energy LEeff to be set for the primary electron beam irradiating the sample <b>200</b> to be inspected. The surface of the sample <b>200</b> is irradiated with the primary electron beam for which the effective landing energy LEeff is set, and the secondary electron beam coming back from the surface of the sample <b>200</b> is detected by the image sensor <b>2150</b>. The detected sample surface image is converted into the mean luminance. The sample <b>200</b> to be inspected is conveyed from the temporary waiting place <b>2216</b> of the preliminary environment chamber <b>2214</b> into the vacuum chamber <b>2174</b> when the gate valve <b>2218</b> is opened and closed. Then, the surface of the conveyed sample <b>200</b> is irradiated with the primary electron beam for which the effective landing energy LEeff adjusted by the acceleration voltage adjustment part <b>2162</b> and the retarding voltage adjustment part <b>2166</b> is set. The irradiation of the primary electron beam having the effective landing energy LEeff set therefor corresponds to the above-mentioned Pre-Dose. The primary electron beam having the effective landing energy LEeff set therefor irradiates the region to be inspected of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> or the entire region of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> with a magnification that is the same as the magnification specified by the inspection recipe (characteristic and material of the sample (mask)). The secondary electron beam coming back from the sample <b>200</b> due to the irradiation of the primary electron beam is detected by the image sensor <b>2150</b>, and the detected image is converted into the mean luminance so that the luminance distribution having potential distribution and position information of the sample <b>200</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">Next, the primary electron beam having the reference landing energy LE<b>0</b> set therefor irradiates the region to be inspected of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> or the entire region of the surface of the sample <b>200</b>. The luminance difference &#x394;DN is determined from the standard luminance A and the mean luminance meanDN detected by the electron beam irradiation including the &#x201c;Pre-Dose&#x201d; described above, and the potential &#x394;V of the region to be inspected or the entire region of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> is determined from the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> using the luminance difference &#x394;DN.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">Next, in Step S<b>402</b>, as to the obtained luminance distribution of the sample <b>200</b>, the potential distribution determination part <b>2163</b> of the control part <b>2160</b> determines the luminance difference &#x394;DN from a difference between the mean luminance meanDN and the standard luminance A of the sample surface. Then, with reference to the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, the potential &#x394;V is converted from the luminance difference &#x394;DN for each region to be measured of the surface of the sample <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">Next, in Step S<b>403</b>, correction of the potential distribution of the sample <b>200</b> is performed, in which the retarding voltage adjustment part <b>2166</b> and the acceleration voltage adjustment part <b>2162</b> adjust the landing energy LE to cancel the potential of each region of the sample <b>200</b> or to electrify the same to an arbitrary potential based on the obtained potential &#x394;V and the position information (X-Y coordinates) of the region to be measured of the surface of the sample <b>200</b>. In Step S<b>401</b>, the sample surface is irradiated with the primary electron beam again while the landing energy LE is adjusted for each region of the sample <b>200</b> irradiated with the primary electron beam, and hence the static electricity of the electrified sample <b>200</b> is removed or set to an arbitrary potential. The potentials of the inspection regions of the sample <b>200</b> are all equalized by the removal of static electricity or potential setting, and a variation of the sensitivity due to a difference of the electrified state among the inspection regions of the sample hardly occurs in the image detected when being irradiated with the primary electron beam. In addition, even in the case where the sample is inspected repeatedly, a variation of the potential distribution hardly occurs among the inspection regions.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">When the sample <b>200</b> is inspected, an influence of the electrification can be removed again by the adjustment of the retarding voltage RTD. In addition, when the potential of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> is adjusted by the retarding voltage RTD, the dose to the sample can be known from the current density of the electron gun and the inspection speed of the inspection apparatus. Therefore, an increase of potential of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> can be determined in advance by one inspection, and the effective landing energy LEeff can be constant by correcting the increase of potential by adjustment of the retarding voltage RTD. In other words, the luminance difference &#x394;DN between the mean luminance and the standard luminance of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> is converted into the potential distribution, and the converted potential distribution is used so that the potential of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> can be set to be uniform (static electricity is removed to 0V), or can be set to an arbitrary potential (a positive potential or a negative potential).</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">Next, the case where the sample <b>200</b> to be inspected is exchanged or the sample <b>200</b> is inspected again is described. When the sample <b>200</b> is exchanged or inspected again, there are a case where the potential distribution of the sample surface is changed and further a case where the entire potential distribution of the sample surface is changed. Therefore, when the sample is exchanged or the same sample is inspected again, it is necessary to adjust the landing energy LE for each inspection. In this case, luminance of an arbitrary region of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> is checked, and using the luminance distribution of the sample <b>200</b> described above, the landing energy LE is adjusted based on a difference between the mean luminance meanDN and the standard luminance A obtained from the luminance distribution. Thus, the potential distribution of the surface of the sample <b>200</b> can be adjusted again to be uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">As described above, as to the effective landing energy LEeff, optimized parameters other than the landing energy LE (for example, the NA position and the size of the inspection apparatus, the Wien condition, and the current density) are set according to the inspection recipe (characteristics or the like of the sample (mask)). Thus, the inspection with good reproducibility can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">Note that, the electro-optical inspection apparatus is used in a case where a defect of the sample surface pattern is inspected, in a case where dust or particles on the sample surface are detected, in a case where dust or particles on a multilayered film formed on the sample surface or a portion having different thickness partially or locally are/is detected, and further in a case where both shapes of a pattern formed on the sample surface (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>) and a pattern formed in a multilayered film are detected so that the sample potentials are compared. In each case, the inspection can be performed with the effective landing energy LEeff suitable for the inspection of the sample surface, and the inspection can also be performed by the irradiation with the charged particles (electron beam) having the landing energy LE of different combinations or the same combination a plurality of times. Note that, the electron beam to irradiate the sample surface is not limited to a charged particle beam but can be a beam that generates a potential difference on the sample surface and can expect that the electron beam comes back from the sample, for example, a high speed atom beam.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0458">If the electron beam irradiates the sample surface a plurality of times, and if dust or particles on the sample are inspected, for example, the inspection is performed by irradiating the sample surface for the first time with the electron beam for which the effective landing energy LEeff is set to 10 eV to 30 eV, for example, so as to electrify slightly positively based on information obtained from the potential distribution of the sample surface, and next irradiating the sample surface with the electron beam for which the landing energy LE is set to 3.5 eV, for example, so that the luminance of dust or particles on the sample can be maximum. Then, dust or particles on the sample can be detected with high sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0459">In addition, when the sample surface pattern inspection is performed, if the sample surface is made of at last two types of materials, the inspection is performed in the following manner. The sample surface is irradiated for the first time with the electron beam for which the effective landing energy LEeff is set to 2 eV to 7 eV, for example, so that one of the materials becomes bright, namely to electrify to a slightly negative potential, based on information obtained from the &#x201c;potential distribution of the sample surface&#x201d; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>). Then, the landing energy LE for the inspection is set so that a difference of luminance between one of the materials and the other material generated by the first irradiation, namely the contrast becomes maximum. For instance, the landing energy LE is set to 2 eV to 5 eV, and the electron beam for which the above-mentioned landing energy LE is set irradiates the sample surface. Then, the potential distribution of the sample surface can be inspected with high sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0460">The adjustment method of the potential distribution of the sample surface illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref> can be performed also in the sample observation system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In other words, if the system control part <b>950</b> of the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is structured to be capable of performing the same function as the control part <b>2160</b> of the sample observation system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the potential distribution can be adjusted.</p>

Those components are housed in vacuum chambers <b>3720</b>, <b>3740</b>, and <b>3760</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">The thermal electron emission type electron gun <b>3320</b> uses mainly LaB<sub>6</sub>, but it is possible to use a filament made of tungsten, or a cathode made of a tungsten-based compound such as Th&#x2014;W or W2C, or made of oxide such as Ba CO<sub>3</sub>, Sr CO<sub>3</sub>, or CaCO<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">The primary electro-optical system <b>3300</b> is means for guiding the primary electron beam generated from the thermal electron emission type electron gun <b>3320</b> to the sample <b>200</b>, and includes an E&#xd7;B filter <b>3340</b>, and a plurality of electrostatic lenses or electromagnetic lenses <b>3240</b>. In the case of the SEM <b>3200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, the secondary electro-optical system <b>3400</b> is disposed obliquely to the optical axis of the primary electro-optical system <b>3300</b>. The primary electron beam generated from the electron gun <b>3320</b> is condensed by the plurality of electromagnetic lenses <b>3240</b> to be a thin electron beam and irradiates the sample <b>200</b> perpendicularly or substantially perpendicularly by action of the E&#xd7;B filter <b>3340</b> constituted of an electric field and a magnetic field. The secondary electron beam coming back from the sample <b>200</b> propagates straight through the E&#xd7;B filter <b>3340</b> of the primary electro-optical system <b>3400</b> in the left direction in the figure so as to be guided to the detector <b>3100</b>. Note that, the E&#xd7;B filter <b>3340</b> is included in both the primary electro-optical system <b>3300</b> and the secondary electro-optical system <b>3400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">The secondary electro-optical system <b>3400</b> includes the detector <b>3100</b> for detecting the secondary electron beam coming back from the sample surface. As the detector <b>3100</b>, a secondary electron multiplier tube is mainly used. The detector <b>3100</b> is connected to a control part <b>3160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0465">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, the element denoted by the same numeral or symbol as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> is the same element as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, and detailed description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0466">The sample observation systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56 and 57</figref> are used in a case where a defect of the pattern is inspected, in a case where dust or particles on the sample are detected, in a case where dust or particles on a multilayered film formed on the sample or a portion having different thickness partially or locally are/is detected, and further in a case where both shapes of a pattern formed on the sample (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>) and a pattern formed in a multilayered film are detected so that the sample potentials are compared. In each case, the inspection can be performed with the effective landing energy LEeff suitable for the inspection of the sample surface, and the inspection can also be performed by the irradiation with the charged particles (electron beam) having the landing energy LE of different combinations or the same combination a plurality of times. In this case, the electron beam to irradiate the sample surface is not limited to a charged particle beam but can be a beam that generates a potential difference on the sample surface and can expect that the electron beam comes back from the sample, for example, a high speed atom beam.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0467">As described above, the foreign matter adhesion prevention method and the electron beam inspection method of the present invention are described with reference to various embodiments. According to these foreign matter adhesion prevention method and the electro-optical inspection apparatus of the present invention, dust or particles such as particles coming toward the sample can be blocked by the dust collecting electrode disposed to surround the periphery of the sample. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the dust or particles such as particles from adhering to the sample surface. In addition, because adhesion of dust or particles such as particles to the sample surface can be prevented, it is possible to perform inspection of, in particular, an ultrafine pattern of 100 nm or smaller, a structural evaluation, an enlarged observation, a material evaluation, electrically conductive state, and the like of the sample surface with high accuracy and high efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">In addition, according to the present invention, even if an insulation region and a conductive region are formed on the sample surface, a high contrast image of the sample surface can be obtained, and it is easy to classify a type of the defect (a short defect or an open defect). In addition, according to the present invention, static electricity due to charge-up on the sample surface can be removed efficiently. Therefore, blurring of a sample image due to the charge-up can be prevented. Thus, together with an effect of preventing adhesion of the dust or particles, it is possible to perform inspection with very high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0469">While the present invention has been described above in detail with reference to the exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the above-mentioned exemplary embodiments, and various modifications and replacement may be made thereto.</p>
