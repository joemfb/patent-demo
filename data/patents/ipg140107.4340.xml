<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to telecommunications in general, and, more particularly, to fault-tolerant mesh networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Telecommunications networks in a mesh topology offer many advantages over networks that are restricted to a ring topology. A mesh topology is disadvantageous, however, in that existing mechanisms for the restoration of mesh networks after failure are complex, particularly so after the failure of multiple network elements. Therefore, the need exists for a mesh network architecture that is faster to restore in the event of the failure of a network element.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides a mesh network architecture that avoids some of the costs and disadvantages associated with mesh network architectures in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, the illustrative embodiment is a mesh network whose protected services can be restored quickly after the failure of a network element (i.e., a network node, a network transmission facility). Furthermore, the protected services can be restored after all single and most multiple network-element failures as quickly as a ring network can recover from a single network-element failure. And still furthermore, the illustrative embodiment is also advantageous in that it can be administered and maintained, for most purposes, as a collection of distinct ring networks. This is beneficial because ring networks are easy to administer and maintain and also because most network service providers are already familiar with administering and maintaining ring networks.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention can use any protocol or transmission technology (e.g., wavelength division multiplexing, dense wavelength division multiplexing, SONET/SDH, ATM, etc.). Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention distinguish between the transport function, the provisioning function, and the fault notification functions of a network and provide that each of these functions can be accomplished by the same or by different sub-networks using different protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The illustrative embodiment of the present invention is a telecommunications system that comprises: a mesh transport network that comprises a plurality of nodes and a plurality of communications links, wherein said mesh transport network defines a first address space, wherein each of said plurality of nodes has a unique address in said first address space and a unique address in at least one ring network, and wherein each of said plurality of communications links is associated with at least one ring network; and a provisioning network that is logically distinct from said mesh transport network for controlling said plurality of nodes.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a graph of the topology of the germane physical facilities that compose the illustrative embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, telecommunications network <b>100</b> comprises 8 physical nodes and 13 physical communications links, interconnected as shown. A line between two nodes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> indicates that there exists a physical communication link between those nodes. Although there is not a direct physical communications link between each pair of nodes, there is at least one physical path (i.e., series of physical communications links) between each pair of nodes. Although the illustrative embodiment comprises 8 physical nodes, it will be clear to those skilled in the art, after reading this specification, how to make and use embodiments of the present invention that comprise any number of physical nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For the purposes of this specification, a &#x201c;node&#x201d; is defined as comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">i. a switch, or</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">ii. a time-slot interchanger, or</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">iii. a cross-connect, or</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">iv. a multiplexor, or</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">v. a demultiplexor, or</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">vi. any combination of i, ii, iii, iv, and v.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As is described in detail below, each physical node in telecommunications network <b>100</b> can comprise one or more logical nodes. For the purposes of this specification, a &#x201c;logical node&#x201d; is defined as a node in a logical network. For the purposes of this specification, a &#x201c;logical network&#x201d; is defined as an apparently distinct, isolated, or virtual network.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although the illustrative embodiment comprises 13 physical communications links, it will be clear to those skilled in the art, after reading this specification, how to make and use embodiments of the present invention that comprise any number of physical telecommunications links. For the purposes of this specification, a &#x201c;communications link&#x201d; is defined as comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">i. one or more unidirectional physical telecommunications channels, or</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">ii. one or more bi-directional physical telecommunications channels, or</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">iii. any combination of i and ii.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, each communications link can be a wireline or wireless or combination wireline and wireless link. And still furthermore, each communications link can comprise a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint (i.e., broadcast) protocol, and each communications link can comprise a dedicated-bandwidth medium or a shared-bandwidth medium. And yet still furthermore, each communications link can comprise one or more logical channels, as is described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Telecommunications network <b>100</b> comprises the physical topology depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is a mesh network whose topology is chosen to facilitate an understanding of the present invention. It will be clear to those skilled in the art, after reading this specification, how to make and use embodiments of the present invention that have any topology.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, telecommunications network <b>100</b> comprises three independent, but interrelated, logical networks:</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">i. transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>,</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">ii. provisioning network <b>100</b>-<b>2</b>, and</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">iii. fault notification network <b>100</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each of transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>, provisioning network <b>100</b>-<b>2</b>, and fault notification network <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> comprises a non-empty subset of telecommunications network <b>100</b>. Another way of conceptualizing the relationship of transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>, provisioning network <b>100</b>-<b>2</b>, and fault notification network <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> to telecommunications network <b>100</b> is to envision each of transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>, provisioning network <b>100</b>-<b>2</b>, and fault notification network <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> as superimposed planes, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which in total compose telecommunications network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each of transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>, provisioning network <b>100</b>-<b>2</b>, and fault notification network <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> are responsible for performing a different objective with regard to telecommunications network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> is the raison d'&#xea;tre for telecommunications network. In other words, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> is the reason that telecommunications network <b>100</b> exists because it is transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> that transports end-user or payload traffic from one node to another. If there were no transport network, telecommunications network <b>100</b> would have no practical reason for existing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> has a logical node at each physical node in telecommunications network <b>100</b>. The topology of transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Some of the physical links in telecommunications network <b>100</b> are not logical links in transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> purely for pedagogical purposes to illustrate that not all of the links in telecommunications network <b>100</b> need also be in transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>. Although transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> comprises 8 nodes in the topology depicted, it will he dear to those skilled in the art, after reading this specification, how to make and use embodiments of the present invention in which the transport network comprises a different number of nodes in any topology.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> uses a synchronous time-division multiplexed protocol (e.g., T<b>1</b>, SONET/SDH, ISDN, etc.) to transmit end-user traffic from one node in the transport network to the next.

<p id="p-0053" num="0064">An important idea underlying the present invention is the fact that transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> has a dual character that enables fault restoration to occur quickly. First, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> has a mesh (i.e., non-ring) character. Second, and simultaneously, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> has a conjoined ring character. In other words, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> is considered both as a mesh and as a set of conjoined rings in a duality somewhat analogous to the wave-particle duality of matter. In other words, for some purposes, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> is treated and considered a mesh network and for some other purposes it is treated as a set of conjoined rings.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0065">The topology of the mesh is quite simply the topology of transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>. The mesh defines an address space and each node in transport <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> has a unique address in the address space of the mesh. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> comprises 8 nodes interconnected as shown. The mesh has, therefore, eight nodes and an address space of eight. The address of each of these 8 logical nodes in the address space of the mesh is arbitrarily chosen and is shown in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0067">Simultaneously, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> is a set of conjoined rings such that each node and each communications link in transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> is in one or more ring networks. A mesh can usually be resolved into different sets of conjoined rings.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0068">For example, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> can be resolved into three conjoined ring networks as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Ring #<b>1</b> comprises nodes <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> and the links interconnecting them. Ring #<b>2</b> comprises nodes <b>3</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> and the links interconnecting them. Ring #<b>3</b> comprises nodes <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>7</b> and the links interconnecting them.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0069">Alternatively, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> can be resolved into two conjoined ring networks, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this case, ring #<b>1</b> comprises all of the nodes in transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> and all of the links interconnecting them except the link between node <b>3</b> and node <b>6</b> and the link between <b>3</b> and <b>7</b>. Ring #<b>2</b> comprises nodes <b>3</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, and all the links interconnecting them.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0070">And as yet another alternative, transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> can be resolved into three conjoined ring networks, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In this case, ring #<b>1</b> comprises all of the nodes in transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> and all of the links interconnecting them except the link between node <b>3</b> and node <b>6</b> and the link between node <b>3</b> and node <b>7</b>. Ring #<b>2</b> comprises nodes <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> and the links interconnecting them. Ring #<b>3</b> comprises nodes <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>7</b>. It will be clear to those skilled in the art how to determine one or more sets of conjoined rings that are isomorphically identical to a mesh.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0071">Each of the conjoined ring networks can be, but is not necessarily interlocked with each other, although each of the ring networks much be interlocked or conjoined with at least one of the other ring networks. Two ring networks are interlocked when they share at least one common node. When two ring networks are interlocked, a failure of a network element (i.e., a node or a communications link) in one ring network can, but does not necessarily, alter some aspect of the operation of the second ring network. This is in marked contrast to dual-ring interworking (&#x201c;DRI&#x201d;) in which the failure of a network element in one ring does not affect the operation of a second ring network.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0072">Two or more interlocked ring networks are conjoined at one or more &#x201c;ring interworking nodes.&#x201d; A ring interworking node is a node in two or more interlocking ring networks that:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0073">i. can transfer traffic between one ring and another ring during normal operation, and</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0074">ii. can initiate or terminate the transfer of traffic between one ring and a second ring based on the failure of a network element in either ring.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0075">When a set of conjoined rings has been determined, the bandwidth resources of transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> are assigned to one or more of the rings. The bandwidth on a link can be divided equally or not equally between the rings sharing that link. When a node is only in one ring, that node is assigned to that ring. Similarly, when a link is only in one ring, that link is assigned to that ring. In contrast, when a node is in two or more rings, the bandwidth of that node is apportioned to each ring. Similarly, when a link is in two or more rings, the bandwidth of that link is apportioned to each ring. The overall result is that the bandwidth of the mesh is equivalent to the bandwidth of the set of conjoined rings.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0076">When a protected service is provisioned through the mesh network, both the service and the protection bandwidth are provisioned through transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> as if the service and the protection bandwidth were provisioned through one ring network or through a series of two or more interlocking ring networks. This is the trick that confines the magnitude of&#x2014;and the scope of&#x2014;a disruption of a fault in transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> so that fault restoration can occur quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0077">When a protected service is provisioned through only one ring network, both the service bandwidth and the protection bandwidth are provisioned in well-known fashion. In this case, the failure of one or more of the network elements supporting the service is detected in well-known fashion, promulgated to the relevant nodes in provisioning network <b>100</b>-<b>2</b> via fault notification network <b>100</b>-<b>3</b>, and handled by provisioning network <b>100</b>-<b>2</b> on a ring-by-ring basis. In other words, the notice of a failure of one or more of the network elements in a ring supporting a service is promulgated by fault notification network <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> to those nodes in provisioning network <b>100</b>-<b>2</b> responsible for controlling the nodes in that ring.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0078">In contrast, when a protected service is provisioned through two or more interlocking rings, both service bandwidth and protection bandwidth are provisioned in each ring and in the conduits between the applicable rings. Whenever the service bandwidth passes between two rings, its passes at a ring interworking node called a &#x201c;primary transfer node.&#x201d; Whenever the protection bandwidth passes between two rings, it passes at a ring interworking node called a &#x201c;secondary transfer node.&#x201d; A primary transfer node and a secondary transfer node are relative designations that are given on a service by service basis, and, therefore, one node can be both a primary transfer node for one service and a secondary transfer node for another service.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0079">When a protected service is provisioned through a primary transfer node, the failure of any network element other than the primary transfer node is detected, promulgated, and handled in the same manner as a failure of a single ring. In other words, the conjoined ring character of transport network <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> enables a failure not involving the primary transfer node to be restored in the same manner as a fault of a single ring.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0080">In contrast, when a primary transfer node fails, the fault is reported by fault notification network as a fault in both rings associated with the primary transfer node to provisioning network <b>100</b>-<b>2</b>. In the illustrative embodiment, a node is only notified of a fault in a ring when that node is part of that ring. Provisioning network <b>100</b>-<b>2</b> then handles the restoration of the resources in both rings, except the secondary transfer node, as isolated faults. The secondary transfer node is, however, provisioned to re-route the service between the two rings and around the failed primary transfer node. Again, this restoration is handled on a service-by-service basis.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0081">It is to be understood that the above-described embodiments are merely illustrative of the present invention and that many variations of the above-described embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention.
