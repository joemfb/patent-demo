<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to surgical devices and, more particularly, to a surgical access apparatus for use during a minimally invasive surgical procedure. The present disclosure further relates to a novel seal assembly for forming a seal about a surgical object while accommodating angular manipulation of the surgical object.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Minimally invasive surgical procedures including both endoscopic and laparoscopic procedures permit surgery to be performed on organs, tissues and vessels far removed from an opening within the tissue. Laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures generally require that any instrumentation inserted into the body be sealed, i.e. provisions must be made to ensure that gases do not enter or exit the body through the incision as, for example, in surgical procedures in which the surgical region is insufflated. These procedures typically employ surgical instruments which are introduced into the body through a cannula. The cannula has a housing at a proximal end thereof in which a seal assembly is mounted. The seal assembly provides a substantially fluid tight seal about the instrument to preserve the integrity of the established pneumoperitoneum. The housing extends above the patient's body, when the cannula is inserted into the incision, reducing the effective length of instruments inserted through the cannula and potentially encumbering maneuverability about the operative site.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Minimally invasive procedures have several advantages over traditional open surgery, including less patient trauma, reduced recovery time, reduced potential for infection, etc. . . . . However, despite its recent success and overall acceptance as a preferred surgical technique, minimally invasive surgery, such as laparoscopy, has several disadvantages. In particular, the maintenance of the seal about the surgical instrument within the cannula has proven to be difficult in certain procedures, e.g., in procedures requiring extensive manipulation of the long narrow endoscopic instruments within a remote site. In addition, many conventional seal assemblies are not adapted to accommodate instruments of various sizes, while still maintaining the seal about the inserted instrument. Even further, known seal assemblies are relatively complex, which increases the length of the housing in which it is confined. As a consequence, maneuverability above the operative site and the effective length of the instrument are undesirably affected.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the present disclosure is directed to an access apparatus for use during a surgical procedure to provide access to the interior of the body. The access apparatus includes an access member defining a longitudinal axis and having a proximal end for being disposed at an exterior side of the body and a distal end for extending into the interior of the body. The access member has a bore therethrough dimensioned to permit passage of an object. A seal is disposed within the bore of the access member. The seal includes a fabric material and an elastomeric material, and defines an internal passageway dimensioned to form a substantial sealing relation with an object inserted therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the fabric material comprises a braided fabric material, and is generally elongated extending along the longitudinal axis of the access member. The braided fabric material may be a tubular braided fabric material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The seal may include an outer surface with the elastomeric material being at least partially disposed at the outer surface. The outer surface is substantially impervious to passage of insufflation gases. The seal includes an inner surface with the braided fabric material being at least partially disposed at the inner surface for engagement with the instrument. The seal may be substantially impervious to passage of insufflation gases along a substantial length of the seal. Alternatively, the seal may include a porous section adjacent one end thereof to permit passage of insufflation gases.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The seal may be mounted within the access member to define an outer passageway between the seal and the access member. The seal may be secured to the access member at a first location along the longitudinal axis and may be secured to the access member at a second location along the longitudinal axis distal of the first location. The access member may include a channel extending distal of the first location for introduction of insufflation gases into the outer passageway. The porous section of the seal is adjacent the second location to permit passage of insufflation gases between the internal passageway of the seal and the outer passageway.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the seal includes a constricted area which is expansible to engage the object in substantial fluid tight relation therewith. The elastomeric material is impregnated into the braided fabric material of the seal.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the seal includes first and second ends. The first end of the seal is secured to the access member at a first location along the longitudinal axis. The second end of the seal is adapted for axial movement in response to passage of an object into the internal passageway of the seal. Preferably, the seal includes a seal mount which is adapted for longitudinal axial movement with the second end of the seal being secured to the seal mount.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, a cannula assembly for use in a surgical procedure is disclosed. The cannula assembly includes a cannula member defining a longitudinal axis and having a longitudinal bore therethrough for passage of a surgical instrument, a cannula housing defining an opening for receipt of the instrument with the cannula housing being connected to a proximal end of the cannula member so that the opening and the bore communicate with one another, and a sealing member mounted within the cannula member for forming a substantial seal with the instrument. The sealing member includes a fabric material which includes a plurality of strands and an elastomeric material.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The fabric material has an elongate shape extending along the longitudinal axis and a predetermined shape prior to insertion of the instrument. The fabric material has a proximal end, a distal end, and a sloped portion therebetween. The sloped portion defines a passageway for the receipt of the instrument and is arranged to form a substantial seal therewith. The fabric material comprises an expansible fabric and is arranged to expand upon engaging the instrument. The elastomeric material is disposed adjacent at least a center-portion of the sealing member. The center-portion is adapted to expand in receiving the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fabric material may have a tubular shape and may be braided. The fabric material may include a plurality of monofilament strands and a plurality of multifilament strands.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The sealing member includes an outer surface with the elastomeric material being at least partially disposed at the outer surface. The outer surface is substantially impervious to passage of insufflation gases.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The access apparatus of the present disclosure provides a substantial seal between a body cavity of a patient and the outside atmosphere during insertion of an object through the apparatus. Moreover, the access apparatus of the present disclosure is capable of accommodating objects of varying diameters, e.g., instruments from about 4.5 mm to about 15 mm or more, and provide a gas tight seal with each instrument when inserted. This flexibility of the access apparatus greatly facilitates endoscopic surgery where a variety of instruments having differing diameters are often needed during a single surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The apparatus incorporates a seal assembly which permits the introduction and manipulation of various types of instrumentation adapted for insertion through a trocar and/or cannula assembly while maintaining a substantial fluid tight interface about the instrumentation to preserve the atmospheric integrity of a surgical procedure from gas and/or fluid leakage. Specifically, the seal assembly accommodates angular manipulation of the surgical instrument relative to the seal axis in addition to off-axis manipulation of the surgical instrument. This feature of the present disclosure desirably minimizes the entry and exit of gases and/or fluids to/from the body cavity. Examples of instrumentation include clip appliers, graspers, dissectors, retractors, staplers, laser probes, photographic devices, endoscopes and laparoscopes, tubes, and the like. Such instruments will be collectively referred to herein as &#x201c;instruments or instrumentation&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The access apparatus may also be adapted to receive and form a seal about a physician's arm or hand during a hand-assisted laparoscopic procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to the drawings, in which like reference numerals identify identical or substantially similar parts throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> illustrate an access apparatus in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. For exemplative purposes, the access apparatus will be described in terms of a cannula assembly which is adapted for introduction, typically utilizing a trocar, within the abdominal cavity during a laparoscopic surgical procedure. However, it is appreciated that the access apparatus may be any apparatus suitable for introduction and passage of surgical objects into underlying tissue including, e.g., catheters, trocar assemblies, endoscopic portals, hand access devices, etc., through an incision or through a natural body opening.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, cannula assembly <b>100</b> will now be described. Cannula assembly <b>100</b> includes a generally tubular member, similar to the conventional cannulas suitable for the intended purpose of accessing a body cavity and permit introduction of instruments therethrough. Cannula assembly <b>100</b> is particularly adapted for use in laparoscopic surgery where the peritoneal cavity is insufflated with a suitable gas, e.g., CO.sub.2, to raise the cavity wall from the internal organs therein. Cannula assembly <b>100</b> is typically used with an obturator assembly, such as a sharp tipped trocar, which is an elongate instrument positionable within the cannula assembly <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an obturator <b>1000</b> is shown partially introduced within cannula assembly <b>100</b>. The obturator assembly <b>1000</b> may have a sharp end, a blunt end, or a tapered end for separating or dilating tissue, and is utilized to pass through, e.g., abdominal tissue, to facilitate introduction of the cannula assembly <b>100</b> within the abdominal cavity. Once access to the abdominal cavity is achieved, the obturator assembly <b>1000</b> is removed from the cannula assembly <b>100</b> to permit introduction of the surgical instrumentation utilized to perform the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one preferred embodiment, access apparatus, i.e., cannula assembly <b>100</b>, includes cannula sleeve <b>102</b> having proximal and distal ends <b>101</b>, <b>103</b> and cannula housing <b>104</b> mounted to the proximal end <b>101</b> of the sleeve <b>102</b>. Cannula sleeve <b>102</b> defines a longitudinal axis &#x201c;a&#x201d; extending along the length of sleeve <b>102</b>. Sleeve <b>102</b> includes an inner wall <b>102</b>&#x2032; that further defines an internal longitudinal passage <b>106</b> dimensioned to permit passage of a surgical object such as surgical instrumentation. Sleeve <b>102</b> incorporates sleeve flange <b>108</b> monolithically-formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) at the proximal end <b>101</b>. Sleeve <b>102</b> may be fabricated of stainless steel or another suitable rigid material such as a polymeric material or the like. Sleeve <b>102</b> may be clear or opaque. The diameter of sleeve <b>102</b> may vary, but, typically ranges from 5 to 15 mm. Sleeve flange <b>108</b> has a seal support <b>202</b> integrally formed with or attached to the sleeve flange <b>108</b>. Sleeve Flange <b>108</b> further includes at least one circumferential recess or slot <b>110</b> within its outer surface. Circumferential slot <b>110</b> mates or cooperates with corresponding structure of cannula housing <b>104</b> to secure cannula sleeve <b>102</b> and cannula housing <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As best depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, cannula housing <b>104</b> is connected to sleeve flange <b>108</b> of cannula sleeve <b>102</b>. In one preferred embodiment, the connection is achieved through ultrasonic welding, adhesives, cements, etc. In the alternative, the cannula housing <b>104</b> and sleeve flange <b>108</b> may be connected through a bayonet, threaded or snap-fit coupling, e.g., incorporating a detent <b>116</b> of cannula housing <b>104</b> which is received within slot <b>110</b> of sleeve flange <b>108</b>. An O-ring <b>118</b> is desirably disposed between an interior bearing surface <b>120</b> of cannula housing <b>104</b> and an exterior bearing surface <b>122</b> of sleeve flange <b>108</b> to minimize leakage of gases between the cannula housing <b>104</b> and sleeve flange <b>108</b> during use in the laparoscopic procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A valve support <b>114</b> is mounted between cannula housing <b>104</b> and sleeve flange <b>108</b>. Valve support <b>114</b> includes inner column <b>124</b> and outer collar <b>126</b> coaxially disposed about the inner column <b>124</b>. Valve support <b>114</b> has a distal end <b>113</b> and a proximal end <b>115</b>. Outer collar <b>126</b> is mounted against the internal surface of sleeve flange <b>108</b> and may be secured thereto with the use of adhesives, cements, etc. The O-ring <b>118</b> is captured between a depending leg <b>127</b> of outer collar <b>126</b>, cannula housing <b>104</b> and sleeve flange <b>108</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. A resilient valve <b>128</b> is supported within valve support <b>114</b>. Resilient valve <b>128</b> includes a circumferential ledge <b>130</b> which is engaged by the proximal end <b>115</b> of inner column <b>124</b> and secured against an interior planar surface <b>132</b> of main housing <b>104</b> so that resilient valve <b>128</b> is supported within the interior of the inner column <b>124</b>. Valve <b>128</b> may be of general duck-bill configuration and defines an interior slit <b>134</b> which opens to permit passage of an object and closes in the absence of the object. The valve <b>128</b> is desirably a zero closure valve or a slit seal which is adapted to close in the absence of a surgical object to thereby prevent passage of insufflation gases through cannula assembly <b>100</b>. In the alternative, valve <b>128</b> may be a flat disc-shaped valve, balloon valve, flapper valve, conical valve, etc. . . . . In one preferred embodiment, valve <b>128</b> is the fabric seal disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/165,373, filed Jun. 6, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,702,787, &#x201c;TROCAR SEAL SYSTEM&#x201d;, issued to Racenet et al. on Mar. 9, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The seal disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,702,787 may be a flat septum seal having a first layer of resilient material and a second fabric layer juxtaposed relative to the first layer. In yet a further alternative, valve <b>128</b> is preferably a fabric seal and is desirably arranged so as to have a constricted area. The fabric is desirably constructed of a material that forms a constriction or closure. The seal may also be molded with a resilient material so as to have a constriction. Other arrangements for valve <b>128</b> are also envisioned.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Cannula housing <b>104</b> desirably includes port <b>136</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for connecting a stop cock to the cannula housing <b>104</b>.

Port <b>136</b> is in communication with channel <b>138</b> defined adjacent the interior of sleeve flange <b>108</b> of cannula sleeve <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B). Channel <b>138</b> opens to longitudinal passage <b>106</b> of cannula sleeve <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, seal assembly <b>200</b> of cannula assembly <b>100</b> will be discussed in detail. Seal assembly <b>200</b> includes elongated seal <b>204</b> which extends from, the seal support <b>202</b>. As best depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, seal support <b>202</b> is a generally annular element having an internal opening <b>205</b> and an outer trough <b>206</b> defined between inner and outer upwardly extending walls <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> of the seal support <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>).

Alternatively or additionally, the seal <b>204</b> may be glued or adhered to the seal support <b>202</b> and/or sleeve flange <b>108</b>. Seal support <b>202</b> is disposed within the internal boundary of sleeve flange <b>108</b> of cannula sleeve <b>102</b> when in the assembled condition of the apparatus. The seal support <b>202</b> may comprise a separate part attached to the cannula sleeve <b>102</b> or sleeve flange <b>108</b>, or a part formed integrally with the sleeve flange <b>108</b> or cannula sleeve <b>102</b>. In either case, the seal support <b>202</b> is desirably arranged so as to permit flow of insufflation gases through channel <b>138</b>. As can be appreciated, the cannula sleeve <b>102</b> therefore includes the seal support <b>202</b> disposed within cannula sleeve <b>102</b>. The seal member <b>204</b> is secured at proximal end <b>204</b><i>a </i>within the cannula sleeve <b>102</b> via the seal support <b>202</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, the configuration of one preferred embodiment of elongated seal <b>204</b> is depicted. Elongated seal <b>204</b> defines seal axis &#x201c;b&#x201d; which is coincident with axis &#x201c;a&#x201d; of cannula assembly <b>100</b>. Elongated seal <b>204</b> incorporates tubular braid <b>212</b>, which extends the length of the seal <b>204</b>, and elastomeric material <b>214</b> mounted to, formed on, or otherwise applied to the tubular braid <b>212</b>.

Upon insertion of an instrument though the elongated seal <b>204</b>, and expansion of the tubular braid <b>212</b> in a radial direction, the tubular braid <b>212</b> contracts in a longitudinal direction. Mounting the elongated seal <b>204</b> with slack facilitates expansion of the elongated seal <b>204</b> without undue strain on the elongated seal <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Elongated seal <b>204</b> defines a slightly curved or circular arcuate profile sloping inwardly from its proximal end to a center <b>220</b> and then sloping outwardly from the center <b>220</b> to its distal end. This sloped, constricted configuration is created during manufacturing of the tubular braid and elastomer assembly. The tubular braid <b>212</b> and/or elastomeric material <b>214</b> may be formed in the curved shape and then joined to one another. Alternatively, the curved shape may be formed in the process of joining a constant diameter tubular braid and elastomer.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, the seal <b>204</b> has a circular concave shape, i.e., a curve having one radius. In other embodiments, curves having more than one radius may be used. The geometry and shape of elongated seal <b>204</b> affects sealing, snagging and push through force. Generally, shorter seal lengths decrease the chance of snagging and provide lower insertion forces. The shape of elongated seal <b>204</b> should balance sufficient sealing with push through forces. Elongated seal <b>204</b> is arranged so that an area of the seal around the center <b>220</b> is positioned to engage the instrument. The shape of elongated seal <b>204</b> and position of engagement with the instrument will define the approach angle of the tip of the instrument, relative to the seal <b>204</b>. An approach angle approaching zero degrees, i.e., tangent to the surface of the seal, decreases snagging and push through force. A longer, gradually tapering, circular concave, or hyperbolic configuration is preferred, as such a shape creates a lower approach angle and lessens snagging and push through force. The fabric material, or elastomeric material, or both, are desirably pre-formed into the constricted or hourglass shape. Preferably, seal <b>204</b> includes an elongated shape that braid <b>212</b> assumes naturally, under tension, as this facilitates the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The novel arrangement of the elongated seal <b>204</b> has many benefits. The elongated seal <b>204</b> seals around an instrument inserted into the passage <b>106</b>. The seal <b>204</b> is disposed within the passage <b>106</b> of the cannula sleeve <b>102</b>, and not within the cannula housing <b>104</b>, so that the cannula housing <b>104</b> has a lower profile. The lower profile of cannula housing <b>104</b> effectively extends the useful length of the instrument which is inserted into the cannula assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Furthermore, it is desirable to minimize the drag of the seal on the instrument so as to facilitate the manipulation of the instrument through the cannula assembly <b>100</b>. The seal <b>204</b> desirably comprises a fabric material, arranged to ease insertion of the instrument. Preferably, the fabric material engages the instrument upon insertion. In embodiments incorporating elastomeric and fabric composite materials, the elastomeric material is preferably at least partially impregnated into the fabric material so that the seal <b>204</b> is largely elastomeric material at an outer surface thereof and possesses largely fabric strands at an inner surface thereof. The seal <b>204</b> may be entirely elastomeric material at an outer surface thereof and mostly fabric strands at an inner surface thereof. The fabric strands engage the instrument upon insertion, minimizing contact with the elastomeric material. Contact with the elastomeric material tends to increase the friction forces with the instrument. However, it is contemplated that elastomeric material may be formed on the inner surface of elongated seal <b>204</b>. In certain embodiments, lubricants, coatings and/or other materials may be used to reduce friction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The composite structure of certain preferred embodiments also reduces the tendency of the instrument to snag the fabric strands, even where the fabric strands are exposed at an inner surface of the seal <b>204</b>. Without committing to any particular theory of operation, it is believed that the elastomeric material holds the strands in place, reducing the tendency of the instrument to catch the strands.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The elongate tubular shape of the seal <b>204</b> in certain preferred embodiments engages the instrument along the longitudinal axis &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the seal <b>204</b>, increasing the contact area with the instrument, and improving sealing. The fabric material provides sufficient resiliency to seal with instruments in a range of sizes. The fabric material may be arranged to provide good sealing characteristics in the absence of any elastomeric material. The elastomeric material of certain preferred embodiments further provides sealing and resiliency for the seal <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Elongated seal <b>204</b> has an inner surface <b>204</b>&#x2032; that defines an internal passageway or seal passage <b>222</b>, within the passage <b>106</b> of the cannula sleeve <b>102</b>, which opens to the underlying body cavity to permit passage of an instrument. When the instrument is inserted, the fabric material and elastomeric material expands to enable the instrument to pass while establishing a sealed relation with the object. In the absence of an instrument, the seal <b>204</b> returns to its normal constricted configuration under the influence of the resiliency of elastomer <b>204</b> and fabric material.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Elongated seal <b>204</b> is coaxially arranged within cannula sleeve <b>102</b> to define an outer passageway <b>224</b> between the elongated seal <b>204</b> and the internal surface of cannula sleeve <b>102</b>. The outer passageway <b>224</b> communicates with channel <b>138</b> and port <b>136</b>. Elongated seal <b>204</b> further defines a gap <b>226</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) or portion adjacent cannula tip <b>216</b> devoid of the elastomer. The gap <b>226</b> permits the passage of insufflation gases between outer passageway <b>224</b> and internal passageway <b>222</b> of elongated seal <b>204</b>. Insufflation gases are introduced from port <b>136</b>, through channel <b>138</b> through outer passageway <b>224</b>, out gap <b>226</b> into the body cavity, to expand the body cavity. Alternatively or additionally, gap <b>226</b> permits the insufflation gases to pass from outer passageway <b>224</b> to internal passageway <b>222</b>, as well as from internal passageway <b>222</b> into outer passageway <b>224</b>, to substantially equalize the pressure within the two locations to allow the seal to adjust to instruments of different sizes. The gap <b>226</b> may be provided during the molding process or, alternatively, may be the result of a removal step where the elastomer is removed subsequent to molding to define the gap <b>226</b>. The gap <b>226</b> may be created by perforating or forming a slit in the outer elastomeric material <b>214</b>. It is further envisioned that cannula sleeve <b>102</b> may include an opening in its outer wall in communication with the outer passageway <b>224</b> to permit passage of gases to the abdominal cavity. This feature will be discussed in detail herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The insufflation pressure may enhance the sealing ability of elongated seal <b>204</b>, by allowing the insufflation gases to pass into outer passageway <b>224</b> between elongated seal <b>204</b> and cannula sleeve <b>102</b>. If this feature is utilized, thin-walled fabrics and lower Durometer elastomeric materials, are preferred. As an alternative to gap <b>226</b>, one or more slits may be formed in elongated seal <b>204</b> and arranged to open only when exposed to a predetermined pressure, to allow seal inflation. As another alternative, elongated seal <b>204</b> is devoid of an opening or openings whereby outer passageway <b>224</b> is inflated so as to constrict internal passageway <b>222</b> of elongated seal <b>204</b> and form a seal about an inserted instrument. In the alternative, insufflation gases may be introduced between seal <b>204</b> and the cannula sleeve <b>102</b> without inflating the seal by providing gas release structure e.g., through the gap <b>226</b>, or in the form of an opening in the wall of cannula sleeve <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The access apparatus includes, in certain preferred embodiments, a fixation device at a distal end of the cannula sleeve. The fixation device desirably comprises the anchor disclosed in certain embodiments of U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,451, or the anchor disclosed in certain embodiments of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/512,389, filed Oct. 17, 2003, the disclosures of which are both hereby incorporated by reference herein. In the alternative, a balloon anchor according to certain embodiments of U.S. Pat.

A person of ordinary skill will appreciate that all these features are well within the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one preferred process of manufacture, tubular braided fabric material <b>212</b> includes a plurality of monofilament and multifilament polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers which are braided with, e.g., a braiding machine, to define a general tubular shape. Braiders for forming the tubular braided fabric material are commercially available. For example, Steeger machines from. Steeger may be used (Korting Nachf. Wilhelm Steeger in Germany). Preferably, the tubular braid is formed in a tubular shape which defines a diameter approximating the maximum diameter of the elongated seal <b>204</b> during use. Thereafter, the tubular braided fabric material <b>212</b> is placed on a mandrel or pin, so that the mandrel or pin extends through the interior of the tubular braid <b>212</b>. The mandrel has a shape which generally conforms to the internal passageway <b>222</b> of elongated seal <b>204</b> in its final state as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, i.e., the shape of the mandrel generally corresponds to a desired end result of the tubular braid <b>212</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts a suitable mandrel <b>300</b> to form the desired hourglass shape. The tubular braid <b>212</b> is placed under tension to conform the braid to the shape of the mandrel. Thereafter, the shaped or sloped tubular braid <b>212</b> is subjected to a molding process to apply an elastomeric material <b>214</b> onto at least an exterior surface of the tubular braid <b>212</b>. The preferred molding process is effectuated through, e.g., an injection molding process or a compression molding process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a lower half of a mold <b>400</b> utilized to apply the elastomeric material. The mold <b>400</b> defines a mold cavity <b>402</b> corresponding to the general configuration of the tubular braid <b>212</b> (shown in phantom) to receive the braid <b>212</b> preferably with the mandrel <b>300</b>. The mold <b>400</b> provides a slight clearance <b>404</b> about the periphery of the cavity <b>402</b> to receive the elastomeric material. The upper half of the mold <b>400</b> would be identical to the lower half depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">With one preferred injection molding process, the shaped or sloped tubular braid <b>212</b> and mandrel are positioned within an injection mold having a shape generally corresponding to the shaped tubular braid <b>212</b> as discussed hereinabove. A molten elastomer is injected into the mold around the tubular braid <b>212</b>. Upon curing, the elastomer coating <b>214</b> bonds to the exterior surface of the braid <b>212</b>. As appreciated, the molten elastomer may migrate into the interstices of the braid <b>212</b> to fully impregnate the braid <b>212</b>. However, the preferred process prevents complete communication of the molten elastomer to the interior surface of tubular braid <b>212</b>. This is desirably accomplished by applying sufficient tension to the tubular braid <b>212</b> so as to increase contact with the mandrel, decreasing the braid <b>212</b> diameter, which increases the density of the braid, minimizing migration of elastomer to the inner surface of the tubular braid <b>212</b>. At least a portion of the strands of the tubular braid are exposed at the inner surface of the tubular braid <b>212</b>. A lubricious coating may be applied to the inner surface of the tubular braid <b>212</b>, to farther reduce insertion forces. Lubricious coatings including hydrogels and medical fluid may be used. Preferred materials for injection molding include thermoplastic elastomers (&#x201c;TPE&#x201d;). Any suitable elastomer may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Alternatively, a compression molding process may be utilized to form the elastomeric material <b>214</b>. In accordance with one preferred process, the tubular braid <b>212</b> and mandrel <b>300</b> are placed within a compression mold (such as mold <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) having a mold cavity conforming to the desired shape for the tubular braid <b>212</b>. Heat and pressure are applied so that the molten elastomer is then compressed within the tubular braid <b>212</b> to cover at least the exterior surface of the tubular braid <b>212</b> and impregnate interstices of the braided fabric material. Pressure may be applied using mechanical pressure and/or a vacuum. Preferably, complete communication of the molten elastomer to the interior surface of tubular braid <b>212</b> is avoided, as well&#x2014;the benefits of which are discussed hereinabove. Any suitable elastomer may be used. One preferred elastomer for compression molding is polyisoprene.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is envisioned that during either the injection or compression molding processes, cannula tip <b>216</b> may be positioned within the molds and secured to the tubular braid <b>212</b> through an overmolding step. It is also envisioned that the cannula tip <b>216</b> be formed using injection molding as the elastomer is injected, or serially before or after the elastomer is injected, over the braid <b>212</b>. In addition, the cavity <b>402</b> of the mold <b>400</b> may include spaces for the elastomeric material to build up, forming elastomeric features on the seal assembly <b>200</b>. The tubular braid <b>212</b> desirably extends beyond the end of the mold, for clamping and/or tensioning the tubular braid <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, the proximal end of elongated seal <b>204</b> has a circumferential flange <b>218</b>. Flange <b>218</b> is monolithically formed from the elastomeric material <b>214</b> during, e.g., the injection or compression molding processes. Circumferential flange <b>218</b> is received within trough <b>206</b> of seal support <b>202</b> and may be secured within the trough <b>206</b> with the use of adhesive, cements or the like. As discussed hereinabove, the distal end <b>113</b> of inner column <b>124</b> of valve support <b>114</b> secures circumferential flange <b>218</b> within seal support <b>202</b> by engaging the flange <b>218</b> to secure it within the trough <b>206</b> along with the proximal end of the fabric material <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In yet another preferred method, the tubular braid <b>212</b> may be dipped into a pool of elastomeric material. A preferred elastomer is urethane. The urethane wicks to the interior surface of the tubular braid <b>212</b> to form a urethane layer at the inner surface of the tubular braid <b>212</b>. The tubular braid <b>212</b> is then inverted such that the elastomeric material is largely disposed on the exterior of the tubular braid <b>212</b>. The tubular braid <b>212</b> is placed under tension to form a constricted shape along its length to shape the braid, and heat is applied to the assembly. The assembly is cured under the tensioned stated to define desired curved configuration of the elongated seal <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Alternatively, in accordance with another process, an elastomer jacket may be separately formed in the desired sloped or tapered configuration and then adhered or otherwise bonded to the outer surface of the tubular braid <b>212</b> to impart the desired tapered configuration to tubular braid <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In another embodiment, the tubular braid <b>212</b> may include either monofilament fibers or a combination of monofilament and multifilament fibers, which are wrapped with strands such as elastomeric strands.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Irregardless of the above described processes employed, elastomeric material <b>214</b> serves as a further barrier to the insufflation gases. Elastomeric material <b>214</b> also provides further resiliency of the elongated seal <b>204</b>. The braid expands in receiving instruments, forming a fluid tight seal about the instrument, and the braid returns to its initial constricted arrangement subsequent to removal of the instrument. The elastomeric material <b>214</b> also expands in receiving the instrument and returns to an initial constricted arrangement upon removal of the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It is further contemplated that an elastomeric material may be applied to cover the inner surface of tubular braid <b>212</b> in addition to the elastomeric material <b>214</b> at outer surface of the braid <b>212</b>. Preferably, the inner layer has a relatively high durometer to minimize resistance to the inserted instrument, whereas the outer layer preferably has a relatively lower durometer. The inner layer may incorporate protrusions to fill any gaps between elongated seal <b>204</b> and the inserted instruments. The inner and outer elastomeric materials may be formed using injection molding, extrusion or co-extrusion processes, injection coining and compression molding.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As discussed hereinabove, tubular fabric <b>212</b> may also be formed by a weaving process. The fabric is initially woven into a tube-like structure with the &#x201c;ends&#x201d; running in the longitudinal axis of the seal, and the &#x201c;fill&#x201d; running in the opposite direction. The fill strands, at least in the center of the seal, comprise LYCRA (trademark of I.U. DuPont and Nemours Company) strands. The LYCRA strands form the constricted shape for the seal. The LYCRA serves to facilitate the establishment of a seal about the instrument and controls puckering of the fabric, which may lead to leakage. Various materials are contemplated for the weave including 80 denier PET, 20 denier PET, etc. with all or less than the entire fill comprising LYCRA. It is further contemplated that several strands of PTFE or polypropylene may be intermingled amongst the various other longitudinally-running ends to reduce friction and facilitate passage of the instrument through the woven seal. PTFE and polypropylene by their respective natures have a low-friction characteristic. Desirably, the seal includes a woven fabric material and an elastomeric material. The woven fabric may further include pleats defined in the interior of the tubular fabric. The pleats may tend to eliminate gaps and other avenues between elongated seal <b>204</b> and the surgical instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Other arrangements and methods of manufacture for elongated seal <b>204</b> are also envisioned. Some exemplative arrangements and processes of manufacture directed to the fabric material are discussed below:</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Braid Examples</heading>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">1. Spool wind 72 spools of 0.003&#x2033; polyester (PET) monofilament clear with no lubricant on a winding apparatus such as a Fletcher spool winder. The winding apparatus should be tensioned appropriately. Spool up 72 ends of a 100 denier PET with no lubricant/sizing, with 100 Denier, 36 end with high interlacing, PET, for a total of 144 ends. Next load up both sets of 72 spools on a 144 carrier machine with low tension spring systems. The spools are loaded in a pattern to create a fabric having alternating ends of monofilament and multifilament. The braid is manufactured without a mandrel at a pick count of 28 picks per inch. &#x201c;Picks per inch&#x201d; is defined herein as the number of intersections between ends, per inch of fabric. This creates a tube of 144 ends at approximately 3-4 mm in diameter with a cover factor of 70%. This tube is then impregnated with a polymer in order to create a composite seal structure using any of the methods discussed above. The composite tube has the ability to stretch radially 400-500%. The length of the braided tube shortens by 15-20 when stretched to 500% the original diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">2. Spool wind 72 spools of 0.003&#x2033; Teflon (PTFE) monofilament clear with no lubricant.

This tube is then impregnated with a polymer in order to create a composite seal structure (using any of the methods discussed above). The composite tube has the ability to stretch radially 400-500%. The length of the braided tube shortens by 15-20 when stretched to 500% the original diameter. The PTFE monofilaments create a low drag inner surface to the seal to reduce push through force.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">3. Spool wind 144 spools of 0.003&#x2033; polyester (PET) monofilament clear with no lubricant. Next load up both sets of 144 spools on a 144 carrier machine with low tension spring systems. The braid is manufactured without a mandrel at a pick count of 29 picks per inch. This creates a tube of 144 ends at approximately 3-4 mm in diameter with a cover factor of 60%. This tube is then impregnated with a polymer in order to create a composite seal structure (using any of the methods discussed above). The composite tube has the ability to stretch radially 400-500%. The length of the braided tube shortens by 15-20 when stretched to 500% the original diameter. The 100% monofilament braid has higher abrasion resistance and is less prone to snagging due to the increased stiffness the monofilaments add to the fabric.</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">1. A narrow fabric loom is set up with 200 denier PTFE filaments in the warp direction at a warp density of 50 ends per inch. The loom is configured to weave a continuous tube. Spandex fill yarns of 40 denier are woven into the fabric at a constant fill density of 150 picks per inch.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">4. A narrow fabric loom is set up with 200 denier PTFE filaments in the warp direction at a warp density of 50 ends per inch. The loom is configured to weave a continuous tube. Spandex fill yarns of 40 denier are woven into the fabric at a constant fill density of 150 picks per inch. The diameter of the tube may be adjusted by changing the warp density. The larger less dense fabric can become smaller in diameter which in turn reduces the fill yarn tension and reduces power.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Knit Examples</heading>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">1. A one inch head circular knitting machine from Lamb Knitting Corporation with 36 needles per inch was set up to knit a tube using a 200 Denier polyester yarn. The higher the needle density, the more dense the fabric. Denser fabric tends to resist poke through and snagging. Knit fabrics are physically more flexible than braids or weaves. The knit structure is a stretchy reinforcing material able to conform to the seals shape and stretch open when required to pass tools through the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">2. A one inch head Lamb circular knitting machine with 36 needles per inch was set up to knit a tube using a 200 Denier Teflon yarn.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">3. A double needle bar warp knitting machine was set up to knit a tube. The warp knitter has 28 needles per bar and PET <b>200</b>D yarn. Higher needle densities create a denser tube fabric.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In use of the apparatus, in laparoscopic surgery, for example, the underlying body cavity, e.g., the abdominal cavity is insufflated, as is known, to expand the body cavity and displace the abdominal wall from the underlying organs therein. Cannula assembly <b>100</b>, with obturator <b>1000</b> positioned therein, is advanced within the abdominal tissue to penetrate the abdominal wall. Obturator <b>1000</b> is removed while cannula assembly <b>100</b> remains within the incision. Surgical instruments are advanced within cannula assembly <b>100</b>, opening valve <b>128</b>, and entering internal passageway <b>222</b> of elongated seal <b>204</b>. The instruments are advanced whereby the elongated seal <b>204</b> engages the instrument and expands outwardly to form a fluid tight seal about the exterior surface of the instrument. The instrument is utilized to perform the desired procedure. The configuration of elongated seal <b>204</b> permits the seal to move relative to axis &#x201c;a&#x201d;, as the instrument is manipulated during the surgery. As discussed below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the area of seal <b>204</b> that engages the instrument is greater for an instrument with a larger diameter, e.g., instrument <b>10</b>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, as compared to an instrument with a smaller diameter, e.g., instrument <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. During the procedure, insufflation gases are introduced through outer passageway <b>224</b>. The gases pass through gap <b>226</b> of elongated seal <b>204</b> to enter the body cavity to maintain insufflation of the body cavity. The insufflation gases also pass through gap <b>226</b> from outer passageway <b>224</b> to internal passageway <b>222</b> and from internal passageway <b>222</b> to outer passageway <b>224</b> of elongated seal <b>204</b> to substantially equalize pressure between the outer passageway <b>224</b> and internal passageway <b>222</b> of elongated seal <b>204</b> as instruments are inserted and removed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The present disclosure contemplates changes to the structure of the seal. For example, the fabric material of the elongated seal may comprise any suitable fabric structure. The fabric material of elongated seal <b>204</b> must have adequate snag resistance, adequate sealing, and generate acceptable push-through forces upon insertion and removal of an instrument. Fabric materials have certain characteristics that affect the snag resistance, sealing and push through forces, including the material modulus, size and type of strands (also known as yarns), density, power, and geometry of the fabric structure.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As discussed in greater detail hereinbelow, elongated seal <b>204</b> is arranged in a constricted shape, e.g., a circular concave, a hyperbolic, or an hourglass shape, so that a portion of the seal engages an instrument upon insertion of the instrument into the seal. The fabric structure is desirably selected so that the strands largely extend in the longitudinal axis of the elongated seal <b>204</b>, to reduce snagging. The fabric structure should be selected with a tortuous fluid path, as these fabric materials have lower permeability and greater sealing around the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The fabric is desirably formed from a plurality of polymeric strands which conform to the instrument inserted without pocketing. The strands for the fabric can be metal, such as stainless steel, MP25N, nitinol and/or Titanium. Pocketing is the formation of an indentation in the fabric when engaged by an instrument and tends to result in greater snagging of the fabric by the instrument. Materials with a lower modulus of elasticity are desirable for their greater sealing characteristics, whereas higher modulus materials are desirable for their lower push through forces and lower snagging. The strands of the fabric desirably has a modulus greater than or equal to 700,000 PSI, for acceptable pocketing and snagging. The smaller the size of the strands that form the fabric, the greater sealing and lower push through forces achieved. However, multifilament strands over 100 Denier and monofilament strands greater than 0.003 inches in diameter are desired, for acceptable snag resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Fabrics which are denser and have higher cover are desired. Tighter or more dense fabrics have lower permeability (defined by cdcm 2/min). Denser fabrics create a more durable, better sealing structure, with less snagging. Denser, tighter fabrics, having smaller pores, resist snagging, whereas more open fabrics allow instruments to &#x201c;poke through&#x201d; the pores and snag. Denser fabrics are formed from a greater number of strands. Fabric materials with greater density produce lower push through forces, as the instrument tends to slide on the strand surfaces. This is surprising, as normally greater friction results from greater surface contact.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Preferably, the density of the fabric, when an instrument is inserted and the seal is expanded to its greatest size is more than 48 strands per inch (also known as &#x201c;ends per inch&#x201d;), but not more than 200 strands. The number of ends per inch is measured around the fabric perimeter. If the number of ends per square inch is too high, the constricted shape or hourglass shape can not be formed without puckering, which tends to cause leaking. To increase the density of the fabric, while improving the ability of the fabric to form a constricted shape or hourglass shape, a greater number of smaller yarns may be used. However, multifilament strands over 100 Denier and monofilament strands greater than 0.003 inches in diameter are desired, for acceptable snag resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The fabric desirably has enough &#x201c;power&#x201d; to create an effective seal without increasing the push through forces and snagging to an unacceptable level. &#x201c;Power&#x201d; defines the level of &#x201c;squeezing force&#x201d; the seal applies to an instrument inserted into the seal. If the power level of the fabric is high, the seal squeezes the instrument with more force. Higher power improves sealing around the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The fabric material may comprise strands of multifilament, monofilament, or a combination of multifilament and monofilament strands. The permeability of the fabric material, as defined by cc/cm 2/min, is lower for multifilament fabrics than monofilaments. Multifilament strands create a high resistance to fluids and greater sealing, whereas monofilaments create a low resistance to fluids and leak more. Monofilaments have a greater resistance to snagging as compared to multifilaments.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Runners can be used on the fabric structure (e.g., knits, weaves, braids), extending in the axial direction of the seal, down the length of the seal. Runners greatly improve snag resistance. The runners desirably comprise higher modulus monofilaments of, for example, polypropylene, PEEK, polyester, nylon or other suitable materials. The runners also add radial stiffness to the fabric structures. This stiffness reduces pocketing and snagging. Runners increase the strand surfaces which are engaged by the instrument and in turn reduce push through forces.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The elongated seal is preferably formed from a composite structure of fabric material and a resilient material, preferably comprising an elastomeric material. The elastomeric material may comprise any suitable material. The elastomeric material is used to cover and shape a &#x201c;zone&#x201d; of the seal. The elastomeric material <b>214</b> and fabric of the tubular braid <b>212</b> form a composite structure. The sum of the components, i.e., fabric material and the elastomeric material, define the final seal geometry, create the power for sealing, and have significant effects on the push through force and snag resistance. The elastomeric material facilitates holding the tubular fabric structure together, diminishing the chance of snagging.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Elastomeric materials with higher Durometer (a measure of hardness), above 70 shore-A, tend to produce better seals. Creep is lowered and tacky surface properties diminish as Durometer increases. Higher Durometer elastomeric materials produce seals with higher power, and better sealing. Thicker films of elastomeric material also produce more power for the seal. However, these characteristics must be balanced against greater push through forces.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">It is desired that the surfaces of the strands of tubular braid <b>212</b> are available or presented at the inner surface of elongated seal <b>204</b>, to contact the instrument to reduce the push through forces. The harder, higher modulus polymers used to make the strands tend to be quite lubricious, reducing friction, as compared to elastomeric material.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The elastomeric material must substantially fill the &#x201c;gaps&#x201d; in the fabric material in order to create a film or membrane throughout the entire fabric surface. A complete film will assure that fluid does not pass through the seal. A seal with a thinner wall is desirable because such a seal leaves less space for fluid to escape.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The composite seal structure should be flexible and conformable enough to move with the instrument, which improves sealing and reduces the chance of pocketing and snagging. These characteristics are governed by fabric construction, strand type, elastomeric material type, and seal geometry. Thus, the fabric construction, strand type, elastomeric material type, and seal geometry should be selected to form a seal with the desired sealing and snagging. Thinner more compliant fabric and elastomeric material composite structures also decrease push through forces.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a design chart illustrating a three dimensional envelope for a preferred seal composite structure. In all cases, the X, Y, and Z axis variables are adjusted, compensated and interchanged to create a design volume (dv) for optimum seal design. Anything outside of the dv may still produce a working seal, however, with less attractive working features such as higher push through forces, less snag resistance, more leakage, or the other characteristics discussed above. The optimum features for the seal (quantified values such as loads, Durometer, volume fractions) are defined by the desired working requirements including drag or push through force (0-10 lbs) and leak rate (0-270 cc/min) to be achieved. The working requirements of elongated seal <b>104</b> are encompassed by the Z-axis variables. The X-axis variables are (1) the seal diameter from the initial to the expanded diameter and (2) the number of yarns in the seal. The Y-axis variables are (1) durometer, (2) surface cover factor, (3) density of yarn to free space, (4) thickness of polymer, (5) geometry of the seal zone and (6) braid angle. The X-axis variable and the Y-axis variables are optimized to produce the desired Z-axis parameters for elongated seal <b>204</b>.</p>

In this manner, elongated seal <b>204</b> may be sufficiently taut when mounted within cannula sleeve <b>102</b>, i.e., substantially devoid of excess slack material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the arrangement of elongated seal <b>204</b> and seal mount <b>252</b> when a relatively small diameter instrument is positioned within access apparatus <b>250</b>.

Tubular member <b>504</b> includes a braided fabric <b>505</b> with an external elastomer coating <b>508</b>. Proximal flange <b>502</b> may be integrally formed with elastomer coating <b>508</b> or affixed to the proximal end of tubular member <b>504</b>. Elongated seal <b>500</b> includes a general hourglass shape tapering inwardly from the proximal end to a construction <b>510</b> and tapering outwardly from the construction <b>510</b> to the distal end of the tubular member <b>504</b>. The hourglass configuration is formed during the manufacturing process by placing the tubular braid on a corresponding hour-glass shaped mandrel and forming the elastomeric material over the braid in accordance with any of the techniques discussed hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In a preferred embodiment, elastomer coating <b>508</b> incorporates a pair of rib portions <b>512</b> adjacent construction <b>510</b>. Rib portions <b>512</b> provide an area of increased elastomer thickness to effectively increase the resiliency of central portion <b>510</b> of tubular member <b>504</b>.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">While the invention has been particularly shown, and described with reference to the preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, persons of ordinary skill in the art may devise alternative means for mounting the slit seal or elongate seal, which would be contemplated herein. In addition, the slit seal may be omitted and the elongate seal may be arranged to block the passage through the cannula sleeve. In further embodiments, different means for introducing insufflation gases, such as a passageway incorporated in or secured to the cannula sleeve. In other embodiments, the braided or other fabric material is formed in a layer, and the ends of the layer are stitched together or otherwise joined together to fowl a tubular shape. In further embodiments, the elastomeric portion extends only over the upper portion of the fabric material. In further embodiments, the elastomeric material is omitted and the fabric material is relied upon to form a seal with instruments.
