<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) on Patent Application No. 2009-164260 filed in Japan on 10 Jul., 2009 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a light emitting element module equipped with a light emitting element and a manufacturing method thereof, as well as a backlight apparatus for use in a liquid crystal display device, such as a liquid crystal television or a liquid crystal monitor using the light emitting element module.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Liquid crystal display devices, such as liquid crystal televisions and liquid crystal monitors, require a light source for illuminating the display from the rear, because the liquid crystal itself does not emit light. A solid state light emitting element, such as a fluorescent tube, or LEDs (light emitting diodes) is used as the light source, and in either case, measures for making the light uniform within the display area are required.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a structure of a substrate equipped with a conventional light emitting element (light emitting element module). As disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 2008-305940, an LED <b>5</b> provided directly on a substrate <b>11</b>, and the substrate <b>11</b> and the LED <b>5</b> are connected with wires <b>8</b>, and furthermore, a cap <b>41</b> having a lens portion <b>41</b><i>a </i>and a reflector portion <b>41</b><i>b </i>that are molded together is bonded to the substrate using an adhesive resin <b>32</b> in order to protect the LED <b>5</b> and the wires <b>8</b>, and moreover, a transparent sealing resin <b>42</b> is injected into the cap <b>41</b> and thermally cured, and thus the module is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of the above described related art, however, there is stress in the portion through which the cap <b>41</b> and the substrate <b>11</b> are bonded together, due to the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the cap and the substrate (difference in the degree of thermal expansion/contraction) when the temperature changes, and a problem arises, such that the adhesive resin portion <b>32</b> between the substrate <b>11</b> and the cap <b>41</b> cracks and peels when the temperature changes repeatedly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, there is a problem with the precision in the border portion between the two color molds when the lens portion <b>41</b><i>a </i>and the reflector portion <b>41</b><i>b </i>in the cap are molded together, and this affects the yield. Moreover, the LED <b>5</b> is mounted on the substrate and connected with the wires <b>8</b>, and thereafter molded in a resin by injecting a transparent liquid resin <b>42</b>. As a result, there arises a problem such that bubbles are created or the resin foams when the transparent liquid resin <b>42</b> is injected into the cap <b>41</b> and thermally cured, which makes the yield of light emitting element modules very poor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is provided in view of the problems with the related art, and an object thereof is to provide a light emitting element module with a high yield, where a portion where a substrate and a lens are bonded together can be prevented from cracking or peeling due to thermal expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to achieve the above object, a light emitting element module according to the present invention comprises: a light emitting element part equipped with a light emitting element; and an optical lens for diffusing light from the light emitting element, which are mounted on a substrate, and is first characterized in that the adhesive resin for fixing the optical lens to the substrate has a tensile breaking elongation of 50% or more.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition to the first characteristic, the light emitting element module according to the present invention is second characterized in that the optical lens has a plurality of supports which protrude from an outer peripheral portion toward the substrate, and the supports are bonded to the substrate using the adhesive resin so that the optical lens is fixed to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition to the first or second characteristics, the light emitting element module according to the present invention is third characterized in that the adhesive resin is any one of an epoxy based thermosetting resin and silicone based, acryl modified silicone based and urethane based moisture curing resins.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition to any of the first to third characteristics, the light emitting element module according to the present invention is fourth characterized in that the light emitting element part is configured such that the light emitting element is sealed in a transparent resin.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The backlight apparatus according to the present invention is a backlight apparatus for a liquid crystal display device using a light emitting element module having any of the first to fourth characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A manufacturing method for a light emitting element module according to the present invention is a method for manufacturing a light emitting element module having any of the first to fourth characteristics, and first characterized by comprising: preparing a light emitting element part where a light emitting element is sealed in a transparent resin; preparing a substrate where lands for mounting wires and the light emitting element part on the substrate are formed; preparing an optical lens; mounting the light emitting element part on the lands on the substrate; and fixing the optical lens on the substrate for each light emitting element part using an adhesive resin having a tensile breaking elongation of 50% or more.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition to the first characteristic, the manufacturing method for a light emitting element module according to the present invention is second characterized in that an optical lens having a plurality of supports which protrude from an outer peripheral portion toward the substrate is prepared in the step of preparing the optical lens, and the supports of the optical lens are fixed to the substrate using the adhesive resin in the step of fixing the optical lens.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition to the first or second characteristic, the manufacturing method for a light emitting element module according to the present invention is third characterized in that the optical lens is fixed using the adhesive resin which is a thermosetting resin and has a curing temperature of 90&#xb0; C. or lower in the step of fixing the optical lens.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition to the first or second characteristic, the manufacturing method for a light emitting element module according to the present invention is fourth characterized in that the optical lens is fixed using the adhesive resin which is a moisture curing resin in the step of fixing the optical lens.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the present invention, in the light emitting element module where a light emitting element part equipped with a light emitting element and an optical lens for diffusing light from the light emitting element are provided on a substrate, the optical lens is fixed to the substrate using an adhesive resin having a tensile breaking elongation of 50% or more, so that the stress caused by the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the substrate and the optical lens is absorbed in the portion through which the substrate and the optical lens are bonded together, and thus, the portion through which the substrate and the optical lens are bonded together can be prevented from cracking and peeling. As a result, the light emitting element module can be fabricated with high yield.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As adhesive resins having such a tensile breaking elongation, epoxy based thermosetting resins or silicone based, acryl modified silicone based or urethane based moisture curing resins can be used, for example. In the case where a thermosetting adhesive resin is used from among these, it is preferable to cure the resins at a lower temperature, because there is less stress after thermosetting followed by cooling. Particularly in the case where an acryl based resin is used as the material for the optical lens, a heating process of 90&#xb0; C. or higher is not desirable, because there is a risk that the optical lens may be deformed by the heat, and it is desirable to fix the lens to the substrate by heating it to 90&#xb0; C. or less using a thermosetting resin that cures at a temperature of 90&#xb0; C. or lower. Meanwhile, in the case where a moisture curing adhesive resin is used, it is possible to cure it at a temperature of as low as 40&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C., or at room temperature, in which case the curing process is somewhat more lengthy, and thus, there is even less stress on the adhesive resin.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, the optical lens has such as structure as to have a plurality of supports and fixed to the substrate by means of these supports, so that the stress in the portion through which the substrate and the optical lens are bonded together can be dispersed between the supports. In addition, the substrate and the optical lens are bonded together by means of the supports, so that there is a layer as wide as the length of the supports through which air can circulate between the substrate and the optical lens, and thus, the heat releasing properties are better than in the case where the light emitting element part is tightly sealed, as in the related art. As a result, the temperature of the light emitting element module can be prevented from changing as the light emitting element is turned ON/OFF for normal use, and stress can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the light emitting element has such a structure as to be molded in a transparent resin and mounted in the light emitting element part, and therefore, good light emitting element parts can be selected when mounted on a substrate, and thus the yield of light emitting element modules can be prevented from lowering.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Accordingly, the present invention can provide a light emitting element module with high yield, where the portion through which the substrate and the optical lens are bonded together can be prevented from cracking and peeling due to thermal expansion. The above-described light emitting element module can be used as a backlight apparatus for the backlight of a liquid crystal display device, such as a liquid crystal television or a liquid crystal monitor.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of a structure of a light emitting element module <b>1</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the light emitting element module <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment as cut perpendicular to the substrate. A plurality of light emitting element parts <b>2</b> each equipped with an LED as a light emitting element are mounted on a substrate <b>11</b> in one or more rows, but <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows only one light emitting element part <b>2</b>. The other drawings focus on the main portion thereof. The dimensions of the components in the drawings do not necessarily match real dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The light emitting element part <b>2</b> is formed so that one or more LED chips (not shown) are mounted on a component substrate <b>3</b>, such as of ceramic, and electrically connected to the component substrate <b>3</b> with wires (not shown), and the LED chips and wires are sealed in a sealing resin <b>6</b>. In addition, the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is connected to a substrate <b>11</b> through component terminals <b>4</b> using a conductive material <b>7</b>, such as solder, which is on the lands <b>13</b><i>a </i>on the substrate <b>11</b>, and in such a location that the center of the optical lens <b>21</b> is substantially above the center of the light emitting element part <b>2</b>. A transparent resin, for example a silicone based resin, is used as the sealing resin <b>6</b>, and a fluorescent body is added if necessary. As described above, a light emitting element part <b>2</b> where an LED chip is sealed in a transparent resin is fabricated in advance, and the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is mounted on the substrate <b>11</b> when it is a good product, so that the yield of light emitting element modules <b>1</b> equipped with a great number of LEDs can be prevented from lowering.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The substrate <b>11</b> is fabricated by carrying out a wiring process on a base <b>12</b> formed by impregnating woven or unwoven glass fibers or organic material fibers with a resin (epoxy resin or cyanate resin), for example. Copper is used for wires <b>13</b> (<b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>). The surface of the wires may be plated with gold. In addition, the heat emission of the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is relatively high, and therefore, the wires can be provided on both surfaces of the substrate <b>11</b>. Lands <b>13</b><i>a </i>are provided where the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is mounted so as to correspond to the location of the component terminals <b>4</b>. A white insulating material (white resist or the like) <b>14</b> is formed on the outermost surface of the substrate so as to cover the wires <b>13</b><i>b</i>. Because the outermost surface of the substrate <b>11</b> is covered with a white insulating material <b>14</b>, the wires can be protected, and in addition, the reflectance for light from the light emitting element is higher, and the display area is irradiated with more light. It should be noted that a normal solder resist may be used in the case where a reflective sheet is separately provided on the surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The substrate <b>11</b> has openings <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>which are not covered with the insulating material <b>14</b>, so that the light emitting element part <b>2</b> can be connected to the land <b>13</b><i>a </i>on the substrate <b>11</b> through the opening <b>15</b><i>a</i>, and the optical lens <b>21</b> can be fixed to the base <b>12</b> on the substrate <b>11</b> with the adhesive resin <b>31</b> through the opening <b>15</b><i>b</i>. Here, the adhesive resin <b>31</b> is an adhesive resin with a high expansion ratio having a tensile breaking elongation of 50% or more. The opening <b>15</b><i>b </i>may have the same size or be slightly larger than the bottom of a support <b>23</b> for the optical lens. Thus, an opening that is the same size or slightly larger than the bottom of the support <b>23</b> is provided in the insulating material, so that the adhesive resin <b>31</b> is easier to position and the amount of resin is also easy to control. The coefficient of thermal expansion is approximately 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>/&#xb0; C. to 3&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>/&#xb0; C. when the substrate <b>11</b> is made of resin, and approximately 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/&#xb0; C. when it is made of ceramic.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Acryl based resins, polycarbonate and methacryl, which are highly transparent, can be used for the optical lens <b>21</b>, in addition to styrene based and epoxy based resins. The coefficient of thermal expansion of these materials is approximately 6&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>/&#xb0; C. to 8&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>/&#xb0; C. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the shape of the optical lens <b>21</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a side view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a top view. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the optical lens <b>21</b> is fabricated so as to have a lens portion <b>22</b>, supports <b>23</b>, a recess <b>24</b> and marks <b>25</b>, and molded into a single piece through injection molding using a die.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Simulation or the like is carried out in advance in order to determine an appropriate shape for the lens portion <b>22</b>, which should be designed so as to be aspherical so that light can be diffused.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A plurality of supports <b>23</b> are provided in order to fix the optical lens <b>21</b> to the substrate <b>11</b> using an adhesive resin <b>31</b>. It is desirable that three or more supports are provided, because this makes it easy to attach the lens to the substrate <b>11</b> horizontally. All of the supports <b>23</b> may be fixed to the substrate <b>11</b> using the adhesive resin <b>31</b>, but at least two of the supports are desirably fixed in order to prevent the optical lens <b>21</b> from rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Here, the supports <b>23</b> function to disperse among themselves the stress in the portion through which the substrate <b>11</b> and the optical lens <b>21</b> are bonded resulting from the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion. The stress is caused when the size (distance between the supports <b>23</b>) changes, when the temperature changes after the optical lens <b>21</b> is bonded to the substrate <b>11</b> (the temperature changes during cooling after the heat treatment for curing the adhesive resin <b>31</b> and the light emitting element part <b>2</b> and other parts are repeatedly heated and cooled through the turning ON/OFF of the display device). Accordingly, the taller the supports <b>23</b> are, the more the stress in the bonded portion can be dispersed between them.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, when the substrate <b>11</b> and the optical lens <b>21</b> are bonded together through the supports <b>23</b>, there is a layer as wide as the height of the supports in which air can circulate between the substrate <b>11</b> and the optical lens <b>21</b>, and thus, the heat releasing properties of the light emitting element module <b>1</b> are better.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Various shapes, such as circular, elliptical, triangular, square, rectangular, polygonal, and the like are possible for the cross section of the supports <b>23</b> as cut parallel to the upper surface of the substrate <b>11</b>, but it is desirable for the width of the cross section in the direction in which the center of the optical lens <b>21</b> and the center of the support <b>23</b> are connected (that is, the direction of the radius of the lens) to be approximately 0.5 mm to 5 mm. In the case where the supports <b>23</b> are too wide in the direction in which the center of the optical lens <b>21</b> and the center of the support <b>23</b> are connected, there is an optical effect, while in the case where they are too narrow, the intensity is low. Meanwhile, the width may be relatively great in the direction perpendicular to the line connecting the center of the optical lens <b>21</b> and the center of the support <b>23</b> (that is, the direction of the outer periphery of the lens), and it is desirable for the width of the cross section to be approximately 0.5 mm to 10 mm. Although the optical effect is small in the direction perpendicular to the line connecting the center of the optical lens <b>21</b> and the center of the support <b>23</b>, the heat releasing properties are affected when the width of the supports is too great in a cross section, because air cannot circulate. However, even in the case where the width exceeds 10 mm in a cross section, the layer allows air to circulate more than in the case where the light emitting element part is tightly sealed, and thus, the heat releasing properties are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although it is desirable for the supports <b>23</b> to be as high as possible in order to reduce the stress on the adhesive resin <b>31</b>, the height should be determined taking into consideration the thickness of the display device in which the light emitting element module <b>1</b> is mounted and the height at which the light emitting element is mounted, and approximately 0.1 mm to 5 mm is generally appropriate. In addition, the greater the distance is between the supports <b>23</b>, which are fixed using the adhesive resin <b>31</b>, the greater the stress applied on the adhesive resin <b>31</b>, and therefore, it is desirable for the distance between supports to be 20 mm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A recess <b>24</b> for containing a part of the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is created in the center portion of the optical lens <b>21</b>, and the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is not sealed tightly, so that there is an air layer between the light emitting element part <b>2</b> and the recess <b>24</b>, so that the heat releasing properties of the light emitting element part <b>2</b>; that is, the heat releasing properties of the light emitting module <b>1</b> as a whole, are better.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The marks <b>25</b> are used as alignment marks when the optical lens <b>21</b> is mounted on the substrate <b>11</b>. The marks <b>25</b> have such a structure as to protrude outward from the outer periphery of the optical lens <b>21</b>, and are provided outside the supports <b>23</b> along lines extending through the center of the optical lens <b>21</b> and the center of each of the three supports. The shape of the marks <b>25</b> is triangular or rectangular as viewed from the front of the optical lens <b>21</b>, and may be any shape that allows the marks to be distinguished from the shape of the gate cutting portion (not shown) after the optical lens is molded. In the present embodiment, the gate cutting portion is rectangular, and therefore, the marks <b>25</b> are triangular in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows results of a reliability test for the adhesion of the adhesive resin <b>31</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the results of examination of the peeling for each adhesive resin <b>31</b> after an optical lens <b>21</b> made of an acryl based resin (having a coefficient of thermal expansion of 6.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>/&#xb0; C.) is bonded and fixed to a composite substrate (having a coefficient of thermal expansion of 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>/&#xb0; C.) formed by impregnating glass fibers with an epoxy resin through supports <b>23</b> and a temperature cycling test is carried out (300 times for 20 minutes each at &#x2212;40&#xb0; C./85&#xb0; C.). There are six types of adhesive resins <b>31</b>, indicated by A to F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which were selected from adhesive resins that cure at 90&#xb0; C. or lower. The test was carried out on optical lenses <b>21</b> where the distance between the center of the supports <b>23</b> was 9 mm, 13 mm and 15 mm, with two supports being fixed using the adhesive resin <b>31</b>. In this case, the optical lens <b>21</b> was provided with at least three supports <b>23</b> so as to be parallel to the upper surface of the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be noted that the adhesive resins B to F, which had a tensile breaking elongation of 50% or more, did not peel when the distance between the supports was 15 mm. The materials C to F, which had a tensile breaking elongation of 175% or more, did not peel when the distance between the supports was 15 mm and the temperature was changed 1000 cycles or more. Furthermore, it is possible to cure the materials C to F, which cure through moisture, at a temperature of as low as 40&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C., and furthermore, they can be cured at room temperature, which requires a more lengthy process of 8 hours or more.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Second Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, the manufacturing method for the light emitting element module <b>1</b> is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> are views showing the manufacturing steps for the light emitting element module <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">First, a light emitting element part <b>2</b>, a substrate <b>11</b>, and an optical lens <b>21</b> are prepared. Here, the substrate <b>11</b> is a resin substrate where epoxy and glass fibers are combined, for example, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross sectional view of the substrate <b>11</b>. Wires <b>13</b> are formed on both surfaces of the substrate <b>11</b>. The wires <b>13</b> can be formed of a material such as copper, nickel, or gold. Lands <b>13</b><i>a </i>in the wires <b>13</b> on which the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is mounted are formed on one surface of the substrate <b>11</b>, and the wiring portions <b>13</b><i>b </i>are formed on both surfaces. In addition, a wiring portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>is provided over the entire surface on which the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is not mounted, so that the substrate <b>11</b> has better heat releasing properties. The solder resist <b>14</b> covers all of the wires <b>13</b><i>b </i>formed on both surfaces so as to protect the wiring portions <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and openings <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>are provided in portions where the lands <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the supports <b>23</b> of the optical lens <b>21</b> are provided, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The light emitting element part <b>2</b> is formed so that one or more LED chips (not shown) are mounted on a component substrate <b>3</b> made of ceramic and electrically connected by means of wires (not shown) or the like, and the LED chips and the wires are sealed in a sealing resin <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The optical lens <b>21</b> is molded through an injection molding or the like, using a die, so that the lens portion <b>22</b>, the supports <b>23</b>, the recess <b>24</b> and the marks <b>25</b> are integrated. The supports <b>23</b> and the marks <b>25</b> may be attached afterward, but are desirably integrated with the mold, which makes the process easier since only one material is used. In the case where a satin finish is provided on the bottom of the lens portion <b>22</b>, the discreteness and radiation of light are higher.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is mounted on the substrate <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the substrate <b>11</b> on which the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is mounted. The surface of the component substrate <b>3</b> in the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is provided with component terminals <b>4</b> made of copper, silver, nickel or gold, so that the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is mounted on the lands <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>11</b> using a conductive material <b>7</b> made of solder of a conductive adhesive material. The conductive material <b>7</b> may be provided on the component terminals <b>4</b> or the lands <b>13</b><i>a</i>, or on both. The conductive material is heat treated through reflow or in an oven, so that the light emitting element part <b>2</b> is fixed to the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, the optical lens <b>21</b> is fixed to the substrate <b>11</b> using an adhesive resin <b>31</b>. The adhesive resin <b>31</b> is an adhesive resin with a high expansion ratio and a tensile breaking elongation of 50% or more after adhesion, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An appropriate amount of the adhesive resin <b>31</b> is supplied on the substrate <b>11</b> through the opening <b>15</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, so that the bottom of the supports <b>23</b> of the optical lens <b>21</b> can be bonded to the substrate. In the case where the adhesive resin <b>31</b> is liquid, the adhesive resin <b>31</b> can be supplied to the substrate <b>11</b> at the point where the optical lens is bonded thereto by using a dispensing method, a printing method or the like. In the case where the adhesive resin <b>31</b> is in sheet form or tape form, it can be supplied through temporary contact bonding. Methods for applying a liquid adhesive resin <b>31</b> using the dispensing method are easy and desirable in the manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The adhesive resin <b>31</b> is supplied only in bonded portions (the bottom of all of the supports <b>23</b>, or at least two of them), and therefore, it is possible to use less adhesive resin than in the case where the entire peripheral portion of the lens is bonded, as in the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, the optical lens <b>21</b> is fixed to the substrate <b>11</b> using a general mounting machine, such as a die bonder or a mounter. The marks <b>25</b> are used as alignment marks at this time.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the case where an epoxy based thermosetting adhesive resin (B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is used as the adhesive resin <b>31</b>, the adhesive resin can be cured through heat treatment for 5 minutes at 80&#xb0; C., which is lower than 90&#xb0; C., after the lens <b>21</b> is mounted. Accordingly, there is little stress after thermosetting followed by cooling, in comparison with general adhesive resins which cure thermally at a high temperature of 150&#xb0; C. or higher. In addition, thermosetting is carried out for a short period of time, for example for approximately 5 minutes, and therefore, it is possible to cure the resin not only in an oven but also on a hot plate or in a reflow furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, in the case where a moisture curing adhesive resin such as a silicone based resin or polyurethane (C to F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is used as the adhesive resin <b>31</b>, the adhesive resin <b>31</b> can be cured at a lower temperature of 40&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C. When the adhesive resin <b>31</b> can be cured for a longer period of time, such as approximately 8 hours, the adhesive resin <b>31</b> can be cured at room temperature, and the stress on the adhesive resin <b>31</b> can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the above described process, the optical lens <b>21</b> is bonded to the substrate <b>11</b> via the supports <b>23</b> so as to be fixed to the substrate <b>11</b> so that the center of the optical lens <b>21</b> is substantially above the center of the light emitting element part <b>2</b>, and as a result, a light emitting element module <b>1</b> where the light emitting element part <b>2</b> and the optical lens <b>21</b> are mounted on the substrate <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is manufactured. The light emitting element module <b>1</b> is fixed to the chassis of a liquid crystal display device, for example a liquid crystal television or a liquid crystal monitor, with rivets, and thus can be used as a backlight unit.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It should be noted that the above-described embodiments are examples of the preferred embodiments of the present invention. The embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto, and various modifications are possible, as long as it does not deviated from the gist of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Other Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the following, other embodiments are described.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">(1) Although in the first and second embodiments, the optical lens <b>21</b> is fixed to the substrate <b>11</b> when the supports <b>23</b> of the optical lens <b>21</b> are bonded to the base <b>12</b> of the substrate <b>11</b> using the adhesive resin <b>31</b> through the opening <b>15</b><i>b </i>opened in the insulating material (solder resist) <b>14</b>, the supports <b>23</b> of the optical lens <b>21</b> may be fixed to the insulating material (solder resist) <b>14</b> using the adhesive resin <b>31</b> without providing an opening <b>15</b><i>b</i>. In this case, if the area in which the supports <b>23</b> are placed is marked, the positioning of the bonded portions and the control of the amount of resin supplied are easy when the adhesive resin <b>31</b> is supplied. However, in cases where the adhesion between the insulating material <b>14</b> and the base <b>12</b> is not very good, it is desirable to provide an opening in the insulating material <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">(2) Although the light emitting element module <b>1</b> may be one module on which an appropriate number of light emitting element parts <b>2</b> for the entire display screen are mounted, in this case, the substrate <b>11</b> needs to correspond in size to the display screen, and it is necessary to change the substrate <b>11</b> for different screen sizes. Therefore, it is desirable to prepare a plurality of basic light emitting element modules of a plurality of types on which several or several tens of light emitting element parts <b>2</b> are mounted, so that a plurality of basic light emitting element modules are combined for use in accordance with the screen size, so that a light emitting element module <b>1</b> having a desired display screen size can be formed. For example, three types of basic light emitting element modules on which five, six and eight light emitting element parts <b>2</b> are mounted may be prepared, so that various display screen sizes are provided. As a result, the individual modules are small in size, and the plurality of light emitting element parts <b>2</b> that are mounted on the individual modules is also small, and therefore, the light emitting element module <b>1</b> can be manufactured without lowering the yield. The basic light emitting element modules are connected by means of jumper lines, connecters, or the like in order to form the light emitting element module <b>1</b>. The structure of the light emitting element parts <b>2</b> and the optical lenses <b>21</b> in the basic light emitting element modules, as well as the method for fixing to the substrates, are the same as in the light emitting element modules <b>1</b> according to the first and second embodiments, and the description thereof is not given.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The present invention can be applied to light emitting element modules on which light emitting elements are mounted, and in particular to backlight apparatuses for liquid crystal display devices, such as liquid crystal televisions and liquid crystal monitors.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Although the present invention has been described in terms of the preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that various modifications and alternations might be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention should therefore be measured in terms of the claims which follow.</p>
