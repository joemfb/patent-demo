<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method to fabricate an image sensor includes providing a semiconductor substrate having a pixel region and a periphery region, forming a light sensing element on the pixel region, and forming at least one transistor in the pixel region and at least one transistor in the periphery region. The step of forming the at least one transistor in the pixel region and periphery region includes forming a gate electrode in the pixel region and periphery region, depositing a dielectric layer over the pixel region and periphery region, partially etching the dielectric layer to form sidewall spacers on the gate electrode and leaving a portion of the dielectric layer overlying the pixel region, and forming source/drain (S/D) regions by ion implantation.</p>

No. 60/887,378 entitled &#x201c;METHOD AND STRUCTURE TO REDUCE DARK CURRENT IN IMAGE SENSOR&#x201d; filed on Jan. 31, 2007, and is a divisional of U.S. application Ser.

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to image sensors and, more particularly, to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In semiconductor technologies, image sensors are used for sensing a volume of exposed light projected towards a semiconductor substrate. Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors (CIS) and charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors are widely used in various applications such as digital still camera applications. These devices utilize an array of pixels or image sensor elements, including photodiodes and transistors, to collect photo energy to convert images into electrical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, image sensor devices suffer from dark current. That is, unwanted current generated by pixels in the absence of illumination. There may be different sources of dark current such as impurities in the silicon wafer, damage to the silicon crystal lattice by processing techniques, and heat build up in the pixel area. Excessive dark current may lead to image degradation and poor device performance.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, what is needed is a simple and cost-effective device and method for reducing dark current in image sensors.</p>
