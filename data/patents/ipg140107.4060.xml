<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to data processing and printing in general, and in particular to separating print jobs on document printers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In many computing environments document printers, to which computer users send print jobs, insert a separator page between consecutive print jobs in order to allow one print job to be distinguished from the next. When multiple print jobs collect in a stack in the printer output tray, a particular print job may be located and retrieved by flipping through the stack until a separator page is found that identifies the print job. Aside from being easy to miss, the separator pages themselves are typically of no use once the print jobs have been separated and removed from the printer output tray.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention is now described within the context of one or more embodiments, although the description is intended to be illustrative of the invention as a whole, and is not to be construed as limiting the invention to the embodiments shown. It is appreciated that various modifications may occur to those skilled in the art that, while not specifically shown herein, are nevertheless within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, which are simplified conceptual illustrations of a system for separating print jobs, constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> a print job request, identified for illustration purposes as &#x201c;Print Job #<b>1</b>&#x201d;, is sent from a computer <b>100</b> to a document printer <b>102</b> via a communications medium <b>104</b>, such as a computer network. Printer <b>102</b> then prints the job, the top sheet of which is alternatively shown at reference numeral <b>106</b>. Printer <b>102</b> prints a banner <b>108</b> on top sheet <b>106</b> such that banner <b>108</b> reaches one or more edges of top sheet <b>106</b>, such as the top or side edges. Banner <b>108</b> may span the length of an edge of top sheet <b>106</b>, and/or may be printed in black or any other color or color combination. Banner <b>108</b> may incorporate a display area <b>110</b> in which printer <b>102</b> may print matter such as information identifying the print job, the requestor, or any other information, including information that is normally printed on a separator page.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> two additional print job requests, identified for illustration purposes as &#x201c;Print Job #<b>2</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;Print Job #<b>3</b>&#x201d;, are sent from a computer <b>112</b> and a computer <b>114</b> respectively to printer <b>102</b>. Printer <b>102</b> then prints the jobs, printing banner <b>108</b> on the top sheet of each print job as described above. The stacked output of Print Jobs #<b>1</b>, #<b>2</b>, and #<b>3</b> is alternatively shown at reference numeral <b>116</b>. When stack <b>116</b> is viewed on edge, sheets having banners <b>108</b> may be clearly discerned, in which case each print job may be easily found without flipping through each page in the stack.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Printer <b>102</b> is capable of borderless printing, and may allow a page-bleed offset to be specified to allow printing to the edge of the paper. A raster graphic with matter to be printed in display area <b>110</b> may be sent with the data to be printed. Printer <b>102</b> may thus bleed-print banner <b>108</b> at the edge of each top sheet <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, which is a simplified conceptual illustration of an alternate print job separation protocol for use with the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, instead of printing a banner only on the top sheet of each print job, printer <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) prints a banner <b>200</b> at the edge of each sheet in a print job such that the location of banner <b>200</b> along the edge of each sheet is the same within a print job, but differs from print job to print job. Banner <b>200</b> does not extend the entire length of an edge that it reaches, but is sufficiently dimensioned such that each print job in a stack <b>202</b> of multiple print jobs may be individually discerned when stack <b>202</b> is viewed on edge.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, which is a simplified conceptual illustration of an alternate print job separation protocol for use with the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The protocol of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is substantially similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> with the notable exception that multiple copies of the same document within a single print job may be printed with a banner <b>204</b> that is in addition to and spaced apart from banner <b>200</b> and that acts as a copy separator. Banner <b>204</b> is printed at an edge of each sheet of each copy within a print job such that the location of banner <b>204</b> along the edge of each sheet is the same within a copy, but differs from copy to copy within the print job. Thus, each copy within a print job in a stack <b>206</b> of multiple print jobs, one or more of which has multiple copies of the same document, may be individually discerned when stack <b>206</b> is viewed on edge.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is appreciated that the invention, including any of the embodiments described hereinabove, may be adapted for separating and categorizing printouts by user, priority, security level, department, or any other criteria, such as by using banners of different colors to indicate each category.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is appreciated that one or more of the steps of any of the methods described herein may be omitted or carried out in a different order than that shown, without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the methods and apparatus disclosed herein may or may not have been described with reference to specific computer hardware or software, it is appreciated that the methods and apparatus described herein may be readily implemented in computer hardware or software using conventional techniques.</p>
