<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wireless device receives RRC message(s) configuring transmissions of sounding reference signals on a second carrier in a second carrier group. The wireless device receives a random access response comprising a long time alignment value and a preamble identifier. The wireless device transmits the sounding reference signals on the second carrier after adjusting uplink transmission timing of the second carrier group. The wireless device is configured to not transmit any of the sounding reference signals on the second carrier until the wireless device receives the random access response comprising the long time alignment value and an uplink grant.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Example embodiments of the present invention enhance time alignment in a multicarrier OFDM communication system. Embodiments of the technology disclosed herein may be employed in the technical field of multicarrier communication systems. More particularly, the embodiments of the technology disclosed herein may relate to enhancing time alignment in a multicarrier OFDM communication system employing multiple timing advances.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Example embodiments of the invention may be implemented using various physical layer modulation and transmission mechanisms. Example transmission mechanisms may include, but are not limited to: CDMA (code division multiple access), OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing), TDMA (time division multiple access), Wavelet technologies, and/or the like. Hybrid transmission mechanisms such as TDMA/CDMA, and OFDM/CDMA may also be employed. Various modulation schemes may be applied for signal transmission in the physical layer. Examples of modulation schemes include, but are not limited to: phase, amplitude, code, a combination of these, and/or the like. An example radio transmission method may implement QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) using BPSK (binary phase shift keying), QPSK (quadrature phase shift keying), 16-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM, and/or the like. Physical radio transmission may be enhanced by dynamically or semi-dynamically changing the modulation and coding scheme depending on transmission requirements and radio conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram depicting example sets of OFDM subcarriers as per an aspect of an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in this example, arrow(s) in the diagram may depict a subcarrier in a multicarrier OFDM system. The OFDM system may use technology such as OFDM technology, SC-OFDM (single carrier-OFDM) technology, or the like. For example, arrow <b>101</b> shows a subcarrier transmitting information symbols. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is for illustration purposes, and a typical multicarrier OFDM system may include more subcarriers in a carrier. For example, the number of subcarriers in a carrier may be in the range of 10 to 10,000 subcarriers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows two guard bands <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> in a transmission band. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, guard band <b>106</b> is between subcarriers <b>103</b> and subcarriers <b>104</b>. The example set of subcarriers A <b>102</b> includes subcarriers <b>103</b> and subcarriers <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates an example set of subcarriers B <b>105</b>. As illustrated, there is no guard band between any two subcarriers in the example set of subcarriers B <b>105</b>. Carriers in a multicarrier OFDM communication system may be contiguous carriers, non-contiguous carriers, or a combination of both contiguous and non-contiguous carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram depicting an example transmission time and reception time for two carriers as per an aspect of an embodiment of the present invention. A multicarrier OFDM communication system may include one or more carriers, for example, ranging from 1 to 10 carriers. Carrier A <b>204</b> and carrier B <b>205</b> may have the same or different timing structures. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows two synchronized carriers, carrier A <b>204</b> and carrier B <b>205</b> may or may not be synchronized with each other. Different radio frame structures may be supported for FDD (frequency division duplex) and TDD (time division duplex) duplex mechanisms. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example FDD frame timing. Downlink and uplink transmissions may be organized into radio frames <b>201</b>. In this example, radio frame duration is 10 msec. Other frame durations, for example, in the range of 1 to 100 msec may also be supported. In this example, each 10 ms radio frame <b>201</b> may be divided into ten equally sized sub-frames <b>202</b>. Other subframe durations such as including 0.5 msec, 1 msec, 2 msec, and 5 msec may also be supported. Sub-frame(s) may consist of two or more slots <b>206</b>. For the example of FDD, 10 subframes may be available for downlink transmission and 10 subframes may be available for uplink transmissions in each 10 ms interval. Uplink and downlink transmissions may be separated in the frequency domain. Slot(s) may include a plurality of OFDM symbols <b>203</b>. The number of OFDM symbols <b>203</b> in a slot <b>206</b> may depend on the cyclic prefix length and subcarrier spacing.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an example case of TDD, uplink and downlink transmissions may be separated in the time domain. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, each 10 ms radio frame may include two half-frames of 5 ms each. Half-frame(s) may include eight slots of length 0.5 ms and three special fields: DwPTS (Downlink Pilot Time Slot), GP (Guard Period) and UpPTS (Uplink Pilot Time Slot). The length of DwPTS and UpPTS may be configurable subject to the total length of DwPTS, GP and UpPTS being equal to 1 ms. Both 5 ms and 10 ms switch-point periodicity may be supported. In an example, subframe <b>1</b> in all configurations and subframe <b>6</b> in configurations with 5 ms switch-point periodicity may include DwPTS, GP and UpPTS. Subframe <b>6</b> in configurations with 10 ms switch-point periodicity may include DwPTS. Other subframes may include two equally sized slots. For this TDD example, GP may be employed for downlink to uplink transition. Other subframes/fields may be assigned for either downlink or uplink transmission. Other frame structures in addition to the above two frame structures may also be supported, for example in one example embodiment the frame duration may be selected dynamically based on the packet sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram depicting OFDM radio resources as per an aspect of an embodiment of the present invention. The resource grid structure in time <b>304</b> and frequency <b>305</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The quantity of downlink subcarriers or resource blocks (RB) (in this example 6 to 100 RBs) may depend, at least in part, on the downlink transmission bandwidth <b>306</b> configured in the cell. The smallest radio resource unit may be called a resource element (e.g. <b>301</b>). Resource elements may be grouped into resource blocks (e.g. <b>302</b>). Resource blocks may be grouped into larger radio resources called Resource Block Groups (RBG) (e.g. <b>303</b>). The transmitted signal in slot <b>206</b> may be described by one or several resource grids of a plurality of subcarriers and a plurality of OFDM symbols. Resource blocks may be used to describe the mapping of certain physical channels to resource elements. Other pre-defined groupings of physical resource elements may be implemented in the system depending on the radio technology. For example, 24 subcarriers may be grouped as a radio block for a duration of 5 msec.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Physical and virtual resource blocks may be defined. A physical resource block may be defined as N consecutive OFDM symbols in the time domain and M consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain, wherein M and N are integers. A physical resource block may include M&#xd7;N resource elements. In an illustrative example, a resource block may correspond to one slot in the time domain and 180 kHz in the frequency domain (for 15 KHz subcarrier bandwidth and 12 subcarriers). A virtual resource block may be of the same size as a physical resource block. Various types of virtual resource blocks may be defined (e.g. virtual resource blocks of localized type and virtual resource blocks of distributed type). For various types of virtual resource blocks, a pair of virtual resource blocks over two slots in a subframe may be assigned together by a single virtual resource block number. Virtual resource blocks of localized type may be mapped directly to physical resource blocks such that sequential virtual resource block k corresponds to physical resource block k. Alternatively, virtual resource blocks of distributed type may be mapped to physical resource blocks according to a predefined table or a predefined formula. Various configurations for radio resources may be supported under an OFDM framework, for example, a resource block may be defined as including the subcarriers in the entire band for an allocated time duration.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, an antenna port may be defined such that the channel over which a symbol on the antenna port is conveyed may be inferred from the channel over which another symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed. In some embodiments, there may be one resource grid per antenna port. The set of antenna port(s) supported may depend on the reference signal configuration in the cell. Cell-specific reference signals may support a configuration of one, two, or four antenna port(s) and may be transmitted on antenna port(s) {<b>0</b>, <b>1</b>}, and {<b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>}, respectively. Multicast-broadcast reference signals may be transmitted on antenna port <b>4</b>. Wireless device-specific reference signals may be transmitted on antenna port(s) <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, or one or several of ports {<b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>}. Positioning reference signals may be transmitted on antenna port <b>6</b>. Channel state information (CSI) reference signals may support a configuration of one, two, four or eight antenna port(s) and may be transmitted on antenna port(s) <b>15</b>, {<b>15</b>, <b>16</b>}, {<b>15</b>, . . . , <b>18</b>} and {<b>15</b>, . . . , <b>22</b>}, respectively. Various configurations for antenna configuration may be supported depending on the number of antennas and the capability of the wireless devices and wireless base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to some embodiments, a radio resource framework using OFDM technology may be employed. Alternative embodiments may be implemented employing other radio technologies. Example transmission mechanisms include, but are not limited to: CDMA, OFDM, TDMA, Wavelet technologies, and/or the like. Hybrid transmission mechanisms such as TDMA/CDMA, and OFDM/CDMA may also be employed.</p>

Depending on wireless device capabilities, Secondary Cells (SCells) may be configured to form together with the PCell a set of serving cells. In the downlink, the carrier corresponding to an SCell may be a Downlink Secondary Component Carrier (DL SCC), while in the uplink, it may be an Uplink Secondary Component Carrier (UL SCC). An SCell may or may not have an uplink carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A cell, comprising a downlink carrier and optionally an uplink carrier, is assigned a physical cell ID and a cell index. A carrier (downlink or uplink) belongs to only one cell, the cell ID or Cell index may also identify the downlink carrier or uplink carrier of the cell (depending on the context it is used). In the specification, cell ID may be equally referred to a carrier ID, and cell index may be referred to carrier index. In implementation, the physical cell ID or cell index may be assigned to a cell. Cell ID may be determined using the synchronization signal transmitted on a downlink carrier. Cell index may be determined using RRC messages. For example, when the specification refers to a first physical cell ID for a first downlink carrier, it may mean the first physical cell ID is for a cell comprising the first downlink carrier. The same concept may apply to, for example, carrier activation. When the specification indicates that a first carrier is activated, it equally means that the cell comprising the first carrier is activated.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A base station may transmit configuration messages to a wireless device causing configuration of a first (primary) carrier and one or more second (secondary) carriers in the wireless device. Serving carriers having uplink to which the same time alignment applies may be grouped in a carrier group. Serving carriers in one carrier group may use the same timing reference. For a given carrier group, a wireless device may use one active downlink carrier as the timing reference at a given time. For a given carrier group, a wireless device may employ the same timing reference for uplink subframes and frames transmission timing of the uplink carriers belonging to the same carrier group. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, serving carriers having uplink to which the same time alignment applies may correspond to the serving carriers hosted by the same receiver. A carrier group comprises at least one serving carrier with configured uplink. A wireless device supporting multiple carrier groups may support two or more carrier groups. One carrier group contains the first carrier and may be called a first carrier group. In a multiple carrier group configuration, at least one carrier group, called a second carrier group, may contain one or more second carriers and may not contain the first carrier. Carriers within the same carrier group may use the same time alignment value and the same timing reference.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To obtain initial uplink time alignment for a second carrier group, base station may initiate random access procedure. In a second carrier group, wireless device may use one of any activated second carriers from the second carrier group as a timing reference carrier. There may be one timing reference and one time alignment timer (time alignment timer) per carrier group. Time alignment timer for carrier groups may be configured with different values. When the time alignment timer associated with the first carrier group expires, all time alignment timers may be considered as expired and the wireless device may flush all HARQ buffers of all serving carriers, may clear any configured downlink assignment/uplink grants, and RRC may release PUCCH/SRS for all configured serving carriers. When the first carrier group time alignment timer is not running, a second carrier group time alignment timer may not be running. When the time alignment timer associated with second carrier group expires: a) SRS transmissions may be stopped on the corresponding second carriers, b) the type-0 SRS configuration may be released, the type-1 SRS configuration may be maintained, c) CSI reporting configuration for the corresponding second carriers may be maintained, and/or d) MAC may flush the uplink HARQ buffers of the corresponding second carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Upon deactivation of the last active second carrier in a second carrier group, the wireless device may not stop time alignment timer of the second carrier group. Upon removal of the last second carrier in a second carrier group, time alignment timer of the carrier group may not be running. Random access procedures in parallel may not be supported for a wireless device. If a new random access procedure is requested (either by wireless device or network) while another random access procedure is already ongoing, it may be up to the wireless device implementation whether to continue with the ongoing procedure or start with the new procedure. The base station may initiate the random access procedure via a PDCCH order for an activated second carrier. This PDCCH order may be sent on the scheduling carrier of this second carrier. When cross carrier scheduling is configured for a carrier, the scheduling carrier may be different than the carrier that is employed for preamble transmission. Non-contention based random access procedure may be supported for second carriers of a second carrier group. Upon new uplink data arrival the wireless device may not trigger a random access procedure on a second carrier. PDCCH order for preamble transmission may be sent on a different serving carrier than the second carrier in which the preamble is sent. Carrier grouping may be performed without requiring any additional wireless device assisted information.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A wireless device may transmit a scheduling request and/or a buffer status report due to uplink data arrival in the wireless device. A wireless device may transmit a scheduling request when wireless device has data for uplink transmission and wireless device does not receive uplink grants for transmission of buffer status report. Wireless device may transmit a medium access control buffer status report in the uplink to inform the base station about the size of the uplink transmission buffer. A wireless device buffer status report may be transmitted in an uplink resource identified in a received uplink grant. In response to receiving buffer status report, the base station may, selectively and depending on a plurality of criteria, transmit a PDCCH order to the wireless device and may cause the wireless device to start random access procedure on a second carrier (in case of carrier aggregation). A PDCCH order may be triggered by the buffer status report reception due to the uplink data arrival in the wireless device. Preamble transmission may be triggered in the case of uplink data arrival, meaning that preamble transmission may be triggered by the buffer status report reception in the base station. Upon new uplink data arrival the wireless device may not trigger a random access procedure on a second carrier. The base station may trigger the random access procedure based on the buffer status report reception due to uplink data arrival in the wireless device. Base station may consider many parameters in triggering random access on a second carrier, for example, current base station load, wireless device buffer size(s) in buffer status report(s), wireless device category, wireless device capability, QoS requirements, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Initial timing alignment may be achieved through random access procedure. This involves the wireless device transmitting a random access preamble and the base station responding an initial time alignment command with a time alignment value within the random access response window. The start of the random access preamble may be aligned with the start of the corresponding uplink subframe at the wireless device assuming time alignment value of zero. The base station may estimate the uplink timing from the random access preamble transmitted by the wireless device. Then the time alignment command may be derived by the base station based on the estimation of the difference between the desired uplink timing and the actual uplink timing. The wireless device may determine the initial uplink transmission timing relative to the corresponding downlink of the second carrier group on which the preamble is transmitted. PDCCH order may be used to trigger random access process for an activated second carrier. For a newly configured second carrier or a configured but deactivated second carrier, base station may need to firstly activate the corresponding second carrier and then trigger random access process on it.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a base station may communicate with a mix of wireless devices. Wireless devices may support multiple technologies, or multiple releases of the same technology depending on wireless device category and/or capability. A base station may comprise multiple sectors. When specification refers to a base station communicating with a plurality of wireless devices, specification may refer to a subset of the total wireless devices in the coverage area. Specification may refer to for example a plurality of wireless devices of a given LTE release with a given capability and in a given sector of the base station. The plurality of wireless devices in the specification may refer to a selected plurality of wireless devices, or a subset of total wireless devices in the coverage area, which perform according to the disclosed methods. There may be many wireless devices in the coverage area that may not comply with the disclosed methods, for example because those wireless devices perform based on older releases of LTE technology. The number of time alignment commands transmitted by the base station to a wireless device in a given period may depend, at least in part, on many parameters including at least one of: a) speed that the wireless device moves in the coverage area, b) direction that the wireless device moves in the coverage area, c) coverage radius, d) number of active wireless devices in the coverage area, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, the mapping of a serving carrier to a carrier group may be configured by the serving base station with RRC signaling. When needed, the mapping between a second carrier and a carrier group may be reconfigured with RRC signaling. The mapping between a second carrier and a carrier group may not be reconfigured with RRC while the second carrier is configured. The first carrier may not change carrier group and may always be a member of the first carrier group. When a base station performs second carrier addition configuration, the related carrier group configuration may be configured for the second carrier. Base station may modify carrier group configuration of a second carrier by removing (releasing) the second carrier and adding a new second carrier (with same physical carrier ID and frequency) with an updated carrier group index. The new second carrier with the updated carrier group index may be initially inactive subsequent to joining the updated carrier group index. Base station may activate the updated new second carrier and then start scheduling packets on the activated second carrier. It may not be possible to change the carrier group associated with a second carrier but rather the second carrier needs to be removed and a new second carrier needs to be added with another carrier group.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A base station may perform initial configuration based on an initial configuration parameters received from a network node (for example a management platform), an initial base station configuration, wireless device location, wireless device type, wireless device CSI feedback, wireless device uplink transmissions (for example, data, SRS, and/or the like), a combination of the above, and/or the like. For example, initial configuration may be based on wireless device channel state measurements. For example, depending on the signal quality received from a wireless device on various second carriers downlink carrier or by determination of wireless device being in repeater coverage area, or a combination of both, a base station may determine the initial configuration of first and second carrier groups and membership of second carriers to carrier groups.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an example implementation, the time alignment value of a serving carrier may change, for example due to wireless device's mobility from a macro to a repeater or an RRH (remote radio head) coverage area. The signal delay for that second carrier may become different from the original value and different from other serving carriers in the same carrier group. In this scenario, base station may relocate this time alignment-changed serving carrier to another existing carrier group. Or alternatively, the base station may create a new carrier group for the second carrier, based on the updated time alignment value. Time alignment value may be derived for example through base station measurement of signal reception timing, random access procedure, and/or other standard or proprietary algorithms. A base station may realize that the time alignment value of a serving carrier is no longer consistent with its current carrier group. There may be many other scenarios which require base station to reconfigure carrier groups. During reconfiguration, the base station may need to move the reference second carrier belonging to a second carrier group to another carrier group. In this scenario, the second carrier group would require a new reference second carrier. In an example embodiment, the wireless device may select an active second carrier in the second carrier group as the reference timing second carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Base station may consider wireless device's capability in configuring multiple carrier groups for a wireless device. Wireless device may be configured with a configuration that is compatible with wireless device capability. Multiple carrier group capability may be an optional feature in LTE release <b>11</b> and per band combination of multiple carrier group capability may be introduced. Wireless device may transmit its multiple carrier group capability to base station via an RRC message and base station may consider wireless device capability in configuring carrier group configuration of the wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The time alignment maintenance for the first carrier and first carrier group may follow Rel-10 principles. If a second carrier applying the time alignment of the first carrier is added to the first carrier group, the Rel-10 procedures may be reused. In one example embodiment, there is no need to assign a carrier group index for the first carrier group. Second carriers grouped with the first carrier may be grouped implicitly and a carrier group index for the first carrier group may not be needed or a carrier group index may be assigned implicitly by default (for example, carrier group index 0). Carrier group index may be regarded as zero if the carrier group index field is absent upon second carrier addition. If a second carrier is not configured with a carrier group index, it may apply that the second carrier belongs to first carrier group.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a wireless device may select one second carrier downlink in a secondary carrier group as the downlink timing reference carrier for the secondary carrier group. This may reduce signaling overhead or complexity of implementation and/or increase efficiency. For a wireless device, a second carrier group may have one timing reference carrier. In an example embodiment, the active second carrier with the highest signal quality may be selected as the timing reference second carrier by the wireless device. In another example embodiment, downlink timing reference carrier for a second carrier group may be the second downlink carrier associated with the second uplink carrier where random access process was performed. For preamble transmission, the corresponding downlink of the carrier which the preamble is sent may be used as downlink timing reference. In an example embodiment, wireless device may autonomously select a downlink carrier of an active carrier in the second carrier group as the reference second carrier. When time alignment command is received in random access response or timing alignment command for a carrier group, the wireless device may apply the time alignment value to current uplink timing of the corresponding carrier group.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an example embodiment, the second carrier served as the timing reference carrier in second carrier group may be deactivated in some cases. In a wireless device, when a second carrier is inactive, the wireless device may switch off some parts of the receiver and/or transmitter corresponding to the second carrier. This act may reduce battery power consumption in the wireless device. In another example embodiment, the reference second carrier in a second carrier group may be released by the serving base station. The timing reference carrier may be changed to another active second carrier in the second carrier group for maintaining uplink timing alignment for second carriers in the same second carrier group. Change of timing reference carrier in a second carrier group may be supported. The reference carrier may also be changed for other reasons such as coverage quality, random access process failure, reference second carrier release, subscriber mobility, a combination of the above, and/or the like. In an example embodiment, when the reference timing second carrier is released or is deactivated, the wireless device may autonomously change the timing reference carrier to another active second carrier in the second carrier group. For example, initially downlink second carrier in which random access is transmitted may be used as a timing reference and then the wireless device may use another second carrier in the carrier group as the timing reference, when the reference second carrier needs to be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A preamble may be sent by a wireless device in response to the PDCCH order on a second carrier belonging to a second carrier group. Preamble transmission for second carriers may be controlled by the network using PDCCH order. Random access response message in response to the preamble transmission on second carrier may be addressed to RA-CRNTI in the first carrier common search space. Once the random access preamble is transmitted, the wireless device (that transmitted the preamble) may monitor the PDCCH of the first carrier for random access response(s). Wireless device may monitor the PDCCH in the random access response window. The wireless device may stop monitoring for random access response(s) after successful reception of a random access response containing a random access preamble identifier that matches the transmitted random access preamble.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">If the random access response contains a random access preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted random access preamble, the wireless device may consider this random access response reception successful and apply the random access response for the serving carrier where the random access preamble was transmitted. The wireless device may process the received timing advance command. The wireless device may process the received uplink grant value and indicate it to the lower layers. In an example implementation, the second carrier index in the uplink grant may not be transmitted in the uplink grant in random access response and the uplink grant contained in the random access response may be applicable to the carrier where the preamble was sent. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, preamble identifier may be included in a random access response to address possible preamble misdetection by the base station. Wireless device may compare the preamble identifier in random access response with the transmitted preamble identifier to verify the validity of the random access response and to verify possible preamble misdetection by base station. The base station may transmit at least one RRC message to a wireless device causing configuration of random access resources in a wireless device. In the first carrier group, random access resources may be configured on the first carrier, and no second carrier in the first carrier group may be configured with random access resources. One or more second carriers in a second carrier group may be configured with random access resources. This may allow the base station to trigger random access process on any one of the second carriers (in the second carrier group) that is configured with random access resources. For the first carrier group, random access process may be performed only on the first carrier. This feature may provide flexibility to the base station in selecting a second carrier for random access process in a second carrier group. It may be noted that carrier configuration may be wireless device specific, and two wireless devices may be configured with different first carrier and different carrier group configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If a wireless device receives an RRC message that causes the wireless device to be configured to transmit sounding reference signal on a second carrier, the wireless device may transmit sounding reference signal if the second carrier is in-sync. The second carrier is in-sync, if time alignment timer for the corresponding second carrier group is running. In an example embodiment, if a second carrier is configured and is associated with a second carrier group that is out-of-sync (time alignment timer is not running), the base station may initiate random access process on a second carrier in the second carrier group. In response to successful completion of random access process in the second carrier group, the wireless device may start sounding reference signal transmission on uplink carriers of second carriers (in the second carrier group) with configured sounding reference signal transmission. Wireless device may not transmit sounding reference signal in the uplink of a second carrier belonging to an out-of-sync second carrier group. When sounding reference signal is configured for a second carrier belonging to an out-of-sync second carrier group, a wireless device may not send sounding reference signal until wireless device receives a random access response including a time alignment value, and an uplink grant, because otherwise sounding reference signal may be sent with incorrect transmission power and/or timing. Uplink grant may include power control information. The wireless device may receive time alignment value, uplink resources and a power control command to adjust the uplink transmission timing and power before the wireless device starts to send sounding reference signal (if configured for the second carrier).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If no random access response is received within the random access response window, or if none of all received random access responses contains a random access preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted random access preamble, the random access response reception may be considered not successful and the wireless device may increment a preamble transmission counter by one. If the counter reaches a predefined value and if the random access preamble is transmitted on the first carrier, wireless device may indicate a random access problem to RRC layer. The first carrier group may be considered out of sync, and uplink transmissions (except transmission of an uplink preamble) may stop. RRC layer may indicate a radio link failure. If the counter reaches a predefined value and if the random access preamble is transmitted on a second carrier, wireless device may consider the random access procedure unsuccessfully completed. The wireless device may not indicate a random access problem to RRC layer in this case, and no radio link failure may be indicated. The wireless device may continue uplink transmissions on that carrier group. The time alignment state of the carrier group may remain in-sync if the time alignment timer is running.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">LTE Rel-8, 9 &#x26; 10 timing advance (alignment) command MAC control element (CE) has a fixed size of one octet and contains 2 reserved bits (R bits). LTE Rel-8, 9 &#x26; 10 supports only one carrier group and there is no need to indicate to which carrier group the time alignment command may apply. The time alignment command is applied to uplink carriers including first carrier and second carrier(s) of a wireless device. There is a need for enhancing the time alignment procedure in LTE Rel-8, 9 &#x26; 10 to efficiently support multiple carrier groups. In release <b>11</b> or above, when multiple carrier groups are configured, a MAC CE identifying the carrier group to which the time alignment value applies may be used. The R bits may be employed to signal the carrier group to which the time alignment value applies. The R bits of the timing advance command MAC control elements may be employed to signal the time alignment group. In this embodiment, one time alignment is included in a MAC CE. If multiple time alignment, each for a different carrier group, need to be transmitted, then multiple CEs may be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, when the R bits are set to 0, MAC CE indicates the carrier group of the first carrier (first carrier group) and other values are addressed to other carrier groups (second carrier groups). This would allow for a maximum of four time alignment groups. Zero may be used for the R bits correspond to first carrier group, and other values may be used for second carrier groups. This solution may reduce the changes to the release <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> MAC layer, and enhance the MAC CE time alignment command to multiple carrier groups. RRC layer may configure carrier groups for a second carrier (implicitly or explicitly) and may assign a carrier group index to a carrier group. The index that is introduced for a carrier group in RRC may be employed for the setting of the R bits. Carrier group index configured by RRC may be used to indicate carrier group where the time alignment command applies. This may imply that the RRC signaling may configure up to 4 carrier group indices.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">One carrier group in one time alignment command may be supported. R.11 or above wireless devices may check R bits in MAC CE, but R.10 or below wireless devices may not need to check the R bits. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, an R.11 or above wireless device with one configured carrier group (first carrier group) may not need to check the R bits. A 6-bit time alignment value may be associated with a carrier group using 2-bit carrier group index. This enhancement may support transmitting time alignment value for a specific carrier group without adding the size of MAC CE command compared to release <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>. Two bits of carrier group index bits are introduced before the 6 bits of time alignment value. This may require a new definition for MAC CE command that would be applicable to release <b>11</b> or above wireless devices. A method to introduce this new MAC CE command is to introduce a new MAC LCID for this new format. This is a viable implementation option. This may increase the number of used MAC LCIDs. An embodiment is introduced here that would allow to use the same MAC LCID as in Rel-8, 9 &#x26; 10 for Rel-11 multiple carrier group configuration. The same LCID as in Rel-8, 9 &#x26; 10 may be used in this embodiment applicable to multiple carrier group configuration in release <b>11</b> or beyond. Base station transmits time alignment MAC CEs to wireless devices in unicast messages. Base station has the information about the current LTE release supported by the wireless device. This information may be available to the base station via network signaling or via air interface signaling (wireless device capability message received from the wireless device). Base station may use the same LCID for the legacy time alignment MAC CE and the newly introduced time alignment MAC CE. If the MAC CE is transmitted to the release <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> LTE wireless devices, then the R bits may not include a carrier group index. If the MAC CE is transmitted to the release <b>11</b> or above wireless devices, then the R bits may include the carrier group index if multiple carrier groups are configured. If multiple carrier groups are not configured, then time alignment value is applied all the configured and active carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">This enhancement may not require introducing a new LCID, although a new MAC CE format is introduced for transmitting time alignment commands. Both legacy time alignment MAC CEs and new time alignment MAC CEs may use the same LCID and that reduces the number of LCIDs used in the MAC layer (compared with the scenario where a new LCID is introduced) and may further simplify wireless device implementation. Base station may consider wireless device LTE release or may consider the number of configured carrier groups (1 for first carrier group only configuration, more than 1 for first carrier group and second carrier group configuration) to decide if legacy MAC CE format should be used or new MAC CE format should be used. If a wireless device is a release <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, then legacy MAC CE is used. For release <b>11</b> or above wireless devices with one carrier group configuration (only first carrier group), base station may use legacy MAC CE, or use new MAC CEs with RR bits set to first carrier group index (for example 0 for first carrier group). For release <b>11</b> or above wireless devices (or for release <b>11</b> or above wireless devices with multiple carrier group configuration), base station may use the new MAC CE format, wherein RR bits set to the carrier group index, which was configured in wireless device employing RRC configuration messages.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an example, wireless devices (for example: wireless device <b>1</b>, wireless device <b>2</b>) communicating with a base station may support different releases of LTE technology.

In another example, wireless devices (for example: wireless device<b>1</b>, wireless device<b>2</b>) communicating with a base station may support different capabilities of LTE technology. For example, wireless device<b>2</b> may support multiple carrier groups, and wireless device<b>1</b> may not support multiple carrier groups. Base station may send MAC time alignment CEs to the wireless devices (wireless device<b>1</b>, wireless device<b>2</b>) in unicast messages. MAC time alignment CEs may have the same LCID for wireless device<b>1</b> and wireless device<b>2</b>. The wireless devices (wireless device<b>1</b>, wireless device<b>2</b>) may interpret MAC time alignment CE messages for adjusting uplink timing differently dependent on the LTE release they support and are operating. The same exact message may be processed differently by wireless device<b>1</b> and wireless device<b>2</b>. For example, in a scenario, where MAC LCID indicate MAC time alignment CE, and RR field is 00, wireless device<b>1</b> may not consider the value of the two bits before time alignment value (RR). Wireless device<b>1</b> may change the uplink transmission timing for all configured and active uplink carriers according to the time alignment value in the MAC command. Wireless device<b>2</b> may however, decode the value of two bits before time alignment value (RR=carrier group index), and when the two bits are for example 00, wireless device<b>1</b> may only update the transmission timing for active carriers belonging to first carrier group according to the time alignment value. The first two bits may indicate the carrier group index to which the time alignment may apply. Therefore, the same MAC CE message content may be processed differently by different wireless devices operating in different LTE releases. In another example embodiment, multiple carrier groups feature may be an optional feature in release <b>11</b>. Wireless device<b>1</b> may be a release <b>11</b> wireless device without multiple carrier group capability. Wireless device<b>2</b> may be a release <b>11</b> (or above) wireless device with multiple carrier group capability. A wireless device with multiple carrier group capability may also operate in a single time alignment mode depending on base station release and/or network configuration (one carrier group configuration). For example, when a multiple carrier group release <b>11</b> wireless device communicate to a release <b>10</b> base station, it may interpret all base station commands as release <b>10</b> commands.</p>

Base station may configure wireless device's second carrier group(s) and first carrier group within the wireless device capability. For example, a wireless device may indicate how many second carrier groups it may support. Base station may configure wireless device second carrier group(s) based, at least in part, on the number of supported second carrier groups in a wireless device. In another example, wireless device may explicitly or implicitly indicate if it supports inter-band or intra-band multiple carrier groups, or both.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, multiple carrier group capability may be explicitly or implicitly communicated to base station. In an example embodiment, inter-band and/or intra-band carrier aggregation may be configured with multiple carrier groups. Wireless device may send multiple carrier group capability based on each supported band combinations. Wireless devices that could be configured with inter-band carrier aggregation may need multiple carrier groups (multiple time alignment) configuration. Carriers in a band may experience a different delay compared with a different band and a band may need its own carrier group configuration. A carrier group configuration for carriers for a band may be required. In a multiple band wireless device, multiple carrier groups may be configured, for example one carrier group per band. Wireless device may comprise a plurality of RF chains to support inter-band carrier aggregation. A wireless device may support multiple carrier groups if the wireless device support inter-band carrier aggregation. In an example embodiment, when a wireless device transmits wireless device band combination information for inter-band carrier aggregation, it may imply that that wireless device supports multiple carrier groups for those bands, and transmission of a separate information element for multiple carrier group capability may not be required.</p>

The base station may employ an internally stored look-up table to interpret the index. Wireless device may transmit at least one parameter including the index to the base station. The base station may use a set of pre-stored configuration options (for example in a look-up table, information list, a stored file, and/or the like format). The base station may receive the index and determine some of the multiple carrier groups capabilities according to the index. For example, an index three may indicate a multiple carrier group capability supporting band A and band B. In another example, an index four may indicate a multiple carrier group capability of a pre-define intra-band configuration. These configurations are for example only and other examples employing configuration index may be possible.

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, cell search may be the procedure by which a wireless device may acquire time and frequency synchronization with a cell and may detect the physical layer Cell ID of that cell (transmitter). An example embodiment for synchronization signal and cell search is presented below. A cell search may support a scalable overall transmission bandwidth corresponding to 6 resource blocks and upwards. Primary and secondary synchronization signals may be transmitted in the downlink and may facilitate cell search. For example, 504 unique physical-layer cell identities may be defined using synchronization signals.

The concatenated sequence may be scrambled with a scrambling sequence given by a primary synchronization signal. The combination of two length-31 sequences defining the secondary synchronization signal may differ between subframe <b>0</b> and subframe <b>5</b> according to predefined formula (s).

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, the physical layer random access preamble may comprise a cyclic prefix of length Tcp and a sequence part of length Tseq. The parameter values may be pre-defined and depend on the frame structure and a random access configuration. In an example embodiment, Tcp may be 0.1 msec, and Tseq may be 0.9 msec. Higher layers may control the preamble format. The transmission of a random access preamble, if triggered by the MAC layer, may be restricted to certain time and frequency resources. The start of a random access preamble may be aligned with the start of the corresponding uplink subframe at a wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to an example embodiment, random access preambles may be generated from Zadoff-Chu sequences with a zero correlation zone, generated from one or several root Zadoff-Chu sequences. In another example embodiment, the preambles may also be generated using other random sequences such as Gold sequences. The network may configure the set of preamble sequences a wireless device may be allowed to use. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, there may be a multitude of preambles (e.g. 64) available in cell(s). From the physical layer perspective, the physical layer random access procedure may include the transmission of random access preamble(s) and random access response(s). Remaining message(s) may be scheduled for transmission by a higher layer on the shared data channel and may not be considered part of the physical layer random access procedure. For example, a random access channel may occupy 6 resource blocks in a subframe or set of consecutive subframes reserved for random access preamble transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">According to some of the various embodiments, the following actions may be followed for a physical random access procedure: 1) layer <b>1</b> procedure may be triggered upon request of a preamble transmission by higher layers; 2) a preamble index, a target preamble received power, a corresponding RA-RNTI (random access-radio network temporary identifier) and/or a PRACH resource may be indicated by higher layers as part of a request; 3) a preamble transmission power P_PRACH may be determined; 4) a preamble sequence may be selected from the preamble sequence set using the preamble index; 5) a single preamble may be transmitted using selected preamble sequence(s) with transmission power P_PRACH on the indicated PRACH resource; 6) detection of a PDCCH with the indicated RAR may be attempted during a window controlled by higher layers; and/or the like. If detected, the corresponding downlink shared channel transport block may be passed to higher layers. The higher layers may parse transport block(s) and/or indicate an uplink grant to the physical layer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a random access procedure may be initiated by a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) order and/or by the MAC sublayer in a wireless device. If a wireless device receives a PDCCH transmission consistent with a PDCCH order masked with its radio identifier, the wireless device may initiate a random access procedure. Preamble transmission(s) on physical random access channel(s) (PRACH) may be supported on a first uplink carrier and reception of a PDCCH order may be supported on a first downlink carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Before a wireless device initiates transmission of a random access preamble, it may access one or many of the following types of information: a) available set(s) of PRACH resources for the transmission of a random access preamble; b) group(s) of random access preambles and set(s) of available random access preambles in group(s); c) random access response window size(s); d) power-ramping factor(s); e) maximum number(s) of preamble transmission(s); f) initial preamble power; g) preamble format based offset(s); h) contention resolution timer(s); and/or the like. These parameters may be updated from upper layers or may be received from the base station before random access procedure(s) may be initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a wireless device may select a random access preamble using available information. The preamble may be signaled by a base station or the preamble may be randomly selected by the wireless device. The wireless device may determine the next available subframe containing PRACH permitted by restrictions given by the base station and the physical layer timing requirements for TDD or FDD. Subframe timing and the timing of transmitting the random access preamble may be determined based, at least in part, on synchronization signals received from the base station and/or the information received from the base station. The wireless device may proceed to the transmission of the random access preamble when it has determined the timing. The random access preamble may be transmitted on a second plurality of subcarriers on the first uplink carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, once a random access preamble is transmitted, a wireless device may monitor the PDCCH of a first downlink carrier for random access response(s), in a random access response window. There may be a pre-known identifier in PDCCH that identifies a random access response. The wireless device may stop monitoring for random access response(s) after successful reception of a random access response containing random access preamble identifiers that matches the transmitted random access preamble and/or a random access response address to a wireless device identifier. A base station random access response may include a time alignment command. The wireless device may process the received time alignment command and may adjust its uplink transmission timing according the time alignment value in the command. For example, in a random access response, a time alignment command may be coded using 11 bits, where an amount of the time alignment may be based on the value in the command. In an example embodiment, when an uplink transmission is required, the base station may provide the wireless device a grant for uplink transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">If no random access response is received within the random access response window, and/or if none of the received random access responses contains a random access preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted random access preamble, the random access response reception may be considered unsuccessful and the wireless device may, based on the backoff parameter in the wireless device, select a random backoff time and delay the subsequent random access transmission by the backoff time, and may retransmit another random access preamble.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a wireless device may transmit packets on an uplink carrier. Uplink packet transmission timing may be calculated in the wireless device using the timing of synchronization signal(s) received in a downlink. Upon reception of a timing alignment command by the wireless device, the wireless device may adjust its uplink transmission timing. The timing alignment command may indicate the change of the uplink timing relative to the current uplink timing. The uplink transmission timing for an uplink carrier may be determined using time alignment commands and/or downlink reference signals.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a time alignment command may indicate timing adjustment for transmission of signals on uplink carriers. For example, a time alignment command may use 6 bits. Adjustment of the uplink timing by a positive or a negative amount indicates advancing or delaying the uplink transmission timing by a given amount respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">For a timing alignment command received on subframe n, the corresponding adjustment of the timing may be applied with some delay, for example, it may be applied from the beginning of subframe n+6. When the wireless device's uplink transmissions in subframe n and subframe n+1 are overlapped due to the timing adjustment, the wireless device may transmit complete subframe n and may not transmit the overlapped part of subframe n+1.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a wireless device may include a configurable timer (timeAlignmentTimer) that may be used to control how long the wireless device is considered uplink time aligned. When a timing alignment command MAC control element is received, the wireless device may apply the timing alignment command and start or restart timeAlignmentTimer. The wireless device may not perform any uplink transmission except the random access preamble transmission when timeAlignmentTimer is not running or when it exceeds its limit. The time alignment command may substantially align frame and subframe reception timing of a first uplink carrier and at least one additional uplink carrier. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, the time alignment command value range employed during a random access process may be substantially larger than the time alignment command value range during active data transmission. In an example embodiment, uplink transmission timing may be maintained on a per time alignment group (carrier group) basis. Carrier(s) may be grouped in carrier groups, and carrier groups may have their own downlink timing reference, time alignment timer, and/or time alignment commands. Group(s) may have their own random access process. Time alignment commands may be directed to a time alignment group. The carrier group including the primary cell may be called a primary carrier group and the carrier group not including the primary cell may be called a secondary carrier group.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, control message(s) or control packet(s) may be scheduled for transmission in a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) and/or physical uplink shared channel PUSCH. PDSCH and PUSCH may carry control and data message(s)/packet(s). Control message(s) and/or packet(s) may be processed before transmission. For example, the control message(s) and/or packet(s) may be fragmented or multiplexed before transmission. A control message in an upper layer may be processed as a data packet in the MAC or physical layer. For example, system information block(s) as well as data traffic may be scheduled for transmission in PDSCH. Data packet(s) may be encrypted packets.</p>
