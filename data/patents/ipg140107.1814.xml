<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed are methods and systems for automatically estimating the length of an implantable catheter by measuring the pressure decay response to pumping fluid through the catheter. The decay time for a unit fluid pressure pulse generated within the catheter is proportional to the catheter length, i.e. as the catheter length increases so does the decay time. The catheter length can therefore be estimated based on, e.g., the decay time of the pressure pulse. The estimated catheter length can also be analyzed to determine if it is representative of the actual catheter length, or, e.g., is affected by one or more catheter malfunctions including cuts and occlusions. Systems for automatically estimating the catheter length include an implantable catheter, a pumping mechanism, a pressure sensor configured to measure pressure within the catheter, and a processor that calculates the catheter length from a pressure pulse measured while delivering fluid through the catheter.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates generally to implantable medical devices and, more particularly, to implantable fluid delivery systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of medical devices are used for chronic, i.e., long-term, delivery of fluid therapy to patients suffering from a variety of conditions, such as chronic pain, tremor, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, urinary or fecal incontinence, sexual dysfunction, obesity, spasticity, or gastroparesis. For example, pumps or other fluid delivery devices can be used for chronic delivery of therapeutic agents, such as drugs to patients. These devices are intended to provide a patient with a therapeutic output to alleviate or assist with a variety of conditions. Typically, such devices are implanted in a patient and provide a therapeutic output under specified conditions on a recurring basis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One type of implantable fluid delivery device is a drug infusion device that can deliver a fluid medication to a patient at a selected site. A drug infusion device may be implanted at a location in the body of a patient and deliver a fluid medication through a catheter to a selected delivery site in the body. Drug infusion devices, such as implantable drug pumps, commonly include a reservoir for holding a supply of the therapeutic substance, such as a drug, for delivery to a site in the patient. The fluid reservoir can be self-sealing and accessible through one or more ports. A pump is fluidly coupled to the reservoir for delivering the therapeutic substance to the patient. A catheter provides a pathway for delivering the therapeutic substance from the pump to the delivery site in the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Implantable drug delivery or infusion devices are commonly used, for example, when chronic administration of a pharmaceutically active agent or therapeutic substance to a patient is required. An implantable infusion pump-catheter delivery system may be preferred when it is important to deliver the agent to a specific site or when the agent must be administered on a recurrent basis in small, controlled dosages. Precise delivery of appropriate amounts of a fluid agent require accurate characterization of various delivery components of the system, such as the reservoir and catheter. The volume of the catheter, which is proportional to its length, is needed by the clinician or programmer, e.g., when determining the amount of drug needed to prime the entire pump and catheter. Catheter volume is also important when determining the time duration used to maintain a current infusion rate (bridging period) after refilling the pump's reservoir with a different fluid agent or fluid agent concentration to insure that the new infusion rate does not go into effect until the current drug has exited the catheter. Ordinarily, clinicians measure and record the length of catheter during implantation which is then used in calculation priming and bridging durations. However, there are a variety of ways for which this information fails to be recorded or is some how lost leaving clinicians that must manage patient's drug delivery therapies without the catheter length information vital to insuring that the prime and bridge procedures are safe.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, this disclosure describes techniques for automatically estimating the length of a catheter of an implanted medical device. The techniques may measure a pressure decay response to pumping fluid doses through the catheter. The decay time for a unit fluid pressure pulse is proportional to the length of the catheter. In particular, as the length of the catheter increases, so does the pressure decay time. The catheter length can therefore be estimated based on the decay time of the pressure pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one example, a method includes delivering an amount of fluid through an implantable catheter. A pressure within a lumen of the catheter is measured during the delivery of the fluid to the patient. An estimated length for the catheter is calculated based on the measured pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another example, an implantable fluid delivery system includes a fluid delivery pump, a catheter, a pressure sensor, and a processor. The catheter is connected to the fluid delivery pump. The pressure sensor is arranged to measure a pressure in a lumen of the catheter. The processor is configured to control the fluid delivery pump to deliver an amount of fluid through the catheter, control the pressure sensor to measure a pressure within a lumen of the catheter during the delivery of the fluid through the catheter, and calculate an estimated length of the catheter based on the measured pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example, a computer-readable medium contains instructions for causing a programmable processor to control a fluid delivery pump to deliver an amount of fluid through an implantable catheter, control a pressure sensor to measure a pressure within a lumen of the catheter during the delivery of the fluid through the catheter, and calculate an estimated length of the catheter based on the measured pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In still another example, a device includes means for delivering an amount of fluid through an implantable catheter, means for measuring a pressure within a lumen of the catheter during the delivery of the fluid through the catheter, and means for calculating an estimated length of the catheter based on the measured pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The details of one or more examples disclosed herein are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Medical devices are useful for treating, managing or otherwise controlling various patient conditions or disorders including, e.g., pain (e.g., chronic pain, post-operative pain or peripheral and localized pain), tremor, movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease), diabetes, epilepsy, neuralgia, chronic migraines, urinary or fecal incontinence, sexual dysfunction, obesity, gastroparesis, mood disorders, or other disorders. Some medical devices, referred to herein generally as fluid delivery devices may be configured to deliver one or more fluid therapeutic agents, alone or in combination with other therapies, such as electrical stimulation, to one or more target sites within a patient. For example, in some cases, a fluid delivery device may deliver pain-relieving drugs) to patients with chronic pain, insulin to a patient with diabetes, or other fluids to patients with different disorders. The device may be implanted in the patient for chronic therapy delivery (i.e., longer than a temporary, trial basis) or temporary delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used in this disclosure, the terms dosing program or therapy program generally refer to a program sent to an implantable fluid delivery device by a programming device to cause the fluid delivery device to deliver fluid at a certain rate and at a certain time. The dosing program may include, for example, definitions of a priming bolus, a bridging bolus, a supplemental bolus, and a therapy schedule. A dosing program may include additional information, such as patient information, permissions for a user to add a supplemental bolus, as well as limits on the frequency or number of such boluses, historical therapy schedules, fluid or drug information, or other information.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term therapy schedule may generally refer to a rate (which may be zero) at which to administer a fluid, or a drug or drug combination within the fluid, at specific times to a patient. In particular, the therapy schedule may define one or more programmed doses, which may be periodic or aperiodic, each dose including, e.g., a rate of fluid delivery and a time duration for which to deliver the dose. Dose generally refers to the amount of drug delivered over a period of time, and may change over the course of a therapy schedule such that a drug may be delivered at different rates at different times.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A priming bolus refers to a bolus delivered by the implantable fluid delivery device to move the fluid to the distal tip of the catheter, e.g., the tip of the catheter that is remote from the reservoir and internal tubing. Once the fluid is primed to the distal tip of the catheter, the device is ready to deliver fluid to the patient from the distal tip, e.g., via one or more fluid outlets at or near the distal tip. The device delivers the priming bolus during a priming phase to prepare the device for delivery of the fluid to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition to a priming bolus, an implantable fluid delivery device may also perform a bridging bolus, which can also be referred to as a bridge. Bridges are performed when a new fluid is inserted into a reservoir of the device while an old fluid is still present in the device, e.g., within internal tubing of the device and/or within a catheter connected to the device. The bridge is performed to define a rate at which to deliver the old fluid until the old fluid is completely delivered out of the catheter and to the patient such that the device contains only the new fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In general, there may be only one priming bolus per implanted device, because only at or around implantation of the device in the patient is the fluid pathway between the device and the target delivery site partially or completely free from any fluid such that priming is necessary. Boluses after the priming bolus that prepare the device to deliver a therapeutic agent to the patient, i.e. fill the fluid pathway from the device to the target delivery site with the agent, may be referred to as bridging boluses.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A supplemental bolus is a bolus administered to the patient outside of the therapy schedule. The terms independent bolus, one-time bolus, and therapeutic bolus may also be used in this disclosure to refer to a supplemental bolus. In one example, the implantable fluid delivery device may administer a supplemental bolus before the implantable fluid delivery device begins administering doses of fluid according to the therapy schedule. In another example, the implantable fluid delivery device may administer a supplemental bolus during the therapy schedule, e.g., to override or supplement the therapy schedule in response to clinician instruction or patient request.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One task required with implantable infusion therapy systems is calculating priming and/or bridging boluses. Miscalculations of priming or bridging bolus amount can result in undesirable overdose or underdose scenarios. A parameter used to calculate the duration of a bridge or priming bolus is the volume of the catheter, which is directly proportional to the implanted catheter length. The catheter length may vary according to the distance between the implantable pump and a target delivery site within the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is typically the responsibility of the implanting physician to manually measure and record the catheter length. In many cases, implantable catheters come in standard lengths and are cut to fit a particular implantation. In such cases, the physician may measure the length cut off from the catheter at implantation and calculate the length of the implanted catheter by subtracting the cut off length from the full length of the catheter prior to being cut. In any event, if this recording is done in error or not at all, then the subsequent bolus calculations will also be subject to error, which in turn can lead to conditions including overdosing or underdosing the patient in which the device is implanted. In some instances, the catheter and/or fluid delivery device may need to be explanted or surgically exposed to measure the length of the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It may be difficult to deliver appropriate priming and/or bridging boluses when the recorded catheter length is not accurate. Techniques described in this disclosure may incorporate the use of therapy systems with one or more pressure sensors configured to measure pressure somewhere within the fluid pathway of an implantable fluid delivery device, such as a catheter extending from the device and/or internal tubing within the device. Such techniques may be performed when the catheter is implanted or outside the body prior to implantation. In some cases, pressure may be measured while a dose of the therapeutic agent is delivered to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The fluid delivery device in such therapy systems, and/or another device such as an external programmer, may be configured to automatically calculate an estimated length of the catheter based on the measured pressure. Automatic calculation of the length of the catheter without relying on human intervention, e.g., without requiring the implanting physician to measure and record length, can promote accurate catheter length recording. Hence, in some cases, cathether length may be estimated automatically instead of by the clinician. Accurate catheter length recording may promote proper delivery of priming and bridging boluses, or other doses in which accurate determination of catheter length is important to proper and safe delivery of the therapeutic agent to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of a therapy system <b>10</b>, which includes implantable medical device (IMD) <b>12</b>, catheter <b>18</b>, and external programmer <b>20</b>. IMD <b>12</b> is connected to catheter <b>18</b> to deliver at least one therapeutic agent, such as a pharmaceutical agent, pain relieving agent, anti-inflammatory agent, gene therapy agent, or the like, to a target site within patient <b>16</b>. Example therapeutic agents that IMD <b>12</b> can be configured to deliver include, but are not limited to, insulin, morphine, hydromorphone, bupivacaine, clonidine, other analgesics, genetic agents, antibiotics, nutritional fluids, hormones or hormonal drugs, gene therapy drugs, anticoagulants, cardiovascular medications or chemotherapeutics.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the therapeutic agent is a therapeutic fluid, which IMD <b>12</b> delivers to patient <b>16</b> through catheter <b>18</b> from proximal end <b>18</b>A coupled to IMD <b>12</b> to distal end <b>18</b>B located proximate to the target site. Catheter <b>18</b> can comprise a unitary catheter or a plurality of catheter segments connected together to form an overall catheter length. External programmer <b>20</b> is configured to wirelessly communicate with IMD <b>12</b> as needed, such as to provide or retrieve therapy information or control aspects of therapy delivery (e.g., modify the therapy parameters such as rate or timing of delivery, turn IMD <b>12</b> on or off, and so forth) from IMD <b>12</b> to patient <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">IMD <b>12</b>, in general, may have an outer housing that is constructed of a biocompatible material that resists corrosion and degradation from bodily fluids including, e.g., titanium or biologically inert polymers. IMD <b>12</b> may be implanted within a subcutaneous pocket relatively close to the therapy delivery site. For example, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, IMD <b>12</b> is implanted within an abdomen of patient <b>16</b>. In other examples, IMD <b>12</b> may be implanted within other suitable sites within patient <b>16</b>, which may depend, for example, on the target site within patient <b>16</b> for the delivery of the therapeutic agent. In still other examples, IMD <b>12</b> may be external to patient <b>16</b> with a percutaneous catheter connected between IMD <b>12</b> and the target delivery site within patient <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Catheter <b>18</b> may be coupled to IMD <b>12</b> either directly or with the aid of a catheter extension (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, catheter <b>18</b> traverses from the implant site of IMD <b>12</b> to one or more targets proximate to spine <b>14</b>. Catheter <b>18</b> is positioned such that one or more fluid delivery outlets (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of catheter <b>18</b> are proximate to the one or more targets within patient <b>16</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, IMD <b>12</b> delivers a therapeutic agent through catheter <b>18</b> to one or more targets proximate to spinal cord <b>14</b>. IMD <b>12</b> can be configured for intrathecal drug delivery into the intrathecal space or epidural delivery into the epidural space, both of which surround spinal cord <b>14</b>. The epidural space (also known as &#x201c;extradural space&#x201d; or &#x201c;peridural space&#x201d;) is the space within the spinal canal (formed by the surrounding vertebrae) lying outside the dura mater, which encloses the arachnoid mater, subarachnoid space, the cerebrospinal fluid, and spinal cord <b>14</b>. The intrathecal space is within the subarachnoid space, which is past the epidural space and dura mater and through the theca.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although the target site shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is proximate to spinal cord <b>14</b> of patient <b>16</b>, other applications of therapy system <b>10</b> include alternative target delivery sites. The target delivery site in other applications of therapy system <b>10</b> can be located within patient <b>16</b> proximate to, e.g., sacral nerves (e.g., the S2, S3, or S4 sacral nerves) or any other suitable nerve, organ, muscle or muscle group in patient <b>16</b>, which may be selected based on, for example, a patient condition. In one such application, therapy system <b>10</b> may be used to deliver a therapeutic agent to tissue proximate to a pudendal nerve, a perineal nerve or other areas of the nervous system, in which cases, catheter <b>18</b> would be implanted and substantially fixed proximate to the respective nerve. Positioning catheter <b>18</b> to deliver a therapeutic agent to various sites within patient <b>16</b> enables therapy system <b>10</b> to assist in managing, e.g., peripheral neuropathy or post-operative pain mitigation, ilioinguinal nerve therapy, intercostal nerve therapy, gastric stimulation for the treatment of gastric motility disorders and/or obesity, and muscle stimulation, or for mitigation of other peripheral and localized pain (e.g., leg pain or back pain). As another example delivery site, catheter <b>18</b> may be positioned to deliver a therapeutic agent to a deep brain site or within the heart (e.g., intraventricular delivery of the agent). Delivery of a therapeutic agent within the brain may help manage any number of disorders or diseases including, e.g., depression or other mood disorders, dementia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, migraines, obesity, and movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, spasticity, and epilepsy. Catheter <b>18</b> may also be positioned to deliver insulin to a patient with diabetes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As already mentioned, therapy system <b>10</b> can be used to reduce pain experienced by patient <b>16</b>. In such an application, IMD <b>12</b> can deliver one or more therapeutic agents to patient <b>16</b> according to one or more dosing programs that set forth different therapy parameters, such as a therapy schedule specifying programmed doses, dose rates for the programmed doses, and specific times to deliver the programmed doses. The dosing programs may be a part of a program group for therapy, where the group includes a plurality of dosing programs and/or therapy schedules. In some examples, IMD <b>12</b> may be configured to deliver a therapeutic agent to patient <b>16</b> according to different therapy schedules on a selective basis. IMD <b>12</b> may include a memory to store one or more therapy programs, instructions defining the extent to which patient <b>16</b> may adjust therapy parameters, switch between dosing programs, or undertake other therapy adjustments. Patient <b>16</b> or a clinician may select and/or generate additional dosing programs for use by IMD <b>12</b> via external programmer <b>20</b> at any time during therapy or as designated by the clinician.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some examples, multiple catheters <b>18</b> may be coupled to IMD <b>12</b> to target the same or different tissue or nerve sites within patient <b>16</b>. Thus, although a single catheter <b>18</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in other examples, system <b>10</b> may include multiple catheters or catheter <b>18</b> may define multiple lumens for delivering different therapeutic agents to patient <b>16</b> or for delivering a therapeutic agent to different tissue sites within patient <b>16</b>. Accordingly, in some examples, IMD <b>12</b> may include a plurality of reservoirs for storing more than one type of therapeutic agent. In some examples, IMD <b>12</b> may include a single long tube that contains the therapeutic agent in place of a reservoir. However, for ease of description, an IMD <b>12</b> including a single reservoir is primarily discussed herein with reference to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Programmer <b>20</b> is an external computing device that is configured to communicate with IMD <b>12</b> by wireless telemetry. For example, programmer <b>20</b> may be a clinician programmer that the clinician uses to communicate with IMD <b>12</b>. Alternatively, programmer <b>20</b> may be a patient programmer that allows patient <b>16</b> to view and modify therapy parameters. The clinician programmer may include additional or alternative programming features than the patient programmer. For example, more complex or sensitive tasks may only be allowed by the clinician programmer to prevent patient <b>16</b> from making undesired or unsafe changes to the operation of IMD <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Programmer <b>20</b> may be a hand-held computing device that includes a display viewable by the user and a user input mechanism that can be used to provide input to programmer <b>20</b>. For example, programmer <b>20</b> may include a display screen (e.g., a liquid crystal display or a light emitting diode display) that presents information to the user. In addition, programmer <b>20</b> may include a keypad, buttons, a peripheral pointing device, touch screen, voice recognition, or another input mechanism that allows the user to navigate though the user interface of programmer <b>20</b> and provide input.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If programmer <b>20</b> includes buttons and a keypad, the buttons may be dedicated to performing a certain function, i.e., a power button, or the buttons and the keypad may be soft keys that change in function depending upon the section of the user interface currently viewed by the user. Alternatively, the screen (not shown) of programmer <b>20</b> may be a touch screen that allows the user to provide input directly to the user interface shown on the display. The user may use a stylus or their finger to provide input to the display.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In other examples, rather than being a handheld computing device or a dedicated computing device, programmer <b>20</b> may be a larger workstation or a separate application within another multi-function device. For example, the multi-function device may be a cellular phone, personal computer, laptop, workstation computer, or personal digital assistant that can be configured with an application to simulate programmer <b>20</b>. Alternatively, a notebook computer, tablet computer, or other personal computer may enter an application to become programmer <b>20</b> with a wireless adapter connected to the personal computer for communicating with IMD <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When programmer <b>20</b> is configured for use by the clinician, programmer <b>20</b> may be used to transmit initial programming information to IMD <b>12</b>. This initial information may include hardware information for system <b>10</b> such as the type of catheter <b>18</b>, the position of catheter <b>18</b> within patient <b>16</b>, the length of catheter <b>18</b> at implantation as measured by the implanting physician and/or as automatically estimated by IMD <b>12</b>, the type of therapeutic agent(s) delivered by IMD <b>12</b>, a baseline orientation of at least a portion of IMD <b>12</b> relative to a reference point, therapy parameters of therapy programs stored within IMD <b>12</b> or within programmer <b>20</b>, and any other information the clinician desires to program into IMD <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The clinician uses programmer <b>20</b> to program IMD <b>12</b> with one or more therapy programs that define the therapy delivered by the IMD. During a programming session, the clinician may determine one or more dosing programs that may provide effective therapy to patient <b>16</b>. Patient <b>16</b> may provide feedback to the clinician as to efficacy of a program being evaluated or desired modifications to the program. Once the clinician has identified one or more programs that may be beneficial to patient <b>16</b>, the patient may continue the evaluation process and determine which dosing program or therapy schedule best alleviates the condition of the patient or otherwise provides efficacious therapy to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The dosing program information may set forth therapy parameters, such as different predetermined dosages of the therapeutic agent (e.g., a dose amount), the rate of delivery of the therapeutic agent (e.g., rate of delivery of the fluid), the maximum acceptable dose, a time interval between successive supplemental boluses such as patient-initiated boluses (e.g., a lock-out interval), a maximum dose that may be delivered over a given time interval, and so forth. IMD <b>12</b> may include a feature that prevents dosing the therapeutic agent in a manner inconsistent with the dosing program. Programmer <b>20</b> may assist the clinician in the creation/identification of dosing programs by providing a methodical system of identifying potentially beneficial therapy parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A dosage of a therapeutic agent, such as a drug, may be expressed as an amount of drug, e.g., measured in milligrams or other volumetric units, provided to patient <b>16</b> over a time interval, e.g., per day or twenty-four hour period. In this sense, the dosage may indicate a rate of delivery. This dosage amount may convey to the caregiver an indication of the probable efficacy of the drug and the possibility of side effects. In general, a sufficient amount of the drug should be administered in order to have a desired therapeutic effect, such as pain relief. However, the amount of the drug administered to the patient should be limited to a maximum amount, such as a maximum daily dose, in order not to avoid potential side effects. Program information specified by a user via programmer <b>20</b> may be used to control dosage amount, dosage rate, dosage time, maximum dose for a given time interval (e.g., daily), or other parameters associated with delivery of a drug or other fluid by IMD <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some cases, programmer <b>20</b> may also be configured for use by patient <b>16</b>. When configured as the patient programmer, programmer <b>20</b> may have limited functionality in order to prevent patient <b>16</b> from altering critical functions or applications that may be detrimental to patient <b>16</b>. In this manner, programmer <b>20</b> may only allow patient <b>16</b> to adjust certain therapy parameters or set an available range for a particular therapy parameter. In some cases, a patient programmer may permit the patient to control IMD <b>12</b> to deliver a supplemental, patient bolus, if permitted by the applicable therapy program administered by the IMD, e.g., if delivery of a patient bolus would not violate a lockout interval or maximum dosage limit. Programmer <b>20</b> may also provide an indication to patient <b>16</b> when therapy is being delivered or when IMD <b>12</b> needs to be refilled or when the power source within programmer <b>20</b> or IMD <b>12</b> need to be replaced or recharged.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Whether programmer <b>20</b> is configured for clinician or patient use, programmer <b>20</b> may communicate to IMD <b>12</b> or any other computing device via wireless communication. Programmer <b>20</b>, for example, may communicate via wireless communication with IMD <b>12</b> using radio frequency (RF) telemetry techniques. Programmer <b>20</b> may also communicate with another programmer or computing device via a wired or wireless connection using any of a variety of communication techniques including, e.g., RF communication according to the 802.11 or Bluetooth specification sets, infrared (IR) communication according to the IRDA specification set, or other standard or proprietary telemetry protocols. Programmer <b>20</b> may also communicate with another programming or computing device via exchange of removable media, such as magnetic or optical disks, or memory cards or sticks including, e.g., non-volatile memory. Further, programmer <b>20</b> may communicate with IMD <b>12</b> and another programmer via, e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), public switched telephone network (PSTN), or cellular telephone network, or any other terrestrial or satellite network appropriate for use with programmer <b>20</b> and IMD <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In accordance with catheter length determination techniques described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref>, therapy system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may include one or more pressure sensors that are configured to measure a pressure pulse within catheter <b>18</b> during the delivery of a fluid dose. The fluid dose may be an actual fluid dose delivered within patient <b>16</b>, a test dose delivered outside the patient, or a test dose of a test fluid delivered within the patient. IMD <b>12</b> includes control electronics, e.g. one or more processors and non-volatile memories that are configured to receive the measured pressure pulse within catheter <b>18</b> from the pressure sensor(s) and calculate an estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> based on the pressure pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Measuring the pressure pulse within catheter <b>18</b> can include determining a maximum pressure within the catheter and determining a decay time of the pressure pulse. The decay time of a pressure pulse, generally speaking, is the time required for the pressure pulse within the catheter to fall from a first pressure level to a second pressure level. The first pressure level may be a maximum pressure level sensed upon delivery of a fluid amount and the second pressure level may be a baseline pressure. The baseline pressure level may be a pressure sensed before of after the delivery of the fluid amount. IMD <b>12</b> can be configured to measure a baseline pressure within the catheter while no fluid dose is being delivered to the patient. In some examples, the baseline pressure can be measured prior to delivering the fluid dose to the patient through the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Calculating the estimated length of the catheter can include, e.g., calculating the estimated length of the catheter based on the decay time. The estimated length may be calculated automatically, e.g., by IMD <b>12</b> or programmer <b>20</b>, avoiding the need for human intervention. In some cases, the estimated length may be calculated automatically and manually by a human caregiver, such that the automated calculation may be used as a cross-verification check to ensure that the human-measured length is generally accurate. Pressure measurement to estimate catheter length may be performed when the catheter is implanted in the patient (in vivo) or when the catheter is outside the patient prior to implantation (ex vivo).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Additionally, IMD <b>12</b> can be configured to analyze the estimated length to determine if it is representative of an actual length of the catheter. In some cases, catheter <b>18</b> may become disconnected from IMD <b>12</b> or otherwise malfunction due to, e.g., cuts or occlusions in the catheter. IMD <b>12</b> can therefore discern whether the estimated length that is calculated based on the pressure pulse is representative of the actual length of catheter <b>18</b> by identifying conditions indicative of one or more catheter malfunctions. For example, IMD <b>12</b> can determine if the maximum pressure of the pressure pulse is below a minimum pressure threshold value, which may indicate the presence of an air bubble in the fluid pathway or that catheter <b>18</b> is disconnected completely from IMD <b>12</b>. Additionally, IMD <b>12</b> can determine if the decay time is below a minimum threshold value, which may indicate a leak in catheter <b>18</b>. In another example, IMD <b>12</b> can determine if the decay time is above a maximum threshold value, which may indicate an occlusion in catheter <b>18</b>. IMD <b>12</b> can also analyze the pressure pulse by determining if the pressure within the lumen falls below a baseline pressure after decaying from a maximum pressure, which may indicate either a cut in catheter <b>18</b> or that catheter <b>18</b> is disconnected from IMD <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In general, the estimated length may be used to generate a catheter length value for presentation to a user, such as a clinician, e.g., via a user interface external programmer <b>20</b>. The clinician then may select the estimated catheter length for use by programmer <b>20</b> and/or IMD <b>12</b> in calculating appropriate dosage parameters, including parameters for priming and/or bridging boluses. In some cases, the estimated catheter length produced based on the pressure measurements may be used as a cross-verification check to ensure that a previously determined catheter length, such as a catheter length determined by a clinician or other user, is reasonably accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If the automatically estimated catheter length and the catheter length estimated by the clinician are inconsistent, programmer <b>20</b> and/or IMD <b>12</b> may be configured to use the automatically estimated catheter length to compute or recompute dosage parameters, or the programmer and/or IMD may present an alert to the clinician or other user indicating the inconsistency. In some cases, although the catheter length determination may be described as automatic, a user such as a clinician may control programmer <b>20</b> and/or IMD <b>12</b> to initiate the automated catheter length determination at a desired time.</p>

Instructions executed by processor <b>26</b> may, for example, define dosing programs that specify the amount of a therapeutic agent that is delivered to a target tissue site within patient <b>16</b> from reservoir <b>30</b> via catheter <b>18</b>. The instructions may further specify the time at which the agent will be delivered and the time interval over which the agent will be delivered.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one example, fluid delivery pump <b>32</b> can be a squeeze pump that squeezes internal tubing <b>38</b> in a controlled manner, e.g., such as a peristaltic pump, to progressively move fluid from reservoir <b>34</b> to the distal end of catheter <b>18</b> and then into patient <b>16</b> according to parameters specified by a set of program information stored on memory <b>28</b> and executed by processor <b>26</b>. Fluid delivery pump <b>32</b> can also be an axial pump, a centrifugal pump, a pusher plate, a piston-driven pump, or other means for moving fluid through internal tubing <b>38</b> and catheter <b>18</b>. In one particular example, fluid delivery pump <b>32</b> can be an electromechanical pump that delivers fluid by the application of pressure generated by a piston that moves in the presence of a varying magnetic field and that is configured to draw fluid from reservoir <b>34</b> and pump the fluid through internal tubing <b>38</b> and catheter <b>18</b> to patient <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Periodically, fluid may need to be supplied transcutaneously to reservoir <b>34</b> because all of a therapeutic agent has been or will be delivered to patient <b>16</b>, or because a clinician wishes to replace an existing agent with a different agent or similar agent with different concentrations of therapeutic ingredients. Refill port <b>26</b> can therefore comprise a self-sealing membrane to prevent loss of therapeutic agent delivered to reservoir <b>30</b> via refill port <b>26</b>. For example, after a percutaneous delivery system, e.g., a hypodermic needle, penetrates the membrane of refill port <b>26</b>, the membrane may seal shut when the needle is removed from refill port <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Pump <b>32</b> may deliver fluid in controlled pulses. When pump <b>32</b> is called upon by processor <b>26</b> to deliver a fluid dose through catheter <b>18</b>, processor <b>26</b> may also control pressure sensor <b>40</b> to measure a pressure pulse within catheter <b>18</b> that is generated by the delivery of fluid through catheter <b>18</b>. Pressure sensor <b>40</b> can also measure a steady state baseline pressure within catheter <b>18</b> when no fluid dose is being delivered to patient <b>16</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail below, pressure sensor <b>40</b> can be any of a number of types of sensors that are capable of measuring the pressure within an implantable catheter including, e.g. capacitive and inductive pressure sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Pressure sensor <b>40</b> can read either gauge or absolute pressure of the fluid in catheter <b>18</b>. Because methods disclosed herein rely on comparison of pressure just prior to and during delivery of a fluid dose to a patient through the catheter <b>18</b>, changes in ambient pressure may be of reduced importance in implementing examples according to this disclosure (especially where the successive pulses are delivered within relatively short time frames, e.g., within minutes or even seconds of each other).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In those instances where, however, it is desirable to use pressure measurements from sensor <b>40</b> that are adjusted to account for ambient pressure outside of the catheter <b>18</b>, a reference pressure may be detected within the body of patient <b>16</b> in which catheter <b>18</b> is implanted or may be detected outside of the patient's body. When detected within the body of patient <b>16</b>, a reference pressure may be detected in a location near IMD <b>12</b> or the target delivery site near distal end <b>18</b>B of catheter <b>18</b>, or even in a location in a separate area of the patient's body. A reference pressure may be obtained in any location capable of providing a pressure indicative of the external environment of implanted catheter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one example, an infusion system may include a catheter <b>18</b> having a first lumen for delivering a fluid and a second lumen through which no fluid is delivered. A reference pressure may then be detected in the second lumen. The second lumen in catheter <b>18</b> can be used to obtain a reference pressure from distal end <b>18</b>B of catheter <b>18</b>, from a region near the target delivery site of therapy system <b>10</b>. An expanded explanation of reference pressures may be found in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,320,676, entitled PRESSURE SENSING IN IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL DEVICES, by Miesel.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The pressure pulse(s) measured by pressure sensor <b>40</b> during delivery of a fluid dose to patient <b>16</b> can be stored in memory <b>28</b>. Processor <b>26</b> can access one or more stored pressure pulses to calculate an estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> based on an algorithm, group of algorithms, or a series of executable steps in any form, which may also be stored in memory <b>28</b>. Processor <b>26</b> may also rely on one or more look-up tables, or other data aggregations stored in memory <b>28</b> to calculate the estimated length of catheter <b>18</b>. For example, processor <b>26</b> may retrieve stored pressure pulses from a look-up table in memory <b>28</b>. Processor <b>26</b> may also analyze the estimated length calculation to determine whether the estimate is representative of an actual length of catheter <b>18</b>. Analyzing the estimated length can be executed using the same or a different algorithm used for calculating the estimated length, which may also be stored in memory <b>28</b> of IMD <b>12</b>. Memory <b>28</b> may include any volatile or non-volatile media, such as a random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), flash memory, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Although controlling fluid pump <b>32</b> and sensor <b>40</b> to deliver fluid through catheter <b>18</b> and measure a pressure pulse therein has been described as executed by IMD <b>12</b>, and in particular, processor <b>26</b>, in other examples one or more of these functions may be carried out by other devices including, e.g., external programmer <b>20</b>. For example, a user may interact with external programmer <b>20</b> to command processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> to control fluid pump <b>32</b> to deliver a fluid dose to patient <b>16</b> through catheter <b>18</b>. Thereafter, pressure sensor <b>40</b> may measure a pressure pulse within catheter <b>18</b> during delivery of the fluid dose and processor <b>26</b> may control telemetry module <b>30</b> to transmit the measured pressure pulse data to external programmer <b>20</b>. External programmer <b>20</b> may, in some cases, store the measured pressure pulse data in one or more non-volatile memories included in the programmer. In any event, a processor housed within programmer <b>20</b> may calculate an estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> based on the measured pressure pulse received from IMD <b>12</b> in accordance with the techniques described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition to storing pressure pulse measurement data obtained by pressure sensor <b>40</b> and one or more algorithms used to execute example methods according to this disclosure, memory <b>28</b> may store program information including instructions for execution by processor <b>26</b>, such as, but not limited to, therapy programs, historical therapy programs, timing programs for delivery of fluid from reservoir <b>34</b> to catheter <b>18</b>, and any other information regarding therapy of patient <b>16</b>. A program may indicate the bolus size or flow rate of the drug, and processor <b>26</b> may accordingly deliver therapy. A program may also indicate the frequency at which pressure sensor <b>40</b> is commanded to measure a pressure pulse and, as will be discussed in greater detail below, instructions for estimating the length of catheter <b>18</b> based on one or more measured pressure pulses. Memory <b>28</b> may include separate memories for storing instructions, patient information, therapy parameters (e.g., grouped into sets referred to as &#x201c;dosing programs&#x201d;), therapy adjustment information, program histories, and other categories of information such as any other data that may benefit from separate physical memory modules. Therapy adjustment information may include information relating to timing, frequency, rates and amounts of patient boluses or other permitted patient modifications to therapy. In some examples, memory <b>28</b> stores program instructions that, when executed by processor <b>26</b>, cause IMD <b>12</b> and processor <b>26</b> to perform the functions athibuted to them in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At various times during the operation of IMD <b>12</b> to treat patient <b>16</b>, communication to and from IMD <b>12</b> may be necessary to, e.g., change therapy programs, adjust parameters within one or more programs, configure or adjust a particular bolus, send or receive an estimated length of catheter <b>18</b>, or to otherwise download information to or from IMD <b>12</b>. Processor <b>26</b> therefore controls telemetry module <b>30</b> to wirelessly communicate between IMD <b>12</b> and other devices including, e.g. programmer <b>20</b>. Telemetry module <b>30</b> in IMD <b>12</b>, as well as telemetry modules in other devices described herein, such as programmer <b>20</b>, can be configured to use RF communication techniques to wirelessly send and receive information to and from other devices respectively. In addition, telemetry module <b>30</b> may communicate with programmer <b>20</b> via proximal inductive interaction between IMD <b>12</b> and the external programmer. Telemetry module <b>30</b> may send information to external programmer <b>20</b> on a continuous basis, at periodic intervals, or upon request from the programmer.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Power source <b>44</b> delivers operating power to various components of IMD <b>12</b>. Power source <b>44</b> may include a small rechargeable or non-rechargeable battery and a power generation circuit to produce the operating power. In the case of a rechargeable battery, recharging may be accomplished through proximal inductive interaction between an external charger and an inductive charging coil within IMD <b>12</b>. In some examples, power requirements may be small enough to allow IMD <b>12</b> to utilize patient motion and implement a kinetic energy-scavenging device to trickle charge a rechargeable battery. In other examples, traditional batteries may be used for a limited period of time. As another alternative, an external inductive power supply could transcutaneously power IMD <b>12</b> as needed or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an example method of determining a length of an implantable catheter. Method <b>50</b> includes measuring a baseline pressure within a lumen of the catheter while no fluid dose is being delivered to the patient (step <b>52</b>), delivering a fluid dose to a patient through the catheter (step <b>54</b>), measuring a pressure pulse within the lumen of the catheter during the delivery of the fluid dose to the patient (step <b>56</b>), calculating an estimated length of the catheter based on the measured pressure pulse (step <b>58</b>), and analyzing the estimated length to determine if it is representative of an actual length of the catheter (step <b>60</b>). Thereafter, or at any other time during the execution of methods according to this disclosure measured pressure pulse, estimated length, and data relating to the analysis of the estimated length may be stored temporarily or permanently stored in, e.g., a non-volatile memory.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Method <b>50</b>, as well as other examples according to this disclosure can be implemented using, e.g. processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> to execute one or more algorithms stored in memory <b>28</b>. In other examples, however, method <b>50</b> may be carried out using the control electronics, e.g. internal memory and processor of an external fluid delivery device that controls delivery of a therapeutic agent through a transcutaneous catheter. In still another example, method <b>50</b> may be carried out cooperatively by more than one device including, e.g., external programmer <b>20</b> and IMD <b>12</b>, which receives pressure measurement data from IMD <b>12</b> by wireless telemetry. Method <b>50</b> is generally directed to automatically determining, i.e. without the need for human interaction, the length of an implantable catheter based on the characteristics of a pressure pulse generated within the catheter during delivery of a fluid dose to a patient. Determining the length of the implanted catheter without relying on the implanting physician measuring and recording length can assist in and improve proper delivery of, e.g., priming and bridging boluses, or any other doses in which catheter length is critical to proper and safe delivery of the therapeutic agent to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">One task required with implantable infusion therapies is the calculation of priming and/or bridging boluses. Miscalculation of the bolus duration can result in undesirable overdose or underdose scenarios. A key parameter used to calculate the duration of a bridge or priming bolus is the volume of the catheter, which is directly proportional to the implanted catheter length. In particular, given a known catheter lumen diameter, the catheter length is used to calculate catheter volume. It is typically the responsibility of the implanting physician to manually measure and record the catheter length. However, if this recording is done in error or not at all, then the subsequent bolus calculations will also be subject to error, which in turn can lead to conditions including overdosing or underdosing the patient in which the device is implanted.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Examples disclosed herein therefore may augment or replace the need for manually entering the catheter length in implantable fluid delivery systems, reducing the possibility of miscalculating dosing durations including, e.g. the duration of a bridge or priming bolus. These example methods and systems can be important when a patient changes clinics or is out of the area in which his or her clinic is located and needs to have a pump refilled with a new drug, in which case the patient may need a bridging bolus. If the catheter type and length is not available, this method may allow a reasonable estimate of the dead space to be calculated for the switch over from one drug to another.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, method <b>50</b> initially involves processor <b>26</b> controlling pressure sensor <b>40</b> to measure a baseline pressure within the lumen of catheter <b>18</b> while no fluid dose is being delivered to patient <b>16</b> (step <b>52</b>). In order to establish a reference pressure within catheter <b>18</b>, method <b>50</b> may include measuring the pressure within the lumen of the catheter while it is full of fluid but not during delivery of any fluid dose to the patient. Measuring the pressure under these conditions will establish the baseline pressure from which other conditions can be judged, e.g., the pressure pulse generated within the catheter during delivery of a fluid dose to the patient. The baseline pressure can be measured (step <b>52</b>) by pressure sensor <b>40</b> any time before or after processor <b>26</b> controls fluid delivery pump <b>32</b> to deliver a fluid dose to a patient through catheter <b>18</b> (step <b>54</b>). For example, the baseline pressure can be measured upon implantation of therapy system <b>10</b> after a priming bolus has been delivered to fill catheter <b>18</b> with fluid. In another example, the baseline pressure can be measured just prior to fluid pump <b>32</b> delivering a fluid dose to patient <b>16</b> (step <b>54</b>). In still another example, the baseline pressure can be measured before and after fluid pump <b>32</b> delivers the fluid dose (step <b>54</b>) and processor <b>26</b> controls pressure sensor <b>40</b> to measure the pressure pulse (step <b>56</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition to measuring the baseline pressure (step <b>52</b>), method <b>50</b> includes processor <b>26</b> controlling fluid delivery pump <b>32</b> to deliver a fluid dose to patient <b>16</b> through catheter <b>18</b> (step <b>54</b>). As discussed with reference to therapy system <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, catheter <b>18</b> may be connected to IMD <b>12</b>, which includes fluid pump <b>32</b> configured to deliver a fluid therapeutic agent to patient <b>16</b> through the catheter. In examples according to this disclosure, a single stroke of fluid pump <b>32</b> may be configured to deliver a nominal fluid dose or pulse to patient <b>16</b> through catheter <b>18</b> with a relatively small volume and little or no therapeutic affect on the patient. For example, the volume of fluid agent delivered to patient <b>16</b> from a single stroke of one example pump mechanism could be as small as 1 micro liter. In this way, for purposes of determining the length of catheter <b>18</b>, the fluid dose can be delivered to patient <b>16</b> through the catheter at virtually any time with little to no affect on the patient's therapy program or schedule.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The timing and frequency of the fluid dose that is delivered to the patient for purposes of examples according to this disclosure can vary depending on the intended application. For example, a nominal fluid dose could be delivered to the patient for purposes of initially determining the length of the catheter once shortly after the catheter is implanted within the patient, e.g., before activation of therapy programs. In any event, timing and frequency can be controlled by the control electronics within the IMD to which the implantable catheter is connected, e.g. processor <b>26</b> and memory <b>28</b> of IMD <b>12</b>. For example, IMD <b>12</b> used in accordance with examples disclosed herein can include memory <b>28</b> that stores one or more algorithms that include instructions executed by processor <b>26</b> for periodically delivering nominal fluid doses to patient <b>16</b> in order to measure a pressure pulse within catheter <b>18</b> that is then used to estimate the length of catheter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In another example, the algorithms can query when and how often the therapy program for IMD <b>12</b> delivers therapeutic doses to patient <b>16</b> to determine if additional nominal doses are necessary for purposes of estimating the length of catheter <b>18</b>. In other words, IMD <b>12</b> can be configured to integrate the functions associated with examples of determining the length of catheter <b>18</b> with the execution of the therapy program of patient <b>16</b> by measuring the pressure within catheter <b>18</b> during delivery of a regularly scheduled therapeutic dose to the patient. The calculated length can then be used, i.e., plugged into, equations used to compute dosages for the therapy programs. In particular, each program may take into account catheter volume, as a function of catheter length, in computing dosages to be delivered to patient <b>16</b> in the ordinary course of therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Method <b>50</b> also includes measuring a pressure pulse within the lumen during the delivery of the fluid dose (step <b>56</b>). As described with reference to IMD <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, pressure sensor <b>40</b> fluidly connected to implanted catheter <b>18</b> can measure the pressure within the lumen of catheter <b>18</b> at any time that fluid pump <b>32</b> is called upon to deliver a fluid dose to patient <b>16</b>. Pressure sensor <b>40</b> can be any of a number of types of sensors that are capable of measuring the pressure within an implantable catheter including. Examples of pressure sensors include capacitive and inductive pressure sensors. The pressure measured by sensor <b>40</b> can be gauge or absolute pressure, but, in any event, will include a characteristic transient pressure pulse with a maximum pressure that is generated when the fluid dose is delivered as the pressure in catheter <b>18</b> increases slightly in reaction to the dose before settling back to a steady state, i.e., baseline pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In order to better understand the response of an implantable catheter to fluid pressure inputs, a canine study was performed that, inter alta, measured pressure pulses within an implanted intrathecal catheter with varying lengths and/or defects. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a pressure pulse representative of results of this study. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a plot of pressure versus time that illustrates the pressure within an implanted catheter during the delivery of a fluid dose to a patient. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, transient pressure pulse <b>64</b> is generated when the fluid dose is delivered through catheter <b>18</b> to patient <b>16</b>. Pressure pulse <b>64</b> includes a maximum pressure, P<sub>max </sub>to which the pressure within catheter <b>18</b> climbs almost instantaneously from the baseline pressure, P<sub>B </sub>after the pump mechanism <b>32</b> of IMD <b>12</b> begins delivering the fluid dose to patient <b>16</b>. Pressure pulse <b>64</b> also includes a total duration, t<sub>T</sub>, and a decay time, t<sub>D</sub>. The decay time t<sub>D </sub>is the time required for the pressure pulse within the lumen of catheter <b>18</b> to fall from the maximum pressure P<sub>max </sub>to the baseline pressure P<sub>B</sub>. Because the pressure rises from the baseline pressure P<sub>B </sub>to the maximum pressure P<sub>max </sub>almost instantaneously, in many cases the total duration t<sub>T </sub>of pressure pulse <b>64</b> may be almost equal to the decay time t<sub>D</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pressure pulse within the lumen that is measured in methods according to this disclosure has several distinct characteristics. Therefore, in the examples disclosed herein, measuring the pressure pulse (step <b>56</b>) can include, e.g., processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> further analyzing the pressure measurement data received from pressure sensor <b>40</b> to determine one or more of the maximum pressure (step <b>70</b>), the decay time (step <b>72</b>), and the total duration (step <b>74</b>) of the pressure pulse as illustrated in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It was discovered from the canine study that the pressure pulse waveform, such as the pressure pulse <b>64</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for a normally functioning catheter with a length of approximately 80 centimeters generated a maximum pressure of about 10.66 KPa. The catheter used in the study was model number 8709 manufactured by Medtronic, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minn. The rise from the baseline pressure was nearly instantaneous relative to a 250 hertz sampling rate that was used to measure pressure within the catheter. The form of the decay from the maximum pressure back to the baseline was exponential (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) with a decay constant on the order of 0.038 seconds and total decay time approximately equal to 0.100 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in addition to measuring a pressure pulse within the lumen during the delivery of the fluid dose (step <b>56</b>), method <b>50</b> includes calculating an estimated length of catheter <b>18</b>, e.g., via processor <b>26</b>, based on the measured pressure pulse (step <b>58</b>). The pressure change within the lumen of catheter <b>18</b> caused by delivering a fluid dose therethrough, i.e., the pressure pulse, is a function of, at least in part, the length of the catheter. Therefore, the length of a properly functioning implanted catheter <b>18</b> can be estimated with reasonable accuracy based on the magnitude and/or characteristics of the pressure pulse measured within the lumen during the delivery of the fluid dose to patient <b>16</b> (step <b>56</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, calculating the estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> based on the measured pressure pulse (step <b>58</b>) can include processor <b>26</b> calculating the estimated length based on the decay time (t<sub>D</sub>) of the pressure pulse. As explained above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the decay time of the pressure pulse can, in many cases, be virtually equal to the total duration of the pressure pulse (t<sub>T</sub>) because the pressure rises almost instantaneously from the baseline (P<sub>B</sub>) to a maximum pressure (P<sub>max</sub>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a plot of catheter length versus pressure pulse decay time that illustrates the relationship of length to pressure within the delivery lumen of a normally functioning catheter. The curve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is representative of experimental data generated by measuring pressure pulse decay times for a catheter as the length of the catheter was varied. In general, the length of the implanted catheter is directly proportional to the decay time of the pressure pulse generated during delivery of a fluid dose through the catheter. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the length of the catheter increases linearly as the decay time of the pressure pulse increases, and decreases linearly as the decay time decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the canine study discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an implanted intrathecal catheter was continuously cut to shorten the catheter from full length to near-zero length (e.g. cut at or near the exit port from the IMD to which the catheter was connected). As the location of the cut in the catheter moved closer to the exit port of the IMD, i.e. as the catheter length decreased, the decay time of the pressure pulse decreased from 0.100 seconds down to zero seconds in a linear manner. As a percentage of the full length of the implanted catheter, the decay time of the pressure pulse decreased from 0.100 seconds at full length to 0.060 seconds at 80% of full length, 0.040 seconds at 50% of full length, and 0.020 seconds at 25% of full length. Using an experimental relationship such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and described with reference to the canine study, the estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> can be calculated by processor <b>26</b> based on the decay time of the pressure pulse generated within the lumen of catheter <b>18</b> when fluid pump <b>32</b> delivers the fluid dose to patient <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In general, calculating the estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> may depend not only on properties or characteristics of the measured pressure pulse, but also on the particular fluidic resistance characteristics of the catheter including, e.g., fluidic resistance per unit length and volumetric compliance per unit length. In some examples, catheter <b>18</b> may be of a known type with known characteristics that may be stored, e.g., in memory <b>28</b> of IMD <b>12</b> (or in another location, e.g. memory on external programmer <b>20</b>). In such examples, processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> may retrieve key characteristics (e.g. fluidic resistance per unit length and volumetric compliance per unit length) of catheter <b>18</b> from a look-up table stored in memory <b>28</b> or memory in programmer <b>20</b>. Processor <b>26</b> may then account for the catheter characteristics retrieved from memory <b>28</b> in the calculation of the estimated length of catheter <b>18</b>. In other examples, catheter <b>18</b> may be of a known type, but with unknown characteristics. The type of catheter <b>18</b> may, in such examples, be stored in memory <b>28</b> of IMD <b>12</b>. In another example, neither the type nor any of the characteristics of catheter <b>18</b> are known and/or stored. In examples where either or both of the type or characteristics of catheter <b>18</b> are unknown and/or unrecorded, catheter characteristics relevant to length calculations may be assumed to provide a range boundary to the estimated length calculation. In any of the examples incorporating catheter characteristics, IMD <b>12</b> may communicate with external programmer <b>20</b> to provide an alert or other notification to a user, e.g. patient and/or clinician, that prompts the user to, e.g., provide or augment any missing or incorrect catheter information or notifies the user whenever any assumptions are applied to the estimated length calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Using the fluidic resistance characteristics of catheter <b>18</b> and the above described characteristics of the measured pressure pulse, the length of catheter <b>18</b> may be estimated analytically instead of by referencing experimental data as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In such cases, the overall pump catheter system including, e.g. fluid pump <b>32</b> and catheter <b>18</b> may be approximated by an electrical analog that represents fluidic restriction (e.g. represented as resistance) and compliance (e.g. represented as capacitance), and pressure (e.g. represented as power) of the various components of and at various locations in the system model. In some examples, the dominant characteristics of the electrical analog model are the fluidic resistance and compliance of catheter <b>18</b>. The input signal to the system may be a relatively rapid, e.g. less than approximately 0.005 seconds, pressure pulse that is assumed to be a unit-impulse response to a fluid dose delivered through catheter <b>18</b>. Within the overall system model, catheter <b>18</b> may itself behave as a distributed restriction and compliance model having an equivalent model that may be represented by a single or lumped restriction and compliance value including, e.g., the total fluidic resistance of the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The length of catheter <b>18</b> can be estimated by determining the total fluidic resistance of the catheter, because the total fluidic resistance is equal to the length of the catheter multiplied by a fluidic resistance per unit length constant for the catheter. In general, the fluidic resistance per unit length constant of catheter <b>18</b> is dependent on the size, shape, and material properties of the catheter lumen. In one example system model, the instantaneous flow rate of fluid within catheter <b>18</b> is equal to the differential pressure across the length of the catheter divided by the total fluidic resistance of the catheter. The volume of fluid dispensed into catheter <b>18</b> is equal to the integral of flow rate over time and may be assumed to be a constant including, e.g. a nominal dose equal to approximately 1 micro liter. Therefore, the dispensed volume is equal to a constant, which is equal to the integral of the differential pressure across the length of catheter <b>18</b> divided by the total fluidic resistance of the catheter over time. Compliance in the overall system and in catheter <b>18</b> is the physical property that creates the exponential decay of the measured pressure pulse illustrated and described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The integral of the measured exponential pressure pulse over time is proportional to the volume of fluid dispensed through catheter <b>18</b>. In particular, the integral of the measured pressure pulse is equal to the total fluidic resistance of catheter <b>18</b> multiplied by the dispensed volume. Therefore, the total fluidic resistance of catheter <b>18</b> is equal to the integral of the measured pressure pulse divided by the volume of dispensed fluid, i.e. is equal to a constant including, e.g. 1 micro liter. The total fluidic resistance of catheter <b>18</b> can therefore be calculated from the measured pressure pulse and the known volume of the fluid dose delivered to patient <b>12</b>. The length of catheter <b>18</b> is equal to total fluidic resistance divided by the fluidic resistance per unit length constant for the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Method <b>50</b> also may include analyzing the estimated length to determine if it is representative of an actual length of catheter <b>18</b> (step <b>60</b>). For example, processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> can analyze the estimated length calculation to determine if it is representative of the actual length of catheter <b>18</b>, or if it has been affected by, e.g., one or more defects in or malfunctions of catheter <b>18</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a number of examples by which processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> may determine if the estimated length calculated in examples disclosed herein is representative of the actual length of catheter <b>18</b> (step <b>60</b>). In one example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, processor <b>26</b> can compare the decay time (t<sub>D</sub>) of the pressure pulse generated within the lumen of catheter <b>18</b> to a minimum threshold value to determine if the catheter is disconnected from IMD <b>12</b> or contains a cut or leak proximate IMD <b>12</b> (step <b>80</b>). In a similar manner, processor <b>26</b> can also compare the estimated length (L<sub>est</sub>) to a minimum threshold value to determine if catheter <b>18</b> is disconnected or contains a cut or leak (step <b>82</b>). If catheter <b>18</b> is cut proximate to or is disconnected from IMD <b>12</b>, the estimated length calculated by processor <b>26</b> based on the measured pressure pulse will be relatively small because the decay time of the pressure pulse, which is proportional to the length of catheter <b>18</b>, will have a smaller magnitude than a normally functioning catheter. Therefore, processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> can compare the calculated estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> and/or the decay time of the pressure pulse to a minimum value to determine if catheter <b>18</b> is disconnected or has a leak and therefore is not exhibiting a length estimate that is representative of the actual length of catheter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The magnitude of the minimum length threshold to which the estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> is compared may vary depending on, e.g. the type of therapy being delivered and the implantation location of IMD <b>12</b> and the target drug delivery site within patient <b>16</b>. For example, an average catheter length for intrathecal fluid drug delivery may be approximately equal to 80 centimeters. The average or typical length for catheter <b>18</b> may be used to set a threshold minimum that represents catheter lengths that are outside of range above and below the typical length.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In another example, processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> can compare a maximum pressure within the lumen of catheter <b>18</b> to a minimum threshold value to determine if catheter <b>18</b> is disconnected from IMD <b>12</b> or contains an air bubble (step <b>84</b>). As explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, during the delivery of a fluid dose to patient <b>16</b> a characteristic pressure pulse will exhibit a maximum pressure, P<sub>max</sub>, to which the pressure within catheter <b>18</b> climbs from a baseline pressure, P<sub>B</sub>, after the fluid pump <b>32</b> of IMD <b>12</b> begins delivering the fluid dose to patient <b>16</b>. In the case catheter <b>18</b> is disconnected from IMD <b>12</b> or contains an air bubble, the maximum pressure of the pressure pulse may have an unusually low value.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Generally speaking, the decay time of the measured pressure pulse is directly proportional to the maximum pressure, making the magnitude of the pressure generated within catheter <b>18</b> during the delivery of a fluid dose directly proportional to the length. Therefore, lower maximum pressures will generally indicate shorter decay times and shorter lengths of catheter <b>18</b>. A minimum pressure threshold may be set that represents pressures indicating lengths of catheter <b>18</b> that are unusually low for the particular therapeutic application of IMD <b>12</b>. As with the minimum length threshold described above, the average or typical length for catheter <b>18</b> may be used to set a threshold minimum pressure that represents pressure values that will yield catheter lengths that are outside of range above and below the typical length.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In addition to referencing average or typical catheter lengths, the magnitude of the minimum pressure threshold may be set based on experimental data for different types of catheters of varying lengths. For example, in the above referenced canine study it was determined that the maximum pressure for the a cut or disconnected catheter having near-zero length falls off from around 10.66 KPa for a full length normally functioning catheter to a value around 4 KPa. Additionally, the study showed that air bubbles trapped within the pressure circuit, e.g. within catheter <b>18</b> dampen the magnitude of the maximum pressure of the pressure pulse by a factor of 10. Once a minimum pressure threshold value is set, processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> can compare the maximum pressure of the pressure pulse measured by pressure sensor <b>40</b> during delivery of the fluid dose to patient <b>16</b> to the minimum to determine if catheter <b>18</b> may be disconnected from IMD <b>12</b> or contains an air bubble and therefore is not exhibiting a length estimate that is representative of the actual length of catheter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In still other examples, processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> can compare the decay time of the pressure pulse generated within the lumen of catheter <b>18</b> to a maximum threshold value to determine if catheter <b>18</b> includes an occlusion (step <b>86</b>). In some examples in which catheter <b>18</b> includes an occlusion along the length thereof, the pressure pulse generated within catheter <b>18</b> during delivery of a fluid dose to patient <b>16</b> may reach a maximum pressure, but may not decay to the baseline pressure before a subsequent fluid dose delivery. In such examples, a second dose delivered to patient <b>16</b> by fluid pump <b>32</b> may then raise the pressure in the lumen of catheter <b>18</b> to a second maximum followed by a drop to another elevated pressure that is again above the baseline pressure. This transient pressure pulse behavior may be caused by the fluid being trapped within catheter <b>18</b> by the blockage. Because the pressure within catheter <b>18</b> does not drop to the baseline pressure, the decay time cannot be measured based on the pressure data provided by pressure sensor <b>40</b>. In such examples, processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> can compare the decay time of the pressure pulse measured by pressure sensor <b>40</b> during delivery of the fluid dose to patient <b>16</b> to a maximum to determine if catheter <b>18</b> is occluded and therefore is not exhibiting a length estimate that is representative of the actual length of catheter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in another example, processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> can compare a minimum pressure within catheter <b>18</b> during delivery of a fluid dose to patient <b>16</b> to the baseline pressure to determine if catheter <b>18</b> has a cut or leak (step <b>88</b>). In some cases where catheter <b>18</b> includes a cut or leak very close to IMD <b>12</b>, the pressure pulse generated during delivery of the fluid dose may exhibit a characteristic negative minimum pressure below the baseline pressure as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a plot of pressure versus time that illustrates the pressure within an implanted catheter during the delivery of a fluid dose to a patient. The pressure pulse shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is representative of a catheter that has a cut close to a proximal end thereof connected to an IMD. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, transient pressure pulse <b>100</b> is generated when the fluid dose is delivered through catheter <b>18</b> to patient <b>16</b>. Pressure pulse <b>100</b> includes a maximum pressure to which the pressure within catheter <b>18</b> climbs from the baseline pressure, P<sub>B</sub>, after the pump mechanism <b>32</b> of IMD <b>12</b> begins delivering the fluid dose to patient <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In contrast to the example that compares the maximum pressure to a minimum threshold described above with reference to step <b>84</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the maximum pressure of pressure pulse <b>100</b> reaches a level typically associated with a properly functioning catheter <b>18</b>. However, pressure pulse <b>100</b> decays to a minimum pressure, P<sub>min</sub>, that is less than the baseline pressure. The negative minimum pressure illustrated by pressure pulse <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may occur because a catheter cut close to or at the proximal connection to the IMD behaves like an undamped system in which the pressure drops more rapidly from the maximum pressure and therefore overshoots the baseline pressure by a non-trivial amount. For example, in the canine study previously referenced, the pressure pulse for a cut catheter rose and decayed quickly, and then dropped below the baseline pressure by approximately 1.33 KPa. In examples including a pressure pulse with such a characteristic negative minimum pressure, processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> can compare a minimum pressure of the pressure pulse measured by pressure sensor <b>40</b> to a baseline pressure to determine if catheter <b>18</b> is cut and therefore is not exhibiting a length estimate that is representative of the actual length of catheter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the event that processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> determines that the analysis performed in all of steps <b>80</b>-<b>88</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> produces negative results, processor <b>26</b> may conclude that catheter <b>18</b> contains no malfunctions (step <b>90</b>) and that the estimated length is representative of the actual length of the catheter. If positive results are produced, processor <b>26</b> may detect a catheter malfunction and generate an appropriate alert to the patient and/or clinician. The alert may be a tactile, audible or visible alert presented via the IMD <b>12</b> or external programmer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Once the estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> has been analyzed and deemed satisfactory by, e.g., the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, IMD <b>12</b> may store the estimated length in memory <b>28</b> and/or present the length to a user. For example, an implanting physician may use therapy system <b>10</b> including catheter length estimation means according to this disclosure to confirm the proper implantation of catheter <b>18</b> within patient <b>16</b>. In such examples, processor <b>26</b> of IMD <b>12</b> may implement a method according to this disclosure to calculate an estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> after the physician has implanted therapy system <b>10</b> within patient <b>16</b>. IMD <b>12</b> may store the estimated length of catheter <b>18</b> in memory <b>28</b> from which it may be accessed and/or transmitted to other devices by processor <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">For example, processor <b>26</b> may transmit the estimated length calculation to external programmer <b>20</b> to be displayed via a user interface thereon. In this way, the implanting physician, or any other authorized user may access the estimated length calculated by IMD <b>12</b>. In some cases, the estimated length calculation may be used by processor <b>26</b> to compute or recompute dosages for therapy programs. In other cases, if the estimated length calculation is generally consistent with a previously estimated length calculation, e.g., by the clinician or otherwise, processor <b>26</b> takes no action and does not compute or recompute dosages. Hence, processor <b>26</b> may generate an alert in the event a malfunction is detected, or generate an alert in the event the estimated catheter length is inconsistent with a previous catheter length determination.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> show examples of pressure sensor appropriate for use with methods and systems according to this disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of an example pressure sensor <b>40</b>A including upper diaphragm <b>110</b>, lower diaphragm <b>112</b>, sensor casing <b>114</b>, conductive material <b>116</b>, complementary conductive material <b>118</b>, stationary insulator <b>120</b>, coupler <b>122</b> and capacitive sensor <b>124</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, sensor <b>40</b>A is a capacitive flow sensor utilizing two diaphragms <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. Upper diaphragm <b>110</b> is mounted to sensor casing <b>114</b>. Upper diaphragm <b>110</b> may be made from or coated, at least partially, with a conductive material <b>116</b>. Complementary conductive material <b>118</b> may be coated on stationary insulator <b>120</b>, which may, in some examples, be a sapphire insulator. In one example, a 0.002 inch gap is created between conductive materials <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>. Using air as an insulator, conductive materials <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> form a capacitor. As upper diaphragm <b>110</b> moves in response to pressure changes, the capacitance created by conductive materials <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> also changes.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A similar arrangement exists on the opposite end of sensor casing <b>114</b> with lower diaphragm <b>112</b>. Conductive materials <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are coated on lower diaphragm <b>112</b> and sapphire insulator <b>120</b>, respectively, forming another capacitor. Coupler <b>122</b> is positioned for relative movement with, preferably against, both upper diaphragm <b>110</b> and lower diaphragm <b>112</b>. Capacitive sensors <b>124</b> are sensitive to changes in capacitances from movement of each of upper and lower diaphragms <b>112</b> and may provide the pressure measurements from within catheter <b>18</b> used in examples according to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The dual diaphragm and dual capacitor arrangement described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> actually multiplies the amount of change in capacitance with a given amount of movement in diaphragms <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. Since the pressure changes are small, the movement of diaphragms <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> are small. The capacitance change is additive resulting in twice the performance. In one example, coupler <b>126</b> contacts diaphragms <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> in the center of the diaphragms in order to obtain the maximum movement of the diaphragms. Coupler <b>126</b> should not significantly inhibit the movement of diaphragms <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates example pressure sensor <b>40</b>B which operates on a change in inductance and includes upper diaphragm <b>110</b>, lower diaphragm <b>112</b>, coupler <b>122</b>, center primary coil <b>130</b>, upper secondary coil <b>132</b>, lower secondary coil <b>134</b>, and magnetic element <b>136</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, sensor <b>40</b>B again has two diaphragms <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> with coupler <b>122</b> mounted for movement therebetween. A center primary coil <b>130</b> is arranged is configured to be excited with an alternating current. Upper and lower secondary coils, <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> respectively, are mounted above and below primary coil <b>130</b>, respectively. Magnetic element <b>136</b> is mounted for movement with coupler <b>122</b>. As magnetic element <b>136</b> moves up and/or down in response to changes in pressure, the inductance induced in secondary coils <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> varies. An inductance sensor (not shown) can detect the change in these inductances and provide an output indicative of a change in pressure. Again, this arrangement doubles the effectiveness of movement in diaphragms <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> by additively combining the changes in inductance of each individual secondary coil <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Examples presented in this disclosure may augment or replace the need for manually entering the catheter length in implantable fluid delivery systems, thereby promoting accuracy in the calculation of dosing durations including, e.g. the duration of a bridge or priming bolus. The techniques described herein include therapy systems with one or more pressure sensors configured to measure pressure somewhere within an IMD fluid pathway (e.g. a catheter attached thereto, and/or internal tubes within the IMD) while a dose of the therapeutic agent is delivered to the patient. The IMD in such therapy systems, and/or another device may be configured to calculate an estimated length of the catheter based on the measured pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Calculating the length of the catheter without relying on human intervention (e.g. implanting physician measuring and recording length) can assist in and improve properly delivering, e.g., priming and bridging boluses, or any other doses in which catheter length is critical to proper and safe delivery of the therapeutic agent to the patient. In some cases, the automatically determined catheter length may be used in computing doses, or used as a cross-verification check to ensure the reasonable accuracy of catheter length determinations made by a clinician or other caregiver. The disclosed methods and systems can be important when a patient changes clinics or is out of the area in which his or her clinic is located and needs to have a pump refilled with a new drug, i.e. needs a bridging bolus. If the catheter type and length is not available, this method would allow a reasonable estimate of the dead space to be calculated for the switch over from one drug to another.</p>
