<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention is directed to a combination headgear and eye protection system. More specifically, the technology relates to a highly adjustable eye protection system that may attach to a headgear assembly via a magnetic ball-and-disc.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In certain industrial professions and sporting activities, it is preferable to wear headgear to protect the professional or sportsman's (collectively &#x201c;user&#x201d;) hearing, due to loud noise. Examples in the professional setting include, but are in no way limited to, construction workers, craftsman, airport ground support, and military personnel. Sportsmen who often encounter loud noises include hunters and any individuals who recreationally use firearms. These individuals must don earplugs, ear muffs or similar headgear in order to prevent hearing loss or injury to the user's ears.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, these users often prefer to use some form of protective eyewear. This is because there is often a risk of eye damage in the event of a misfire of a firearm while engaged in a recreational activity. Likewise, there is always a risk of some form of debris when the user is engaged in a professional activity such as construction, woodworking, or use of heavy machinery.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Numerous limitations exist when a user opts to wear both protective eyewear and headgear. First, it is often cumbersome and uncomfortable to fit eyewear within the headgear to rest and engage the user's ears. Second, it remains difficult for the user to remove and later reposition the eyewear when the user must insert portion of the eyewear within the headgear. Lastly, upon removing the eyewear from inside the headgear and from the user's face, there is often no place to store this protective eyewear for quick and easy retrieval.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There have been only a few forms of combination headgear and protective eyewear assemblies, all of which have considerable limitations. As one example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,020,901 entitled &#x201c;Eye and Ear Protection Apparatus to Brhel issued on Apr. 5, 2006 discloses an extension member functionally adapted to cooperatively engage and be slideably received within one or more slits found within the eyewear. A flange positioned on the outer surface of the headgear assembly is capable of receiving the slits to engage and hold the eyewear. However, this slit and flange system fails to allow quick attachment and later removal of the eyewear.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a second example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,020,903 entitled &#x201c;Combination Ear and Eye Protective Apparatus&#x201d; teaches a pair of bridge-to-frame hinges that connect between part of bridge portions and the frame ends. Preferably, there are a pair of bridge-to-ear cover connectors that connect to the distal ends of the bridge portions and a pair of ear to cover bridge connectors that connect to the outer portions of the ear covering portions. The bridge-to-ear cover connectors are comprised of first hook-or-loop connectors, and the ear-cover-to-bridge connectors are comprised of second hook-or-loop connectors. Use of such a hook-and-loop assembly fails to create a sufficient bond to secure the headgear to the protective eyewear.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a third example of a combination assembly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,511,177 entitled &#x201c;Protective Eyewear with Adjustable Strap,&#x201d; to Hall reference issued on Jan. 28, 2003 teaches use of a &#x201c;snap lock&#x201d; which allows the ear muffs or head phones to engage the headband of the protective eyewear. While this provides a more improved fastener compared to a hook and loop fastener, it still provides an awkward assembly should the need arise to quickly remove or attach the protective eyewear if the user has already positioned and is wearing headgear.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a need in the art of combination headgear that allows protective eyewear to be quickly and easily secured to headgear, when the headgear is already worn by the user. Moreover, there is a further need for a system that allows the eyewear to be quickly removed and stowed when the user does not need the protective eyewear during a professional or recreational sporting event.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This invention solves the current limitations in the art of combination headgear assemblies and protective eyewear systems. More specifically, one embodiment of the invention may comprise protective eyewear that attaches to a headgear assembly via magnetic connectors. The headgear assembly may include an adjustable headrest with a first and second end. The first end connects to a first spherical capsule having a first side wall. Similarly, the second end connects to a second spherical capsule having a second side wall.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The protective eyewear may include a vision blade with a first end, a second end, a top end, and a bottom end. The first end attaches via a first finger to a first telescoping member while the second end attaches via a second finger to a second telescoping member. A first magnetic connector is positioned between the first telescoping member and the first side wall of the first spherical capsule. Likewise, a second magnetic connector may be positioned between the first telescoping member and the second side wall of the second spherical capsule. Both spherical capsules may include a comfort pad which allows more comfortable contact on the side of the user's head.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally, the headgear assembly includes both a first and second &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped connector to attach the adjustable headrest to both spherical capsules. The first &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped connector may be attached to the first end of the adjustable headrest having two first sliding members which attach to the first spherical capsule via a first set of pivot pins. Similarly, the second &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped connector may be attached to the second end of the adjustable headrest having two second sliding members which attach to the first spherical capsule via a second set of pivot pins. Each sliding member includes a rotating support which engages a pivot pin on a spherical capsule, where the rotating support in turn engages and is affixed to an outer bar with an internal cavity having a sufficient size and dimension to engage and maintain an inner bar which affixes to the adjustable headrest.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Each telescoping member of the protective eyewear is sufficiently hollow to form a shaft of sufficient size and dimension to position an engaging rod which in turn may engage a side wall of the spherical capsule. The telescoping members both include extensions to provide for greater adjustability of the eyewear. Preferably, both the first and second magnetic connectors are ball-and-disc devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates, by way of example, the overall components of the combination system <b>100</b>. As shown, there are three primary components of the combination system <b>100</b>: the headgear assembly <b>200</b>, the protective eyewear <b>300</b>, and the magnetic connectors <b>400</b> (which connect to both the headgear assembly <b>200</b> and the protective eyewear <b>300</b>). As shown, and disclosed in greater detail below, it is preferable that the magnetic connectors <b>400</b> include a ball-and-disc device <b>415</b>. (The only ball and socket feature is the plastic socket in which the ball magnet is permanently attached. Although utilizing a ball magnet with a mating &#x201c;socket&#x201d;, or concave, magnet for attachment is feasible, this arrangement does not provide the freedom of movement that the magnetic ball and disc arrangement provides)</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Headgear Assembly</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the headgear assembly <b>200</b> includes three main parts: a first earmuff <b>210</b>, a second earmuff <b>220</b>, and an adjustable headrest <b>230</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the adjustable headrest <b>230</b> connects to both the first earmuff <b>210</b> and second earmuff <b>220</b>. Preferably, the earmuffs <b>210</b> and <b>220</b> are made out of a lightweight, resilient and sound reducing material such as a plastic, composite, polymer or metal. Moreover, the inner portion of both earmuffs <b>210</b> and <b>220</b> may be lined with sound reducing materials.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Both earmuffs <b>210</b> and <b>220</b> are elliptical in cross section having a sufficient diameter and height so as to enclose and cover the user's ears. Moreover, both earmuffs <b>210</b> and <b>220</b> include spherical capsules <b>211</b> and <b>221</b> that mirror each other in size and configuration. The first spherical capsule <b>211</b> includes a first end <b>212</b>, a corresponding second end <b>213</b>, and a side wall <b>214</b>. Likewise, the second spherical capsule <b>221</b> includes a first end <b>222</b>, corresponding second end <b>223</b>, and a side wall <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second ends <b>213</b> and <b>223</b> both engage soft and pliant pads <b>215</b> and <b>225</b>. Both soft and pliant pads <b>215</b> and <b>225</b> function to allow the headgear assembly <b>200</b> to comfortably sit about the user's head. While numerous materials are contemplated for the pads <b>215</b> and <b>225</b>, they are preferably made of neoprene or similar sponge like material. However, other similarly lightweight and resilient materials, known to those skilled in the art, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and illustrates, by way of example, the salient components of the adjustable headrest <b>230</b>. As shown, the adjustable headrest <b>230</b> may include a top cushion <b>240</b>, a first sliding member <b>250</b> and a corresponding second sliding member <b>260</b>. The first sliding member <b>250</b> rotateably connects to the side wall <b>214</b> of the first spherical capsule <b>211</b>. Likewise, the second sliding member <b>260</b> connects to the side wall <b>224</b> of the second spherical capsule <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first sliding member <b>250</b> includes a first &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped connector <b>251</b> that engages the first side wall <b>214</b> through use of two pivot pins <b>252</b>. Correspondingly, the second sliding member <b>260</b> includes a second &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped connector <b>261</b> that engages the first side wall <b>224</b> via two pivot pins <b>262</b>. Both &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped connectors <b>251</b> and <b>261</b> have a sufficient size and dimension to fit about both spherical capsules <b>211</b> and <b>221</b>. All four pivot pins (<b>252</b> and <b>262</b>) connect to the earmuffs <b>210</b> and <b>220</b> so as to allow a custom fit about the user's head.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the adjustable headrest <b>230</b> includes a first end <b>231</b> and a corresponding second end <b>232</b>. The first end <b>231</b> engages the first &#x201c;U&#x201d; sliding connector <b>251</b> through the first connecting member <b>250</b>. Likewise, the second end <b>232</b> connects the second &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped connector <b>261</b> through the second sliding member <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrate the arrangement and functionality of both the first and second sliding members <b>250</b> and <b>260</b> of the headgear assembly <b>200</b>. As shown and illustrated, there are two first sliding members <b>250</b> which engage the first &#x201c;U&#x201d; connector <b>251</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each first sliding member <b>250</b> has three primary components: a rotating support <b>253</b>, an outer bar <b>254</b> and an inner bar <b>255</b>. As shown and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each rotating support <b>253</b> is configured to engage a pivot pin <b>252</b>. This allows the rotating support <b>253</b> to move about the first spherical capsule <b>211</b>. The outer bar <b>254</b> is directly attached to the rotating support <b>253</b>, and may include a stabilizing beam <b>256</b>. Such outer bar <b>254</b> is preferably hollow and capable of receiving and maintaining the inner bar <b>255</b>. Such inner bar <b>255</b> directly attaches to the first end <b>231</b> of the adjustable headrest <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Likewise, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> further shows how the second sliding member <b>260</b> parallels construction of the first sliding member <b>250</b>. More specifically, the second sliding member <b>260</b> includes a rotating support <b>263</b>, an outer bar <b>264</b>, and an inner bar <b>265</b>. Such inner bar <b>265</b> direct attaches to the second end <b>231</b> of the adjustable headrest <b>230</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Protective Eyewear</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrate, by way of example, the salient components of the protective eyewear <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> best shows the primary components of the protective eyewear <b>300</b>. First, the protective eyewear <b>300</b> includes a visor blade <b>310</b> that is made from a hard and sturdy glass or polymer that acts and functions as a shield. The visor blade <b>310</b> includes a first side <b>311</b>, a corresponding second side <b>312</b>, a top side <b>313</b> and a corresponding bottom side <b>314</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the bottom side <b>314</b> of the visor blade <b>310</b> includes a curved nose pad <b>320</b> that allows the protective eyewear <b>300</b> to rest upon the user's nose.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As is further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first side <b>311</b> is engaged by a first finger <b>330</b> while the second side <b>312</b> is affixed to a second finger <b>340</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, both fingers <b>330</b> and <b>340</b> are slightly curved and have a first end (<b>331</b> and <b>341</b>) and a second end (<b>332</b> and <b>342</b>). The second end <b>332</b> engages a first telescoping member <b>350</b> through a pivot pin <b>333</b>. Of similar construction, the second finger <b>340</b> likewise connects to a second telescoping member <b>360</b> via a pivot pin <b>343</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The structure and arrangement of both telescoping members <b>350</b> and <b>360</b> provided improved functionality and safety features. In addition, the telescoping members <b>350</b> and <b>360</b> are both sufficiently hollow as to form shafts <b>353</b> and <b>363</b>. As such, a first engaging rod <b>352</b> is of a sufficient size and dimension to be positioned within the first shaft <b>353</b>. Likewise, a second engaging rod <b>362</b> is partially enclosed by the second shaft <b>363</b>. These telescoping members <b>350</b> and <b>360</b> both include &#x201c;by-pass&#x201d; extensions <b>351</b> and <b>361</b> in order to by-pass the pivot pin connection and provide additional length, forward of the pivot pin connection <b>333</b> and <b>343</b>. This additional length, forward of the pivot pin connection, provides more engagement and travel between the engaging rods <b>352</b> and <b>362</b> and telescoping members <b>350</b> and <b>360</b>. Due to the size of the earmuff cup covering the ear, there is limited available space between the cup and the pivot pin area of the eyewear. This is especially true of persons with the shortest &#x201c;ear-to-front-of-face&#x201d; dimensions. Extending past this pivot pin area allows for longer telescoping members <b>350</b> and <b>360</b> and more adjustability of engaging rods <b>352</b> and <b>362</b>. Additionally, by extending past this pivot pin area, the rectangular female shaft <b>353</b> and <b>363</b> is able to completely pass through the telescoping member <b>350</b> and <b>360</b>. This pass-through shaft allows the engaging rods <b>352</b> and <b>362</b> to be made oversized (longer) so device can be fitted to persons with the longest &#x201c;ear-to-front-of-face&#x201d; dimensions. For persons with shorter dimensions, the excess length of the engaging rod <b>352</b> and <b>362</b> can be trimmed off once the person determines the excess length is not needed. This extension feature <b>351</b> and <b>361</b> is not found in traditional eyewear due to the fact that traditional eyewear is not designed to be adapted to earmuff type head gear as described in this invention. This feature allows for a longer engaging rod which in turn will provide greater adjustability of the engaging rod, fitting a broader range of users.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Magnetic Connectors</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 8</figref> illustrate, by way of example, the components of the magnetic connectors <b>400</b>. First turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first magnetic connector <b>410</b> is affixed to a first engaging rod <b>352</b>. Likewise, a second magnetic connector <b>420</b> is affixed to the second engaging rod <b>362</b>. In turn, a portion of both magnetic connectors <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> affixes to the headgear assembly <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As provided in greater detail in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the first magnetic connector <b>410</b> includes both a cylindrical disc magnet <b>411</b> and a ball magnet <b>412</b>. The ball magnet <b>412</b> directly attaches to the first engaging rod <b>352</b> positioned on the protective eyewear <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the cylindrical disc magnet <b>411</b> magnetically attaches to a ball magnet <b>412</b>. Under such arrangement, the magnetic connector <b>410</b> is arranged as a magnetic ball-and-disc device <b>415</b>. Here, the disc <b>411</b> is permanently affixed to the side wall <b>214</b> of the first spherical capsule <b>211</b>. Similarly, the disc <b>411</b> of the second magnetic connector <b>420</b> is permanently affixed to the second spherical capsule <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Under the assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 8</figref>, the protective eyewear <b>300</b> can be easily affixed to the headgear <b>200</b> through the magnetic connectors <b>400</b>. Likewise, the protective eyewear <b>300</b> can be quickly removed when not in use via the magnetic connectors <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to the mind of one skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings.
