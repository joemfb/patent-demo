<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates, in general, to surveillance and, more particularly, to covert surveillance using a camera.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although there is an overwhelming view that night lighting reduces crime, crime data does not support reduced crime rates with increased lighting. Since criminals need to see what they are doing, crime usually occurs in lighted areas. Hence, the majority of criminal activity occurs either in the daylight hours or in a region adjacent to artificial lights such as street lights.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, street lights are frequently individually controlled to turn on and off by using electronic light sensitive devices that detect daylight. In order to provide sufficient exposure to daylight, the light sensitive device is generally contained within a protrusion or a distinct structure extending out from a housing of the street light lamp fixture. This extended structure can be positioned above, below and to the side of the lamp housing. Since criminals normally seek remote lighted spaces with limited or no surveillance to perform illegal activities, areas adjacent to street lights can be an excellent venue for performing surveillance. Thus, surveillance using a hidden security camera can provide a strong advantage for better capturing criminal activity including vandalism, stealing, illegal drug sales and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hence, there is a need to observe unfettered criminal activity by improving the stealth of security cameras in areas lit by street lights.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Generally, this invention is a light fixture or luminaire positioned on a pole or other structure and contains a concealed camera. The luminaire further includes components that allow fitting the concealed camera within a protrusion or cover extending above a surface of a housing of any of a possibility of street light housing configurations. The cover is made to conceal the camera. In one embodiment, the camera receives images through the cover and rotates independently with respect to the non-rotating cover. In yet another embodiment, the camera receives images through a hole in the cover and rotates in unison with the rotating cover. The cover resembles structures commonly used on street lights including structures that extend from the lamp housing for containing a sensor to turn on and off a street light at night and day times, respectively. The camera can include commercially available surveillance cameras having the capability to pan, tilt and zoom (PTZ) to track a target. These cameras are referred to as PTZ cameras and can have the capability of working in combination with thermal, audio and motion sensors to track changes within the camera's field of view. Further yet, the luminaire can be connected to the internet and controlled from a remote location using a controller.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention will be better understood from a reading of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction, with the accompanying drawing figures, in which like reference numbers designate like elements and in which:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side-view depicting a street light <b>40</b> commonly used along traffic ways and other places. The street light <b>40</b> includes a pole <b>34</b> supported from the ground <b>32</b>. Further, the street light <b>40</b> can include a cross-member <b>36</b>, which can extend outward or laterally from the pole <b>34</b> and supports a lighting fixture or luminaire <b>100</b>. The luminaire <b>100</b> can also be installed on any power/telephone or a roadway pole or any man-made structure or natural feature having access to electrical power. This includes the power grid or a battery, a generator, a solar panel and the like. The luminaire <b>100</b> can be retrofitted and made to function at most any location or roadway that includes light providing structures manufactured and used in most cities around the world. The luminaire <b>100</b> should not be considered limited to the particular application as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The luminaire <b>100</b> includes a first portion or a lamp housing <b>2</b> having an outer surface <b>42</b> and internal components such as an electrical transformer (not shown) for stepping up or down the voltage. Typically, larger lamps require a transformer having more capacity and size and normally require more space within the lamp housing <b>2</b>. Network conductors can be used for connecting to a computer network such as Ethernet or control cables <b>5</b> can be routed to the luminaire <b>100</b> through the pole <b>34</b> and cross-member <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the outer surface <b>42</b> of the lamp housing <b>2</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a portion of the outer surface <b>42</b> is curved. The lamp housing <b>2</b> can include a plurality of other shapes. The shape of the lamp housing <b>2</b> should not be considered a limitation of the present invention. The lamp housing <b>2</b> can be made using opaque materials including aluminum, galvanized steel and the like. Further, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a second portion of the luminaire <b>100</b> referred to as a protrusion or cover <b>14</b>, which abruptly extends outward or above the outer surface <b>42</b>. A top portion or top <b>17</b> of the cover <b>14</b> can extend a height <b>1</b> above the outer surface <b>42</b> over a range from about 2 inches to about 6 inches. The height <b>1</b> that the cover <b>14</b> extends above the outer surface <b>42</b> should not be considered a limitation of the present invention. The cover <b>14</b> is shown on a portion of the outer surface <b>42</b> opposite the ground <b>32</b>. However, the location of the cover <b>14</b> can be any location on the outer surface <b>42</b>. The location of the cover <b>14</b> should not be considered limited in relation to any particular location on the outer surface <b>42</b>. It should be noted that the cover <b>14</b> can take on a variety of difference forms, shapes and is not limited. The cover <b>14</b> is substantially made to appear as a common feature of a street light <b>40</b> to provide a measure of stealth. Further, objects within the cover <b>14</b> are provided substantial concealment, thereby not causing attention to criminals and others. The cover <b>14</b> is generally made of opaque materials similar to the lamp housing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a lamp or light source <b>4</b> is shown positioned on the bottom of the lamp housing <b>2</b>. The light source <b>4</b> provides illumination for a region <b>46</b> in the vicinity of the street light <b>40</b>. Obviously, illumination from the light source <b>4</b> can potentially propagate over a region extending to infinity, even into outer space. Here, the region <b>46</b> is limited and is defined within a radial distance <b>13</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of up to about 350 feet from the luminaire <b>100</b> as shown. In addition to the light source <b>4</b> providing luminosity to the region <b>46</b>, illumination of region <b>46</b> can also occur from other ambient sources of light such as other street lights.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> taken from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrating the various components within the luminaire <b>100</b>. An opening <b>11</b> is shown formed on the top of the lamp housing <b>2</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a camera mounting bracket <b>22</b> is positioned across the opening <b>11</b> and is connected to the lamp housing <b>2</b> via fasteners <b>3</b>. A seal <b>18</b> is shown disposed on and above the camera mounting bracket <b>22</b> and precludes water or moisture from entering a space or cavity <b>7</b> within the lamp housing <b>2</b>. The seal <b>18</b> can be made using a felt material or various other materials including rubber, plastics and the like. A bearing <b>20</b> is depicted disposed on and above the seal <b>18</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bearing <b>20</b> includes two portions referred to as upper and lower. These upper and lower portions of the bearing <b>20</b> are connected to the cover <b>14</b> and mounting bracket <b>22</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the camera <b>12</b> is illustrated disposed within the cover <b>14</b> of the luminaire <b>100</b> and includes a fixed base <b>44</b> and a rotatable viewer upper portion <b>43</b> for collecting visual images. The fixed base portion <b>44</b> of the camera <b>12</b> is shown connected to the upper portion of the bearing <b>20</b>. The rotatable viewer upper portion <b>43</b> of the camera <b>12</b> can be connected to the top portion <b>17</b> of the cover <b>14</b>. Hence, the camera <b>12</b> pans or rotates in synchronization the cover <b>14</b>. For example, the camera <b>12</b> can rotate over an azimuth having a range of about 240 degrees to about 360 degrees. The cover <b>14</b> can include a variety of different cameras having varying capability including Internet Protocol. This invention should not be considered limited to any particular camera. Generally, the camera <b>12</b> can include a variety of cameras that pan, tilt and zoom and are referred to as PZT cameras. Further, the camera <b>12</b> can include video cameras used for the purpose of observing the region <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) around the luminaire <b>100</b>. A target <b>15</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can be tracked within a radial distance <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of up to about 350 feet. For example, the target <b>15</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) tracked by the camera <b>12</b> can include criminal activity, security, animal activity and the like. The tracking of the camera <b>12</b> is generally controlled by a controller <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Further, the controller <b>38</b> can use a wireless router with Broadband, DSL and Wi-Fi&#x2122; and can be connected to a recording device for recording the target <b>15</b>. The controller <b>38</b> can be coupled to communicate to the camera <b>12</b> either through the cable <b>5</b> or via antennas <b>9</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) using electromagnetic waves. The information from the camera <b>12</b> can be collected into a database and used in combination with software to automate searching. Further yet, the camera <b>12</b> can include encryption capabilities and can include day/night functions for turning on adjacent electrical loads such as the light source <b>4</b>. PZT cameras generally include the capability to track up and down or tilt over a range from about minus 35 degrees to about 45 degrees. Depending on the particular configuration of the luminaire <b>100</b>, the utilization of the camera's <b>12</b> tilt capability can vary. Further, depending on the particular camera <b>12</b>, the zoom capability can vary over a range from about 20&#xd7;to about 40&#xd7;. The camera <b>12</b> can be connected directly to the Ethernet or control/power cable <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and controlled from any location having Ethernet capability. Further yet, the luminaire <b>100</b> can include a battery backup (not shown) for the camera <b>12</b> and the light source <b>4</b> in the event electrical power is interrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The cover <b>14</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, extends from the lamp housing <b>2</b> and is connected to the upper portion of the bearing <b>20</b>. The cover <b>14</b> is also shown connected to the viewer upper portion <b>43</b> of the camera <b>12</b> and rotates with the camera <b>12</b>. Since bearing <b>20</b> is connected to the cover <b>14</b> and the mounting bracket <b>22</b>, which is connected to the lamp housing <b>2</b>, the cover <b>14</b> is said to be indirectly connected to the lamp housing <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cover <b>14</b> includes inner <b>24</b> and outer <b>28</b> surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a bracket <b>26</b> is connected to the lamp housing <b>2</b> and extends below the camera mounting bracket <b>22</b> into the cavity <b>7</b> within the lamp housing <b>2</b>. The bracket <b>26</b> can be used to secure a cooling fan <b>6</b> within the cavity <b>7</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a bracket <b>25</b> can be connected to and extends below the camera mounting bracket <b>22</b> and can be used to support a power supply <b>8</b>, a dusk-to-dawn sensor <b>30</b>, a router <b>10</b>, switches (not shown) and circuit breakers (not shown) within the cavity <b>7</b>. In another embodiment, the camera <b>12</b> can replace the dusk-to-dawn sensor <b>30</b> and be used to turn the light source <b>4</b> on or off in concert with the daily solar-cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a particular configuration of the camera <b>12</b> and the lamp housing <b>2</b>, the size and shape of the lamp housing <b>2</b> can vary substantially. Hence, the cavity <b>7</b> within the lamp housing <b>2</b> can vary. For example, in one embodiment the cavity <b>7</b> can enclose a volume of about 10 inches by about 6 inches by about 6 inches. In another embodiment, the cavity <b>7</b> can be larger. For this reason, the details concerning the configuration such as the number and shape of brackets (e.g., brackets <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>) can vary. This luminaire <b>100</b> should not be limited to any particular the size and shape, because the lamp housing <b>2</b> and camera <b>12</b> can vary substantially.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side-view of the luminaire <b>100</b> illustrating an opening <b>16</b> of the cover <b>14</b> for the camera <b>12</b> to receive images from within at least the region <b>46</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The top <b>17</b> of the cover <b>14</b> extends the height <b>1</b> above the outer surface <b>42</b> of the lamp housing <b>2</b>. The opening <b>16</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> around a camera opening <b>23</b> and provides concealment and protection for the camera <b>12</b>. The alignment of the openings <b>16</b>, <b>23</b> of the cover <b>14</b> and camera <b>12</b>, respectively, provides concealment of the camera <b>12</b>. In other words, the camera <b>12</b> is aligned with the opening <b>16</b> of the cover <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the opening <b>16</b> of the cover <b>14</b> is about <b>2</b> inches in diameter. The opening <b>16</b> of the cover <b>14</b> should not be considered limited to any particular size and shape. In another embodiment (not shown) the opening can be shaped as an oval. Or yet in another embodiment (not shown), the opening can be shaped as a square.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the relationship between the sizes of the cover <b>14</b> and the lamp housing <b>2</b> are generally not accurately depicted. One measure of the actual relationship in the size between the cover <b>14</b> and the lamp housing <b>2</b> can include the volume and the area of the outer surface of each. Generally, the ratio is based on the area of the outer surfaces (e.g., outer surface <b>28</b> for cover <b>14</b> and outer surface <b>42</b> of lamp housing). This ratio of the outer surfaces of the lamp housing <b>2</b> and the cover <b>14</b> can range from about <b>10</b> to <b>1</b> to about <b>27</b> to <b>1</b>. In other words, the cover <b>14</b> is substantially smaller than the lamp housing <b>2</b>, thereby the cover <b>14</b> is much less noticeable than the lamp housing <b>2</b>. Hence, a camera <b>12</b> within the cover <b>14</b> can be said to be concealed based on the relative size difference of the cover <b>14</b> and the lamp housing <b>2</b>. With the luminaire mounted a significant distance (e.g., 10 feet to 40 feet) above the surface or ground, the concealment of the camera <b>12</b> can be substantial.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a light fixture or luminaire <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the various components within the luminaire <b>200</b> including an opening <b>211</b> that is formed on the top of a lamp housing <b>202</b>. A camera mounting bracket <b>222</b> is positioned over the opening <b>211</b> and is connected to the lamp housing <b>202</b> via fasteners <b>203</b>. A seal <b>218</b> is disposed on and above the camera mounting bracket <b>222</b> and precludes water or moisture from entering a space or cavity <b>207</b> within the lamp housing <b>202</b>. The seal <b>218</b> can be made using a felt material or various other materials including rubber, various plastics and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A cover <b>214</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, extends from an outer surface <b>242</b> and is said to be directly connected to lamp housing <b>202</b> and is shown disposed over a camera <b>212</b>, which rotates within the cover <b>214</b>. More particularly, the camera <b>212</b> is disposed within the cover <b>214</b> of the luminaire <b>200</b> and includes a fixed base portion <b>244</b> and a rotatable viewer upper portion <b>243</b> for collecting visual images. A top portion <b>217</b> of the cover <b>214</b> extends a height <b>201</b> above the outer surface <b>242</b> and can be made of various translucent materials such as a variety of plastics that have been further processed to include a tint or an applied film.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a bracket <b>226</b> is connected to and extends below the camera mounting bracket <b>222</b> into the cavity <b>207</b> within the lamp housing <b>202</b>. The bracket <b>226</b> can be used to secure a cooling fan <b>206</b> within the cavity <b>207</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a bracket <b>225</b> can be connected to and extends below the camera mounting bracket <b>222</b> and can be used to support a power supply <b>208</b>, a dusk-to-dawn sensor <b>230</b>, a router <b>210</b>, switches (not shown) and circuit breakers (not shown) within the cavity <b>207</b>. A light source <b>204</b> is depicted at the bottom of the lamp housing <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A privacy film can reduce the visibility within at least the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum through generally transparent materials. The privacy film can be silvered, thereby offering an unimpeded view from the low-light side but virtually no view from the high-light side. The privacy film can be made by frosting transparent materials. This can transform the material to translucent. There are a number of privacy film gradients that can be lighter or darker. Further, the privacy film can include material having a plurality of small holes referred to a perforated film. Here, we refer to the variety of privacy films generally as a tint, silvered, mirrored or a perforated film and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A tint <b>219</b> is disposed on the cover <b>214</b> meaning the tint <b>219</b> can be on the inner surface <b>224</b> or outer surface <b>228</b> or diffused within the cover <b>214</b> material. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the tint <b>219</b> is disposed on the inner surface <b>224</b>. By tinting the cover <b>214</b>, the camera <b>212</b> can be concealed. In another embodiment, a perforated film <b>221</b> is shown disposed on the outer surface <b>228</b> of the cover <b>214</b>. The perforated film <b>221</b> can include films such as 3M&#x2122; Scotchcal&#x2122;.</p>
