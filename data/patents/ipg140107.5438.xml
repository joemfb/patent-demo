<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/485,416, filed on May 12, 2011, entitled &#x201c;REDUCING EXPOSURE DUE TO FAILURES TO PROCURE APPROPRIATE INSURANCE COVERAGE OPTIONS&#x201d;, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An insurance agent, when assisting a potential or existing client, generates numerous documents which can be exchanged between the insurance agent and the client. The documents can include, for example, insurance proposals which enumerate coverage options elected by the client and/or recommended to the client by the agent, provide descriptions of the elected coverage options, indicate selected limits for applicable coverage options, and quote estimated premiums for coverage options included in the proposals. An insurance proposal, created by the insurance agent, can be provided to the client for review via mail, e-mail, or during an in-person meeting. The client typically reviews the proposal and takes one or more actions with respect to the included coverage options. For instance, the client can decide to accept a coverage option, decline a coverage option, select a different limit for a coverage option, request additional information from the insurance agent on a coverage option or associated limit, inquire about a coverage option not included in the proposal, or the like. The client can take these actions during an in-person meeting, embody the actions in a formal letter mailed to the agent, send an email explaining the client's decisions, or discuss the decisions with the agent over the telephone. After one or more rounds of interaction as described above, the client can ultimately decide on a set of coverage options to purchase in a policy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The insurance agent risks exposure for an errors and omissions claim when an insurance coverage option is not procured for an insured. Accordingly, another document, commonly created by the insurance agent and exchanged with the client, is a coverage check list or coverage review list. The coverage review list can be generated by the insurance agent contemporaneously with the insurance proposal. For instance, coverage options not specified on the insurance proposal can be included on the coverage review list. Alternatively, the coverage review list can be generated at a later stage of the insurance procurement process, e.g., when the client and agent finalize the insurance coverage options of a policy. To reduce exposure, the insurance agent typically discusses the coverage review list with the client during an in-person meeting or over the telephone, or sends the coverage review list to the client for the client to review at his or her leisure. The insurance agent may request the client sign off on the coverage review list to formally indicate the coverage options listed are declined.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Purchasing insurance is an important, but complicated, process. The interactions described above can be time-consuming while also inefficiently conveying necessary information between the agent and client. Agents often experience difficultly in properly educating clients on details of coverage options, explaining gaps in coverage to clients, and, in general, exchanging important documents with clients while also limiting liability and protecting agencies from risks. Similarly, clients have difficulty understanding documents provided from agents and identifying the gaps in coverage while understanding business risks created from declining certain coverage options.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above-described deficiencies in the conventional insurance procurement process are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional techniques, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the conventional techniques, and corresponding benefits of the various non-limiting embodiments described herein, may become further apparent upon review of the following description.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary, non-limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the sole purpose of the summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In various, non-limiting embodiments, a coverage management system configured to streamline the insurance procurement process between an insurance agent and an insured (e.g., a client) is described. The coverage management system facilitates creation, exchange, and review of interactive documents, related to insurance coverage for the insured. The insurance agent, utilizing the coverage management system, can create an insurance proposal interactive document managed by the system. The system enables the insured to access the insurance proposal interactive document and, via the coverage management system, the insured can review coverage options, request information regarding coverage options included or not included, accept the proposal, etc. Through the coverage management system, the insurance agent can be notified of the information requests from the insured, coverage options in the proposal accepted by the insured, coverage options declined by the insured, and the like. Accordingly, the coverage management system provides a medium through which the insurance agent and the insured and efficiently interact. Moreover, in addition to aiding the proposal process, the coverage management system provides mechanisms to facilitate presentation, review, acceptance, and/or rejection of coverage options included on a coverage review list (e.g., coverage options not included on the proposal or purchased as part of a policy).</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">General Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As discussed in the background, conventional insurance procurement is a time-consuming and inefficient task which, through that inefficiency, can expose both insured parties and insurance agents to risks and liabilities. Insurance is a complicated subject and the amount of information required to be conveyed to explain a set of coverage options included in a policy, a set of coverage options not included in the policy, or to distill an insured party's insurance requirements can be troublesome for insurance agents and insured parties to manage. Manual creation, exchange, explanation, and review of insurance-related documents (e.g., insurance proposals, coverage lists, policies, etc.) can lead to oversights having many repercussions. In addition, the conventional insurance procurement process can leave many insured parties overwhelmed leading to dissatisfaction with a policy or agent, and impose unseen costs from time spent effectively reviewing, understanding, and evaluating coverage options.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In various, non-limiting embodiments, a coverage management system is provided to manage interactions between insurance agents and insured parties. With the coverage management system, a plurality of interactive documents can be generated, viewed, modified, and tracked by insurance agents and insured parties during an insurance procurement process guided by the coverage management system. For instance, insurance-related documents such as policies, proposals, coverage review lists, etc., which are conventionally static forms exchanged between insurance agents and insured parties, can be provided as rich, dynamic, interactive documents by the coverage management system. The interactive documents can breakdown coverage options, individually, to facilitate effective review and understanding. Further, as interactive documents, an insured's experience with the documents can be monitored by the coverage management system to provide assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Many insurance agencies employ agency management systems to retain client information, agent information, policy information, and other information utilized to support and run an agency's business. The coverage management system, in an embodiment, can integrate with these agency management systems in order to direct insurance procurement between an agent and insured having a pre-existing relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the coverage management system, in an exemplary embodiment is configured to collect data from various third-party sources to enhance selection and/or recommendation of coverage options. Such configuration can assist insured parties and/or insurance agents in areas where they lack experience. For example, an insurance agent, lacking experience in restaurants, can be contacted by a potential client starting a restaurant venture for the first time. The coverage management system described herein can collect and analyze information pertinent to insurance needs of restaurants to provide recommended coverage options. Thus, the amount of information required by the agent or client to accomplish due diligence is reduced and the overall insurance procurement process is streamlined.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, a coverage management system is described herein that includes an interface (configured to couple the coverage management system to a network), a processor, and a computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon computer-executable modules that, when executed by the processor, carry out operations of the coverage management system. The computer-readable storage medium includes a core module configured to receive a set of insurance coverage options selected by at least one of an insurance agent or a client of the insurance agent, to generate an interactive insurance document based on the set of insurance coverage options, to monitor input received on the interactive insurance document; and to associate input received on the interactive insurance document with the interactive insurance document. In addition, the computer-readable storage medium can include a data management module configured to manage information retained on the computer-readable storage medium, wherein the information includes at least the interactive insurance document and the input received on the interactive insurance document. In an example, the computer-readable storage medium can include a notification module configured to transmit a notification to one of the insurance agent or the client via the interface, wherein the notification is in response to generation of the interactive insurance document or receipt of input on the interactive insurance document. The notification transmitted by the notification module is sent via at least one of an email, a text message, or a voice call.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to another example, the computer-readable storage medium, of coverage management system, can include an integration module configured to access an agency management system, which is remote from the coverage management system. The integration module is further configured to import information from the agency management system into the coverage management system, wherein the information imported includes at least one of client contact information, client identification information, or client policy information. In addition, the integration module is further configured to publish the interactive insurance document as a static document and to export the static document representation of the interactive insurance document to the agency management system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In yet another example, the computer-readable storage medium of the coverage management system can include a recommendation engine configured to generate a set of suggested insurance coverage options to at least one of the insurance agent or the client to assist in generation of the interactive insurance document. The recommendation engine is further configured to obtain information from a plurality of data sources external to the coverage management system to determine potential risks to which the client is exposed. In addition, the recommendation engine is configured to analyze a plurality of interactive insurance documents managed by the coverage management system to determine commonly selected insurance coverage options.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to further aspects, the interactive insurance document embodies each insurance coverage option, of the set of insurance coverage options utilized to generate the interactive insurance document, as an individual interactive element such that each distinct input received on the interactive document relates to a single insurance coverage option. Alternatively, the interactive insurance document embodies disjoint subsets of the set of insurance coverage options utilized to generate the interactive insurance document, as individual groups such that each distinct input received on the interactive document can relate to a single group corresponding to a one of said subsets of the set of insurance coverage options. The input received on the interactive insurance document relates to one of acceptance of an insurance coverage option as included on the interactive insurance document, refusal of the insurance coverage option, or a request for additional information on the insurance coverage option. Moreover, as described herein, the interactive insurance document is at least one of an insurance proposal or a coverage review list.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to another embodiment, described herein is a computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon computer-executable instructions that, in response to execution, cause a computing device to perform operations. The operations can include transmitting a first user interface, to a first user, including a plurality of insurance coverage options which are selectable by the first user, receiving a set of insurance coverage options selected by the first user via the user interface, generating an interactive insurance document based on the set of insurance coverage options selected by the first user, notifying a second user that the interactive insurance document is generated, transmitting, to the second user upon request, a second user interface that displays the generated interactive insurance document, recording interactions of the second user with the interactive insurance document via the second user interface, and notifying the first user of the interactions of the second user. In addition, the operations can also include generating the plurality of insurance coverage options included on the first user interface from a template.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, a computer-implemented method is described. The method can include transmitting, from a server apparatus, a list of insurance coverage options to a first user terminal associated with a first user, for display on a user interface of the first user terminal; receiving, at the server apparatus, from the first user terminal, a set of selected insurance coverage options, wherein the set of selected insurance coverage options include one or more insurance coverage options included on the list of insurance coverage options; and generating an interactive insurance document based on the set of selected insurance coverage options received.

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Insurance Procurement Directed by a Coverage Management System</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As mentioned above, in various embodiments, a coverage management system enables an insurance agent and an insured party to engage in a streamlined insurance procurement process. The coverage management system facilitates generation of interactive insurance-related documents, provides mechanisms to interact with the documents, and optimizes agent-insured interaction via the insurance-related documents. Moreover, as described herein, the coverage management system increases an ease of understanding complicated insurance concepts presented in the insurance-related documents.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a block diagram illustrating an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of a coverage review system configured to facilitate interactions between an insurance agent and an insured during an insurance procurement process. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a coverage management system <b>100</b> which can be a server apparatus including a processor and computer-readable storage media (not shown). The computer-readable storage media can have stored thereon modules executable by the processor (e.g., core module <b>110</b> and data management module <b>120</b>) as well as information managed by and accessed via the data management module <b>120</b> as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The coverage review system <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, can include an interface module <b>102</b> comprising a variety of hardware and/or software components. For the purposes of the systems and methods described herein, interface module <b>102</b> can include necessary hardware and software components to enable the coverage management system <b>100</b> to transmit/receive information via a variety of communication networks (e.g., PSTN, wireless (cellular) networks, Internet, or other IP-based networks) according to a variety of communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, GSM, LTE, CDMA, HDSPA, etc.) and application protocols (e.g., SMS, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, etc.) For instance, interface module <b>102</b> can include hardware connections, wireless antennas, signal processors, etc., that communicatively couple the coverage management system <b>100</b> to a physical or wireless communication network. In addition, interface module <b>102</b> can include software components such as, but not limited to, a TCP/IP stack of an operating system and various server applications that implement application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, etc.). The interface module <b>102</b> operates to transform information received over a network to a format consumable by the core module <b>110</b>, which represents a main application executed by the processor of the coverage management system. In addition, the interface module <b>102</b> accepts information from the core module <b>110</b>, which is to be transmitted over the network, and transforms the information into a suitable format according to the protocols and standards of the network. For instance, the interface module <b>102</b> can receive information from an agent terminal <b>150</b> associated with an agent <b>152</b> or an insured terminal <b>160</b> associated with an insured <b>162</b>, and provide the received information to the core module <b>110</b>. In addition, information can be acquired by the interface module <b>102</b> from the core module <b>110</b>, which is sent over the network to one of the agent terminal <b>150</b> or insured terminal <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to one example, core module <b>110</b> can be implemented as a web-based application accessible via the World Wide Web (WWW). As such, agent terminal <b>150</b> and insured terminal <b>160</b> can be any suitable computing device equipped with a web browser application, such as a general-purpose personal computer, a mobile device (e.g., smartphone, tablet device, etc.), a web-enabled electronic device (e.g., set-top box, television, video game console, etc.) or the like. Further to this example, interface module <b>102</b> provides a hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) server to communicate with respective browser applications executed on agent terminal <b>150</b> and insured terminal <b>160</b>. Via HTTP, interface module <b>102</b> can receive HTTP requests to resources exposed by core module <b>110</b>, route the requests to the core module <b>110</b> for handling, and transmit whatever information is returned by the core module <b>110</b> to one of the agent terminal <b>150</b> or insured terminal <b>160</b>. As described in greater detail below, the information returned by the core module <b>110</b> can be one of a plurality that combines various assets (e.g., images, client-side scripts, style sheets) and resources (e.g., interactive documents, agent information, insured information, templates, coverage options, etc.) into a web page or other interface renderable by the agent terminal <b>150</b> and the insured terminal <b>160</b> for presentation to the agent <b>152</b> and the insured <b>162</b>, respectively. In another example, core module <b>110</b> can provide one or more application program interfaces (APIs), whereby non-browser client applications, executed on agent terminal <b>150</b> and insured terminal <b>160</b>, can utilize the APIs to communicate with coverage management system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A primary function of core module <b>110</b> is to enable creation, modification, retrieval, and deletion of insurance-related interactive documents. An interactive document, as opposed to a static document such as a printed page or an electronic representation of a printed page (e.g., a word processing document, a portable document format (PDF) file, etc.), enables not only content thereof to be displayed and modified, but also enables a user's experience with the document to captured, displayed, and enhanced. By way of example, one type of interactive document utilized in the coverage management system <b>100</b> is an insurance proposal, which provides a list of coverage options to be included in a policy, if purchased.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment for generating an interactive insurance document with the coverage management system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At <b>200</b>, agent <b>152</b>, via agent terminal <b>150</b>, can provide a list of coverage option selections for insured <b>162</b> to coverage management system <b>100</b>. For example, agent <b>152</b>, on agent terminal <b>150</b>, can fill out a form, select radio buttons, select check boxes, select items from drop-down lists, or engage other user interface elements provided by interface module <b>102</b> and rendered by the browser application on agent terminal <b>152</b>, to create the list of coverage option selections. In addition, a submit button or other interface element can be triggered to send the list of coverage option selections to coverage management system <b>100</b> as well as instruct the coverage management system <b>100</b> to generate an insurance proposal embodying the list of coverage option selections as an interactive insurance document (e.g., an interactive insurance proposal).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, the coverage options displayed to agent <b>152</b> for selection can be generated according to a template. For instance, agent <b>152</b> can first select a template suitable for some aspect related to insured <b>162</b> as starting point for document creation. The template, which can be generated by agent <b>152</b> or insured <b>162</b> in much the same way as the insurance proposal described here, is a tool to pare down a full list of all available insurance options to reduced list of insurance options applicable to insured matching particular criteria. For instance, templates can be created and utilized for insured parties of particular sizes, in particular business industries, in particular geographical locations, having certain assets, etc. Functionally speaking, templates provide a mechanism to choose a set of pre-made insurance choice options applicable to a large group to facilitate rapid generation of interactive insurance documents. With templates, agent <b>152</b> does not have to go through the full list of insurance coverage options (option-by-option, section-by-section) in order to generate the interactive insurance document for insured <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At <b>210</b>, the coverage management system <b>100</b> generates the interactive insurance document based on the list of coverage options selections. As will be described later, the core module <b>110</b> generates the interactive insurance document. At <b>230</b>, the interactive insurance document is stored. For instance, the data management module <b>120</b> can facilitate storage of the interactive insurance document on a computer-readable storage medium managed by the data management module <b>120</b>. It is to be appreciated that insured <b>162</b> can perform similar tasks to have an insurance proposal generated on his or her behalf by coverage management system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment for reviewing an interactive insurance document. At <b>300</b>, the coverage management system <b>100</b> can notify insured <b>162</b> of the interactive insurance proposal once created and stored. Notifications can occur via email, via a voice call, text message, a chat protocol (instant messaging), or via the web should insured <b>162</b> have an active session with the coverage management system <b>100</b>. Upon receiving a notification, insured <b>162</b>, via insured terminal <b>160</b>, can access coverage management system <b>100</b> to retrieve the interactive insurance proposal, which, at <b>310</b>, is displayed to insured <b>162</b>. At <b>320</b>, input, related to the interactive insurance proposal, is obtained from insured <b>162</b>. As an interactive document, insured <b>162</b> can view the insurance proposal section by section, make changes to individual sections (e.g., decline a coverage option included in a particular section, change a limit associated with a coverage option, add a coverage option, etc.), request additional information or issue a specific inquiry regarding individual sections or coverage options, or approve coverage options as listed in the proposal on a section-by-section or option-by-option basis. In this way, insured <b>162</b> can review a portion of the proposal, return to reviewing the proposal at a later time, and pick after the portion last reviewed. The aforementioned interactions can be communicated to coverage management system <b>100</b>, which, at <b>330</b>, records the interactions in the interactive document, e.g., as metadata.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Another interactive document provided by coverage management system <b>100</b> is a coverage review list, which presents available insurance coverage options not included in a policy or proposal, or declined by an insured. The coverage review list interactive document provided by coverage management system <b>100</b> can be similar in structure to, and enable similar interactions thereto as, the insurance proposal described above. However, it is to be appreciated that the coverage review list interactive document, being a complementary or disjoint document to the insurance proposal with respect to coverage options, includes inverse content and opposite interaction semantics.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary, non-limiting converge management system <b>100</b> according to one or more embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the core module <b>110</b> includes various sub-modules respectively configured to control respective resources stored on a computer-readable storage medium, whose access is managed by the data management module <b>120</b>. In an example, the data management module <b>120</b> can be a database management system and/or a filesystem provided by an operating system of the coverage management system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The core module <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, includes a view module <b>412</b> configured to control views <b>422</b>. Views include interface templates, web pages, and other assets (e.g., client-side scripts, styles sheets, images, etc.), which are utilized to generate user interfaces for interacting with coverage management system <b>100</b> via, for example, the agent terminal <b>150</b> or insured terminal <b>160</b>. When the agent terminal <b>150</b>, i.e., a web browser application on agent terminal <b>150</b>, is directed towards coverage management system <b>100</b>, view module <b>412</b> retrieves a particular view from views <b>422</b> managed by data management module <b>120</b>. The retrieved view is transmitted to the agent terminal <b>150</b> for rendering by the web browser application.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">User interfaces elements (e.g., forms, buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, drop-down boxes, and the like) included in views <b>422</b> can encode specific addresses or commands to other resources managed by data management module <b>120</b>. For example, a view can incorporate a user interface element that enables a selection of a particular resource. When a user, e.g., agent <b>152</b> or insured <b>162</b>, utilizes the user interface element a request for the resource is transmitted to the coverage management module <b>100</b>. The interface module <b>102</b> forwards the request for the resource to the core module <b>110</b> for servicing. Depending on the specific resource requested, a sub-module of core module <b>110</b> retrieves the resource and provides the resource to view module <b>412</b> for incorporation into an appropriate view from views <b>422</b>. The appropriate view, with resource incorporated, is transmitted back to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the core module <b>110</b> includes a document module <b>414</b> configured to control a resource, illustrated as documents <b>424</b>, representing a plurality of interactive insurance documents. Through specific resource requests transmitted to coverage management system <b>100</b>, users can utilize the document module <b>414</b> to retrieve, create, modify, or destroy particular document of documents <b>424</b> (i.e., the plurality of interactive insurance documents). For example, a resource requests accompanied by an index value enables document module <b>414</b> to retrieve a particular document or documents associated with the index value. The index value can be a unique identifier for a single document, a unique identifier corresponding to insured <b>162</b> thus retrieving any interactive insurance documents corresponding to insured <b>162</b>, a unique identifier for agent <b>152</b> thus retrieving all interactive insurance documents associated with agent <b>152</b>, or the like. Another resource request accompanied by, for instance, a set of insurance coverage options, can instruct document module <b>414</b> to generate a new interactive insurance document based on the set of insurance coverage options and retain the new interactive insurance document in documents <b>424</b>. Yet another resource request can include a set of insurance coverage options, which may or may not be the full set of options incorporated into an interactive insurance document, correlated with a set of respective state values. The respective state values indicate states associated with particular insurance coverage options which record interactions with the document on the part of users. A state of an insurance coverage option can indicate that the option included in the document is not yet reviewed, is reviewed, is accepted, is declined, is flagged as requesting additional information, etc. Finally, another resource request including an index value can be utilized to instruct document module <b>414</b> to delete one or more interactive insurance documents from documents <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Similar to document module <b>414</b>, core module <b>110</b> can include an agent module <b>416</b> configured to control agent information <b>426</b> and an insured module <b>418</b> configured to control insured information <b>428</b>. Agent information <b>426</b> and insured information <b>428</b> include identification information, demographic information, contact information, etc., respectively associated with insured <b>152</b> and insured <b>162</b> as well as other agents and insured utilizing the coverage management system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, illustrated is a block diagram of an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment coverage management system configured to issue notification for various events occurring in the coverage management system. As described above, the coverage management system <b>100</b> enables agent <b>152</b> and/or insured <b>162</b> to create and interact with interactive insurance documents such as insurance proposals and coverage review lists. When certain events occur, notifications can be issued from the coverage review system. Events can include agent <b>152</b> creating a new document for insured <b>162</b>, insured <b>162</b> reviewing portions of a document, insured <b>162</b> flagging a portion of a document as needing additional information, insured <b>162</b> changing coverage options included on a document, etc. It is to be appreciated that the types of events noted above is not exhaustive and notifications can be utilized to inform other parties of events beyond those above or to broadcast system messages.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the coverage management system <b>100</b> includes a notification module <b>500</b> configured to transmit notification via communication modes beyond that handled by core module <b>110</b>. For instance, core module <b>110</b> can convey notifications to users (agent <b>152</b> and insured <b>162</b>) via views <b>422</b> when users login to the coverage management system <b>100</b>. However, notification module <b>500</b> can send notifications to users by means other than views. Notification module <b>500</b> can include a text message module <b>510</b> configured to transmit notifications via a text messaging protocol such as SMS to a user's mobile device or a instant messaging. An email module <b>520</b> is provided to transmit notification via an email sent to a user's email address. Further, notification module <b>500</b> can include a voice module <b>530</b> configured to provide voice notifications, e.g., recordings, which are relayed via telephone call to a number corresponding to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Notifications can include information describing the event which occurred and can provide instructions for the user to follow to respond to the event. For example, when agent <b>152</b> generates a new interactive insurance document for insured <b>162</b>, notification module <b>500</b> transmits a notification to insured <b>162</b> detailing that fact. The notification, when sent by email or via text message to a web-enabled mobile device, can include a link to view the generated document. Alternatively or concurrently, the notification can provide instructions to follow to retrieve the document when the link is not available or not functioning.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Exemplary User Interfaces</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-25</figref> illustrate exemplary, non-limiting user interfaces and emails (notifications) employed by coverage management system <b>110</b> according to one or more embodiments described herein. As described above, the user interfaces illustrated depict web-based user interfaces that accept input and provide output in the form of web pages transmitted via the Internet and viewed and manipulating using a browser application. In further to this embodiment, the user interfaces described below are example views from views <b>422</b> controlled by view module <b>412</b>. It is to be appreciated that other graphical user interfaces can be employed in connection with coverage management system <b>100</b>. As mentioned above, clients can interact with coverage management system <b>100</b> via APIs and, as such, the clients provide a custom designed interfaces to present information obtained via the APIs. The user interfaces and emails depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-25</figref> relate to a coverage review list generation and review procedure. It is to be appreciated that similar user interfaces are utilized by coverage management system <b>100</b> to generate other interactive insurance documents such as proposals or policies.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, illustrated is an exemplary user interface that prompts agent <b>152</b> to enter login credentials to access coverage management system <b>100</b>. Accordingly, agent <b>152</b> can input a user name (e.g., email address, unique nickname, etc.) and a password to the user interface to log in to the coverage management system <b>100</b>. Although the below example describes that agent <b>152</b> can log in to and interact with the coverage management system <b>100</b>, it is further contemplated that a different member of an insurance agency can similarly log in to and interact with the coverage management system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an exemplary user interface that can be rendered upon successful login by the agent <b>152</b> or another member of the insurance agency. The user interface includes a button to start a new list and table of open lists. Upon receiving input that selects the button to start a new list, creation of a new coverage review list can be initiated. Moreover, the table of open lists comprises a listing of coverage review lists that have been forwarded to insureds, such as insured <b>162</b>, but have yet to be completed by the insureds.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">If the agent selects to create a new coverage review list, then an exemplary user interface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can be rendered. According to the illustrated example, creating a new coverage review list can include four steps: select an insured, select a list, select coverage, and select a delivery method. It is to be appreciated, however, that a subset of such steps can be omitted when creating the new coverage review list and/or additional step(s) can be included when creating the new coverage review list. For example, when a template is not utilized, the select a list step is omitted. Moreover, the order of the steps is not fixed. For instance, selecting a template or electing to create a coverage review from scratch can occur before selecting insured <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The user interface includes an indicator that specifies that the user interface relates to a first step of creating the new coverage review list, namely, selecting an insured. Moreover, the user interface includes a table of previously entered insureds and a button to add a new insured. The agent <b>152</b> can select an insured from the table of previously entered insureds or add a new insured by selecting the button. If the agent <b>152</b> chooses to add a new insured, then a user interface can prompt the agent <b>152</b> to enter information related to the new insured such as, for instance, a name of the insured, a contact name, an email address, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Following the depicted example, Anderson Corp. (e.g., insured <b>162</b>) can be selected by the agent from the table <b>404</b> of previously entered insureds. Upon receiving input pertaining to the selection of Anderson Corp. from the agent, <b>152</b> an exemplary user interface illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> can be rendered. The user interface includes an indicator that specifies that the user interface relates to a second step of creating the new coverage review list, where the second step pertains to selecting a list. The user interface can solicit input from the agent <b>152</b> to select a prior coverage review list or a template for a coverage review list. The user interface includes a table of prior coverage review lists that can be selected and a table of templates that can be selected. The prior coverage review list or the template can be a starting point for generating the new coverage review list. It is to be appreciated that agent <b>152</b> can start from scratch with a new coverage review list wherein the agent <b>152</b> is presented will all available insurance coverage options regardless of applicability to an industry of insured <b>162</b> or other characteristic of insured <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">By way of illustration, a prior coverage review list sent to Anderson Corp. (insured <b>162</b>) can be chosen from the table and used as a starting point for generating the new coverage review list. For instance, a prior coverage review list may be selected when few changes in insurance coverage options included in a policy for the insured <b>162</b> are made compared to a previous policy for the insured <b>162</b>. Thus, the coverage review list generated in connection with the previous policy for the insured <b>162</b> can be modified to create the new coverage review list. Alternatively, a template can be chosen from the table. The template can be adapted for a particular type of client. For instance, a template for a standard commercial property and casualty (P&#x26;C) client can be included in the table, and if this template is chosen by the agent <b>152</b>, then a blank template that includes available insurance coverage options for a standard commercial P&#x26;C client can be used as a starting point for creating the new coverage review list.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is contemplated that substantially any number of templates can be included in the table. For instance, a template can include a comprehensive list of insurance coverage options, a subset of insurance coverage options, or the like. By way of illustration, an agency can design one or more custom templates, which can be included in the table. Insurance coverage options and/or pre-selections (e.g., related to step 3 described below) included in a template can be customized. In accordance with a further illustration, a business owners policy (BOP) can be standard policy, and a standard commercial P&#x26;C-BOP pre-selected template can have a substantial portion of the first three steps for creating the new coverage review list completed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, illustrated is an exemplary user interface that can be rendered if the agent <b>152</b> selects a prior coverage review list from the table included in the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The user interface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> includes an indicator that specifies that the user interface relates to a third step of creating the new coverage review list, where the third step pertains to selecting coverage options.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to an illustration, a commercial P&#x26;C policy can be renewed for Anderson Corp. in 2012. Thus, the prior coverage review list generated for Anderson Corp. in 2010 pertaining to a 2010 commercial P&#x26;C policy can be chosen by the agent <b>152</b> from the table included in the user interface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Hence, as included in the user interface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, insurance coverage options included in the 2010 commercial P&#x26;C policy of Anderson Corp. can be pre-selected as insurance coverage options included in the 2012 commercial P&#x26;C policy. In the depicted example, commercial general liability coverage, waiver of subrogation endorsement, and employee benefits liability coverage were included in the 2010 commercial P&#x26;C policy of Anderson Corp., and hence, the user interface shows such insurance coverage options as pre-selected as insurance coverage options included in the 2012 commercial P&#x26;C policy of Anderson Corp. Moreover, the user interface can solicit input from the agent <b>152</b> to modify the pre-selections; thus, pre-selected insurance coverage options can be deselected and/or insurance coverage options not pre-selected can be selected in response to input received from the agent <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">By way of example, if an additional insured endorsement is included in the 2012 commercial P&#x26;C policy of Anderson Corp. (e.g., the additional insured endorsement was not included in the 2010 commercial P&#x26;C policy), then the agent <b>152</b> can select to add the additional insured endorsement as being included in the 2012 commercial P&#x26;C policy via a button included in the user interface. Moreover, an exemplary user interface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> can be rendered in response to the selection to add the additional insured endorsement. The user interface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> includes the indicator that specifies that the user interface is related to the third step (e.g., selecting insurance coverage options) of creating the new coverage review list. Further, the user interface comprises a tips window.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A library of tips and recommendations can be maintained by the coverage management system <b>100</b> and, specifically, by the data management module <b>120</b>. Thus, when an insurance coverage option is selected as being included in a policy, a tips window can be rendered. The tips window presents tips and/or recommendations related to the selected insurance coverage option via the user interface. The tips and/or recommendations can supply information to the agent <b>152</b> to mitigate making an error or omission as they go through the process of procuring insurance coverage for a client. For instance, the tip or recommendation presented via the tips window can be stored and tagged as being related to the additional insured endorsement. Thus, when the additional insured endorsement is selected, the tips window can be displayed to supply the related tip or recommendation to the agent. A tip or recommendation rendered via a tips window can point out commonly occurring errors and/or approaches that can be utilized by the agent to mitigate such errors. By supplying the tip or recommendation, errors or omissions can potentially be mitigated. For instance, the tip or recommendation can help to make sure that a policy is effective.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, illustrated is an exemplary user interface that solicits input pertaining to a delivery method for disseminating the new coverage review list.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20</figref> illustrate various exemplary user interfaces that can be rendered for the insured <b>162</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a user interface includes a collapsed view of the new coverage review list. Additionally, the user interface includes language which states that the coverage review list is a list of insurance coverage options that are available but not included in the policy of the insured. Input from the insured <b>162</b> can be obtained via the user interface to view insurance coverage options for each coverage section (e.g., property, general liability, inland marine, crime, boiler and machinery, business auto, workers' compensation, electronic equipment, miscellaneous, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a user interface rendered for the insured <b>162</b> shows that a general liability section has been selected by the insured <b>162</b>. Accordingly, the general liability section is expanded so that the user interface shows insurance coverage options within the general liability section to be reviewed by the insured <b>162</b>. The insurance coverage options are accompanied by corresponding descriptions. Thus, descriptions can be packaged with the insurance coverage options (e.g., replacing an agent having to explain the insurance coverage options where it is possible that the agent <b>152</b> may not be able to fully explain one or more of the insurance coverage options). The insurance coverage options are available insurance coverage options that are not included in the policy of the insured <b>162</b>. When the general liability section is expanded, a respective check box for each of the insurance coverage options is included in the user interface to prompt the insured <b>162</b> for input. A check box can be checked by the insured <b>162</b> to indicate that the insured <b>162</b> has reviewed a description of a corresponding insurance coverage option. For example, as depicted, the insured <b>162</b> has supplied input to the user interface to check the boxes indicating that higher commercial general liability limits, per project/premises aggregate endorsement, and separate project/premises endorsement have been reviewed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to a further example, the insured <b>162</b> can provide input to the user interface to obtain more information related to employment practices liability coverage by selecting a more link.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates an email that can be sent to the agent <b>152</b> indicating that the insured <b>162</b> has completed the review process of their coverage review list (e.g., sign off by the insured <b>162</b> has been secured). Moreover, the email notes that coverage review list, as signed, has been archived.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref> illustrate exemplary user interfaces that can be rendered for the agent <b>152</b>. The user interfaces depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref> allow the agent <b>152</b> to track progress of review of coverage review lists or other interactive insurance documents disseminated to insureds, perform various actions related to coverage review lists (e.g., which can be documented through the coverage management system <b>100</b>), retrieve interactive insurance documents retained by the coverage management system <b>100</b>, run reports, gather statistics, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, illustrated is a user interface that can be rendered for the agent <b>152</b>. It is contemplated that the user interface can be rendered upon the agent <b>152</b> logging in via the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (e.g., the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> can be rendered instead of the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The user interface includes a button to start a new list, a table of open lists, a table of completed lists, and table of custom templates. The button to start a new list can be substantially similar to the button to start a new list of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and the table of open lists can be substantially similar to the table of open lists of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The table of open lists includes entries for coverage review list(s) that have not yet been completed by insured(s). As depicted, the table of open lists presents an insured name, list name, list type, created on date, and status indicator for uncompleted coverage review list(s). The status indicator, for instance, can specify whether a coverage review list has been visited at all by an insured, or if has been visited but not completed; however, it is to be appreciated that other statuses are intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims (e.g., percentage of completion, insured requested more information, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The completed lists table includes entries for coverage review list(s) that have been completed by insured(s). The completed lists table, as illustrated, presents an insured name, list name, list type, completed on date, and status indicator for completed coverage review list(s). Moreover, a view documentation button can be included in the completed lists table for each completed coverage review list. Accordingly, the agent <b>152</b> can click on a view documentation button to retrieve documentation related to the corresponding coverage review list. By way of example, if the agent <b>152</b> is notified that an insured experienced a significant loss not covered by the policy of the insured <b>162</b>, then the agent <b>152</b> can retrieve the documentation which shows that the insured <b>162</b> was presented information about an insurance coverage option that would have covered such loss, indicated that such information was reviewed, and agreed to reject such insurance coverage option.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The table of custom templates includes entries for templates that can be utilized by the agent <b>152</b> when creating a new coverage review list. For instance, a select button associated with a template can be clicked on by the agent <b>152</b> to yield a pull down menu, which can include menu items for editing a template, renaming a template, and closing and archiving a template. Moreover, adding a new template to the table of custom templates can be initiated by selecting an add a new template button. Insurance coverage options and pre-selections can be set for a template created.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Again, reference is made to the table of open lists. Coverage review lists that have yet to be completed can each be associated with a corresponding actions button (e.g., the coverage review list for Tech Corp. is associated with an actions button). If input is received from the agent <b>152</b> to select the actions button, then a user interface as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> can be rendered. The user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> includes an actions pull down menu that can be rendered in response to selection of the actions button of the user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Menu items included in the actions pull down menu include email a reminder, print a reminder, log a call, view documentation page, and close and archive. Selection of a menu item from the actions pull down menu can be recorded via the coverage management system <b>100</b>, e.g., included in metadata associated with the interactive insurance document managed by the data management module <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to an illustration, the email a reminder menu item included in the actions pull down menu can be clicked on by the agent <b>152</b>. Following this illustration, an email to remind the insured <b>162</b> to review the coverage review list can be sent to the insured <b>162</b> in response to clicking the email a reminder menu item. By way of example, a standard form reminder email can be sent to the email address associated with the insured <b>162</b> when the email a reminder menu item is chosen. According to another example, the agent <b>152</b> can draft an email through a user interface (not shown) that can be rendered upon clicking on the email a reminder menu item. Following this example, it is to be appreciated that at least a portion of the content of the email can be pre-populated (e.g., a link to the coverage review list, standard reminder language, etc. can be pre-populated); yet, the claimed subject matter is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Moreover, the email sent to the insured <b>162</b> can be archived. Further, a reply email sent by the insured <b>162</b> to the agent <b>152</b> in response to the reminder email can be archived. Hence, correspondence in both directions can be retained within the coverage management system <b>100</b>. A date, contents, attachments, etc. of an email can be retained. It is also contemplated that a read-receipt obtained in response to the insured <b>162</b> opening the reminder email can be archived, for instance. Thus, follow up attempts by the agent <b>152</b> can be archived to provide a documentation trail for the agent <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Although the foregoing describes reminder emails being sent in response to the agent <b>152</b> selecting the email a reminder menu item, it is further contemplated that an email reminder can automatically be disseminated to the insured <b>162</b> (e.g., without the agent <b>152</b> selecting the email a reminder menu item). For instance, an email reminder can be periodically transmitted to the insured <b>162</b> until the coverage review list is completed by the insured <b>162</b>. Similar to above, the reminder email and any reply emails received in response thereto can be archived.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, the coverage management system <b>100</b> can document a date and time when the print a reminder menu item included in the actions pull down menu is clicked on by the agent <b>152</b>. Thus, a date and time when the reminder is printed can be archived.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Moreover, the log a call menu item included in the actions pull down menu can be selected to enable the agent <b>152</b> to log a call to the insured <b>162</b>. For instance, the log a call menu item can display a phone number for the insured <b>162</b>. By way of example, when the log a call menu item is clicked on, a user interface (not shown) which enables the agent <b>152</b> to input information pertaining to a date, time, length, subject, participants, etc. of a call to the insured <b>162</b>. Further, in person meetings with the insured <b>162</b> can similarly be documented.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, illustrated is a user interface that presents a documentation report to the agent <b>152</b>. The user interface can be rendered, for instance, upon the agent <b>152</b> clicking a view documentation button included in a table of completed lists table. According to another example, the user interface can be rendered upon the agent <b>152</b> selecting a view documentation page menu item from an actions pull down menu.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The documentation report can include an insured name, a list name, a list type, a created on date, a prepared by name (e.g., agent), a delivery method indicator, a contact at the insured, an email address of the contact at the insured, a status indicator (e.g., whether or not the coverage review list is completed, whether visited or not visited if not completed), and a review completed date (if completed). Moreover, the documentation report specifies actions that have been performed. As illustrated, a number of email reminder sent, a number of print reminders, a number of logged calls, etc. can be included in the user interface. Further, information related to coverage review list visits by the insured <b>162</b> can be included in the user interface. The information can comprise a date, duration, IP address from which the coverage review list was visited, etc. for each coverage review list visit by the insured <b>162</b>. It is also contemplated that the information can include information related to what was clicked on by the insured <b>162</b> during each visit. The user interface can also include information concerning whether additional information has been requested by the insured <b>162</b>. The user interface also includes a version of the coverage review list as modified by the insured <b>162</b>. Thus, selected or unselected check boxes, a signature, a date, etc. entered by the insured <b>162</b> can be viewed in the version of the coverage review list.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, illustrated is a user interface that includes an agency usage report. The agency usage report can supply information related to a number of lists delivered, a number of lists signed, and a number of outstanding lists.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Integration with Agency Management Systems</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> depicts an exemplary, non-limiting embodiment of the coverage management system <b>100</b> described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-25</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the coverage management system <b>100</b> include an agency management system (AMS) interface module <b>2600</b> configured to access an agency management system (AMS) <b>2610</b> utilized by an agent (e.g., agent <b>152</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The AMS interface module <b>2600</b> can communicate with AMS <b>2610</b> via the interface module <b>102</b> of the coverage management system <b>100</b>. Utilizing APIs exposed by the AMS <b>2610</b>, the AMS interface module <b>2600</b> can import information into the coverage management system <b>100</b>. For instance, the AMS interface module <b>2600</b> can import insured information (e.g., insured name, insure contact information, insured industry, etc.) from AMS <b>2610</b> into coverage management system <b>100</b> to bypass manual entry of insureds as described above. In another example, policy information of an insured can be imported into the coverage management system <b>100</b>. Policy information can be utilized to generate a template for creation of interactive insurance documents (e.g., proposals, coverage review lists, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In another aspect, the AMS interface module <b>2600</b> can provide synchronization capabilities such that changes to data in the coverage management system <b>100</b> are replicated to the AMS <b>2610</b> and vice versa. In this way, the AMS interface module <b>2600</b> operates to integrate the AMS <b>2610</b> into the coverage management system <b>100</b> as if it were a component thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Recommendation Engine for Assisting Selection of Insurance Coverage Options</p>

The recommendation engine <b>2700</b> can compile information from a plurality of sources to derive the set of insurance coverage options recommended. The plurality of sources can include sources internal to the coverage management system <b>100</b> such as, but not limited to, the information on insureds associated with interactive insurance documents, the interactive insurance documents themselves which are created and managed by the coverage management system <b>100</b>, agent information, etc. In addition, the plurality of sources can also include external data sources <b>2710</b> accessed by the recommendation engine <b>2700</b> via the interface module <b>102</b>. By way of example, external data sources can include information such as, but not limited to, crime statistics, weather almanac information, industry trends for a plurality of industries (e.g., industry news and reports), litigation reports, and the like. The recommendation engine <b>2700</b> can compile such information to provide the set of recommended coverage options designed to protect an insured based on the demographic information of the insured, geographically location of the insured, industry of the insured, etc.</p>
