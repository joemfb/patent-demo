<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/318,937, filed on Mar. 30, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention generally relates to facilitating transportation at locations which are difficult to access or operate such as high above the ground level, and more specifically, to the airship for facilitating transportation and rescue operations at locations high above the ground level and at ground level while the airship is hovering, for example.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Transportation and performing rescue operations at locations high above the ground level remains tedious and potentially dangerous. Especially, when a location where the transportation and the rescue operations need to be performed is difficult to access the task becomes even more challenging. For example, considering the rate of increase in high rise buildings, the risk involved with people living or working in those high rise buildings has also increased. The risk may be because of fire incidents, terrorist attacks, hostage situations, and civil defense, etc. Additionally, maintenance of these high rise buildings is also a time consuming and risky job.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In existing technologies, helicopters are used to rescue people trapped inside a multi-story building in case of fire break out or any hazardous incidents. Helicopters may use one or more of ropes, cables, cages, ladders, and baskets to rescue the people trapped inside the multi-story building. However, the use of ropes, cables, and ladders involves considerable amount of risk due to the dynamics of the helicopters. Additionally, the dynamics of the helicopters results in movement of hanging cages and hanging baskets. The movement of the hanging cages and the hanging baskets may create height and space limitations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, elevators may also be used to overcome the above limitations. The elevators can be installed on a wall of the multi-story building. Alternatively, the elevators may be installed in the ground and may be used to access different stories of the building. However, the elevators have various limitations. For example, the elevators installed on the ground cannot be used to access stories of the building that are very high above the ground level due to height limitations of the elevators. Additionally, the elevators have limited capacity for rescuing people from the building. Similarly, individual rescue techniques are also available. However, the individual rescue techniques have limitations in case of mass evacuation of a building.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need for an airship for performing transportation and rescue operations at locations high above the ground level in a convenient manner or at ground level, as well. Accordingly, there exists a need in the art to overcome these and other deficiencies and limitations described hereinabove.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention generally relates to facilitating transportation at locations which are difficult to access or operate such as high above ground level, and more specifically, to an airship for facilitating transportation and rescue operations at locations high above ground level and at ground level while the airship is hovering, for example. It should be understood that the embodiments reside primarily in combinations of method steps and apparatus components related to the airship for transportation. Accordingly, the apparatus components, method steps and system components have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to figures and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an airship <b>100</b> is illustrated, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The airship <b>100</b> facilitates transportation and rescue operations at one or more locations high above ground level. The one or more locations may include, but are not limited to, multi-story buildings, mountains, cliffs, bridges, cable carts, and high-rise structures. For example, the airship <b>100</b> may be used for transporting people from a top story of a multi-story building to the ground during rescue operations performed on the multi-story building.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The airship <b>100</b> includes a balloon unit <b>102</b>. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the airship <b>100</b> is shown to include one balloon unit <b>102</b> only for purpose of description; however, the airship <b>100</b> may include more than one balloon unit similar to balloon unit <b>102</b>, as discussed in more detail below. The airship <b>100</b> may be driven by one or more propellers (power plants) <b>112</b> configured on the balloon unit <b>102</b>. A propeller <b>112</b> of the one or more propellers may be powered by one or more motors. The one or more motors may include, but not limited to, electric motor, mechanical motor, hydraulic motor, and combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The balloon unit <b>102</b> of the airship <b>100</b> includes one or more balloon chambers. The one or more balloon chambers may facilitate in lifting the airship <b>100</b> in the air. The one or more balloon chambers may include one or more gases lighter than air. Thus, these one or more gases facilitate in lifting the airship <b>100</b> in the air. In order to lift the airship <b>100</b>, the one or more balloon chambers filled with the one or more gases develop buoyancy force on the airship <b>100</b>. A gas of the one or more gases may be one of hydrogen gas, helium gas, ammonia gas, and methane gas. For example, the one or more balloon chambers of the airship <b>100</b> filled with hydrogen and/or helium gas creates buoyancy force on the airship <b>100</b> thereby resulting in lifting of the airship <b>100</b>. In an embodiment, the one or more balloon chambers may be vacuumed to facilitate the airship <b>100</b> to rise in the air.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, the airship <b>100</b> includes a cabin <b>104</b>. In embodiments, the cabin <b>104</b> is configured on a top portion of the airship <b>100</b>; although as discussed in more detail below, other configurations are also contemplated by the present invention. For example, it will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the cabin <b>104</b> may be configured on any part of the airship <b>100</b> such as to provide easy access to the cabin <b>104</b> from locations near by the airship <b>100</b>. The cabin <b>104</b> may be capable of accommodating one or more of, but not limited to, people and goods. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the airship <b>100</b> is shown to include one cabin for purpose of description, however the airship <b>100</b> may include more than one cabin similar to cabin <b>104</b>. In an embodiment, the cabin <b>104</b> may be configured at one side of the airship <b>100</b>. For example, a cabin may be configured at a side portion of the airship.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, the airship <b>100</b> includes a platform <b>106</b>. The platform <b>106</b> is operatively connected to the cabin <b>104</b> and can be extended during the flight of the airship <b>100</b>. The platform <b>106</b> is connected to the cabin <b>104</b> to facilitate ingress and egress to the cabin <b>104</b>. In an embodiment, the platform <b>106</b> is operatively connected to the cabin <b>104</b> such that the platform <b>106</b> may be rotated at an angle varying from 0&#xb0; to 360&#xb0; with respect to the cabin <b>104</b>. This rotating feature of the platform <b>106</b> may facilitate the airship <b>100</b> to access locations high above the ground level from different angles. For example, the platform <b>106</b> may be rotated to access various locations from different angles with respect to the airship <b>100</b> without moving the airship <b>100</b>. This rotation of the platform <b>106</b> may be accomplished by any known mechanism such as known mechanical or electrical swivel mechanisms. In embodiments, the platform <b>106</b> may form part of a lower portion of a clam shell door configuration (which is discussed in more detail below). The use of platform as a lower door of the clam shell door configuration will reduce overall weight of the airship. That is, it would not be necessary to have a separate platform and door.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another embodiment, the platform <b>106</b> may be extendable as represented by the double arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the platform <b>106</b> may be extended up to different lengths using any mechanisms known in the art. The extendibility feature of the platform <b>106</b> may facilitate the airship <b>100</b> to access locations that are high above the ground level from a substantial distance. For example, the platform <b>106</b> may be extended to access places located at different distances from the airship <b>100</b> without moving the airship <b>100</b>. In embodiments, the platform <b>106</b> preferably extends past an outer surface of the airship, to provide ingress and egress during flight, e.g., to effectuate rescue operations.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, the extendibility feature of platform <b>106</b> may also be used to transport the one or more people and goods to the cabin <b>104</b> from a location and to the location from the cabin <b>104</b>. In this case, the platform <b>106</b> may have a configuration similar to a basket connected to an end of an extendable member (shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The other end of the extendable member may be operatively connected to the cabin <b>104</b>. Thus, people standing on the platform <b>106</b> may be transported outside the cabin <b>104</b> by moving the platform <b>106</b> away from the cabin <b>104</b> using the extendable member. Similarly, the platform <b>106</b> may be capable of transferring people from a location to the cabin <b>104</b> using the extendable member.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the airship <b>100</b> may be used to rescue people trapped at different locations on a cliff. In this case, the airship <b>100</b> may be maneuvered to the cliff and kept in a position such that maximum locations on the cliff where people are trapped are easily accessible to the airship <b>100</b>. Further, the platform <b>106</b> may be rotated with respect to the airship <b>100</b> to access these different locations on the cliff at different angles. Thus, the people trapped in these different locations can be transferred to the cabin <b>104</b> of the airship <b>100</b> using the platform <b>106</b> thereby rescuing the people. Additionally, the platform <b>106</b> may be extended to access locations on the cliff that are located far from the airship <b>100</b>. In this manner, people at these locations on the cliff are transferred to the cabin <b>104</b> using the platform <b>106</b>. Thereafter, the airship <b>100</b> may transfer those people to a safe place.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the airship <b>100</b> used for performing transportation and rescue operations on a building <b>202</b> is illustrated in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The airship <b>100</b> facilitates transportation of people or goods to or from one or more stories of a multi-story building <b>202</b>. The one or more stories may be located high above the ground level.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The airship <b>100</b> includes one or more balloon units <b>102</b>. The airship <b>100</b> may be driven by one or more propellers configured on the balloon unit <b>102</b>. A propeller of the one or more propellers <b>112</b> may be powered by one or more motors, as discussed herein. The balloon unit <b>102</b> includes one or more balloon chambers, which facilitate in lifting the airship <b>100</b> in the air. The one or more balloon chambers may include one or more gases. The one or more gases may be lighter than air to lift the airship <b>100</b> in the air. In order to lift the airship <b>100</b> the one or more balloon chambers filled with the one or more gases develop buoyancy force on the airship <b>100</b>. In an embodiment, the one or more balloon chambers may be vacuumed to facilitate the airship <b>100</b> to rise in the air.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, the airship <b>100</b> includes the cabin <b>104</b>. The cabin <b>104</b> is configured on a top portion of the airship <b>100</b>. The cabin <b>104</b> may be positioned such as to provide easy access to the cabin <b>104</b> from different stories of building <b>202</b> when the airship <b>100</b> is located near to the building <b>202</b>. The cabin <b>104</b> may be capable of accommodating one or more of, but not limited to, people and goods. In an embodiment, the cabin <b>104</b> may be configured at one side of the airship <b>100</b>. In a scenario, the cabin <b>104</b> is configured on a top portion of the airship <b>100</b> to have easy access from different stories of building <b>202</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>; although other locations are also contemplated by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, the airship <b>100</b> includes the platform <b>106</b>, which is operatively connected to the cabin <b>104</b>. As discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the platform <b>106</b> may be part of a lower door of a clamshell door configuration. The platform <b>106</b> is connected to the cabin <b>104</b> to facilitate easy access to the cabin <b>104</b> from outside, even during flight of the airship <b>100</b>. In an embodiment, the platform <b>106</b> may be rotated at an angle varying from 0&#xb0; to 360&#xb0; with respect to cabin <b>104</b>, by use of a mechanical or electric swivel unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. This rotating feature of the platform <b>106</b> may enable the airship <b>100</b> to have access to different stories of the multi-story building <b>202</b>. For example, the airship <b>100</b> may be positioned near building <b>202</b> during a fire break out in building <b>202</b>. The platform <b>106</b> of the airship <b>100</b> may be maneuvered at different angles and may extend from the airship at different lengths (as explained in greater detail below) to gain access to different stories of building <b>202</b>. Thus, people trapped in these stories can be easily transferred to cabin <b>106</b> using platform <b>106</b>. Thereafter, the airship <b>202</b> may land on the ground and the people present in the cabin <b>104</b> may move out to the ground safely through the platform <b>106</b>. The platform <b>106</b> may be extended using, for example, any electric motor, or other mechanical or pneumatic system such as, for example, rack and pinion gear or hydraulic system all of which are represented by reference numeral <b>106</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates another configuration of the airship <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In embodiments, the airship <b>100</b> is shown to include a first balloon unit <b>102</b><i>a </i>and a second balloon unit <b>102</b><i>b</i>, connected together by a structural frame <b>102</b><i>c</i>. The structural frame <b>102</b><i>c </i>can be made from any aviation grade structural material such as, for example, aluminum or other materials used for structural material in the aviation field. The first balloon unit <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the second balloon unit <b>102</b><i>b </i>may include chambers filled with gases for providing buoyancy, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The structural frame <b>102</b><i>c </i>encompasses the cabin <b>104</b>. In embodiments, the cabin <b>104</b> is accessible through one or more doors <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>. The cabin <b>104</b> can also include a cockpit <b>110</b>. In embodiments, the door <b>108</b><i>a </i>can be an upper door and the door <b>108</b><i>b </i>can be a lower door, both of which are hinge mounted to portions of the structural frame <b>102</b><i>c </i>or cabin <b>104</b>. In embodiments, the doors <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>are clamshell type doors, which dropped down and lift upwards to open. In embodiments, the lower door <b>108</b><i>b </i>may be used as the platform <b>106</b>; although, it is contemplated that the platform <b>106</b> can also be a separate unit. In embodiments, the platform <b>106</b> need not be extendable; although such extensions are still contemplated by the present invention. In a specific embodiment, the lower door <b>108</b><i>b </i>acts as the platform <b>106</b> and may be about one third of the opening (deployed); whereas, the upper door <b>108</b><i>a </i>may be two thirds of the opening. For example, in embodiments, the lower door <b>108</b><i>b </i>(platform <b>106</b>) may be about 60-70 cm of the total ingress/egress opening.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In embodiments, the bottom door <b>108</b><i>b </i>can act as the platform <b>106</b>, which can be extended outwards at different angles, depending on the opening angle of the door <b>108</b><i>b</i>, itself. Also, the door <b>108</b><i>b </i>can be extended by use of additional platforms, for example. More specifically, the platform <b>106</b> can be a trifold type system, which unfolds upon opening of the door <b>108</b><i>b</i>. The cabin <b>104</b> is preferably completely enclosed for the safety of the passengers and crew, with the doors <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>providing access to the cabin <b>104</b> and the cockpit <b>110</b>. The opening, extending and rotating of the platform <b>106</b> can be performed by any of the mechanisms already described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In embodiments, the cabin <b>104</b> can be provided between the two airships, e.g., first balloon unit <b>102</b><i>a </i>and second balloon unit <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and preferably with a passenger cabin in the front and upper half of the airship <b>100</b>. The remaining portion of the cabin <b>104</b> (including below a floor of the cabin) can be used for mechanical and electrical systems, as well as storage, etc. Accordingly, the placement and configuration of the cabin <b>104</b> between the first balloon unit <b>102</b><i>a </i>and second balloon unit <b>102</b><i>b </i>provides for added payload and passenger capacity. Also, the overall airframe design contributes to the overall lift generation of the airship <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, by placing the cabin <b>104</b> between the first balloon unit <b>102</b><i>a </i>and second balloon unit <b>102</b><i>b</i>, it is possible to achieve different configurations of the airship <b>100</b>, e.g., wider or narrower spacing between the chambers for optimal sizing. This configuration also allows the airship <b>100</b> to be easily configured by merely changing the width of the cabin <b>104</b>. Additionally, the shape of the cabin <b>104</b>, in combination with the first and second balloon units <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, also contributes to the overall aerodynamic shape of the airship <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the airship <b>100</b> can be covered with a hard skin, known to those of ordinary skill. For example, the skin can be aluminum, carbon fiber, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, and combinations thereof to name a few illustrative examples. The airship <b>100</b> also includes a power plant system which comprises a main power plant <b>112</b> and side or auxiliary power plants <b>114</b>.
