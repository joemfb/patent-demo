<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0029991, filed Apr. 1, 2010 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the present invention relate to an organic light emitting display device, and more particularly, to a transparent organic light emitting display device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Organic light emitting display devices generally have wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios, short response times, and reduced power consumption, and thus may be used across a variety of applications such as personal portable devices, such as MP3 players and mobile phones, or large screen displays, such as television sets. An organic light emitting display device has self-emitting characteristics, and a weight and a thickness of the organic light emitting display device can be reduced since the organic light emitting display device does not require an additional light source, compared to a liquid crystal display device. Also, an organic light emitting display device can be manufactured as a transparent display device by including transparent thin film transistors and transparent organic light emitting devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a transparent display device, when the device is in an off-state, an object or an image positioned on a side of the device opposite to a user is visible to the user through organic light emitting diodes and through spaces between patterns of thin film transistors and various wires. Therefore, a distorted image is transmitted to the user due to the patterns. The reason for this is because gaps between the patterns are merely a few nanometers in size. That is, the widths are almost equal to the wavelengths of visible light, thus causing light to scatter as it passed through the transparent display device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, external light is incident to a surface that is opposite to the surface displaying images while the images are displayed on the transparent display device, and thus, image quality is degraded due to the external light. Also, light displaying images and the transmitted external light are mixed, and thus, expected brightness and color coordinates may not be displayed well.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of the present invention provide a transparent organic light emitting display device that can prevent distortion of an image transmitted therethrough by preventing light scattering during image display.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Aspects of the present invention also provide a transparent organic light emitting display device that can adjust transmission of external light simply.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Aspects of the present invention also provide an organic light emitting display device that can prevent degradation of brightness and color coordinate reproduction due to the external light that is transmitted through the organic light emitting display device during image display.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an organic light emitting display device according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the organic light emitting display device, a display unit <b>2</b> is disposed on a first surface <b>11</b> of a first substrate <b>1</b> and a polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) device <b>3</b> is disposed on a second surface <b>12</b> of the first substrate <b>1</b>. The substrate <b>1</b> is formed of a transparent material, such as a transparent glass or a transparent plastic. The first surface <b>11</b> and the second surface <b>12</b> face each other. The first substrate <b>1</b> may not be a single substrate in all aspects. For example, the first substrate <b>1</b> may be at least two substrates attached to each other in other embodiments. For example, a substrate having the first surface <b>11</b> on which the display unit <b>21</b> is formed and a substrate having the second surface <b>12</b> on which the PDLC device <b>3</b> is formed may be bonded to each other to form the first substrate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the organic light emitting display device, external light is incident from an outer portion of the PDLC device <b>3</b> and passes through the PDLC device <b>3</b>, the first substrate <b>1</b>, and the display unit <b>2</b>. As will be described later, the display unit <b>2</b> is formed to transmit external light. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the display unit <b>2</b> is formed so that a user positioned on a side where an image is displayed can observe the external image transmitted through the PDLC device <b>3</b>, the first substrate <b>1</b>, and the display unit <b>2</b>. While not required in all aspects, in the shown organic light emitting display device, the display unit <b>2</b> and the PDLC device <b>3</b> are connected to an additional controller <b>4</b>. While not required in all aspects, the controller <b>4</b> can be implemented using one or more general or special purpose processors executing software and/or firmware to implement control operations for the device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the PDLC device <b>3</b> is formed on the first surface <b>11</b> of the first substrate <b>1</b>. An insulating layer <b>5</b> is formed on the PDLC device <b>3</b>. The display unit <b>2</b> is formed on the insulating layer <b>5</b>. Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described based on the organic light emitting display device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, however, embodiments that will be described later may be applied to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing an embodiment of the organic light emitting display device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The display unit <b>2</b> includes an organic emission unit <b>21</b> disposed on the first surface <b>11</b> of the first substrate <b>1</b> and a sealing substrate <b>23</b> to seal the organic emission unit <b>21</b>. The sealing substrate <b>23</b> is formed of a transparent material to allow viewing of an image generated by the organic emission unit <b>21</b> and to prevent external air and moisture from penetrating into the organic emission unit <b>21</b>. Edges of the sealing substrate <b>23</b> and the organic emission unit <b>21</b> are sealed by a sealant (not shown), and thus, a space <b>25</b> is formed between the sealing substrate <b>23</b> and the organic emission unit <b>21</b>. The space <b>25</b> may be filled with an absorbent or a filler, but the invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing another embodiment of the organic light emitting display device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a thin sealing film <b>24</b> is formed on the organic emission unit <b>21</b> to protect the organic emission unit <b>21</b> from the environment. The thin sealing film <b>24</b> has a structure in which a film formed of an inorganic material, such as silicon oxide or silicon nitride, and a film formed of an organic material, such as epoxy or polyimide, are alternately stacked. The thin sealing film <b>24</b> may have a structure of a variety of thin film type sealing structures.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the PDLC device <b>3</b> includes a first electrode <b>31</b> formed on a second surface <b>12</b> of the first substrate <b>1</b>, a second electrode <b>32</b> facing the first electrode <b>31</b>, and a PDLC layer <b>33</b> disposed between the first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>. The second electrode <b>32</b> is formed on a second substrate <b>34</b>, and the second substrate <b>34</b> is attached to the first substrate <b>1</b> via an additional sealant (not shown). The first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are transparent electrodes respectively formed of a material such as indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or ZnO. However, aspects of the present invention are not limited thereto, and the first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> may be formed of other suitable materials.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The PDLC layer <b>33</b> is formed of polymer dispersed liquid crystal. That is, the PDLC layer <b>33</b> includes liquid crystal droplets of a diameter of about 1 to 2 &#x3bc;m which are dispersed in polymer matrix. Here, since liquid crystal molecules are dispersed in the polymer matrix, the non-directional liquid crystal molecules may scatter the incident light. Therefore, when a predetermined voltage is applied to the first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, the liquid crystal molecules are arranged in a direction of an electric field due to a strong electric field of the applied voltage. At this time, the liquid crystal molecules disperse less light, and thus, more of the external light is transmitted through the PDLC device <b>3</b>. However, when the voltage is not applied to the first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, the light is strongly scattered by the liquid crystal droplets and the light does not transmit through the PDLC device <b>3</b>. However, aspects of the present invention are not limited to the PDLC device <b>3</b> of the above example. For example, the first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> may be arranged in parallel with each other to form a horizontal electric field like a liquid crystal display device of a horizontal electric field mode.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The PDLC device <b>3</b> may realize a see-through display by transmitting the external light when the predetermined voltage is applied between the first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>. In addition, when the predetermined voltage is not applied between the first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, the PDLC device <b>3</b> does not transmit the external light, and thus provides clear images and high contrast ratio. The PDLC device <b>3</b> may be operated automatically or manually by the controller <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic drawing showing an example of the organic emission unit <b>21</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the organic emission unit <b>21</b> is disposed on the first substrate <b>1</b> having a transmitting region TA transmitting external light and pixel regions PA. The pixel regions PA are separated from each other with the transmitting region TA interposed therebetween. Each of the pixel regions PA includes a pixel circuit unit PC, and conductive lines, such as a scan line S, a data line D, and a driving power line V, which are electrically connected to the pixel circuit unit PC. Although not shown, various other conductive lines besides the scan line S, the data line D, and the driving power line V may further be connected to the pixel circuit unit PC according to the configuration of the pixel circuit unit PC. A pixel electrode <b>221</b> is disposed on the pixel circuit unit PC.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example of the pixel circuit unit PC. The shown pixel circuit unit PC includes a first thin film transistor TR<b>1</b> connected to the scan line S and the data line D. A second thin film transistor TR<b>2</b> is connected to the first thin film transistor TR<b>1</b> and the driving power line V. A capacitor Cst is connected to the first and second thin film transistors TR<b>1</b> and TR<b>2</b>. In one embodiment, the first thin film transistor TR<b>1</b> may be a switching transistor and the second thin film transistor TR<b>2</b> may be a driving transistor. The second thin film transistor TR<b>2</b> is electrically connected to the pixel electrode <b>221</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first and second thin film transistors TR<b>1</b> and TR<b>2</b> are P-type transistors. However, aspects of the present invention are not limited thereto, and at least one of the first and second thin film transistors TR<b>1</b> and TR<b>2</b> may be an N-type transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to an embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, all the conductive lines, including scan line S, data line D, and driving power line V, are disposed to cross the pixel region PA. Thus, no conductive lines cross the transmitting regions TA. As described above, if other conductive lines besides the scan line S, data line D, and driving power line V are further formed, the other conductive lines are also disposed to cross the pixel region PA and to not cross the transmitting regions TA.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of the pixel regions PA is a light emitting region. The pixel circuit unit PC is located in the light emitting region and the conductive lines, including scan line S, data line D, and driving power line V, cross the light emitting region. Thus, the user may only perceive regions from which the light is emitted and may see the external portion through the transmitting region TA. In addition, when external light is transmitted through the pixel circuit unit PC, the external light is scattered by patterns of the devices in the pixel circuit unit PC, and thus, distortion of the external image may be prevented. Therefore, solar light can be prevented from scattering caused by interfering with the patterns of internal devices of the pixel circuit unit PC, thereby preventing external image distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, at least one of the conductive lines, including scan line S, data line D, and driving power line V, is disposed to cross the transmitting region TA between the pixel regions PA. However, since the conductive lines are formed to be very thin, the conductive lines are hardly visible to the user and have little effect on the overall transmittance of the organic emission unit <b>21</b>, and accordingly, a see-through display can be realized. Also, although the user may not see the external image as much in regions covered by the pixel regions PA, in consideration of the overall display region, there is little effect on observing the external image since the pixel regions PA may be viewed by the user as a plurality of dots regularly arranged on a surface of a transparent glass.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an embodiment of the present invention, the transmitting regions TA and the pixel regions PA are formed so that a ratio of the area of the transmitting regions TA with respect to the combined area of the transmitting regions TA and the pixel regions PA, is between about 20% and about 90%. In other words, a combined area is the area of the transmitting regions TA plus the area of the pixel regions PA, and the transmitting regions TA are 20% to 90% of the combined area.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The above ratio range may provide an optimal balance between the prevention of light scattering and pixel integrity to provide a stable image. For example, if the ratio is greater than or equal to about 20%, the transparency of the device is enhanced. The ratio of the area of the transmitting regions TA with respect to the overall area of the transmitting regions TA and the pixel regions PA may be approximately 20%. In such an embodiment, the pixel regions PA are present in an island state with respect to the transmitting regions TA, and scattering of external light is minimized since all conductive patterns are disposed across the pixel regions PA. Thus, the display unit <b>2</b> may be recognized as a transparent display unit by the user. As will be described later, when a transistor included in the pixel circuit unit PC is formed of a transparent thin film transistor (TFT) such as an oxide semiconductor, and an organic light emitting device is a transparent device, then the display unit <b>2</b> may be recognized as a transparent display unit. In this case, unlike a conventional transparent display unit, all conductive patterns are disposed across the pixel regions PA if possible. Accordingly, scattering of external light can be prevented, and transmittance of the external light is high, and thus, the user can see an undistorted external image.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the ratio of the area of the transmitting regions TA with respect to the entire area of the pixel regions PA and the transmitting regions TA is greater than 90%, pixel integrity of the display unit <b>2</b> is excessively reduced, and thus, a stable image is not easily realized through the light emission from the pixel regions PA. In one embodiment, as the area of the pixel regions PA is reduced, the amount of light emitted from the organic light emitting film <b>223</b> is increased in order to realize an image. However, if the organic light emitting device is operated so as to emit light having a high intensity, the lifetime of the organic light emitting device is rapidly reduced. Also, when the ratio of the area of the transmitting regions TA with respect to the combine area of the pixel regions PA and the transmitting regions TA is greater than 90% while the size of a single pixel region PA is maintained at an appropriate size, the number of pixel regions PA is reduced. Accordingly, the resolution of the organic light emitting device is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The ratio of the area of the transmitting regions TA with respect to the combined area of the pixel regions PA and the transmitting regions TA may further be in a range of about 40% to about 70%. This ratio range, about 40% to about 70%, provides advantages. For example, the ratio range of being greater than or equal to about 40% may not significantly limit the user's capability of observing an external image through the transmitting regions TA. Further, the ratio range of being less than or equal to about 70% may make it easier to design the pixel circuit unit PC. However, aspects of the present invention are not limited thereto, and ratio ranges other than the above-described ranges can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Each of the pixel regions PA includes the pixel electrode <b>221</b> that has an area corresponding to the area of pixel regions PA. The pixel electrode <b>221</b> is electrically connected to the pixel circuit unit PC. The pixel circuit unit PC overlaps with the pixel electrode <b>221</b> so that the pixel circuit unit PC is covered by the pixel electrode <b>221</b>. Also, the conductive lines including the scan line S, the data line D, and the driving power line V are disposed to cross the pixel electrode <b>221</b>. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the pixel electrode <b>221</b> has an area equal to or slightly greater than that of the pixel region PA. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the user observes the organic emission unit <b>21</b>, the pixel circuit unit PC is covered by the pixel electrode <b>221</b> and a large portion of the conductive lines are also covered. Therefore, scattering of external light is greatly reduced as described above and the user sees a portion of the conductive lines through the transmitting regions TA. Accordingly, the user can observe an undistorted external image.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a plan view showing an example of the organic emission unit <b>21</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an organic light emitting display device according to an embodiment of the present invention. According to an embodiment of the present invention, in the organic emission unit <b>21</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a buffer layer <b>211</b> is disposed on the first surface <b>11</b> of the first substrate <b>1</b>, and the first TFT TR<b>1</b>, a capacitor Cst, and a second TFT TR<b>2</b> are disposed on the buffer layer <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">First, a first semiconductor active layer <b>212</b><i>a </i>and a second semiconductor active layer <b>212</b><i>b </i>are formed on the buffer layer <b>211</b>. The buffer layer <b>211</b> prevents impurity elements from penetrating into the organic emission unit <b>21</b> and planarizes a surface of the organic emission unit <b>21</b>. The buffer layer <b>211</b> is formed of any of various materials that can perform the functions described above, such as an inorganic material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, titanium oxide, or titanium nitride, an organic material such as polyimide, polyester, or acryl, or stacks of these materials. However, aspects of the present invention are not limited thereto, and the buffer layer <b>211</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first and second semiconductor active layers <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>are formed of polycrystal silicon. However, aspects of the present invention are not limited thereto, and the first and second semiconductor active layers <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>may be formed of a semiconductor oxide, for example, a G-I&#x2014;Z&#x2014;O layer [a(In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)b(Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)c(ZnO) layer], where a, b, and c are integers that respectively satisfy a&#x2267;0, b&#x2267;0, and c&#x3e;0. When the first and second semiconductor active layers <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>are formed of a semiconductor oxide, optical transmittance may be further increased compared to when the active layers are formed of a silicon semiconductor. A gate insulating layer <b>213</b> covering the first and second semiconductor active layers <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>is formed on the buffer layer <b>211</b>.

In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the pixel electrode <b>221</b> is formed as an island type independent from each other pixel electrode <b>221</b>. A pixel defining layer <b>219</b> covering edges of the pixel electrode <b>221</b> is formed on the passivation layer <b>218</b>. An organic emission layer <b>223</b> and an opposite electrode <b>222</b> are sequentially formed on the pixel electrode <b>221</b>. The opposite electrode <b>222</b> is formed on all of the pixel regions PA and the transmitting regions TA.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The organic emission layer <b>223</b> is a low molecular weight organic film or a polymer organic film having a large molecular weight. When the organic emission layer <b>223</b> is a low molecular weight organic film, the organic emission layer <b>223</b> is formed by stacking a hole injection layer (HIL), a hole transport layer (HTL), an emission layer (EML), an electron transport layer (ETL), and an electron injection layer (EIL) in a single structure or a composite structure, and is formed of any of various materials such as copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), N,N&#x2032;-Di(naphthalene-1-yl)-N,N&#x2032;-diphenyl-benzidine (NPB), or tris-8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq3). The low-molecular weight organic film is formed by vacuum deposition. In this regard, the HIL, the HTL, the ETL, and the EIL are common layers and are commonly applied to red, green, and blue pixels. Accordingly, unlike the organic emission layer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the common layers are formed to cover the pixel regions PA and the transmitting regions TA like the opposite electrode <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the pixel electrode <b>221</b> functions as an anode electrode, and the opposite electrode <b>222</b> functions as a cathode electrode.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the pixel electrode <b>221</b> is a reflection electrode and the opposite electrode <b>222</b> is a transparent electrode.

However, aspects of the present invention are not limited thereto, and the organic emission unit <b>21</b> may be a bottom emission type or a dual emission type.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the pixel electrode <b>221</b> is a reflection electrode, the pixel circuit unit PC disposed under the pixel electrode <b>221</b> is covered by the pixel electrode <b>221</b>.

Also, the user can not observe portions of the scan line S, the data line D, and the driving power line V. Accordingly, a more clear external image is viewable since distortion of the external image, which is due to each of the patterns that constitute the organic emission unit <b>21</b>, is not generated.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">However, aspects of the present invention are not limited thereto. For example, the pixel electrode <b>221</b> can also be a transparent electrode or a semi-transparent electrode.

If the pixel electrode <b>221</b> is transparent, the user can observe the first TFT TR<b>1</b>, the capacitor Cst, and the second TFT TR<b>2</b> disposed under the pixel electrode <b>221</b>, as well as portions of the scan line S, the data line D, and the driving power line V, at the upper outer sides of the opposite electrode <b>222</b>. However, although the pixel electrode <b>221</b> is transparent, there is a loss of light since the transmittance of light therethrough is not 100%. Also, the transmittance of external light is further reduced due to the pixel electrode <b>221</b> since the conductive patterns are disposed in the region of the pixel electrode <b>221</b>. Therefore, interference due to the conductive patterns on the external light is reduced as compared when the external light directly enters the conductive patterns. Thus, distortion of an external image is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an embodiment of the present invention, in order to further increase the optical transmittance of the transmitting regions TA, the passivation layer <b>218</b>, the gate insulating layer <b>213</b>, the interlayer insulating layer <b>215</b>, and the pixel defining layer <b>219</b> may be formed as transparent insulating layers. Herein, the first substrate <b>1</b> has a transmittance greater than or equal to a total transmittance of the transparent insulating layers. The passivation layer <b>218</b> is interchangeably used with a first insulating layer, and a combination of the gate insulating layer <b>213</b>, the interlayer insulating layer <b>215</b>, and the pixel defining layer <b>219</b> is interchangeably used with a second insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, the PDLC device <b>3</b> is formed on a second surface <b>12</b> of the first substrate <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the PDLC device <b>3</b> has an area corresponding to the entire area of the display device including the transmitting regions TA and the pixel regions PA. Accordingly, the transmission of external light that is incident from a lower side of a second substrate <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may be selectively adjusted. That is, when the external light is intense or when the user does not want to see the external environment, the predetermined voltage is not applied to the first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> as described above, and accordingly, only the image from the organic emission unit <b>21</b> may be provided to the user. When the user wants to see the external environment, the predetermined voltage is applied to the first and the second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> so that the external light may be transmitted through the PDLC device <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, at least one of the first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> in the PDLC device <b>3</b> is formed to have a pattern corresponding to at least a part of the transmitting regions TA while disposed under the transmitting regions TA. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the second electrode <b>32</b> is formed on a portion of the second substrate <b>34</b> corresponding to at least a part of the transmitting region TA. In addition, the second electrode <b>32</b> is formed to have an area that is equal to an area of at least a part of the transmitting region TA. The second electrode <b>32</b> is patterned as an island and independently exists at a position corresponding to each of the pixels. In addition, the first electrode <b>31</b> is a common electrode that is formed throughout the entire display regions. It is understood that the first electrode <b>31</b> could also be patterned in addition to or instead of the second electrode <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the above case, the controller <b>4</b> adjusts a time of applying the predetermined voltage to the second electrode <b>32</b> with respect to a time of emitting light at the pixel regions PA. That is, the controller <b>4</b> controls the predetermined voltage to be not applied to the second electrode <b>32</b> when the pixel region PA emits the light. Thus, the controller <b>4</b> automatically controls the transmission of external light. Therefore, images which are clear and have a high contrast ratio are visible to the user. Moreover, when the second electrode <b>32</b> is patterned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the PDLC device <b>3</b> may be controlled according to the pixel unit, and thus, the user may see clear images while observing the external environment.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, at least one of the first and second electrodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> in the PDLC device <b>3</b>, for example, the second electrode <b>32</b>, is formed to have a pattern corresponding to the pixel region PA under the pixel region PA. In the present embodiment, the controller <b>4</b> operates the PDLC device <b>3</b> when each of the pixel regions PA displays the image in order to restrict the transmittance of the external light. Then, the incidence of the external light to the pixel regions PA may be reduced, and a degradation of the brightness and the color purity at the pixel regions PA may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In more detail, the PDLC device <b>3</b> is disposed on a position corresponding to each of the pixel regions PA to operate in communication with the operation of the each pixel region PA. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the second electrode <b>32</b> formed on the second substrate <b>34</b> is formed to correspond to each of the pixel regions PA. In addition, the second electrode <b>32</b> is formed to have an area that is greater than that of the pixel electrode <b>221</b>. The second electrode <b>32</b> is patterned as an island to independently correspond to each of the pixel regions PA. Meanwhile, the first electrode <b>31</b> is a common electrode that is formed throughout the entire display regions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the present embodiment, when a constant voltage is applied to the first electrode <b>31</b> and the second electrode <b>32</b> is driven opposite to the driving of the pixel electrode <b>221</b>, the PDLC layer <b>33</b>, which is disposed on a certain second electrode <b>32</b>, restricts the transmission of the external light. The transmission of the external light is restricted when the pixel region PA corresponding to the above second electrode <b>32</b> emits the light, and thus, the external light incident on the corresponding pixel region PA may be restricted. Therefore, the external light incident on the pixel regions PA may be reduced, and accordingly, reducing degradation of the brightness and color purity, wherein the degradation is caused by mixture of the light emitted from the pixel regions PA with the external light. Moreover, when the second electrode <b>32</b> is patterned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the PDLC layer <b>33</b> independently operates at each of the pixel regions PA, and thus, the PDLC device <b>3</b> may be controlled according to the pixel unit. Thus, the user may see clear images while observing the external environment. In embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the first electrode <b>31</b> is patterned instead of patterning the second electrode <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> show another example of the organic emission unit <b>21</b> and the organic light emitting display device, and an opening <b>220</b> having a predetermined shape and formed in the transparent insulating films in the transmitting regions TA. The opening <b>220</b> is formed as wide as possible as long as the opening <b>220</b> does not interrupt the scan line S, the data line D, and the driving power line V. The opening <b>220</b> is formed in the gate insulating layer <b>213</b>, the interlayer insulating layer <b>215</b>, the passivation layer <b>218</b>, and the pixel defining layer <b>219</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the opening <b>220</b> is not formed in the buffer layer <b>211</b> in order to prevent impurities from penetrating into the first substrate <b>1</b>. If necessary, the opening <b>220</b> may extend to the buffer layer <b>211</b>. In this way, the formation of the opening <b>220</b> in the transmitting regions TA further increases the optical transmittance of the transmitting regions TA, and thus, an external image can be further clearly observed by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As described above, according to the PDLC device <b>3</b> according to aspects of the present invention, a color reproduction ratio and a contrast ratio may be improved. The organic light emitting display device, according to aspects of the present invention may be used as a functional window, such as might be used in heads-up displays in aircraft and cars, advertisements in store windows, displays in homes, or other similar applications using the functional window. According to aspects of the present invention, an organic light emitting display device may prevent distortion of a transmitted image by eliminating light scattering during image display. According to aspects of the present invention, the transmission of external light through the organic light emitting display device may be controlled automatically or whenever the user wants to. In addition, degradation of the brightness and color coordinate reproduction due to the external light transmitted during the image display may be reduced, and a range of the color reproduction ratio may be increased. Also, the contrast ratio of the images may be improved.</p>
