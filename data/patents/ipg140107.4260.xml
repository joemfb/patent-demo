<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to Korean application number 10-2011-0107630, filed on Oct. 20, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as set forth in full.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a nonvolatile memory apparatus, and more particularly, to a write control method of a nonvolatile memory apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A useful feature of a nonvolatile memory apparatus is low power consumption, and a nonvolatile memory apparatus that does not perform a refresh operation may consume less power. A phase-change random access memory (PRAM), which is a nonvolatile memory apparatus that does not perform a refresh operation, applies an electrical pulse to a phase change layer formed of a chalcogenide compound and stores data using a resistance difference between an amorphous state and a crystal state. The phase change layer may include a chalcogenide compound such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST). Here, the amorphous state (or reset state) may be obtained by applying a pulse current to a memory cell during a designated time, and the crystal state (or set state) may be obtained by applying a pulse current during a longer time than the designated time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The GST of the PRAM has its own physical characteristics, and a representative example of the physical characteristic is resistance drift. The resistance drift refers to a phenomenon where the resistance of GST, which is physically and chemically unstable, increases with time while the GST is electrically stabilized. The resistance drift becomes prominent in the amorphous state.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The resistance drift exhibits an exponential function characteristic with respect to time, and the exponential function has a random variable within the range of a designated constant, regardless of a unique characteristic of a phase-change cell.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when the random variable of the exponential function is significantly changed, the resistance change is increased. Accordingly, the resistance value may be increased after a constant time passes, unlike when an initial write operation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As such, when the resistance value is significantly changed after a constant time passes, the reliability of a nonvolatile memory apparatus may be reduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a nonvolatile memory apparatus and a write control method thereof, which are capable of increasing reliability of the nonvolatile memory apparatus by improving a write operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Hereinafter, a nonvolatile memory apparatus and a write control method thereof according to the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings through exemplary embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a write control circuit of a nonvolatile memory apparatus according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the write control circuit <b>100</b> of the nonvolatile memory apparatus according to the embodiment includes a memory cell array <b>110</b>, a data input buffer <b>120</b>, a write operation controller <b>130</b>, a write driver <b>140</b>, and a write operation verification reader <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The memory cell array <b>110</b> includes a plurality of PRAM cells. Furthermore, each of the PRAM cells includes a switching element coupled to a word line (not illustrated) and one variable resistor (GST) coupled to a bit line (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The data input buffer <b>120</b> is configured to buffer data provided from an external pad DQ and provide input data Din.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The write operation controller <b>130</b> is configured to receive the input data Din inputted from the data input buffer <b>120</b> and output a write driving signal WDEN for driving the write driver <b>140</b> in response to an output signal outputted from the write operation verification reader <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, when the write operation verification reader <b>150</b> determines as a verification result that the write operation was normally performed, the write operation controller <b>130</b> calculates a resistance value or voltage value with time and determines whether or not to re-perform the write operation. This operation will be described below in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Meanwhile, when the write operation verification reader <b>150</b> determines as a verification result that the write operation was not normally performed, the write operation controller <b>130</b> controls the write driver <b>140</b> to apply a voltage that is increased from an initially-applied voltage and re-perform the write operation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The write driver <b>140</b> is driven in response to the write driving signal WREN outputted from the write operation controller <b>130</b>, and the write driver <b>140</b> loads the input data Din into an input/output line (not illustrated) such that the input data Din is written to the memory cell array <b>110</b>. The write driver <b>140</b> applies a voltage to the memory cell array <b>110</b> according to an incremental step pulse programming (ISPP) method, which successively increases the voltage from a designated voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">After the write operation is performed by the write driver <b>140</b>, the write operation verification reader <b>150</b> reads the data of the corresponding cell, verifies whether the read data is identical to data to be written, and provides the verification result to the write operation controller <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the nonvolatile memory apparatus according to the embodiment, the write control circuit <b>100</b> includes the write operation verification reader <b>150</b> for verifying a write operation. However the present invention is not limited thereto, and a write operation may be verified by using a sense amplifier (not illustrated), which is included in a read operation circuit, to verify a write operation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above, the write operation controller <b>130</b> of the write control circuit <b>100</b> in the nonvolatile memory apparatus according to the embodiment calculates a resistance value or voltage value with time when a write operation is normally performed. This process will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph illustrating a resistance change with time in the nonvolatile memory apparatus according to the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of the resistance change with time, but the embodiment of the present invention may be applied to an example showing a voltage change with time because a voltage is proportional to resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the resistance of the write control circuit <b>100</b> according to the embodiment increases with time. This resistance characteristic is based on the unique characteristic of GST and is caused by the resistance drift as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The write operation controller <b>130</b> of the write control circuit <b>100</b> according to the embodiment may calculate a resistance value with time, as expressed by the following equation.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Here, R<sub>0 </sub>represents an initial resistance value, t<sub>0 </sub>represents a time when the initial resistance value is measured, t represents a time when the next resistance value is measured, and v represents a unique constant of GST.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, the initial resistance value refers to a resistance value that is measured when the write operation verification reader <b>150</b> determines as a verification result that a write operation was normally performed after the write operation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The initial resistance R<sub>0 </sub>at 100 ns is substituted in the above-described equation, and a resistance value R is calculated at 1 &#x3bc;s corresponding to a time of the next resistance measurement, and with the resistances measured at these exemplary times, the equation derives a first reference resistance value Rref<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, similar to the method that the first reference resistance value Rref<b>1</b> is derived, the initial resistance R<sub>0 </sub>at 100 ns is substituted in the equation, and a resistance value R is calculated at 2 &#x3bc;s corresponding to a time of the next resistance measurement, and with the resistances measured at these exemplary times, the equation derives a second resistance value Rref<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As such, the reference resistance values are previously set through the above-described equation, and then each is compared to a respective resistance value that is measured in the write control circuit <b>100</b> after a respective designated time passes. When the measured resistance value is larger than the first reference resistance value, a resistance value is measured one more time after a designated time passes. Then at this time, when the measured resistance value is larger than the second reference resistance value, the write operation is re-performed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The write control method of the nonvolatile memory apparatus according to the embodiment will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart showing the write control method of the nonvolatile memory apparatus according to the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when data is inputted from a circuit outside of the write control circuit <b>100</b>, the write operation controller <b>130</b> controls the write driver <b>140</b> to write the data into a corresponding cell, at step S<b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The data of the corresponding cell is read through the write operation verification reader <b>150</b> at step S<b>302</b>, and whether or not the read data is identical to the initial data, more specifically, the written data, is determined by the write operation verification reader <b>150</b> at step S<b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As the determination result of step <b>303</b>, when the read data is identical to the initial data, a first time t<b>1</b> is counted at step S<b>305</b>. Meanwhile, when the read data is not identical to the initial data, a voltage increased more than a voltage applied to perform the write operation at the step S<b>301</b> is applied at step S<b>304</b>.
