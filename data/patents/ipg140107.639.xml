<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of building construction, and more specifically to providing standardized modular building construction components to realize a superstructure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Today's on-site building construction techniques typically require various suppliers and contractors to provide the necessary elements, such as raw materials, in combination with the labor necessary to complete each step in the process for producing a building, such as a single family home. Many people and building materials are required to be at the site at the appropriate time.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On-site construction may in some instances suffer schedule delays and budget overages resulting from unforeseen site conditions, such as inclement weather or permit delays, changing site conditions, subcontractor unavailability, and lack of readily available raw materials. Project managers responsible for constructing buildings within budget and on-schedule must coordinate numerous process steps and building materials that are challenging to schedule and in some instances wholly unpredictable. The process of on-site building construction is often described as &#x201c;controlled chaos.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, some on-site builders employ prefabricated construction techniques in erecting portions of the building, or the entire structure. Present pre-fabrication techniques can in some instances ease the need for availability of certain building materials and the labor associated with traditional non-prefabricated construction techniques. &#x201c;Prefabrication&#x201d; or &#x201c;systems built housing&#x201d; construction techniques typically involve one of four major market segments: manufactured, modular (which can be divided into custom and semi-custom), panelized, and pre-cut or kit homes. Each involves pre-formed materials, and all but manufactured homes must typically comply with local building codes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Manufactured homes are complete dwelling units substantially or completely constructed in a factory in conformance with a national building code, an example of which is a mobile home. Modular homes are factory assembled residences built in units or sections, transported to a permanent site and erected on a foundation, and modular homes typically exclude mobile homes. Again, modular homes can be either custom or semi-custom. Custom pre-fabrication generally involves multiple modular boxes, or volumes, built to size, compliant with local codes, that define the desired final space, room, or portion thereof. Each modular box must be individually &#x201c;engineered&#x201d; to ensure adequate strength (e.g. shear and vertical loading), code compliance, and other structural design details. Buildings realized from custom prefabrication are therefore limited in benefits that can be offered, in some instances requiring months of additional &#x201c;engineering&#x201d; and code compliance verification prior to beginning of each building project. Due to the customized nature, this technique becomes problematic because it does not benefit from standardized parts. The modular &#x201c;boxes&#x201d; produced by today's custom methods resemble empty volumes &#x201c;full of air&#x201d; as the box is lacking in infrastructure, e.g. HVAC, electrical and plumbing, and exhibit low packing and shipping characteristics. Custom methods are of limited benefit due to higher costs associated with shipping &#x201c;empty&#x201d; modules, required individual design/engineering efforts, a lack of infrastructure, and the fact that the custom process generally provides no repeatable, reusable, or standardized components or economies of fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Semi-custom prefabrication methods typically involve a limited set of, for example, five to twenty complete individual building designs. Since the designs are known in advance, semi-custom prefabrication methods may enable configuring and building a limited set of components prior to construction. Many semi-custom designs involve choosing a pre-determined building design and constructing on-site with no modifications. In the situation where some customization is available, the resulting designs become are limited and can require re-engineering and re-approval of the initially selected building design. Semi-custom designs are further limited in that they typically require provisioning of space within multiple areas of the structure to accommodate addition of various custom features such as a tank-less in-wall water heater for a bathroom. Semi-custom designs become problematic in that the need for establishing or provisioning reserve space is inefficient and inhibits component standardization, resulting in higher overall costs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As may be appreciated, certain advantages and disadvantages are associated with each type of housing construction technique. Certain modular systems can offer advantages over site and panelized systems in that all trades (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, etc.) can be organized in one place and can thus be readily controlled. This can minimize delays due to weather, use of tools can be leveraged, and supplies can be centralized and readily available to all trades.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Manufactured prefabrication construction of manufactured or &#x201c;mobile&#x201d; homes occurs in accordance with Housing and Urban Development (HUD) codes. The mobile homes produced from manufactured systems are mostly produced in a factory as a single complete structure. By HUD code, mobile homes must be transportable, with wheels attached to their foundations, and must be capable of being moved after installation. The mobile home is transported on a single vehicle or transported in a limited number of large sections and fixed at a semi-permanent location.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Manufactured systems such as these are limited, in that multi-family dwellings are not permissible according to current HUD codes. Also, due to the need to transport the dwellings on roadways, the total size of the structure is governed by inter- and intra-state vehicle codes.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Panelized prefabrication methods generally involve constructing only the building walls at a factory. The walls may be efficiently packed and shipped to the on-site construction location.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Panelized methods may afford flexible designs and allow for standardizing certain components, for example one component may be a wall with a door, where a different component may involve a window in lieu of or in combination with a door. Panelized methods become problematic because the effort to assemble the large number of panels required for realizing an entire building structure on-site remains labor intensive, including the need for internal components such as electrical, plumbing, etc. Panelized methods are typically limited to wall components and do not generally entail ceilings, floors, decks, roofs and other horizontally oriented &#x201c;wall-like&#x201d; components. The lack of horizontal components and the inability to define spaces for inclusion of desired features can result in increases in on-site assembly efforts, increasing costs and delaying schedule.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Off-site construction of repeatable standardized building modules in a controlled environment as part of a complete building system may eliminate many of the budget and schedule challenges associated with site-based construction.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It would therefore be beneficial to provide for standardized modular building construction that combines aspects and processes for pre-defined modules with infrastructure functional elements in an arrangement affording mobile delivery.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one aspect of the present design, there is provided a method for providing standardized modular elements usable to construct a building. The method comprises defining a set of allowable functional building block configurations, wherein the set of allowable functional building block configurations is divided into assembly levels, defining allowable configurations and allowable interactions for each allowable functional building block configuration usable in a building configuration, and producing standardized modular elements based on the allowable configurations and allowable interactions for a desired building configuration. Fabricated standardized modular components are provided at an off-site location and employed in a building at an on-site location.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The exemplification set out herein illustrates particular embodiments, and such exemplification is not intended to be construed as limiting in any manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The following description and the drawings illustrate specific embodiments sufficiently to enable those skilled in the art to practice the system and method described. Other embodiments may incorporate structural, logical, process and other changes. Examples merely typify possible variations. Individual components and functions are generally optional unless explicitly required, and the sequence of operations may vary. Portions and features of some embodiments may be included in or substituted for those of others.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In general, the present design includes a system and method for off-site creation and prefabrication of standard components that integrate beneficial aspects of mobile construction with panelized and modular building system techniques to form a hybrid building construction system and methodology. The present building construction system may configure, fabricate, and integrate components off-site that would typically be assembled and/or constructed on-site. The present building components may include but are not limited to modules and panels and the methodology may include configuring and assembling standardized building components to provide generally reusable designs and a repeatable and relatively predictable construction process.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present design establishes structures in a way to insure that all parts of the home that require the greatest skilled labor&#x2014;baths, kitchens, utility cores&#x2014;are isolated into the modules, thus leveraging what modules do best. The present design employs panels to define spaces between the modules, and thus in the present design each system is leveraged to do what the system can do best.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Another aspect of the present design is the integration of infrastructure (plumbing, electrical, ducting, etc.) into individual panels, where that infrastructure had previously been integrated on site.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Note that as used herein, the terms &#x201c;modules&#x201d; &#x201c;components&#x201d; and &#x201c;elements&#x201d; are generally employed to mean modules are the largest building related unit, and modules include certain components formed of elements. Building system panel components may include but are not limited to walls, floors, roofs, and decks. Building system module components may configure predefined functional building blocks to form upper, lower, and mid-level positioned modules. Functional building blocks may include but are not limited to stairs, kitchens, built-in such as a home theater wall unit or other fixture, master baths, baths, and studios arranging a kitchen and bath combination. The present design building system may configure each standard component, such as modules and panels, suitable for mobile transport to the building lot or site for assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The standard components of the present design may enable installation and integration of various infrastructure functional elements including but not limited to plumbing and electrical, HVAC ducting, structural framing, interior finish, exterior cladding, special purpose materials, such as thermal or sound insulating, structural, etc., and non-structural cavity furring. Space or provisions may be made for these infrastructure functional elements such that they are available when the components leave the factory and are received at the job site. The infrastructure functional elements are configured for efficient on-site assembly, such as insertion of electrical or plumbing components in a multi floor building configuration, such as for example where a kitchen sink plumbing requires a horizontal stack pipe vented out the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present design may pre-configure the a plumbing infrastructure functional element within a standard wall component, where provision for the anticipated plumbing components are sufficient to maintain panel-to-panel or panel-to-module vertical alignment between components when mated or joined on-site, with space for infrastructure including but not limited to plumbing, electrical, insulation, HVAC, and so forth. Aligning infrastructure functional elements in this way can reduce the on-site assembly time required for joining and configuring horizontally arranged components, such as (with the kitchen sink example) by pre-positioning a stack pipe at an identical location within the lower floor and associated upper floor component.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present design may involve pre-installation preparation of portions of predefined or standardized modules where each module is configured to include all equipment integrated into a fully finished, ready-for-use, room arranged to fulfill specialized functions, such as a kitchen or bath. The present design may combine standard modules (kitchen, bath, bedroom, etc.) with standard panels that enable connection of the standard modules by providing predetermined modules with specific known pre-assembled panels at the construction site in accordance with approved architectural/engineering plans to realize a completed building. Standard modules are typically used for areas that require a high degree of coordination between trades, for example kitchens, baths, stairs, together with utility cores offered within or with the standard modules, such as HVAC, plumbing, and electric power feed with circuit breaker box.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Standard panels may be assembled or fabricated with infrastructure elements or integrated services (electrical outlet boxes, insulation, HVAC ducts, etc.) or without. Panels containing few or no integrated services, together with panels that include infrastructure functional elements for providing services, may be arranged together as desired to connect modules together. Different such panels may be employed to define remaining spaces required that are not satisfied by the use of modules (hallways, staircase landings, etc.)</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present design enables the architect, engineer, builder, or owner to increase or decrease the overall size of the final building superstructure as desired by changing (increasing or decreasing) the number of modules or panels, the size of modules or panels size, and the layout or contents of connected panels to alter dimensions of the buildings defined spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present design permits pre-installation fabrication of building modules and panels that integrate functional elements that typically would be fabricated and constructed on-site. Moving the complex construction activities associated with producing kitchens, baths, and other spaces requiring diverse highly skilled professionals from the construction site to a factory location can result in an overall reduction in total costs, expended time, construction waste, and complexities associated therewith to construct buildings of various types, styles, and sizes as compared with current traditional site-based production methods. Further, such a methodology provides the ability to change the building design, modules, and desired infrastructure within certain boundaries, without the need for re-engineering or obtaining further permits, thus providing advantages over previous pre-fabrication designs. Moving infrastructure functional element assembly from the construction site to a factory location may further contribute to cost and complexity reductions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> disclose embodiments of the building construction system, including representative standardized modules and panels. As may be appreciated, different modules, panels, components, and elements from those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> may be employed as desired while still within the scope of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> disclose two representative production and assembly methodologies for the present design, i.e. the building construction system process, for activities performed at the factory (off-site) and in the field (on-site).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">While the term &#x201c;factory&#x201d; is employed herein, it is to be understood that the modules, panels, and components disclosed herein may be produced or assembled at various locations, including but not limited to a production facility particularly suited solely to preparation of the designs and pieces disclosed herein. The term &#x201c;factory&#x201d; as used herein indicates any off-building site location where parts or pieces are collected or assembled before processed (finished or near-finished) parts are provided to a building site, and may include one or more locations or production facilities, a site specifically suited to producing such modules, panels, or components, or a facility or facilities that perform other functions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> diagrammatically illustrates a building construction system <b>110</b> involving modules <b>150</b> and panels <b>120</b> for use in accordance with one embodiment of the present design. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates modules and panels forming a set of standard components for the hybrid building construction system <b>110</b> configured for use in fabricating an entire superstructure within a factory. The present design's building construction system <b>110</b> may be configured for prefabricating standard components to form a complete superstructure including requisite infrastructure functional elements and arranged for final for on-site assembly. Beginning at the top of the drawing, building construction system <b>110</b> is shown to form a one bedroom <b>111</b>, two-bedroom <b>112</b>, or three bedroom <b>113</b> home, including the various applicable modules, such as kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, stairways, etc. Building construction system <b>110</b> in the desired configuration may comprise a combination of standard panels <b>120</b> and standard modules <b>150</b> forming the desired home or building.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The designer may lay out the structure, such as two bedroom home <b>112</b>, using known or generally available modules or panels. In certain instances, some panels or modules may not conform to the desires of the owner, who may want a larger kitchen at the expense of a dining area. In such cases, if the modules can be fabricated off site by changing known modules, this can be done; otherwise, the desired module or panel may be partially or completely fabricated on site, with the remaining modules, panels, and components produced at the factory and transported to the site.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus although the present design contemplates construction of an exemplary single or multi-bedroom home dwelling configuration, the present design is not limited to home construction and the construction techniques disclosed herein may be used to realize any type of superstructure, such as a warehouse, office complex, or retail store, at a location remote from a factory wherein modules, panels, and components are built or assembled. Further, non standard designs may be employed, such as a single family home having multiple stories, or more than three bedrooms.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, standard panels <b>120</b> may include panels oriented in either the vertical direction (panel <b>130</b>) or the horizontal direction (panel <b>140</b>). Modules <b>150</b> may be configured or selected to fulfill specialized functionality within the building system, again including such modules as kitchens or baths. These may be provided on different levels, such as upper level <b>160</b>, mid-level <b>170</b>, and lower level <b>180</b>. While shown to include stairwells in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, building construction system modules <b>150</b> may include rooms, stairwells at different positions on different levels, or generally square modules atop smaller rectangular modules, for example. As may be appreciated, engineering considerations for the site where the building will be situated must be considered, including adequate support in lower modules for modules on upper floors, local codes, and so forth. However, assuming local codes are generally known, numerous components may be fabricated and modules contemplated and provided to the site in a manner that requires no further on site engineering for issues such as structural support, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> diagrammatically illustrates standard modules <b>150</b> and standard panels <b>120</b> as repeatable components for use in accordance with one embodiment of the present design. The present design may configure vertical panels <b>130</b> to realize structural walls <b>131</b>, nonstructural walls <b>132</b>, and braced frames <b>133</b>. Similarly, the present design may configure horizontal panels <b>140</b> to realize a roof <b>141</b>, deck <b>142</b>, intermediate floor <b>143</b>, or a lower floor <b>144</b> as standard components.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In general, each of these panels may need to conform to certain requirements and desires. As may be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, structural wall <b>131</b> may take the form of a panel that is generally rectangular in shape such that it can fit with other panels as well as modules, and each panel typically includes infrastructure. With respect to conforming to certain requirements, as an example, structural wall <b>131</b> must have the ability to bear weight, while nonstructural wall <b>132</b> has no such requirement. Further, the amount of load that is to be borne by the structural wall <b>131</b> will dictate the composition of the wall. Further, different design materials may be employed as desired or appropriate&#x2014;for example, a lower floor <b>144</b> in one structure where a subfloor is employed and a wood floor installed thereon may be of different construction from a lower floor where a slab is employed and slate flooring with radiant heating contemplated. Thus while generally standard panels are employed, different constructions of these standard panels may be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In order to further produce standard repeatable components, the present design may involve building blocks <b>190</b> as standard components for configuring and constructing upper <b>160</b>, mid <b>170</b>, and lower <b>180</b> standard modules. The building blocks <b>190</b> or module types may include but are not limited to stairs <b>191</b>, kitchens <b>192</b>, built-ins <b>193</b> (wall units, wet bars, etc.), master bathrooms <b>194</b>, bathrooms <b>195</b>, or studios <b>196</b>, where a studio combines a combined kitchen and bath.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">By limiting designers (architects) to a relatively general set of pre-engineered standardized module and panel components, the present design may enable the production of superstructures from components that provide cost and schedule benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Designers benefit from knowing the final design arrangement before initiating construction, based on the ability to pre-position multiple interconnected pre-defined modules and panels. Architects have knowledge that employing known modules, panels, and components will yield a structurally suitable building that meets local code requirements at a competitive price and schedule.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one example of a horizontal panel <b>140</b> embodied as a standard component intermediate floor panel <b>143</b> for use in accordance with one embodiment of the present building construction system <b>110</b>. The intermediate floor panel <b>143</b> design illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may integrate functional elements within the floor panel infrastructure during construction at the factory. Intermediate floor panel <b>143</b> may include but is not limited to cement board(s) <b>211</b> for thermal insulation, plywood sheathing <b>212</b> providing shear strength, radiant heat tubing <b>213</b> for heating, micro-duct air supply <b>214</b> for ventilation and air-conditioning, floor framing <b>215</b> for load bearing strength, and plywood sheathing <b>216</b> to enclose the bottom and providing a member to attach framing <b>215</b>. The finished product is intermediate floor panel <b>143</b> as shown, generally ready for shipping to the building site with other panels, modules, and components.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present design typically involves rules to govern the design and construction of each prefabricated module and/or panel. The present design's rule based system may produce an efficient, i.e. limited, set of standard repeatable panels through a process of establishing and selecting from the present design's rule set. The present design may establish rules to modify the characteristics, for example the structural material and/or dimensions, of intermediate floor panel <b>143</b> to form additional standard components such as deck <b>142</b> and roof panels <b>141</b>. For example, a designer may wish to add a moisture barrier to the outside facing surface of intermediate floor panel <b>143</b> and form lower floor panel <b>144</b> component. Rules enable addition of decking material to the outside facing surface to form a standard deck panel <b>142</b>, or addition of a roofing membrane applied to the outside facing surface to form a standard roof panel <b>141</b> component.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary vertically oriented panel <b>130</b> embodied as a standard component structural wall panel <b>131</b> for use with the present hybrid building construction system <b>110</b>. The structural wall panel <b>131</b> design illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may integrate functional elements within the panel infrastructure during construction at the factory. Structural wall panel <b>131</b> may include but is not limited to cement board(s) <b>311</b> for thermal insulation, interior finish <b>312</b> providing living space surface, structural framing <b>313</b> for load and shear strength, structural panel <b>314</b> for attaching structural framing <b>313</b>, HVAC duct <b>315</b> enabling ventilation and air flow, plumbing and electrical spaces or components <b>316</b> for provisioning services, nonstructural cavity furring <b>317</b> for supporting plumbing, electrical, HVAC ducting, etc, and an exterior cladding panel <b>318</b> for protection from exposure and elements. The present design may involve a braced frame panel <b>133</b> where the construction material is steel as opposed to wood as found in similar standard components. The building construction system <b>110</b> may arrange braced frames <b>133</b> to add a standardized structural strength component for use with modules <b>150</b> and panels <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present building construction system for prefabricating horizontal and vertical panels, such as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may produce standard, repeatable components in combination with assembly and production methods configured to accommodate mobile delivery of said panels. The present design may reduce costs and time to realize a superstructure at an on-site location.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present design typically employs rules governing the design and construction of each structure and module. The present rule based system may produce an efficient, generally limited, set of standard repeatable modules arranged as design components by architects for creating unique superstructures. For example, the building construction system <b>110</b> may have a limit to the number of available module types.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary standard mid-level module <b>170</b> for use in the present building construction system <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a mid-level module <b>170</b> comprising three functional building blocks <b>190</b>: a kitchen <b>192</b>, a master bathroom <b>194</b>, and a stair block <b>191</b> located in between the kitchen and bath building blocks. In one embodiment, the number of module types may be limited. For example, the present design may set the number of module types to three, such as upper, mid, and lower levels as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The module types produced by hybrid building construction system <b>110</b> may also be limited, such as to use of three specific types of building blocks based on certain considerations. In this example, to form the desired module <b>150</b>, the architect may configure the joining of three standard building block <b>190</b> types, or sub-modules. The building construction system <b>110</b> may establish a set of rules to indicate permissible building blocks and block locations for each standard module type, or module level. An exemplary &#x2018;rule-set&#x2019; illustrating permissible building block <b>190</b> types for each module type is shown in Table 1 for one embodiment of the present design.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to Table 1, the exemplary rules for the upper level <b>160</b> excludes the use of stairs <b>191</b> and studios <b>196</b> from upper level module designs. The building construction system <b>110</b> design rules presented in Table 1 permit kitchens <b>192</b>, built-ins <b>193</b>, master bath <b>194</b>, and bathroom <b>195</b> for use in designing an upper level <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The present design may involve establishing where individual functional building block <b>190</b> types may be located within each standard module <b>150</b>. For example, in order to achieve superstructure designs that exhibit efficient airflow, the present design may indicate that for all mid-level <b>170</b> and lower level <b>180</b> modules, a block <b>190</b> type of stairs <b>191</b> must be located in the center position or slot, and a rule may indicate that no block <b>190</b> type may be located in the center position for all upper level <b>160</b> standard module designs. By selecting and affecting this requirement for the center portion, or middle slot, of each standard module <b>150</b> is always reserved for circulation. Thus architectural designs rendered using the building construction systems <b>110</b> modules <b>150</b> when produced according to the rule set described above will produce superstructures affording efficient HVAC systems.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The present design may establish a set of rules to manage the size and dimensions for modules and panels. For example, structural wall panel <b>131</b> may be configured for lengths of sixteen or twenty feet, where non-structural wall panel <b>132</b> may only be configured in twelve or fourteen foot lengths. Additional requirements may establish the modules in terms of, for example, mandating an end-to-end alignment configuration for certain modules or panels while specifically excluding side-to-side alignments.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The hybrid building construction system <b>110</b> is not limited to the examples disclosed and may involve any aspect of prefabricating and assembling standard components for use in constructing complete superstructures. The present design may involve rules for directing the number of allowable types, such as painted or stained, of interior finishes available for use in constructing modules and panels. In a similar manner, rules may be established for directing installation of a watertight membrane onto a roof panel or tile onto a floor panel. In another example, the present design may establish rules for directing door and window placement and size.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The present design's building construction system <b>110</b> for prefabricating standard horizontal and vertical panels, categorizing modules by type, and assigning permissions to each building block type indicating allowable locations within the module may produce an efficient set of standard reusable components to realize superstructure and their associated infrastructure functional elements configured for mobile delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present designs building construction system for prefabricating upper, mid, and lower level modules illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as standard reusable design components in combination with repeatable building construction system methods and accommodating mobile delivery of said modules may reduce costs and time to realize a superstructure at an on-site location.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In general, four phases are employed in the current design, the last phase being assembly of the structure, including interlocking pieces, providing any special or nonstandard pieces in the final structure, and performing desired tasks such as waterproofing that are not recommended or desired to be performed at the factory.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Before construction and shipping pieces to the construction site, three general phases are employed: establishing choices for designers, selecting components for the structure (design), and fabrication. The phases may take place at different times or concurrently, and it is to be understood that a single set of modules is not the only fixed design choice, but new and revised modules, panels, components and other infrastructure are being added or modified at all times. Thus while certain pieces may be being fabricated or prepared for shipping to a site, new pieces may be concurrently being created or contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 7</figref> illustrate aspects of these three pre-shipping phases. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, point <b>501</b> establishes the possible modules that may be offered, such as a kitchen, bath, bedroom, dining area, and so forth. Within these, multiple modules may be provided, such as kitchen modules <b>1</b> through <b>6</b>. The result is a list of possible modules that may be employed. Point <b>502</b> establishes interconnection rules between modules for the list of possible modules, such as kitchen <b>1</b> can be placed on a first floor but not a second floor, if bathroom <b>2</b> is provided next to master bedroom <b>4</b>, a space for a double door is available, or if bedrooms <b>3</b> and <b>7</b> are desired, a hallway must be offered between the rooms. Engineering considerations are factored in at this point and throughout the points shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and building codes are considered based on anticipated installation. The result is a listing of possible modules and interconnection rules between modules. Point <b>503</b> employs the results of points <b>501</b> and <b>502</b> and selects or considers possible panel options that may be provided. In the case of a needed hallway or alcove between areas, panels may be offered that create the hallway. Also, panels used to make the possible modules may be offered, such as kitchen <b>1</b> with hard wood flooring above a subfloor may employ panels G, K or W as flooring panels, panels P, Q, and R as wall panels, and panel B as ceiling panels. Various panels may be offered as desired or necessary to realize the possible modules and interconnections therebetween, again with engineering and building codes considered. The result of point <b>503</b> is a set of possible modules, panels, and interconnection rules that may be offered to a designer.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Point <b>504</b> proceeds with establishing components, which may be used in the panels and modules, again considering engineering and building code requirements. The point of considering engineering and building code considerations along the way is so that a designer will not pick a module, panel, or component or complete design that is not engineered properly nor built to code. At this point, connections between panels, modules, and even components may be established, and infrastructure may be considered. For example, if the structure is to be located in a cold climate, the necessary insulation spacing should be provided for at this point. Other infrastructure, such as structural, plumbing, electrical, and so forth is considered at this point and again available to the designer. Point <b>505</b> is an optional function wherein additional specialized components may be considered. For example, if a six car garage is desired, provisions and/or modules may be provided. If a module is to bear a significant load, such as an extensive water load on the floor for an extremely large fish tank, or a large waterbed, such a module may be considered and offered. Other specialized modules, panels, and components may be offered as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The result of point <b>504</b> or <b>505</b> is a list of available possible modules, panels, components, infrastructure, and interconnection rules, engineered and having building code considerations integrated. The complete listing can be offered to designers as a catalog or simply a listing of what may be commissioned and built before construction or assembly begins.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the functions performed once the catalog or list of available or possible modules, panels, components, infrastructure, and interconnection rules are established. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the designer/architect may sit down with the owners or another party and decide on the general layout or desired floorplan of the structure. The architect or designer may then select from among the available modules, panels, and components for the desired structure at point <b>601</b>. Point <b>602</b> represents the question of whether changes are required, wherein changes may be to standardized possible modules, panels, or components, or nonstandard uncontemplated modules, panels, or components, such as increasing ceiling height, for example. Point <b>603</b> indicates changes are considered, either by the architect, owner, or by the party responsible for offering the module, panel or component. If changes are available, considering engineering and building code factors as well as fabrication concerns, the specialized module, panel, or component may be offered. If unavailable, the designer or architect may need to consider another design. If changes are not required, i.e. if the structure can be fabricated from available modules, panels, or components or permissively altered pieces, interconnections may be considered and established to the extent this has not already been done. Such issues regarding interconnections are considered at point <b>604</b>, and these interconnections may be as large as areas between modules, such as between a kitchen and a living area spaced 10 feet away, to simple interconnections between panels, such as between a ceiling panel and an adjacent ceiling panel in a different area.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The goal at this point is to lay out or establish as much of the complete structure as possible using standardized, modified, or approved modules, panels, and/or components. If interconnections between modules or interconnections between panels are required that are nonstandard or uncontemplated, as evaluated at point <b>604</b>, then at point <b>605</b> the interconnections are considered, again by either the responsible party commissioning the structure, the architect, designer, or the party offering the modules, panels, or components. If specialized pieces or changes to existing modules, panels, or components are achievable to provide interconnections between modules and/or panels, then such interconnections can be offered or established at point <b>605</b>, again having considered engineering and building code issues. If such interconnections are not possible, such as they would violate local building codes, other options would need to be considered. The end result of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a floorplan, and a listing of modules, panels, and components that will be required to construct a structure conforming to the floorplan. Certain specialized items may be necessary, but the listing of modules, panels, and components would include those items that can be fabricated ahead of construction, even possibly before breaking ground at the site.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> represents a flowchart of occurrences subsequent to establishing a floorplan and list of modules, panels, and components and before shipping items to the site, in general the fabrication process necessary. It is to be understood that certain modules, panels, or components may exist that may be employed, but the term &#x201c;fabrication&#x201d; or &#x201c;fabricate&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> contemplates providing the necessary items either by procuring or producing such items in some manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> generally represents the fabrication or production/procurement process. Point <b>701</b> calls for fabricating components as needed based on the floorplan and list. Point <b>702</b> calls for fabricating panels based on the floorplan and list from components and any other necessary materials. Point <b>703</b> calls for fabricating modules based on the floorplan and list from panels, components, and any other necessary materials. The end result is a completed set of modules, panels, and components transportable to the site collectively or in partial shipments that enable personnel on site to produce the structure, save for any specialized nonstandard components and joining materials or items, or items that cannot be pre-provided, such as exterior coatings that must be provided to the entire structure.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an alternate flowchart illustrating a hybrid building construction system <b>800</b> process flow for off-site factory prefabrication and on-site field assembly activities for constructing a superstructure. The hybrid building construction system <b>800</b> may be used to produce pre-defined standardized, based on architectural plans, modules and panels in a factory configured for efficient field assembly, i.e. at the on-site location. Factory construction and assembly of prefabricated modules and panels may involve assembling of structural frames. Structural frames may involve, for example, a top plate and bottom plate with studs or joists attached within to form the initial wood framework for the present designs modules and panels.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The present design may arrange structural frames to allow mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and other infrastructure systems to connect between panel-to-panel, panel-to-module, and module-to-module. The hybrid building construction system <b>800</b> may configure the assembly for structural frames to realize standardized modules and panels. The following example describes factory assembly and production of such structural frames in accordance with an aspect of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Factory assembly begins at point <b>810</b> and may involve the construction and assembly of structural frames at point <b>811</b>. The present design may install the HVAC ducting system at point <b>812</b> within the structural frame arrangement. The plumbing system at point <b>813</b> may then be installed within the structural frame followed by the electrical system at point <b>814</b>. After the infrastructure functional elements of the frame are completed, factory assembly may connect the exterior surface substrate, i.e. cladding, at point <b>815</b> to the structural frame such that a waterproofing layer may be applied or attached (not shown). Exterior panels may be positioned for fastening to one another at the building site by integrating pre-arranged lapping and waterproofing functional elements.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">To complete the factory assembly process at point <b>819</b>, the building construction system may involve installing insulation at point <b>816</b> and panel connection hardware at point <b>817</b>. Panel connection hardware may include but is not limited to mechanical, non-permanent clips and fasteners to position and hold the interior finish panel to the structural frame. The standard panels and modules assembly required to construct a building system in accordance with the present design are completed at point <b>819</b>, ending the factory assembly phase and are ready for transport to the on-site building construction location.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The present design may use the same structural frame construction technique for producing and assembling the hybrid building construction system panels and modules. The present design may realize standardized modules by arranging a plurality of structural frames configured to form each side of the module.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Field assembly may begin at point <b>820</b> with assembling the first or bottom floor level at point <b>821</b>. The building construction system <b>800</b> first floor assembly may position and place modular structures at point <b>822</b> at their pre-defined location as indicated by the building architectural plans. The present design may test at point <b>823</b> to determine if additional modules remain. If additional modules require field assembly, the building construction system may return and position additional modules, looping through process steps at point <b>822</b> and <b>823</b> until all modules have been positioned. After placing the modules, the panels are ready for installation and assembly. The present design may assign an assembly order for systematically installing the panels starting with the bottom floor. The panel assembly may begin with positioning at point <b>824</b> and fastening into place to connect and install each panel at point <b>825</b> in a pre-determined order by moving around the bottom floor.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the situation where an infrastructure functional element within one standard component must be mated, joined, or connected to another standard component, the present design may involve using the manufacturer's recommendation or in accordance with existing code requirements. For example, if the electrical system requires panel-to-panel or panel-to-module connectivity, on-site labor may involve assembling the connection using conventional means such as positioning a junction box for each spliced connection. Each wiring home run originating from intra panel and module electrical switches, outlets, and lights may terminate in a junction box as required at the factory. Similarly, all plumbing supply limes, drains, and stack pipes contained within the modules and panels may connect using convention methods, for example solder if copper pipe connections, or glue for plastic pipe connections. Other activities may involve lapping the interior walls were a vertical seam is formed between two or more joined panels, involving side-to-side and top-over-bottom lapping techniques in accordance to the interior finish manufactures directions and specifications. Exterior walls may be lapped in accordance with the exterior surface manufactures directions.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Once the bottom floor installation of modules and panels is completed, the next floor is assembled. The assembly of each subsequent floor may involve the same process of placing the modules first, followed by positioning and attaching the associated panel components of the construction system. The present design may test at point <b>826</b> to determine if additional panels remain ready for installation. If additional panels require field assembly, the building construction system may return and position additional panels, looping through process steps at points <b>824</b> through <b>826</b> until all panels have been positioned and associated infrastructure elements interconnected. The present design may test at point <b>827</b> to determine if additional levels or floors remain ready for installation. If additional levels require field assembly, the building construction system <b>800</b> may return and assemble additional levels, looping through process steps at point <b>821</b> through <b>827</b> until all floors have been assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The top floor modules and panels may be configured to position a plurality of roofing panels at point <b>828</b> to the modular structure to form a watertight seal. The watertight membrane within each roof panel may be connected to each other using a gasket or pressure seal technique to waterproof the superstructure. After all the roof panels are connected and installed at point <b>829</b>, the field assembly activities are complete at point <b>830</b> and the building is ready for inspection and occupancy.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">By the foregoing description, an improved system and method for complete off-site prefabrication of mobile standardized building components configured for on-site assembly that minimizes on-site activities and associated effort have been described. The improved system and method may be suitable for efficient production and assembly of the various system standard components by efficiently scheduling use of skilled staff in combination with hybrid construction methods. In addition, improving the scheduling of staff may improve overall build quality by ensuring the proper skill is available when required during the off-site prefabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The foregoing description of specific embodiments reveals the general nature of the disclosure sufficiently that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and/or adapt the system and method for various applications without departing from the general concept. Therefore, such adaptations and modifications are within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments. The phraseology or terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation. Centralized production in a controlled environment can eliminate delay due to weather, allows use of jigs and certain automated tools for various tasks and trades, and reduces construction waste.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Hence the present design comprises a method for providing standardized components usable for constructing a building structure. The design comprises establishing a set of design choices for potential building structure pieces, wherein building structure pieces comprise at least one subset of the building structure, such as modules, panels, and/or components as described. The design further includes enabling a designer to select from the set of design choices, wherein the designer can establish a floorplan and a listing of desired building structure pieces based on the set of design choices and providing desired building structure pieces (modules, panels, and/or components) based on the listing of desired building structure pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In other words, the present design is a method for hybrid building construction that comprises establishing a list of available standardized module and panel components, said standardized module and panel components usable to construct a building structure, establishing a listing of desired standardized module and panel components usable to construct a specific building structure design providing standardized components at an off-site location in accordance with said specific building structure design, providing the standardized components to a site for assembly, and assembling standardized components on-site in accordance with said specific building structure design.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Alternately, the present design may be considered to comprise a method for constructing building structures, comprising establishing a set of standardized modules selectable by a designer for assembly into various building structures, enabling the designer to select standardized modules from the set of standardized modules for assembly into a desired floorplan, and providing at least one standardized module selected by the designer at an off-site location for use in constructing a building structure according to the floorplan.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The present design also provides a method for providing standardized modular elements usable to construct a building. The method comprises defining a set of allowable functional building block configurations, wherein the set of allowable functional building block configurations is divided into assembly levels, defining allowable configurations and allowable interactions for each allowable functional building block configuration usable in a building configuration, and producing standardized modular elements based on the allowable configurations and allowable interactions for a desired building configuration. Fabricated standardized modular components are provided at an off-site location and employed in a building at an on-site location.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Alternately, the method for constructing a building comprises establishing a set of predetermined standardized modular components for building a structure, the set of standardized modular components conforming to fabrication and assembly rules for individual standardized modular components. The set of standard modular components are constructable to accommodate predetermined infrastructure functional elements therein. The method further comprises providing the set of predetermined standardized modular components from the establishing to an individual contemplating building a desired structure, thereby enabling the individual to select from among individual standardized modular components to construct the desired structure.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The design presented herein and the specific aspects illustrated are meant not to be limiting, but may include alternate components while still incorporating the teachings and benefits of the invention, namely a building construction system enabling off-site prefabrication of standardized modules and panels to form a complete superstructure without need for on-site centric construction efforts. While the invention has thus been described in connection with specific embodiments thereof, it will be understood that the invention is capable of further modifications. This application is intended to cover any variations, uses or adaptations of the invention following, in general, the principles of the invention, and including such departures from the present disclosure as come within known and customary practice within the art to which the invention pertains.</p>
