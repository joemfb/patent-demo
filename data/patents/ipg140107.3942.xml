<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A solid-state imaging apparatus including a plurality of pixels each including: a first holding portion for holding signal carriers from a photoelectric conversion portion; an amplifying portion for amplifying and reading a signal based on the signal carriers generated in the photoelectric conversion portion; and a carrier discharging control portion for discharging charge carriers in the photoelectric conversion portion to an OFD region, and having a carrier path between the photoelectric conversion portion and the first carrier holding portion, in which the solid-state imaging apparatus further includes a second carrier holding portion electrically connected with the first carrier portion in parallel through a first transfer unit, when viewed from an output node of the photoelectric conversion portion, thereby smoothing an movie imaging without causing discontinuous frame while suppressing generation of noise mixing into the charge carrier holding portion.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a solid-state imaging apparatus and, in particular, a solid-state imaging apparatus provided with pixels, each of which has a charge carrier holding portion capable of an electronic shutter operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, as a solid-state imaging apparatus provided with pixels, each of which has a charge carrier holding portion capable of an electronic shutter operation, there is known configurations disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 2006-262070 and 2006-246450.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2006-262070 discloses a configuration which has a shutter controller to perform switching between a first mode of transferring charge carriers of a photodiode to a power supply and a second mode of transferring charge carriers generated in the photodiode to a capacitor through a MOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2006-246450 discloses a configuration which transfers a part of charges generated in a photoelectric conversion portion to a charge carrier accumulating region at a part of a photoelectric conversion period.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, in the case of a configuration which transfers a signal carrier generated in a photoelectric conversion period to a charge carrier accumulating region during a photoelectric conversion period as is described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 2006-262070 and 2006-246450, the following problems may occur: Reading out a signal based on charge carriers held in the charge carrier accumulating region to a common output line is line-sequential. In this case, holding charge carriers in the charge carrier accumulating region is required until a scanning unit selects a pixel and reads out a signal at the common output line. In launching light into the photoelectric conversion portion under such a state, a charge may be moved into the charge carrier accumulating region. When such a charge carrier movement occurs, noise occurs because a charge carrier generated during a different period from a basic photoelectric conversion period is mixed. Because the charge carrier mixing amount varies with the time held in the charge carrier accumulating region, noise appears as image shading and is visually recognized with ease. The noise is unpreferable for image quality.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing problems, it is an object of the present invention to suppress noise mixing into a charge carrier accumulating region, for example, in a configuration which transfers charge carriers to a charge carrier accumulating portion during a photoelectric conversion period.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the present invention, there is provided a solid-state imaging apparatus including a plurality of pixels each including: a photoelectric conversion portion; a first holding portion for holding signal carriers from the photoelectric conversion portion; an amplifying portion for amplifying and reading a signal based on the signal carriers generated in the photoelectric conversion portion; and a carrier discharging control portion for controlling an electrical connection between the photoelectric conversion portion and an overflow drain region, in which a carrier path between the photoelectric conversion portion and the first holding portion is formed in a buried channel structure, and in which a second holding portion is arranged through a first transfer portion between the first holding portion and the amplifying portion.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in accordance with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(First Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a solid-state imaging apparatus according to the present embodiment and illustrates 6 pixels, however, the solid-state imaging apparatus may be configured to have a plurality of more pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The photoelectric conversion portion <b>101</b> illustrates a photodiode herein as an example. The output node O-node is an output node of the photoelectric conversion portion. The charge carrier transfer portion <b>102</b> is configured to transfer a signal carrier generated in the photoelectric conversion portion <b>101</b> to a circuit element at a subsequent stage. The first charge carrier holding portion <b>103</b> is configured to hold a signal carrier generated in the photoelectric conversion portion. The first transfer portion <b>104</b> is configured to transfer a signal carrier held in the first charge carrier holding portion to a circuit element at a subsequent stage. The second charge carrier holding portion <b>105</b> is configured to hold a signal carrier transferred from the first charge carrier holding portion through a first transfer portion. The second transfer portion <b>106</b> is configured to transfer a signal carrier held in the second charge carrier holding portion to a circuit element at a subsequent stage.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The input node <b>107</b> is an input node of an amplifying portion to be described later and is configured to hold a signal carrier to be transferred through a second transfer portion from a second charge carrier holding portion. The input node can use, for example, a floating diffusion region (FD region) distributed to a semiconductor substrate. The resetting portion <b>108</b> is configured to supply a reference voltage to the input node <b>107</b> of the amplifying portion. The amplifying portion <b>109</b> amplifies a signal based on a signal carrier transferred to the FD region and reads the amplified signal to the outside. As an example, there is a source follower circuit using a MOS transistor. The amplifying portion may use such a configuration that a gate of the MOS transistor and the FD region are electrically connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The selection portion <b>110</b> is configured to select each pixel and read the selected pixel to the outside for each pixel or for each pixel row. The charge carrier discharging control portion <b>111</b> is capable of discharging charges of the photoelectric conversion portion <b>101</b> and may use, for example, a MOS transistor as the photoelectric conversion portion. In this case, the carrier discharging control portion is configured in such a manner that a semiconductor region having the same polarity as a signal carrier constituting a part of the photoelectric conversion portion is taken as a source and a semiconductor region (overflow drain region: OFD region) supplied with a power supply voltage is taken as drain.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each of the transfer portion, the resetting portion, the selection portion and the charge carrier discharging control portion may use a MOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention is characterized by a structure of a charge carrier path between the photoelectric conversion portion and the charge carrier holding portion. The charge carrier transfer portion is configured to transfer a charge from the photoelectric conversion portion to the first charge carrier holding portion under a state in which a voltage causing the charge transfer portion to be in a non-conduction state is supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, as a concrete configuration, the charge carrier transfer portion is of a MOS transistor. The MOS transistor constitutes a buried channel structure. This configuration includes a portion in which an energy barrier is positioned to be lower in a portion deeper than a surface even under a non-conduction state. In this case, the charge carrier transfer portion can also keep a constant voltage to be in a supplied state without any positive control. Specifically, a stationary potential barrier may be provided without need of having a function serving as the transfer portion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Such a configuration allows most of signal carriers generated by photoelectric conversion when light is launched into the photoelectric conversion portion to be transferred to the first charge carrier holding portion without any accumulation in the photoelectric conversion portion. Accordingly, the photoelectric conversion portion included in all pixels allows charge carrier accumulating time to be unified. When the MOS transistor is in a non-conduction state, a hole is stored in a channel surface and a channel to which charge carriers are transferred exists in a portion at a predetermined depth from the surface and therefore an adverse effect of a dark current can be suppressed at an insulation film interface.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">From another viewpoint, during a period in which the photoelectric conversion portion and the charge carrier holding portion accumulate signal carriers, it may be said that a potential of a charge carrier path between the photoelectric conversion portion and the charge carrier holding portion is lower than that of a charge carrier path between the photoelectric conversion portion and an OFD region. The potential used herein is a potential for a signal carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">From the viewpoint of drive, a charge carrier moved to the first charge carrier holding portion from the photoelectric conversion portion during one exposure period is held in the first charge carrier holding portion and used as an image signal. Specifically, it may be said that after start of one exposure period by the photoelectric conversion portion, a signal is read out to the pixel outside without any reset operation of the charge carrier holding portion. One exposure period used herein refers to the one determined in common by the each photoelectric conversion portion when a one-frame image is taken.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, the solid-state imaging apparatus according to the present embodiment is configured in such a manner that the plurality of charge carrier holding portions are connected in parallel to the respective photoelectric conversion portions when viewed from an output node of the photoelectric conversion portion through the transfer portion. Such a configuration is effective, particularly to a case where the photoelectric conversion portion, the charge carrier holding portion and the charge carrier path therebetween are in a state described above. Description of the advantages of the configuration of the present embodiment will be made, as a comparative example, on a case where moving image shooting is performed in a configuration having only one charge carrier holding portion relative to the photoelectric conversion portion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">During a period at which light is launched into the photoelectric conversion portion as described above, a predetermined amount of signal carriers generated by photoelectric conversion move from the photoelectric conversion portion to the charge carrier holding portion. However, the charge carrier holding portion may have a state where a signal carrier of a previous frame is held. This is because the signal carrier is required to be held for a fixed period by the charge carrier holding portion until a selection operation is performed for reading out to the outside for each pixel row. When a signal carrier generated by the photoelectric conversion portion is mixed into the charge carrier holding portion under such a state, the mixed charge is a signal carrier generated during a period which is not an original exposure period (a charge of a following frame), which causes a noise. To prevent the charge which is a cause for a noise from being mixed into the charge carrier holding portion, during a period at which the charge carrier holding portion is holding a charge, the charge carrier discharging control portion requires to discharge a signal carrier generated by the photoelectric conversion portion to an OFD region. Hence, mixing of a charge into the charge carrier holding portion can be inhibited. However, if such an operation is performed, such a state where image information is missing will be made during a period at which a charge carrier is being discharged from a charge carrier discharging control portion. Therefore, a moving image tends to be taken with discontinuous frame in performing moving image shooting.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">On the other hand, in a configuration of the present embodiment, installation of a plurality of charge carrier holding portions (a first and a second charge carrier holding portions) in the photoelectric conversion portion allows continuous moving image shooting. Specifically, during a period at which the photoelectric conversion portion and the first charge carrier holding portion hold a signal carrier generated by the photoelectric conversion portion, the second charge carrier holding portion can hold a charge until a pixel row is sequentially selected.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate a top view and a sectional view of a solid-state imaging apparatus according to the present embodiment, respectively. Portions having similar functions to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> have the same reference numerals/characters and detailed description will not be repeated. In the top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, each region is rectangular for easy description, which indicates that each configuration is not always rectangular and, in the region, at least the each configuration is disposed. Other embodiments are applicable in the same way. Only one pixel is illustrated, however, such a plurality of pixels is disposed to constitute a pixel region.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present embodiment, within the same pixel, the first charge carrier holding portion <b>103</b> is disposed in a first direction (right-hand in Figure) relative to the photoelectric conversion portion <b>101</b>. The FD region <b>107</b> is arranged in a second direction (downward in Figure) orthogonal to the first direction, relative to the first charge carrier holding portion <b>103</b>. Such a configuration allows reduction in layout.</p>

Description will be made on only three rows herein, however, the present invention is applicable to a case of more than three rows by repeating the driving pattern and is highly active.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">First, a state where a first frame accumulating period is completed and the second charge carrier holding portion is holding a first frame signal carrier is taken as an initial state.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">First, a pulse which keeps the second transfer portion of each pixel row to be in an electrical connection state is supplied in the order of &#x3a6;<b>311</b>(<i>n</i>), &#x3a6;<b>311</b>(<i>n+</i>1) and &#x3a6;<b>311</b>(<i>n+</i>2) and thereby the charge carrier held by the second charge carrier holding portion is transferred to an input portion of an amplifying portion and the selection portion is brought into an electrical connection to read out a signal to the outside. This is a first frame reading-out operation.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a driving method of the present embodiment will be described below. Each supply pulse is a pulse supplied to each control electrode in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>. The suffix &#x201c;n&#x201d; is the number of pixel rows, where a unit constituted by disposing a plurality of units including two photoelectric conversion portions perpendicularly adjacent to each other in a horizontal direction is taken as one pixel row. Use of a plurality of more rows is applicable by repeating the driving pattern, which is highly active.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">First, as an initial state, a first-frame signal is accumulated in the second charge carrier holding portion <b>703</b><i>b</i>. In this state, by bringing &#x3a6;<b>311</b> into electrical connection for each pixel row, the charge carrier held by the second charge carrier holding portion is transferred to an input portion of the amplifying portion. By bringing a selection portion into electrical connection, a signal is read out to the outside. This is a first-frame reading-out operation. Description will be made on &#x3a6;<b>312</b> supplied to a charge carrier discharge control electrode during a first-frame reading-out period. &#x3a6;<b>312</b><i>a</i>, that is, a charge carrier discharging control portion adaptable to a first photoelectric conversion portion is in a non-conduction state, while &#x3a6;<b>312</b><i>b</i>, that is, the charge carrier discharging control portion adaptable to a second photoelectric conversion portion is in an electrical connection state. Specifically, the signal carrier generated by the first photoelectric conversion portion is in a usable state as an image signal, while the signal carrier generated by the second photoelectric conversion portion <b>701</b><i>b </i>is in a discharging state to an OFD region. The signal carrier generated by the first photoelectric conversion portion <b>701</b><i>a </i>is used as a second-frame image signal. Next, when first-frame signal reading-out has been completed after lapse of a predetermined time with &#x3a6;<b>311</b>(<i>n+</i>2) in a non-conduction state, &#x3a6;<b>309</b><i>a </i>is brought into electrical connection in a collective manner and charge carriers of the first photoelectric conversion portion <b>701</b><i>a </i>are transferred to the first charge carrier holding portion <b>703</b><i>a</i>. Subsequently, a charge carrier discharging control portion <b>312</b><i>a </i>adaptable to the first photoelectric conversion portion <b>701</b><i>a </i>is brought into electrical connection. Because all charge carrier discharging control portions are in an electrical connection state, the signal carrier generated during this period is discharged to the OFD region. By bringing &#x3a6;<b>313</b> into electrical connection after lapse of a predetermined period, a charge carrier of the first charge carrier holding portion <b>703</b><i>a </i>is transferred to the second charge carrier holding portion <b>703</b><i>b</i>. At this time, &#x3a6;<b>309</b><i>b </i>is also concurrently brought into electrical connection. Subsequently, by sequentially bringing &#x3a6;<b>311</b> into electrical connection, a charge carrier is transferred to the input portion of the amplifying portion. By bringing the selection portion into electrical connection, a signal is read out to the outside. This is a second-frame reading-out operation. During a period at which &#x3a6;<b>311</b> is sequentially brought into electrical connection, &#x3a6;<b>309</b> and &#x3a6;<b>312</b><i>a </i>are brought into electrical connection in order. This operation can determine accumulating periods of the first photoelectric conversion portion <b>701</b><i>a </i>and the first charge carrier holding portion <b>702</b><i>a</i>. Specifically, it is sufficient to change a timing for bringing &#x3a6;<b>309</b> and &#x3a6;<b>312</b><i>a </i>into electrical connection, depending upon an accumulating period of each frame. Continuous implementation of such operations allows moving image shooting.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a driving operation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, shooting is made, using a signal carrier generated by at least either one of the two photoelectric conversion portions.</p>

With &#x3a6;<b>312</b> kept in a non-conduction state, charges are accumulated, using the first and the second photoelectric conversion portions and the first charge carrier holding portion. By bringing &#x3a6;<b>309</b> into electrical connection in a collective manner after lapse of predetermined period, charge transfer is made from the photoelectric conversion portion to the first charge carrier holding portion and concurrently &#x3a6;<b>312</b> is brought into electrical connection and the charge generated by the photoelectric conversion portion is discharged to the OFD region. By sequentially bringing &#x3a6;<b>311</b> into electrical connection, a signal based on the signal carrier generated by the second photoelectric conversion portion is read out. When &#x3a6;<b>313</b> has been brought into electrical connection after completion of the reading-out, &#x3a6;<b>311</b> is sequentially brought into electrical connection again to read out a signal based on the signal carrier generated by the first photoelectric conversion portion. A driving method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> provides higher-quality shooting than in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> because signals of all the photoelectric conversion portions are available. Accordingly, the driving method is suitable, particularly in performing still image shooting.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a solid-state imaging apparatus according to the present embodiment and illustrates 4 pixels, however, the solid-state imaging apparatus may be configured to have a plurality of more pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The photoelectric conversion portion <b>801</b> illustrates a photodiode as an example. The output node O-node is an output node of the photoelectric conversion portion. The first and the second charge carrier transfer portion <b>802</b>, <b>803</b> are configured to transfer a signal carrier generated in the photoelectric conversion portion <b>801</b> to a circuit element at a subsequent stage. The charge carrier discharging control portion <b>804</b> is capable of discharging charges of a photoelectric conversion portion <b>801</b> and may use, for example, a MOS transistor as the photoelectric conversion portion. In this case, the carrier discharging control portion is configured in such a manner that a semiconductor region having the same polarity as a signal carrier constituting a part of the photoelectric conversion portion is taken as a source and a semiconductor region (overflow drain region: OFD region) <b>805</b> supplied with a power supply voltage is taken as drain.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The first and the second charge carrier holding portions <b>806</b>, <b>807</b> are configured to hold a signal carrier generated in the photoelectric conversion portion. The first and the second charge transfer portion <b>808</b>, <b>809</b> are configured to transfer charges held by the first and the second charge carrier holding portions to a circuit element at a subsequent stage. The input node <b>810</b> is an input node of an amplifying portion to be described later and is configured to hold charges to be transferred through the first and the second transfer portions from the first and the second charge carrier holding portions. The input node can use, for example, a floating diffusion region (FD region) distributed to a semiconductor substrate. The resetting portion <b>811</b> is configured to supply a reference voltage to the input node <b>810</b> of the amplifying portion. The amplifying portion <b>812</b> amplifies a signal based on a signal carrier transferred to the FD region and reads out the amplified signal to the outside. As an example, here is a source follower circuit using a MOS transistor. The amplifying portion may use such a configuration that a gate of the MOS transistor and the FD region are electrically connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The selection portion <b>813</b> is configured to select each pixel and read the selected pixel to the outside for each pixel or for each pixel row.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Each of the transfer portion, the resetting portion, the selection portion and the charge carrier discharging control portion may use a MOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The present embodiment is characterized by a structure of a charge carrier path between the photoelectric conversion portion and the first and the second charge carrier holding portions. The present embodiment is configured to transfer a charge from the photoelectric conversion portion to the first and the second charge carrier holding portions with such a voltage as to cause the first and the second charge transfer portions to be in a non-conduction state being supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, as a concrete configuration, the charge carrier transfer portion is of a MOS transistor. The MOS transistor constitutes a buried channel structure. This configuration includes a portion in which an energy barrier is positioned to be lower even under a non-conduction state. In this case, the charge carrier transfer portion can also keep a constant voltage to be in a supplied state without any positive control. Specifically, a stationary potential barrier may be provided without need of having a function serving as the transfer portion.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Such a configuration allows most of signal carriers generated by photoelectric conversion when light is launched into the photoelectric conversion portion to be transferred to the first charge carrier holding portion without any accumulation in the photoelectric conversion portion. Accordingly, the photoelectric conversion portion included in all pixels allows charge accumulation time to be unified. When the MOS transistor is in a non-conduction state, a hole is accumulated in a channel surface and a channel to which a charge current is transferred exists in a portion at a predetermined depth from the surface and therefore an adverse effect of a dark current can be suppressed at an insulation film interface.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">From another viewpoint, during a period in which at least one of the photoelectric conversion portion and the first and the second charge carrier holding portions accumulate signal carriers, it may be said that a potential of a charge carrier path between the photoelectric conversion portion and the charge carrier holding portion is lower than that of a charge carrier path between the photoelectric conversion portion and an OFD region. The potential used herein is a potential for a signal carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">From the viewpoint of drive, a charge moved to at least either one of the first and the second charge carrier holding portions from the photoelectric conversion portion during one exposure period is held and used as an image signal. Specifically, it may be said that after start of one exposure period by the photoelectric conversion portion, a signal is read out to the outside of a pixel without any reset operation of the charge carrier holding portion. One exposure period used herein refers to the one determined in common by the each photoelectric conversion portion when a one-frame image is taken.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, detailed description will be described on a relationship between respective configurations in one pixel. In the present embodiment, the plurality of charge carrier holding portions are provided for one photoelectric conversion portion <b>801</b> and charge holding is performed, using charge carrier holding portions different for each frame, thus attaining continuous moving image shooting.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the same way as the embodiments described above, such a configuration is effective, particularly for a case where the photoelectric conversion portion, the charge carrier holding portion and the charge carrier path therebetween are in such a state as described above. Description of the advantages of the configuration of the present embodiment will be made, as a comparative example, on a case where moving image shooting is performed in a configuration having only one charge carrier holding portion relative to the photoelectric conversion portion.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">During a period at which light is launched into the photoelectric conversion portion as described above, a predetermined amount of signal carriers generated by photoelectric conversion move from the photoelectric conversion portion to the charge carrier holding portion. However, the charge carrier holding portion may have a state where a signal carrier of a previous frame is held. This is because the signal carrier is required to be held for a fixed period by the charge carrier holding portion until a selection operation is performed for reading out to the outside for each pixel row. When a charge generated by the photoelectric conversion portion is mixed into the charge carrier holding portion under such a state, the mixed charge is a charge generated during a period which is not an original exposure period (a charge of a following frame), which causes a noise. To prevent the charge which is a cause for a noise from being mixed into the charge carrier holding portion, during a period at which the charge carrier holding portion is holding a charge carrier, the charge carrier discharging control portion requires to discharge a signal carrier generated by the photoelectric conversion portion to an OFD region. Hence, mixing of a charge into the charge carrier holding portion can be inhibited. However, if such an operation is performed, such a state where image information is missing will be made during a period at which a charge carrier is being discharged by the charge carrier discharging control portion. Therefore, a moving image tends to be taken with discontinuous frame.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">On the other hand, in a configuration of the present embodiment, installation of a plurality of charge carrier holding portions (a first and a second charge carrier holding portions) in the photoelectric conversion portion allows continuous moving image shooting. Specifically, during a period at which charges generated by the photoelectric conversion portion are held by the photoelectric conversion portion and the first charge carrier holding portion, the second charge carrier holding portion can hold charges until a pixel row is sequentially selected.</p>

With a conduction pulse being supplied to &#x3a6;<b>804</b>, the 3rd-frame accumulation is started by supplying a non-conduction pulse to &#x3a6;<b>804</b>, a second pulse to &#x3a6;<b>803</b> and a non-conduction pulse to &#x3a6;<b>809</b> after supplying a first pulse to &#x3a6;<b>803</b> and a conduction pulse to &#x3a6;<b>809</b>, respectively. By supplying a second pulse to &#x3a6;<b>803</b>, a charge carrier path in the second charge transfer portion exists in a region buried inside a substrate at a predetermined distance from a surface (Buried channel).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Repeating this operation allows moving image shooting. As described above, the accumulating period of each frame can be set as needed from conduction periods of &#x3a6;<b>104</b> and &#x3a6;<b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, description will be made on a drive method appropriate to still image shooting. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example used as an image signal by adding charges held by the first and the second charge carrier holding portions. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a ternary pulse was supplied to &#x3a6;<b>802</b>, &#x3a6;<b>803</b>, however, a binary pulse may be used in this example. For description, a first pulse and a second pulse are taken in descending order of pulse height.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">First, a first pulse is supplied to &#x3a6;<b>802</b> and &#x3a6;<b>803</b> and a conduction pulse is supplied to &#x3a6;<b>808</b>, &#x3a6;<b>809</b> and &#x3a6;<b>804</b>. Subsequently, a second pulse is supplied to &#x3a6;<b>802</b>, &#x3a6;<b>803</b> and a non-conduction pulse is supplied to &#x3a6;<b>808</b>, &#x3a6;<b>809</b> and &#x3a6;<b>810</b>. This operation allows the photoelectric conversion portion, the first charge carrier holding portion and the second charge carrier holding portion to store a signal carrier. After lapse of a predetermined accumulating period, a first pulse is supplied to &#x3a6;<b>802</b>, &#x3a6;<b>803</b> and a signal carrier left in the photoelectric conversion portion is transferred to the each charge carrier holding portion. Subsequently, by bringing &#x3a6;<b>804</b> into electrical connection, a charge of the photoelectric conversion portion is discharged to the OFD region. By bringing the resetting portion (not illustrated) into electrical connection, a reference voltage is supplied to the FD region. Subsequently, by concurrently bringing &#x3a6;<b>808</b>, &#x3a6;<b>809</b> in the same row into electrical connection, addition of a signal carrier is made in the FD region and a signal is read out to the outside. According to the reading-out method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, particularly during still image shooting, shooting can be made with a more expanded dynamic range.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Driving methods in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> can be used by switching, for example, in switching moving image shooting and still image shooting.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As described above, according to the present embodiment, even in such a configuration that a signal carrier moves to and is accumulated in the charge carrier holding portion during an exposure period, shooting by electronic shutter operation can be performed without causing any break in a shooting period.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> and <b>12</b> illustrate an equivalent circuit diagram of a solid-state imaging apparatus according to the present embodiment. The difference from the first embodiment is that an output node of a first photoelectric conversion portion is electrically connectable with a plurality of charge carrier holding portions through a transfer portion. That is, a first charge carrier holding portion provided corresponding to a second photoelectric conversion portion can be used as a second charge carrier holding portion of the first photoelectric conversion portion. In the present embodiment, one set of operations is made in two pixel rows and a charge generated by the photoelectric conversion portion in one row is always discharged though an OFD.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> and <b>12</b>, there are the first photoelectric conversion portions <b>501</b><i>a</i>, <b>1201</b><i>a </i>and the second photoelectric conversion portions <b>501</b><i>b</i>, <b>1201</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">A ternary pulse can be supplied to &#x3a6;<b>1202</b><i>a</i>, &#x3a6;<b>1214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, respectively. During a first-frame reading-out period and during the subsequent frame or a second frame accumulating period, a first-frame signal is held in the second charge carrier holding portion and a second-frame signal is held in the first charge carrier holding portion. Accordingly, a third pulse is supplied to &#x3a6;<b>1202</b><i>b</i>, &#x3a6;<b>1214</b> and is strongly turned off and hence a charge carrier will not flow into the second charge carrier holding portion. On the other hand, a second pulse is supplied to &#x3a6;<b>1202</b><i>a </i>and hence a charge carrier generated by the photoelectric conversion portion flow into the first charge carrier holding portion. During this period, a pulse is sequentially supplied to &#x3a6;<b>1208</b><i>b </i>for each row and a charge carrier of the charge carrier holding portion is transferred to the FD region.
