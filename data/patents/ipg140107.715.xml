To this end, the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> includes an assistant water supply line <b>31</b> connected to one side of the water supply line <b>22</b> connected to the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> to allow water to be additionally supplied to the tub <b>11</b> without passing through the detergent supply device <b>19</b>, an assistant water supply valve <b>32</b> provided to the assistant water supply line <b>31</b> to control additional supply of water to the tub <b>11</b>, and a detergent liquid input valve <b>33</b> to control the detergent liquid of a high concentration in the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> to be supplied by an amount required for generation of the bubbles having the predetermined concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The assistant water supply valve <b>32</b> is a three-way valve that can control a direction of the water such that the water is supplied to the detergent supply device <b>19</b> or the assistant water supply line <b>31</b> through the water supply line <b>22</b>. The assistant water supply valve <b>32</b> adjusts a supplying direction of water in such a way that, after a small amount of water (that is, an amount of water capable of forming the detergent liquid of the high concentration by dissolving the detergent of the detergent supply device <b>19</b>) is supplied once into the detergent supply device <b>19</b> at an initial water supplying stage, the water is directly supplied into the tub <b>11</b> through the assistant water supply <b>31</b> along with the detergent liquid formed in the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b>, in order to form the detergent liquid in the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> by dissolving the detergent of the detergent supply device <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The washing machine of the invention further includes a drying device <b>40</b> to dry the laundry (clothes). The drying device <b>40</b> includes a drying fan <b>41</b> on the tub <b>11</b>, a drying duct <b>42</b> connected between an outlet <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the drying fan <b>41</b> and an air induction port <b>45</b> formed on the opening <b>14</b> of the tub <b>11</b>, and a condensing duct <b>43</b> mounted on the rear side of the tub <b>11</b> and connected between an air discharge port <b>46</b> formed at a lower portion of the rear side of the tub <b>11</b> and an inlet <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the drying fan <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The drying device <b>40</b> includes a drying heater <b>44</b> positioned inside the drying duct <b>42</b> to supply hot air into the tub <b>11</b>, and a condensing device positioned on the condensing duct <b>43</b> to allow vapor generated when drying the clothes to be condensed and removed while the vapor passes through the condensing duct <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The condensing device includes a cold water injection nozzle <b>53</b> positioned at an upper portion inside the condensing duct <b>43</b> to inject cold water into the condensing duct <b>43</b>, and a cold water supply line <b>54</b> connected to the water supply device <b>20</b> to supply the cold water to the cold water injection nozzle <b>53</b>, and a cold water valve <b>55</b>. With this structure, the condensing device enables an improvement in dehumidification effect to increase a contact area between humid air rising from a lower portion of the condensing duct <b>43</b> and the cold water by allowing the cold water from the cold water injection nozzle <b>53</b> positioned at the upper portion to flow to the lower portion of the condensing duct <b>43</b> along an inner surface of the condensing duct <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The washing machine of the invention further includes a water draining device <b>50</b> to drain water inside the tub to the outside. The water draining device <b>50</b> includes a drainage line <b>51</b> connected to a lower surface of the tub <b>11</b> to guide the water from the tub <b>11</b> to the outside, and a drainage pump <b>52</b> provided to the drainage line <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The washing machine of the invention further includes an air supply device <b>60</b> to wash the laundry in the rotational drum <b>12</b> by use of the bubbles. The air supply device <b>60</b> includes an air motor <b>61</b> positioned below the tub <b>11</b> to supply air, an air supply line <b>62</b> to transfer the air supplied from the air motor <b>61</b>, and a porous member <b>63</b> positioned at an end of the air supply line <b>62</b> to disperse the air. After being generated by the air motor <b>61</b>, air is dispersed through the porous member <b>63</b> via the air supply line <b>62</b>, and generates air bubbles in the detergent water as a mixture of detergent liquid and water, generating bubbles, so that the laundry can be washed only with the bubbles within the rotational drum <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, air holes <b>64</b> are formed through the tub <b>11</b> in which the air supply device <b>60</b> is positioned, and allows air to flow from the air supply device <b>60</b> into the tub <b>11</b> therethrough so that the air is induced into a space between the tub <b>11</b> and the rotational drum <b>12</b> after being dispersed through the porous member <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing the construction of a controller for the washing machine according to the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the washing machine further includes a signal input unit <b>100</b>, a temperature detection unit <b>110</b>, a dry detection unit <b>120</b>, the controller <b>130</b>, and a driving unit <b>140</b> in addition to the devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With the signal input unit <b>100</b>, it is possible to input operation information, such as washing courses (for example, bubble washing course or general washing course), washing temperatures, spin-drying RPM, additional rinsing, etc., which can be selected by a user according to kinds of laundry, to the controller <b>130</b>. In a bubble washing course, selected information such as bubble concentration is input to the controller <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The temperature detection unit <b>110</b> serves to detect the temperature of water supplied into the tub <b>11</b>, and the dry detection unit <b>120</b> serves to detect a dried state of laundry through detection of the temperature and humidity of the laundry.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The controller <b>130</b> is a microcomputer which can control the washing machine according to operation information inputted from the signal input unit <b>100</b>, and stores an RPM and operation rate of a motor and a washing period, which are set depending on a washing load (weight of laundry) in a selected washing course.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The controller <b>130</b> controls a motor <b>13</b>, the water supply device <b>20</b>, and the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> to achieve an optimum washing effect while reducing damage of texture of the laundry by controlling supply amounts of water and detergent liquid together with generation of the bubbles upon the bubble washing operation, controlling the RPM and operation rate of the motor according to the washing load, and by controlling the bubble concentration according to a contaminated degree of the laundry.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition, the controller <b>130</b> controls the RPM of the motor or driving of the water supply device <b>20</b> or drying device <b>40</b> to effectively remove the bubbles after the bubble washing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The driving unit <b>140</b> drives the motor <b>13</b>, washing heater <b>16</b>, water supply valves <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>, assistant water supply valve <b>32</b>, detergent liquid input valve <b>33</b>, drying fan <b>41</b>, drying heater <b>44</b>, drainage pump <b>52</b>, air motor <b>61</b>, etc. in response to driving control signals from the controller <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">There will be described hereinafter operation and advantageous effect of the washing machine constructed as above and the control method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The control method of the washing machine according to the present invention is to allow the washing machine to proceed a general washing course to wash general laundry and a bubble washing course to wash delicate laundry (for example, wool or silk which requires a delicate washing operation) through a bubble washing operation. The signal input unit <b>100</b> of the washing machine includes buttons with which a user can select the washing courses.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the overall procedure of the control method of the washing machine to perform the bubble washing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">With laundry inputted into the rotational drum <b>12</b>, operation information such as a washing course (bubble washing or general washing), a washing temperature, a spin-drying RPM, additional rinsing, etc. is selected according to a kind of laundry, and inputted to the controller <b>130</b> through the signal input unit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The controller <b>130</b> determines whether or not the selected washing course is a bubble washing course in response to an input of the operation information from the signal input unit <b>100</b> (S<b>200</b>), and controls the washing machine to perform the same general washing course as that of a conventional technique if it is determined that the selected washing course is not the bubble washing course (S<b>210</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the selected washing course is the bubble washing course, the controller <b>130</b> receives information about a washing load (weight of the laundry) of the rotational drum <b>12</b> (S<b>300</b>), and sets an amount of water, an RPM and operation rate of the motor (on-off time of the motor), and a washing period based on the received information about the load (S<b>400</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Then, the controller <b>130</b> allows the washing machine to perform a wash cycle via generation of bubbles with the set RPM, operation rate and washing period (S<b>500</b>), and to perform a bubble removing cycle to effectively remove the bubbles remaining in the rotational drum <b>12</b> after the bubble washing operation (S<b>600</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As for the wash cycle via the generation of the bubbles, the bubbles act as a cushion for friction between the laundry, and reduce damage of texture of laundry due to the friction between the laundry and a strong water stream. In addition, a high detergent concentration of the bubbles enables dirt on the laundry to be effectively removed with only a small amount of water, thereby reducing energy consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">After performing the wash cycle via generation of the bubbles and the bubble removing cycle, rinsing and spin-drying cycles set corresponding to the load are performed (S<b>700</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, there will be described the process (S<b>500</b>) of performing a wash cycle via generation of bubbles with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a detailed flow chart illustrating the wash cycle of the washing machine, in which the wash cycle is performed using bubbles.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When a bubble washing course is selected, the controller <b>130</b> controls the water supply device <b>20</b> to allow a small amount of water required for dissolving detergent to be supplied into the detergent dissolving apparatus <b>30</b> through the detergent supply device <b>19</b> via the water supply valve <b>24</b> and the water supply line <b>22</b>. At this time, the detergent in the detergent supply device <b>19</b> is input along with the water into the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> while being dissolved by the water so that detergent liquid (that is, water with the detergent concentrated therein) is contained in the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> (S<b>502</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Then, the controller <b>130</b> controls the detergent liquid input valve <b>33</b> to allow the detergent liquid in the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> to be supplied into the tub <b>11</b> through the water supply nozzle <b>26</b> via the connection line <b>25</b> (S<b>504</b>), while controlling the assistant water supply valve <b>32</b> to allow the water to be supplied into the tub <b>11</b> through the connection line <b>25</b> and the water supply nozzle <b>26</b> via the assistant water supply line <b>31</b> without being supplied to the detergent supply device <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As such, the control is performed in such a way that, after the small amount of water (that is, an amount of water capable of forming detergent liquid of a high concentration by dissolving the detergent of the detergent supply device) is supplied once into the detergent supply device <b>19</b> at an initial water supplying stage, the water is directly supplied into the tub <b>11</b> through the assistant water supply line <b>31</b> along with the detergent liquid in the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For better understanding of the present invention, although the detergent liquid and the water are illustrated as being sequentially supplied in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is desirable that operations of supplying the detergent liquid and the water be performed simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As the detergent liquid and the water are supplied into the tub <b>11</b>, detergent water as a mixture of detergent liquid and water is formed between the tub <b>11</b> and the rotational drum <b>12</b>. At this time, a level of detergent water is detected by the level detection unit <b>17</b>, and the controller determines whether or not the level of the detergent water is a first preset level (the maximum level of the detergent water capable of preventing water supplied into the tub from flowing into the rotational drum, and corresponding to about &#xbc; of a level of detergent water in a general washing operation; a level detected by the first level sensor) (S<b>508</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">If the level of the detergent water is not the first level, the detergent liquid and the water are continuously supplied into the tub <b>11</b> until the level of the detergent water reaches the first level, and if the level of the detergent water is the first level, the controller <b>130</b> turns off the water supply valve <b>24</b>, the assistant water supply valve <b>32</b> and the detergent liquid input valve <b>33</b> to stop supply of detergent liquid and water (S<b>510</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Then, to wash the laundry using the bubbles within the rotational drum <b>12</b>, air is supplied from the air supply device <b>60</b> to the detergent water formed of the mixture of detergent liquid and water to generate the bubbles (S<b>512</b>), followed by washing operation. At this time, the air supply device <b>60</b> generates the bubbles in such a way that, after being supplied from the air motor <b>61</b>, air is dispersed through the porous member <b>62</b> via the air supply line <b>62</b>, and is then forced into the detergent water as the mixture of detergent liquid and water through the air holes <b>64</b>, generating the bubbles.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">After being generated between the tub <b>11</b> and the rotational drum <b>12</b> via the air supply device <b>60</b>, the bubbles are supplied into the rotational drum <b>12</b> through the holes or a front section of the rotational drum <b>12</b>, and finally dispersed into the overall space of the rotational drum <b>12</b> after a predetermined period of time (about three minutes), enabling the laundry to be washed only with the bubbles within the rotational drum <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">When generating the bubbles, it is desirable that an RPM and operation rate of the rotational drum <b>12</b>, and a washing period therein be less than or equal to values set in each washing course corresponding to the load.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As such, dirt on the laundry can be effectively removed due to the high detergent concentration on the bubbles dispersed in the overall space of the rotational drum <b>12</b>. At this time, the bubbles can act as a cushion with respect to fall of the laundry and friction between the laundry caused by rotation of the rotational drum <b>12</b>, thereby preventing the texture of the laundry from being damaged due to the friction between the laundry.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Then, it is determined whether or not the wash cycle via the generation of the bubbles is completed (S<b>516</b>). If the wash cycle is completed, the process proceeds to the operation of S<b>600</b> to perform rinsing and spin-drying operations.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">If the wash cycle is not completed, the amount of detergent water is gradually reduced while the wash cycle via the generation of the bubbles proceeds. At this time, the level detection unit <b>17</b> detects a level of the lowering detergent water, and determines whether or not the level of the detergent water reaches a second preset level (the minimum level of detergent water required for generation of the bubbles; a level detected by the second level sensor) (S<b>518</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">If the level of the detergent water does not reach the second level, the process returns to the operation of S<b>512</b> to continue the washing operation via rotation of the rotational drum <b>12</b> along with generation of the bubbles until the level of the detergent water reaches the second level. When the level of the detergent water reaches the second level, the process returns to the operation of S<b>504</b> to start supply of detergent liquid and water corresponding to a reduced amount of the detergent water.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Specifically, the water supply valve <b>24</b> and the assistant water valve <b>32</b> are opened with operation of the water supply device <b>20</b>, allowing water to flow through the assistant water supply line <b>31</b> instead of the detergent supply device <b>19</b>, and then to be additionally supplied into the tub <b>11</b> through the water supply nozzle <b>26</b> via the connection line <b>25</b>. At the same time, the detergent input valve <b>33</b> is opened, allowing the detergent liquid of a high detergent concentration in the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> to be also supplied into the tub <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">That is, in the case where the amounted of detergent water is reduced due to generation of the bubbles, if only the water is supplied into the tub without supplying the detergent, it is difficult to generate the bubbles having a predetermined detergent concentration due to a reduced detergent concentration on the bubbles. Thus, the predetermined amount of detergent liquid in the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> is also supplied upon additional supply of the water.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The amount of the detergent liquid supplied from the detergent liquid supply device <b>30</b> is so determined that, when 1 drop of detergent liquid having a predetermined concentration is supplied into the tub <b>11</b>, the water is also supplied at an amount proportional to this detergent liquid. For example, assuming an amount of detergent water required by the tub <b>11</b> is 10, the controller controls the washing machine to supply 1 drop of detergent liquid and an amount of water proportional to this detergent liquid into the tub <b>11</b>, and assuming an amount of detergent water required by the tub <b>11</b> is 20, the controller controls the washing machine to supply 2 drops of detergent liquid and an amount of water proportional to this detergent liquid, that is, two times of the above case, into the tub <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As such, the control method of the present invention enables the bubble washing operation to be effectively performed always using the bubbles having the predetermined detergent concentration by allowing the predetermined amount of detergent liquid to be supplied together with additional supply of water into the tub.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Results of the wash cycle using the bubbles according to the present invention are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph depicting a shrinkage rate of laundry when washing the laundry in such a way of reducing an amount of water and supplying only bubbles at the same concentration in the same wash cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, &#x201c;conventional wool washing&#x201d; indicates a shrinkage rate of wool when a wash cycle is performed at an RPM of 25 and at an operation rate of 1 second-On and 78 seconds-OFF for a washing period of 10 minutes, &#x201c;Bubble 1&#x201d; indicates a shrinkage rate of wool when the wash cycle is performed at an RPM of 25 and at an operation rate of 1 second-On and 78 seconds-OFF for a washing period of 10 minutes as in the conventional wool washing, and &#x201c;Bubble 2&#x201d; indicates a shrinkage rate of wool when the wash cycle is performed at an RPM of 25 and at an operation rate of 2 second-On and 78 seconds-OFF for a washing period of 10 minutes, which is different from the conventional wool washing in terms of operation rate.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is found that Bubble 1 exhibits a noticeably reduced shrinkage rate of the laundry compared with the conventional wool washing, and Bubble 2 exhibits a reduced shrinkage rate of the laundry compared with the conventional wool washing in spite of its higher operation rate than that of the conventional wool washing.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph depicting a cleaning degree of contaminated laundry of 60 MU (Make Up) in terms of reflective index at the same amount (2 g, 4 g, 10 g) of detergent, comparing the case of using detergent water with the case of using bubbles, both of which have the same detergent concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the cleaning degree of the laundry through the wash cycle using the bubbles is noticeably higher than that using the general detergent water.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Next, there will be described a process (S<b>600</b>) of removing bubbles remaining in the rotational drum <b>12</b> after performing a bubble wash cycle with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a detailed flow chart showing a first cycle of the washing machine to remove the bubbles after performing the bubble wash cycle. In the first cycle, after the detergent water is drained to the outside on completion of the bubble wash cycle, a bubble removing cycle is performed to remove the bubbles remaining in the rotational drum <b>12</b> instead of directly performing a rinsing cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">After draining the water on completion of the bubble wash cycle, the bubbles are removed by intermittent spin-drying during which the motor <b>13</b> is driven at a low RPM (for example, about 400 RPM) (S<b>602</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">It is determined whether or not a preset intermittent spin-drying time (T<b>1</b>: the minimum time required to remove the bubbles in the rotational drum through the spin-drying) elapses by counting the time of driving the motor <b>13</b> at the low RPM (S<b>604</b>), and if it is determined the preset intermittent spin-drying time elapses, driving of the motor <b>13</b> is stopped (S<b>606</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a detailed flow chart showing a second cycle to remove the bubbles after the bubble wash cycle by the washing machine of the present invention. In the second cycle, after draining the detergent water on completion of the bubble wash cycle, the bubble removing cycle is performed to remove the bubbles remaining in the rotational drum <b>12</b> instead of directly entering the rinsing cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">After draining the water or when blowing air through driving of the drying fan <b>41</b> simultaneously with water drainage, the drying heater <b>44</b> is driven to supply hot air, thereby removing the bubbles (S<b>612</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">It is determined whether or not a preset driving time (T<b>2</b>: the minimum time required to remove the bubbles in the rotational drum through air or hot air-blowing) elapses by counting the time of driving the drying fan <b>41</b> or the drying heater <b>44</b> (S<b>614</b>), and if it is determined the preset driving time elapses, the driving of the drying fan <b>41</b> or the drying heater <b>44</b> is stopped (S<b>616</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a detailed flow chart showing a third cycle to remove the bubbles after the bubble wash cycle by the washing machine. In the third cycle, after draining the detergent water on completion of the bubble wash cycle, the bubble removing cycle is performed to remove the bubbles remaining in the rotational drum <b>12</b> instead of directly entering the rinsing cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">While separately or simultaneously performing the driving of the motor <b>13</b> at the low RPM and the driving of the drying fan <b>41</b> or the drying heater <b>44</b>, the water supply device <b>20</b> is controlled to inject a small amount of water in the form of spray between the rotational drum <b>12</b> and the tub <b>11</b> through the water supply line <b>26</b>, thereby removing the bubbles (S<b>622</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">It is determined whether or not a preset injection time (T<b>3</b>: the minimum time required to remove the bubbles in the rotational drum through spray injection) elapses by counting the time of injecting the water (S<b>624</b>), and if it is determined the preset injection time elapses, the spray injection is stopped (S<b>616</b>), thereby completing the bubble removing cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As apparent from the above description, the washing machine and the control method thereof according to the present invention enables laundry to be washed only with bubbles without direct contact with water so that the bubbles act as a cushion to reduce friction between the laundry, thereby preventing texture of expensive laundry (such as wool or silk) from being damaged due to the friction between the laundry and strong water stream, while allowing dirt on the laundry to be effectively removed due to a high detergent concentration on the bubbles.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In addition, the washing machine and the control method thereof according to the present invention uses a small amount of water, thereby enabling reduction in water consumption and energy consumption to heat the water, and preventing damage and deformation of the laundry when washing general laundry.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Furthermore, the washing machine and the control method thereof according to the invention can generate the bubbles having a predetermined detergent concentration through control of a water supply amount and a detergent input amount upon a bubble washing operation, and can adjust the detergent concentration on the bubbles so as to be suitable to a contaminated degree of the laundry, providing a high cleaning degree not only for a delicate washing operation but also for a general washing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Although few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.</p>
