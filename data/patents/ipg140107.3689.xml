<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Fire alarm devices such as audible horns (audible/visible or A/V), loudspeakers (speaker/visible or S/V) and visible strobes (visible only or V/O), are referred to as &#x201c;notification appliances.&#x201d; Typically, a fire alarm control panel (FACP) drives these devices over one or more &#x201c;notification appliance circuits&#x201d; (NACs) for non addressable devices or &#x201c;Signaling Line circuits&#x201d; in the case of addressable devices. The strobes are required, for example, as an alert for the hearing-impaired, or for those in a high noise environment.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A strobe device is typically made up of a high-intensity Xenon flash tube, an electronic control circuit, a terminal block to connect the device to the NAC, a housing, a strobe reflector assembly, and a transparent protective dome.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The strobe device is a notification device designed to disperse its light output in a predetermined pattern. Further, the strobe may output different colors to signal a different type of alarm. For example, an amber color output of the strobe is indicative of a mass notification output. Thus, the different colors of output light aid in providing more information to occupants of a building. In order to output the desired color, the strobe device can be fitted with a strobe cover of the desired color. However, the strobe cover adds another variable when configuring and maintaining the fire alarm system. Accordingly, a need exists to aid in configuring and maintaining strobe covers for strobes in a fire alarm system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present embodiments relate to methods and systems for determining at least one property of a strobe cover. The determined property of the strobe cover may then be analyzed to determine whether it is the proper property for the strobe device. The strobe cover may cover at least a part of a strobe device, such as at least a part of the strobe of the strobe device. The strobe cover, for example, may be a lens, a cap, or a filter (such as a filter that passes and/or removes certain wavelengths or certain wavelength bands of light). The property of the strobe cover may include the color of the strobe cover (such as clear, blue, amber, etc.), the shape of the strobe cover (such as a strobe cover with a lens or a strobe cover without a lens), the material of the strobe cover, etc. The method and system may include determining the property of the strobe cover and checking whether the determined property is the expected property of the strobe cover (such as the expected color of the strobe cover).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a strobe cover assembly is disclosed that includes a strobe cover with one or more property indicators, and a circuit including at least one element. The indicator (or indicators) on the strobe cover indicates at least one property of the strobe cover. For example, the indicator may include a color indicator (that indicates the color of the strobe cover), a shape indicator (that indicates the shape of the strobe cover), and/or a material indicator (that indicates the material of the strobe cover). The indicator on the strobe cover interfaces with the element in the circuit, such as mechanical interfaces, electrical interfaces, magnetic interfaces, or optical interfaces. The circuit may determine the property of the strobe cover (such as the color, shape, and/or material) of the strobe cover depending on the interfacing of the indicator on the strobe cover with the element in the circuit. For example, the indicator may be placed or positioned on different portions of the strobe cover, with the location of the indicator on the strobe cover signifying to the circuit the property of the strobe cover (such as signifying the color, the shape, and/or the material of the strobe cover).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, a strobe device is disclosed that includes a strobe, a controller in communication with the strobe, a strobe cover including at least one indicator, and a circuit for generating an output to send to the controller, the circuit including at least one element, the at least one element interfacing with the at least one indicator in order to generate the output indicative of the property of the strobe cover.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A system embodying one example of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The system includes one or more Signaling Line Circuits (SLCs), i.e., networks <b>16</b>, having alarm condition detectors D and alarm system notification devices A. Alternatively, the detectors and notification devices may be on separate networks. A system controller (such as a fire alarm control panel (FACP) <b>14</b>) may monitor the detectors D. When an alarm condition is sensed, the fire alarm control panel <b>14</b> may signal the alarm to the appropriate notification devices through one or more networks <b>16</b>. Notification devices may include, for example, a visual alarm (strobe), an audible alarm (horn), a speaker, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although not necessary for carrying out the invention, as shown, all of the notification devices in a network are coupled across a pair of power lines <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> that advantageously also carry communications between the fire alarm control panel <b>14</b> and the detectors D and notification devices A.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The notification devices A may be remotely programmed using the fire alarm control panel <b>14</b>. In particular, the fire alarm control panel <b>14</b> may use one or more of the following: software configuration tools; fire alarm panel displays and keypads or similar user interfaces; service port command; external computer interfaces; Internet interfaces; and modem or other remote connection interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Commands from the fire alarm panel can, for example, be multiplexed onto the device's power line, providing the added benefit that it saves the cost of additional wiring to devices. Examples of commands issued for a system with addressable notification appliances are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,697, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, the communication line to the device may be separate from the power line. The communications channel may comprise, for example, a wireless link, a wired link or a fiber optic link.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As another example, the notification devices A may be locally programmed. Specifically, the notification device A may be programmed manually (without its removal) via any of a variety of means, including but not limited to: configuring a switch on the notification device A, jumpers, optical signaling (e.g. TV remote control, blinking flashlight, light bulb or other light source, laser pointers, breaking optical beam), a magnet tapped against the device, radio frequency (RF) tags, sound signaling (e.g. ultrasonic tones, touchtones) etc.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Communication signals to and from the fire alarm control panel <b>14</b> may be multiplexed onto the device's power line, or may be on a communication line that is separate from the power line. Alternatively, a fiber optic cable link or a wireless connection can be utilized. Alternatively, or in addition, the notification device A may directly communicate with the fire alarm control panel <b>14</b> using for example, optical signaling (for example, an LED, an infrared emitter, etc.). The notification device A may also communicate using other means, such as RF tag reading or audio (e.g., ultrasonic, chirps, beeps, prerecorded or synthesized voice, etc.)</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One, some, or all of the notification devices A may comprise a strobe device. One or more of the strobe devices may be locally configured with a strobe cover. The strobe cover may, for example, be a lens or a cap. The strobe cover may also act as a filter that passes and/or removes certain wavelengths or certain wavelength bands of light, so that the strobe device transmits a particular color of light (such as an amber color, a blue color, or a white color). The strobe cover may also have one or more properties, such as the color of the strobe cover (e.g., clear, blue, amber, etc.), the shape of the strobe cover (e.g., a strobe cover with a lens or a strobe cover without a lens), the material of the strobe cover, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, the strobe cover may be one of a plurality of colors. As discussed in more detail below, the strobe cover may be installed onto the notification device A through a mechanical connection (such as by using one or more mounting tabs or mounting pins).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, further illustrating details of an embodiment of the present invention. For simplicity, the two-line network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown with a single line <b>16</b>. The fire alarm control panel <b>14</b> includes a processor <b>42</b>, a memory, <b>44</b>, a user interface and configuration software <b>12</b>, and network interface <b>46</b>. The user interface and configuration software <b>12</b> in combination with the processor <b>42</b> (or other type of controller) allows a user to program the individual strobe devices <b>30</b> on the network or communications channel <b>16</b>. The fire alarm control panel <b>14</b> connects to the network <b>16</b> via the network interface (communication connection) <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Strobe device <b>30</b> comprises a network interface <b>24</b>, a controller <b>26</b>, a strobe <b>22</b>, a memory <b>32</b>, an indicator <b>34</b>, a sensor <b>36</b>, a strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b>, and a switch <b>40</b>. The strobe device <b>30</b> connects to the network <b>16</b> via the network interface (communication connection) <b>24</b>. The controller <b>26</b>, such as a microcontroller or hardwired logic, receives commands from and sends data to the fire alarm control panel <b>14</b>. For example, the fire alarm control panel <b>14</b> may send a command to activate the strobe <b>22</b> of the strobe device <b>30</b>. As another example, the fire alarm control panel <b>14</b> may send a command to request a response from the strobe device <b>30</b>, the response including an indication of the property of strobe cover installed in the strobe device <b>30</b> (such as the color, the type, and/or the material of the strobe cover), as discussed in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When the strobe device <b>30</b> receives the command to activate the strobe <b>22</b>, the strobe <b>22</b> flashes. The strobe <b>22</b> may comprise a Xenon flash tube or an LED and drive circuitry, or other high-brightness light source. Although shown separately, the memory <b>32</b> may be integrated with the controller <b>26</b>. The indicator <b>34</b>, such as a flashing LED, may indicate a current configuration of the strobe device <b>30</b>, for example, upon command from the fire alarm control panel <b>14</b>, upon a local manual command such as a pushbutton (not shown), on a periodic basis, always, or upon some other event.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further includes a strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b>. The strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b> may provide an input to the controller <b>26</b> of one or more properties of the strobe cover installed in strobe device <b>30</b> (such as the color, the type, and/or the material of the strobe cover). The strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b> may interact with the strobe cover in order for the strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b> to determine the one or more properties of the strobe cover (such as the color, the type, and/or the material of the strobe cover). The interaction of the strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b> may comprise mechanical interaction, electrical interaction, optical interaction, magnetic interaction, or any combination thereof, as discussed in more detail below. Examples of the strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b> and the controller <b>26</b> are separate elements. Alternatively, the controller <b>26</b> may include strobe cover detection circuit functionality, with the controller <b>26</b> interfacing directly with the strobe cover.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also includes a switch <b>40</b>. The switch <b>40</b> may provide an operator a manner in which to manually input the property of the strobe cover installed in the strobe device <b>30</b> (such as the color, the type, and/or the material of the strobe cover). For example, the switch <b>40</b> may comprise a 2-way switch that includes 2 positions. A first position of the 2-way switch may indicate that the strobe cover is a first color (such as clear), and a second position of the 2-way switch may indicate that the strobe cover is a second color (such as amber). When setting up the strobe device, the operator may install the strobe cover, and may also set the 2-way switch to the appropriate setting. The controller <b>26</b> receives an input from the switch <b>40</b>, the input indicate the setting of the switch <b>40</b>. As another example, the switch <b>40</b> may comprise a 3-way switch includes 3 positions. A first position of the 3-way switch may indicate that the strobe cover is a first color (such as clear), a second position of the 3-way switch may indicate that the strobe cover is a second color (such as amber), and a third position of the 3-way switch may indicate that the strobe cover is a third color (such as blue).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes sensor <b>36</b>. Sensor <b>36</b> may comprise a light sensor for sensing one or more discrete wavelengths or one or more wavelength bands of light. In determining the color of the strobe cover, the controller <b>26</b> may command the strobe <b>22</b> to generate an output. The sensor <b>36</b> may sense the output, including sensing whether the output is at one or more discrete wavelengths or in one or more wavelength bands of light. For example, the controller <b>26</b> may control strobe <b>22</b> so that strobe <b>22</b> outputs light. The sensor <b>36</b> may thereafter sense the light after it passes through a part of the strobe cover. Or, a light separate from the strobe <b>22</b> (such as another source element) may be used to generate light to pass through the strobe cover. The sensor <b>36</b> may then detect light coming from the other source element, passing through the strobe cover (such as through the mounting tab of the strobe cover) and then to the sensor <b>36</b>. The sensor <b>36</b> may communicate the sensed output to the controller <b>26</b>, which may analyze the communicated sensed output in order to determine the color of the strobe cover. For example, the controller <b>26</b> may determine that the sensed output is only at a blue wavelength or only in the blue wavelength band. Based on this, the controller <b>26</b> may determine that the strobe cover is the color blue. As another example, the controller <b>26</b> may determine that the sensed output is at each of the sensed wavelengths or in each of the wavelength bands. Based on this, the controller <b>26</b> may determine that the strobe cover is clear.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts sensor <b>36</b>, strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b>, and switch <b>40</b>, the strobe device <b>30</b> may include only include one of those elements (such as only the sensor <b>36</b>, only the strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b>, or only switch <b>40</b>), may include two of those elements (such as the strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b> and the switch <b>40</b>), or may include all three of those elements (such as the sensor <b>36</b>, the strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b> and the switch <b>40</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side view of the strobe cover <b>50</b> and printed circuit board (PCB) electronics <b>62</b>. The strobe cover <b>50</b> may comprise a shaped upper surface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Or the strobe cover <b>50</b> may comprise a flat upper surface. The strobe cover <b>50</b> may further comprise one or more mounting tabs. The strobe cover <b>50</b> may include four mounting tabs. Alternatively, more or fewer mounting tabs may be used to affix the strobe cover <b>50</b> to a part of the strobe device <b>30</b> (such as to PCB electronics <b>62</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, illustrating a side view, depicts two mounting tabs <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> (or other type of mounting pins) on a bottom surface of strobe cover <b>50</b>. Alternatively, the one or more mounting tabs <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may be placed on a side surface of strobe cover <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">One or more of the mounting tabs <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may interface with a part of base of the strobe device <b>30</b>, such as PCB electronics <b>62</b> on an upper surface of the base of the strobe device <b>30</b>. The one or more mounting tabs <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may be part of the strobe cover, either integral with the strobe cover <b>50</b> or attached to the strobe cover <b>50</b>. In one embodiment, the one or more mounting tabs <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may mechanically interact with a portion of the base of the strobe device <b>30</b>, such as a contact on the PCB electronics <b>62</b>. The PCB electronics <b>62</b> (and the contacts on the PCB electronics <b>62</b>) may be mounted to the housing of the strobe device <b>30</b>, so that when the mounting tabs <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> mechanically interact with the contacts, the strobe cover <b>50</b> may be provided with additional structural support. The mechanical interaction of the mounting tab with the contact may comprise the mounting tab opening the contact or closing the contact. In this way, the PCB electronics <b>62</b> may be configured to monitor for a normally-open or normally-closed contact in order to determine the property of the strobe cover (such as the color, shape or type of the strobe cover), as discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Alternatively, the strobe cover may electrically interact with the PCB electronics in order for the PCB electronics to determine the property of the strobe cover (such as the color, the type, and/or the material of the strobe cover). For example, the strobe cover may have a metallic or other conductive material placed on different portions of the strobe cover in order to indicate different properties of the strobe cover (such as different colors, different types, and/or different materials of the strobe cover). The PCB electronics may include multiple sets of contacts placed in different sections of the upper surface of the PCB electronics. Each set of contacts may normally not be electrically conductive. The conductive material may electrically connect a set of contacts, such as electrically connect the two contacts in the set of contacts, thereby indicating a particular property of the strobe cover to the controller <b>26</b> (such as a particular color, a particular type, and/or a particular material of the strobe cover).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an alternate embodiment, the strobe cover may optically interact with the PCB electronics in order for the PCB electronics to determine the property of the strobe cover (such as the color, the type, and/or the material of the strobe cover). For example, the PCB electronics may include one or more optical sensors. The strobe cover may be designed such that a different property strobe cover blocks a different one of the optical sensors on the PCB electronics. In this way, the optical sensor that is blocked may indicate the property of the strobe cover (such as the color, the type, and/or the material of the strobe cover).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In still an alternate embodiment, the strobe cover may magnetically interact with the PCB electronics in order for the PCB electronics to determine the property of the strobe cover (such as the color, the type, and/or the material of the strobe cover). For example, a magnet may be placed on different portions of the strobe cover in order to indicate different properties of the strobe cover (such as different colors, different types, and/or different materials of the strobe cover). The PCB electronics may include one or more magnetic sensors (such as one or more Hall effect sensor) in order to interact with the magnet that is attached to the strobe cover. The one or more Hall effect sensors may vary its output voltage based on whether the magnet is proximate to or touching the Hall effect sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there are a plurality of contacts <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> on PCB electronics <b>62</b>. Depending on the placement of the mounting tab, the mounting tab mechanically interfaces with a different one of the contacts <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>. This is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with solid mounting tab <b>54</b> designed to interface with contact <b>60</b>, and with dashed mounting tabs <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, in which mounting tab <b>64</b> is designed to interface with contact <b>56</b>, and in which mounting tab <b>66</b> is designed to interface with contact <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Thus, the mounting tab may be placed in different locations on the strobe cover <b>50</b> to indicate a different property of the strobe cover <b>50</b>, such as a different color of the strobe cover <b>50</b>. For example, the placement of mounting tab <b>54</b> (shown in solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may indicate a clear strobe cover. When installed, the mounting tab <b>54</b> interfaces with contact <b>60</b>. And, the PCB electronics determines that if the contact <b>60</b> interfaces with mounting tab <b>54</b>, the PCB electronics may determine that the strobe cover color is clear, as discussed in more detail below. As another example, the placement of the mounting tab in position <b>64</b> (shown in dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may indicate an amber strobe cover. When installed, the mounting tab <b>64</b> interfaces with contact <b>56</b>. And, the PCB electronics determines that if the contact <b>56</b> interfaces with a mounting tab, the PCB electronics may determine that the strobe cover color is amber, as discussed in more detail below. As still another example, the placement of the mounting tab in position <b>66</b> (shown in dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may indicate a blue strobe cover. When installed, the mounting tab <b>66</b> interfaces with contact <b>58</b>. And, the PCB electronics determines that if the contact <b>58</b> interfaces with a mounting tab, the PCB electronics may determine that the strobe cover color is blue, as discussed in more detail below. In this way, the PCB electronics <b>62</b> may determine the property (such as the color) based on which of the contacts <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> interfaces with the mounting tab.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, the mechanical interaction of the mounting tab with the contact may provide mechanical support for the strobe cover <b>50</b>. For example, the mounting tab may be mechanically connected to the base unit of the strobe device by being press-fitted or snapped into the one or more contacts on the base unit. In this way, the mounting tabs may provide mechanical support to the strobe cover <b>50</b> and provide an indicator of the property of the strobe cover <b>50</b> to the PCB electronics <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref> show a view of the mounting tab and contact along section A-A (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrating the mounting tab and contact prior to contact, and with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrating the mounting tab and contact after contact. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the contact <b>60</b> is closed prior to contact with the mounting tab <b>54</b> of strobe cover <b>50</b> (e.g., the &#x201c;A&#x201d; part of the contact is electrically connected to the &#x201c;B&#x201d; part of the contact). After mechanical contact, the mounting tab <b>54</b> separates the contact <b>60</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The mounting tab may be made of a non-conductive material so that the contact <b>60</b> may be interpreted by the PCB electronics <b>62</b> as an open circuit. Alternatively, the contact may be a normally open contact. The mounting tab may be composed of an electrically conductive material so that upon contact, the mounting tab may electrically close the contact.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example of a strobe cover detection circuit in which individual dedicated comparators change state when the respective contact is closed. The contacts <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> are connected to respective pullup resistors R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b> and to inputs to the negative input of comparator <b>1</b>, comparator <b>2</b>, comparator <b>3</b>. A reference voltage (Ref) is input to the positive input of comparator <b>1</b>, comparator <b>2</b>, comparator <b>3</b>. Closing a contact changes the output of the respective comparator, which is sent to controller <b>26</b>. For example, a change in output of comparator <b>1</b> indicates to controller <b>26</b> a particular property, such as that the color of the strobe cover is clear. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a strobe cover detection circuit for detecting the color of the strobe cover. However, the circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may likewise be used to detect different properties of the strobe cover.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another example of a strobe cover detection circuit in which a single comparator monitors a group of contacts against a level shifted reference. The positive input to comparator <b>68</b> includes a reference voltage that is periodically shifted. The shifted reference voltage may be output from controller <b>26</b>. The three contacts <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> may be connected to preset voltage values (such as different voltage values of V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, and V<sub>3</sub>) and to the negative input to comparator <b>68</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a strobe cover detection circuit for detecting the color of the strobe cover. However, the circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may likewise be used to detect different properties of the strobe cover. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, contact <b>56</b> indicates interfacing with the &#x201c;clear&#x201d; mounting tab on strobe cover <b>50</b>, contact <b>58</b> indicates interfacing with the &#x201c;amber&#x201d; mounting tab on strobe cover <b>50</b>, and contact <b>60</b> indicates interfacing with the &#x201c;other colors&#x201d; mounting tab on strobe cover <b>50</b>. The controller <b>26</b> may shift the reference voltage, and then read the output to determine which of the contacts <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> are interfacing with the mounting tab. In this way, a state change of the comparator <b>68</b> indicates the property of the strobe cover <b>50</b>, such as the color of the strobe cover <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Still another example of the strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b> may include an analog to digital converter. For example, the analog voltage may be read from a circuit that includes the contacts <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, and the digital output from the A/D converter may be input to the controller <b>26</b>. As another example, the analog voltage from the circuit that includes the contacts <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> may be input directly to the controller <b>26</b>, which may include an internal A/D converter. The examples of the strobe cover detection circuit <b>38</b> are merely for illustration purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an example of a flow chart <b>70</b> in which a command is sent from FACP to the strobe to determine at least one property of the strobe cover of the strobe device. At <b>72</b>, the FACP sends a request for a report of the strobe cover property to one or more of the strobe devices. The FACP may use the processor <b>42</b> in combination with the user interface/configuration software to send the request for the report. At <b>74</b>, one or more strobe devices receive the command and poll their respective PCB (or other electronics) to determine the strobe cover property (such as the strobe cover color). Alternatively, the strobe device may probe the PCB independently, store the determined property of the strobe cover, and report the stored determined property when requested by the FACP. At <b>76</b>, the one device sends to the FACP a response to the request. The response to the FACP includes a field indicating the property of the strobe cover (such as the strobe cover color). At <b>78</b>, the FACP receives the response. The FACP may then check whether the information in the response is correct, as shown at <b>80</b>. For example, the FACP may compare the strobe cover property information (such as the strobe cover color information) in the response with historical strobe cover property information (such as historical strobe cover color information) stored in a memory, such as memory <b>44</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, of the FACP. The historical strobe cover property information stored in the memory <b>44</b> of the FACP may indicate the expected configuration of the fire alarm system (such as the expected colors of the strobe covers of one or more strobes in the fire alarm system). If the strobe cover is determined to be correct (the expected property matches the strobe cover property information sent from the strobe device), the process ends at <b>84</b>. If the strobe cover is not determined to be correct, an alert may be sent at <b>82</b>. For example, the alert may be sent to a user interface at or in communication with the FACP. The alert may also comprise an electronic communication to a device external to the FACP. The alert may indicate the error to the operator. The error may be due either to installation of an incorrect strobe cover or to improper configuration of the FACP.</p>
