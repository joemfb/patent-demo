<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to a method of analyzing integrated circuits and, more particularly, to a method for analyzing substrate noise in integrated circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, integrated circuit design includes multiple steps to ensure the operability of the designed circuit. One step may be to simulate the operation of the circuit once the layout of the circuit has been designed. One aspect of the simulation may be to determine the effects of noise, such as substrate noise, on analog portions of the circuit. The results of the simulation may indicate a need to alter or re-design the circuit to allow proper functionality in different circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An electronic design automation (EDA) tool is typically used when simulating integrated circuit. An EDA generally requires a completed circuit layout to perform the simulation and analysis. The EDA may analyze the effect of substrate noise on the circuit. Once the effects are determined, a complete re-design of the integrated circuit may be necessary to bring the functionality of the circuit within acceptable ranges. Further, multiple reiterations of the re-design process may be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, simulation using the completed layout on an EDA may require de-bugging complicated netlists. The de-bugging process may be very frustrating for a designer and may require the support of the EDA vendor. Thus, the EDA simulation is not very user-friendly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another method may be to use device models and substrate networks for noise analysis. However, this method uses simplified models based on assumptions that some effects are negligible when those effects may not be. Thus, the method generally is too simplified to accurately predict substrate noise for every circuit. Also, the substrate networks used in this method are typically very complicated which leads to complex netlists that are too specific to use for every substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is a need in the art to overcome the above stated disadvantages.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an embodiment, a method for substrate noise analysis comprises using a first processor based system, creating and simulating a circuit schematic comprising a multi-terminal model of a transistor, and thereafter, creating a layout based on properties represented in the circuit schematic and simulation results of the simulating. The multi-terminal model comprises a source terminal, a gate terminal, a drain terminal, a body terminal, and a guard-ring terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another embodiment, a method for substrate noise analysis comprises using a first processor based system, creating a circuit schematic; using a second processor based system, simulating the circuit schematic thereby resulting in simulation results; determining when the simulation results are unacceptable; upon determining when the simulation results are unacceptable, modifying a component in the circuit schematic to modify at least one property represented in the circuit schematic; and thereafter, creating a layout based on a plurality of properties represented in the circuit schematic. The circuit schematic comprises a first circuit, an aggressor circuit, and a substrate network coupling the first circuit to the aggressor circuit. The substrate network is based on physical features of an expected die size.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with a further embodiment, a method for substrate noise analysis comprises creating a circuit schematic using a first processor based system; simulating the circuit schematic using a second processor based system; obtaining data from the simulating of the circuit schematic; modifying a component based on the data from the simulating, wherein the component represents at least one of the physical properties of the expected layout; and thereafter, creating a final layout based on the modifying of the component. The circuit schematic comprises a model representing physical properties of an expected layout.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The making and using of the present embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present disclosure provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the embodiments, and do not limit the scope of the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments are described in a specific context, namely with regard to the design, simulation, and analysis of an inductor-capacitor tank voltage controlled oscillator (LC tank VCO). Other embodiments may also be applied, however, to other integrated circuits, such as a low noise amplifier (LNA), a power amplifier, etc. Embodiments contemplate simulating a pre-layout circuit with a device model as discussed herein to obtain data regarding substrate noise in an effort to make the circuit design and verification process more efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates an n-channel field effect transistor (NFET) and its equivalent multi-terminal model circuit according to an embodiment. In this embodiment, the multi-terminal model is a six-terminal model (6T). The structure comprises a gate stack with a gate electrode <b>66</b> over a gate oxide <b>64</b>. Source region <b>68</b> and drain region <b>70</b> are disposed on opposite sides of the gate stack in the substrate <b>94</b>. The source region <b>68</b> and the drain region <b>70</b> are surrounded in the substrate by a first isolation region <b>72</b>, such as a shallow trench isolation. A p+ doped body region <b>74</b> surrounds the first isolation region <b>72</b>. A second isolation region <b>76</b> surrounds the body region <b>74</b>. An n+ doped guard-ring <b>78</b> surrounds the second isolation region <b>76</b>, and a third isolation region <b>80</b> surrounds the n+ doped guard-ring <b>78</b>. A p+ doped guard-ring <b>82</b> surrounds the third isolation region <b>80</b>, and a fourth isolation region <b>84</b> surrounds the p+ doped guard-ring <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further disposed in the substrate <b>94</b> are a first p doped well <b>86</b>, a deep n doped well <b>88</b>, an n doped well <b>90</b>, and a second p doped well <b>92</b>. The n doped well <b>90</b> surrounds the first p doped well <b>86</b>, and the deep n doped well <b>88</b> underlies the first p doped well <b>86</b> and adjoins the surrounding n doped well <b>90</b>. The second p doped well <b>92</b> surrounds the n doped well <b>90</b>. Accordingly, the n doped well <b>90</b> and the second p doped well <b>92</b> may act as guard-rings to aid in the suppression in the effects of noise.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The schematic and circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> may be formed in an electronic file using a processor based system, i.e. a computer, running design software, such as one of the products from Cadence&#xae;. The schematic may be represented by and comprise a SPICE netlist. Each component of the schematic in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> may be a subcircuit comprising another netlist. For example, the LC tank VCO <b>200</b> may be a subcircuit that represents one of the circuits in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C through 3I</figref>. The LC tank VCO <b>200</b> may further comprise other subcircuits comprising even more netlists. The multi-terminal model <b>210</b> and/or <b>212</b> may be described in a subcircuit netlist in order to represent the physical properties of the device and thus the equivalent circuit, like described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The substrate network <b>202</b> may also be represented by multiple netlists where each netlists includes a representation of some variation of a physical component. For example, each netlist may alter the electrical properties of the substrate network <b>202</b> to represent different distances between the LC tank VCO <b>200</b> and the aggressor circuit <b>204</b>, different dopant concentrations of the substrate, different dopant types, or any combination of these characteristics. This may help model effects of different guard-ring structures. These schematics and circuits may be formed before the integrated circuit layout is designed, such that the circuit is said to be a pre-layout circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The circuit in the electronic file may then be simulated in a processor based system, such as a computer, running simulation software, again such as one of the products from Cadence&#xae;. If multiple substrate network <b>202</b> netlists are used, each netlist may be simulated separately.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">From the simulation, data may be obtained to determine the noise resulting in the circuit. The data may be represented in a plot, such as the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or tabular in nature. The data may be obtained by analyzing an output signals from the circuit during the simulation. By analyzing this signal, the substrate noise may be predicted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of a plot of the magnitude of the signal for a particular frequency range at one terminal of the circuit. Peak <b>300</b> is the desired carrier frequency to be generated by the LC tank VCO. Peaks <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are spurs caused by substrate noise and a subsequent mixing step. In this example, the spurs are approximately &#x2212;47.1 dBc (decibels relative to the carrier).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">If the noise is at too high of a level, features of the device may be modified in order to reduce the noise, such as the width of a guard-ring, a spacing, doping concentrations, depths of a guard-ring, or the like. If the noise is not too high, no modification may be needed. If multiple substrate network <b>202</b> netlists are simulated, the modification may be made by merely choosing a device represented by a netlist that has noise that is not too high.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an example of how changing features of the device may reduce substrate noise. The y-axis is the magnitude of decibels relative to the carrier of the spurs, and the x-axis is the distance, in micrometers, between the LC tank VCO <b>200</b> and the aggressor circuit <b>204</b>, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Line <b>350</b> is the resulting noise as measured in decibels relative to the carrier for give distances between the LC tank VCO <b>200</b> and the aggressor circuit <b>204</b> with only an intrinsic silicon substrate, i.e. without any doping, and line <b>352</b> is the resulting noise with a p+ doped guard-ring between the LC tank VCO <b>200</b> and the aggressor circuit <b>204</b>. As can be seen from the graph, as the distance increases, the magnitude of the decibels relative to the carrier of the spurs increases, thus decreasing the noise.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Different connections to a transistor device in the LC tank VCO <b>200</b> may also be simulated to determine desirable connections of the transistor device for a give application. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> lists the results of simulations when a transistor device modeled by the 6T model has different connections. &#x201c;6T&#x201d; indicates the sixth terminal, i.e. the p guard-ring terminal <b>62</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. &#x201c;5T&#x201d; indicates the fifth terminal, i.e. the n guard-ring terminal <b>60</b>. &#x201c;4T&#x201d; indicates the fourth terminal, i.e. the body terminal <b>58</b>. The rows below the 4T, 5T, and 6T indicate connections, directly or indirectly, to each respective terminal for a simulation. The &#x201c;A&#x201d; indicates a connection to the aggressor circuit <b>204</b>, the &#x201c;V&#x201d; indicates a connection to the positive power supply VDD, the &#x201c;F&#x201d; indicates a floating state, &#x201c;VSS&#x201d; indicates a connection to a negative power supply VSS, and &#x201c;Source&#x201d; indicates a connection to the source of the transistor. The other three columns indicate the power ratio of the VCO output tone, the highest level noise spur, and the level of the spur relative to the VCO output tone.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">With a modified device, if needed, an entire circuit layout may be designed and verified using known techniques in the art. With the substrate noise analysis being accomplished before the layout design, the verification process may be simplified by reducing complications in the prior art netlists and re-design time when the substrate noise is too high. Further, this substrate noise analysis considers all of the effects of the substrate noise by use of the above multi-terminal equivalent circuit models such that the simulation can more accurately predict the effects of substrate noise. Also, the impacts of VDD/VSS bounce are included within the model.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once the layout has been verified, it may be implemented using standard semiconductor processing techniques, such as lithography, ion implantation, deposition, and etching. Thus, the layout may be used to realize a semiconductor chip with low substrate noise.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart of an embodiment. In step <b>505</b>, a pre-layout circuit schematic is created, for example, by creating an electronic file on a processor based system running design software. The electronic file may comprise netlists representing the pre-layout circuit schematic or individual components of the pre-layout circuit schematic. The pre-layout circuit schematic may comprise components such as an aggressor circuit, like an inverter, coupled to another desired circuit, such as an LC tank VCO, through a substrate network. In this configuration, the aggressor circuit may cause substrate noise during simulation.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an exemplary process for creating a pre-layout circuit schematic in step <b>505</b>. In step <b>605</b>, a multi-terminal model for a device in the pre-layout circuit schematic is created. This may comprise creating a netlist representing the multi-terminal model of the device, where the netlist includes characteristics of the device based on physical features of the device. For example, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the netlist may comprise resistors based on the substrate features, such as sheet resistance, doping type, doping concentration, distances, spacings, depths, or the like, and may comprise diodes at p-n junctions. The netlist may indicate that the resistors and diodes are coupled to nodes in a manner similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. Further, the terminals of the multi-terminal model may comprise or consist of a gate terminal, a source terminal, a drain terminal, a body terminal, a p+ guard-ring terminal, and an n+ guard-ring terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In step <b>610</b>, a substrate network coupling the desired circuit to an aggressor circuit is modeled to represent the substrate effects of a possible represented layout. This may comprise creating a netlist representing the substrate network. For example, the netlist may comprise a first resistor coupled between a node that couples the desired circuit and an interior node, a second resistor coupled between a node that couples the aggressor circuit and the interior node, a third resistor coupled between the interior node to an inductor, and the inductor further coupling ground. Thus, the netlist may represent a &#x3c4;-configuration for the substrate network, like the network illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Further, step <b>610</b> may comprise creating multiple netlists where each netlist varies in some manner from the others. For example, a network represented by a single netlist may vary a single physical characteristic of the substrate from other netlists such that the representative components of the network are varied accordingly. Further, each netlist may vary multiple physical characteristics of the network. For example, netlists may represent varying doping concentration of a guard-ring, varying distances or spacings between the desired circuit and the aggressor, and/or varying types of guard-rings. Any combination of physical characteristics may be varied within any netlists.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In step <b>615</b>, the pre-layout circuit is created by using the multi-terminal model netlist and the substrate network netlist. For example, these can be configured in a pre-layout circuit netlist in a similar manner as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in step <b>510</b>, the pre-layout circuit schematic is simulated, for example, by using a processor based system running simulation software. The desired circuit's output may be analyzed in the frequency domain to determine the magnitude, in dBm, of the frequency components of the output. For example, if the desired circuit is an LC tank VCO, the LC tank VCO may be simulated at a particular tuning voltage that results in a desired carrier frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step <b>515</b>, data from the simulation is obtained. The data may be a frequency domain plot of an output signal indicating the magnitude of the frequency components. Referring back to the LC tank VOC example, the output of the LC tank VCO may be analyzed to determine the magnitude of the carrier frequency with respect to other frequency components of the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In step <b>520</b>, the data obtained in step <b>515</b> is analyzed to determine whether noise indicated by the data is acceptable. For example, the noise may be acceptable if a spur is less than some threshold of decibels relative to the carrier (dBc), whereas the noise may be unacceptable if it is equal to or greater than the threshold. If the noise not acceptable, in step <b>525</b>, a component or components of the device that was represented by the multi-terminal model or of the substrate network are modified. The component that is modified may be modified in any manner to reduce the noise, for example, by widening a guard-ring, increasing the depth of a guard-ring, increasing the distance of the guard-ring from the active device, and the like. Also, if netlists were used that represented variations to different components, the device represented by a netlist that had an acceptable noise may be used for the subsequent layout design. Thus, physical features may be modified in a manner that reduces noise to an acceptable level.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After step <b>525</b> or after step <b>520</b> if the noise is acceptable, in step <b>530</b>, a layout for the circuit is designed with the chosen physical components and features obtained and/or simulated in the multi-terminal model(s). This may be accomplished using a processor based system running circuit layout design software. In step <b>535</b>, the layout is verified using a processor based system running verification software, such as an EDA. In step <b>540</b>, the circuit layout is physically implemented by known semiconductor processing techniques.</p>
