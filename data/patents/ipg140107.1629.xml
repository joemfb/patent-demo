<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a game system and control method of the game system, and link system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A slot machine known as one kind of gaming machine is constituted so as to: start a game by a player inserting gaming mediums into a predetermined area of the slot machine; rearrange symbols in predetermined areas of the slot machine; and award a prize, based upon a combination of the rearranged symbols. In addition, the above slot machines are generally constituted to judge whether or not a winning combination allowed to award a prize is established, based upon whether or not a predetermined number of symbols of the same type (for example, &#x201c;CHERRY&#x201d; or &#x201c;7&#x201d;) is arranged along a preset payline. In the conventional slot machine, in a case where a predetermined number or more of symbols of the same type are arranged, it has been a common routine to award a prize, based upon the number of the aforementioned arranged symbols, regardless of the payout line.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, a bonus awarded if a combination of special symbols has been rearranged is set, and a payout referred to as a so called jackpot is awarded. In this manner, entertainability of the slot machines is enhanced. Alternatively, a probability of winning a jackpot is generally kept down, and among players, such jackpot is known as an incidentally acquirable prize.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, a plurality of gaming machines are provided which are linked via a network by a plurality of players and in which the players enjoy games while sharing a jackpot in groups. For example, International Patent WO99/03078 discloses a game system in which a plurality of gaming machines and a jackpot controller are connected via a network. In this system, the jackpot controller performs a process of selecting one of a plurality of gaming machines connected via a network, and then, changing a mode of a gaming machine selected as a feature game mode for winning a jackpot. While the jackpot controller controls gaming machines, games per se are always executed at these gaming machines.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,311,598 and 7,311,604 each disclose a game system in which: a plurality of gaming machines and a jackpot controller are interconnected via a network; and a shared jackpot payment display panel linked with layout of the gaming machines is provided. In this system, the jackpot controller selects one from among a plurality of networked gaming machines; further selects one from among various jackpot payment rates displayed on the jackpot payment display panel; and controls a jackpot payment condition for the selected gaming machine accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the abovementioned game system, a condition for winning a prize such as a jackpot is that a network connection is established; and therefore, a probability of winning a prize is identical to another one irrespective of a reserved amount of gaming mediums betted on a prize. If a player with a small reserved amount of gaming mediums betted on a prize has won a prize, other players may feel unfairness. A so-called high roller with a large number of gaming mediums betted one time greatly contributes to the large reserved amount of gaming mediums betted on a prize, and however, there is a need to employ a configuration which is not disadvantageous to such high roller or that which is not advantageous than necessary to other players who are not such high roller.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been made in view of the abovementioned circumstance, and aims to provide a game system which is capable of eliminating the feeling of unfairness in acquiring a prize commonly shared by a plurality of gaming machines by varying a probability of winning a prize.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

The word &#x201c;loser&#x201d; used herein denotes a case in which no coin payout is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">Next, an operation of the center controller <b>200</b> will be described. The CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> performs the processes at steps S<b>111</b> to S<b>117</b> that follow. First, the CPU <b>201</b> receives items of bet information and machine identification information transmitted from the slot machine <b>10</b> at step S<b>14</b> mentioned above (step S<b>111</b>). Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> receives input data from the slot machines <b>10</b>, each of which executes a standalone game independently. The items of input data include: part of the bets or side-bet(s), which are placed in the standalone game every time it is executed; and the first or second identification information for identifying types of the slot machines <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">The RAM <b>203</b> stores bet information for a progressive bonus by slot machine <b>10</b>, and the CPU <b>201</b> stores bet information in an area of the corresponding slot machine <b>10</b> of the RAM <b>203</b>, based upon identification information for identifying the types of slot machines. Further, the CPU <b>201</b> stores in a predetermined area of the RAM <b>203</b>: the first and second identification information for identifying types of slot machines <b>10</b>, the information having been transmitted from the slot machines <b>10</b> at step S<b>14</b> mentioned above; and an input data reception count.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">Next, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> performs a process of adding bet information to a progressive value (step S<b>112</b>). Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> updates a progressive value by adding thereto bet information for the progressive bonus of each slot machine <b>10</b>, the information having been stored in the RAM <b>203</b> at step S<b>111</b>. The updated progressive value is stored in the RAM <b>203</b>. For example, assuming that two slot machines <b>10</b> have participated in a progressive bonus game, if they have betted 500 and 300 progressive bets, the center controller <b>200</b> adds up these bet numbers (500+300) and stores an added-up progressive value of &#x201c;800&#x201d; in the RAM <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">Next, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> performs a process of adding up an input data count (step S<b>113</b>). Specifically, with respect to the count of receiving input data stored in the RAM <b>203</b> at step S<b>111</b> mentioned above, the CPU <b>201</b> adds up the input data count of the first or second slot machine, based upon identification information for identifying types of slot machines <b>10</b>. The RAM <b>203</b> stores the added-up input data count of the first or second slot machine. For example, if two first slot machines <b>10</b> have received 10 times and 25 times as input data counts, respectively, the center controller <b>200</b> adds up these input data counts (10+25), and then, stores the added-up value of &#x201c;35&#x201d; in the RAM <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">Next, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> performs a random determination process which will be described later referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> (step S<b>114</b>). In this random determination process, this CPU randomly determines whether or not to randomly award a progressive bonus in association with input of input data, while it is triggered that a predetermined progressive value has been reached.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">Next, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> judges whether or not a winning progressive bonus is established (step S<b>115</b>). Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> determines a slot machine <b>10</b> to which a progressive bonus is to be awarded, at step S<b>114</b>, and then, judges whether or not a winning progressive bonus is established. Upon judging that no progressive bonus win is established (step S<b>115</b>: NO), the CPU <b>201</b> terminates game processing.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">Alternatively, upon judging that a winning progressive bonus is established (step S<b>115</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> transmits a winning progressive bonus signal (step S<b>116</b>). Specifically, where the random numbers sampled at step S<b>114</b> coincide with specific numbers, the CPU <b>201</b> transmits a winning progressive bonus signal, as a winning progressive bonus, to a slot machine to which a specific number has been assigned.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">Next, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> updates a progressive value. Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> updates the progressive values stored in the RAM <b>203</b>; bet information assigned by slot machine <b>10</b>; and the values of input data counts of the first or second slot machines (step S<b>117</b>). For example, for the progressive value, the amount of prize money derived when a progressive bonus is paid out is subtracted from the progressive value stored in the RAM <b>203</b>. Further, the input data count of the first or second slot machine is cleared. Game processing is then terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">Like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flowchart showing a subroutine of a random determination process invoked and executed at step S<b>114</b> pertinent to the game processing in the center controller <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. First, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> identifies a type of slot machine <b>10</b> (step S<b>121</b>). The type of slot machine <b>10</b> is identified by means of a data table of slot machine identification information (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). This identifying process is based upon input data including the first or second identification information for identifying the type of slot machine <b>10</b> that the communication interface <b>204</b> has received every time each of the slot machines executes a standalone game independently.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">Next, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> judges whether or not a progressive value is a predetermined value (step S<b>122</b>). Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> judges whether or not one accumulative value obtained as the progressive value stored in a storage device has reached a predetermined value. Upon judging that the progressive value is not the predetermined value (step S<b>122</b>: NO), the CPU <b>201</b> terminates the random determination process.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">Alternatively, when the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> judges that the progressive value is the predetermined value (step S<b>122</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> judges whether or not the machine type is the first slot machine (step S<b>123</b>). This judgment is made based upon the first identification information included in input data pertinent to the first slot machine included in the plurality of slot machines <b>10</b>. Upon judging that the machine type is the first slot machine (step S<b>123</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> compares the first predetermined count with the input data reception count (step S<b>124</b>). Specifically, the CPU compares the first predetermined count predetermined for the first identification information with the reception count of input data received every time a standalone game is executed. This comparison is accomplished referring to the predetermined count data table, based upon the first identification information included in the first slot machine (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">Next, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> judges whether or not the reception count has reached the first predetermined count (step S<b>125</b>).

<p id="p-0397" num="0396">Alternatively, when the judgment result is affirmative (step S<b>125</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> randomly determines whether or not to award the first progressive bonus (step S<b>126</b>). Specifically, this CPU samples random number values from among those included in the predetermined numeric range by assigning specific numbers to slot machines <b>10</b> and executing programs. The CPU determines whether or not to award the first progressive bonus in comparison between the sampled random number values and the specific numbers assigned to the slot machines <b>10</b>. After this process has been completed, the CPU terminates the random determination process.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">Upon judging that the machine type is not the first slot machine (step S<b>123</b>: NO), the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> judges that the machine type is a second slot machine (step S<b>127</b>). This judgment is made based upon the second identification information included in input data pertinent to the second slot machine included in the plurality of slot machines <b>10</b>. When the judgment result is affirmative (step S<b>127</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> compares the second predetermined count with the input data reception count (step S<b>128</b>). Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> compares the second predetermined count predetermined for the second identification information, which is greater than the first predetermined count, with the reception count of input data received every time a standalone game is executed. This comparison is accomplished referring to the predetermined count data table (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>), based upon the second identification information included in the second slot machine.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">In this manner, the first predetermined count and the second predetermined count that is greater than the first one are predetermined, based upon the identification information included in the input data received from the plurality of gaming machines. Further, if the input data reception count has reached a predetermined count, a random determination process is executed as to whether or not to award a prize. Therefore, by determining a larger predetermined count of a gaming machine of a non-high roller than that of a high roller, it is possible to employ a configuration which is not disadvantageous to a high roller or that which is not more advantageous to a player who is not a high roller than necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">Next, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> judges whether or not the reception count has reached the second predetermined count (step S<b>129</b>).

<p id="p-0401" num="0400">Alternative, when the judgment result is affirmative (step S<b>129</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> randomly determines whether or not to award a second progressive bonus.

The CPU <b>201</b> determines whether or not to award the second progressive bonus in comparison between the sampled random number values and the specific numbers assigned to the slot machines <b>10</b>. After that, this CPU terminates the random determination process.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">In this manner, the predetermined count is predetermined based upon the identification information included in the input data received from the plurality of gaming machines. Further, if the input data reception count has reached the predetermined count, the random determination process is executed as to whether or not to award a prize. Therefore, a probability of winning prizes can be varied by determining the different counts of executing the random determination process, depending upon the gaming machines of high rollers or non-high rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">According to the first embodiment of the present invention, in the process of step S<b>123</b>, when it is judged that input data of the slot machine <b>10</b> fails to include the second identification information, it is possible to execute every time a random determination process as to whether or not to award a first progressive bonus every time input data is received with respect to the first predetermined count.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">In this manner, the center controller <b>200</b> executes the random determination process as to whether or not to award a second prize smaller than a first prize every time input data is received, if the input data of the second gaming machine fails to include identification information for identifying the first gaming machine. Therefore, by executing the random determination process every time input data is received, it is possible to employ a configuration which is not disadvantageous to a high roller or which is not more advantageous to a player who is not a high roller than necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">While the first embodiment of the present invention described a case of so called high-roller-oriented slot machines in which the first slot machine is smaller than the second slot machine in the number of bets placed in one standalone game and the second slot machine is greater than the first slot machine in the number of bets placed in one standalone game, the present invention is not limitative thereto. The CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> may be constituted so as to receive the second identification information as input data if the amount of bets stored as an accumulative value in the RAM <b>43</b> of the slot machine <b>10</b> has reached a predetermined count.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">While the first embodiment of the present invention described a case of adding up the first or second slot machine input data and comparing the reception count of the first or second slot machine with a predetermined count, the present invention is not limitative thereto.

For example, after two slot machines <b>10</b> have participated in a progressive bonus game, if they have placed 500 progressive bets and 300 progressive bets, the center controller <b>200</b> adds up these bet numbers (500+300), and stores the added-up progressive value of &#x201c;800&#x201d; in the RAM <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">Next, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> performs a process of adding up an input data count (step S<b>143</b>).

This adding-up is based upon the reception count of the input data that is inclusive of the first or second identification information for identifying the type of slot machine <b>10</b>, the information having been stored in the RAM <b>203</b> at step S<b>141</b> mentioned above. The added-up count of the first or second slot machine input data is stored in the RAM <b>203</b>. For example, if the input counts of the input data of the two first slot machines <b>10</b> are 10 times and 25 times, respectively, the center controller <b>200</b> adds up the counts of these input data (10+25), and then, stores the added-up value of &#x201c;35&#x201d; in the RAM <b>203</b>.</p>

The image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> is displayed, and is then changed to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, line <b>121</b> of Link <b>1</b> and line <b>123</b> of Link <b>3</b> are displayed in an expression (shaded) which is different from another one, and a message <b>131</b> &#x201c;Link <b>1</b> and Link <b>3</b> are merged!&#x201d; is displayed at the upper side of the screen, whereby a player, who has visually recognized this message display, contemplates that these two progressive links <b>150</b> are to be merged from now.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0524">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, the latest information is displayed after the jackpots <b>151</b> of the progressive links have been merged after the display of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>. In this example, the names of the progressive links, the corresponding progressive values, and the number of participants are displayed at the center of the screen in a tabulated manner; and a display <b>131</b>, which is indicative of the fact that a message &#x201c;Link <b>1</b> and Link <b>3</b> are merged, and Link <b>5</b> is newly established&#x201d;, appears at the upper side of the screen. Here, line <b>125</b> of Link <b>5</b> established when Link <b>1</b> and Link <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> have been merged is displayed in an expression (shaded) which is different from another one. Further, the progressive value and the link game count are indicated by numbers obtained after they are added up by means of merging. Here, each of the progressive values of Link <b>1</b> and Link <b>3</b> is established as 50,000. Thus, these values are added up, and the progressive value of Link <b>5</b> is established as 100,000. Further, each of the link game counts of Link <b>1</b> and Link <b>3</b> is 5,000.

A message &#x201c;Link <b>1</b> and Link <b>3</b> are merged, and Link <b>5</b> is newly established!&#x201d; is displayed at the upper side of the screen, whereby a player, who has visually recognized this message display, is aware of the fact that two links are merged, a new link is then established, and the progressive value is substantially doubled in comparison with each of the links before merged. Therefore, the player raises further expectation in obtaining the progressive value increased by means of merging.</p>

The predetermined condition is that each of the first and second progressive values has reached a predetermined value or more (for example, 50,000) and that each of these progressive values is within the preset predetermined difference (for example, &#xb1;10%). Further, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> further reads the link game count from the RAM <b>203</b>, and judges whether or not each of the first and second link games meets the preset predetermined condition.

After that, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> updates the progressive values stored in the RAM <b>203</b>, based upon the added-up progressive value. Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> generates a new unique progressive link number which is different from the currently assigned progressive numbers, and causes the RAM <b>203</b> to store the added progressive value, in association with the generated number.

Upon judging that a progressive link is newly created (step S<b>115</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> proceeds to step S<b>116</b>.

Hereinafter, the configuration of the game system will be described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>. In this case, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; of any one slot machine <b>10</b>&#x2032; serves as a host controller to perform control operation. Namely, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; of the slot machine <b>10</b>&#x2032;, which serves as a host controller, performs control operation of the CPU <b>201</b> of the abovementioned center controller <b>200</b> that performs processing of the progressive link <b>150</b>; and other slot machines perform a participation process of the progressive link <b>150</b> for the single slot machine <b>10</b>&#x2032;. In the following description, a ROM <b>42</b>&#x2032; of the slot machine <b>10</b>&#x2032; replaces the abovementioned ROM <b>202</b>; a RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the slot machine <b>10</b>&#x2032; replaces the abovementioned RAM <b>203</b>; and a communication interface <b>44</b>&#x2032; of the slot machine <b>10</b>&#x2032; replaces the abovementioned communication interface <b>204</b>.

<p id="p-0597" num="0596">Next, the progressive link creation and merging process will be described. FIG. <b>29</b> is a flowchart showing the progressive link creation and merging process performed by a host controller. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a flowchart showing a subroutine of the progressive link creation and merging process invoked and executed at step S<b>3</b> of the subroutine in the slot machine <b>10</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> or at step S<b>103</b> of the subroutine in the host controller.</p>
<p id="p-0598" num="0597">A host controller operation will be described hereinafter. The main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller performs a process of verifying the progressive value of each jackpot <b>151</b> (step S<b>211</b>). In this process, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller reads the progressive values of all of the jackpots <b>151</b> in link games, the values being stored in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0599" num="0598">Next, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller judges whether or not there exists a progressive link meeting a condition close to the corresponding progressive link <b>150</b> (step S<b>212</b>). In this process, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller judges a predetermined condition in which each of the stored first and second progressive values and the link game count are preset. The predetermined condition is that each of the first and second progressive values has reached a predetermined value or more (for example, 50000) and that the respective progressive values are within the preset predetermined difference (for example, &#xb1;10%). The main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller further reads the link game count from the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;, and judges whether or not each of the first and second link games meets the preset predetermined condition. The predetermined condition is that, when the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller references the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;, each of the link game counts executed in the first and second link games reaches the predetermined value (for example, 5,000). Upon judging that the first and second progressive values and link game count read at step S<b>211</b> meet the predetermined condition (step S<b>212</b>: YES), the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller proceeds to step S<b>213</b>. If not (step S<b>212</b>: NO), the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; proceeds to step S<b>215</b>. While the target range was defined to be within &#xb1;10%, it may be broader or narrower.</p>
<p id="p-0600" num="0599">Next, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller merges progressive links (step S<b>213</b>). Upon judging that the first and second progressive values meet the predetermined condition as the result of the judgment at step S<b>213</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; merges a plurality of link games, which correspond to the first and second progressive values meeting the predetermined condition, to form one link game; and then, adds up these progressive values. Namely, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller adds up the first progressive values so that the first and second link games are merged with each other to form one link game, as the result of the judgment at step S<b>212</b>, and the first and second progressive bonuses are integrated with each other. Subsequently, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller updates the progressive values stored in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;, based upon the added-up progressive value. Specifically, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller generates the number of a new progressive link <b>150</b> that is different from that of the currently established progressive link <b>150</b>, and stores the added up progressive value in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller in association with the generated number. This item of information is defined as merge information. The items of the merge information include a progressive value of a machine-participating progressive link <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0601" num="0600">Namely, where the stored first and second progressive values meet the predetermined condition, they can be merged, thus making it possible to increase the scale of the progressive values. As a result, an opportunity of obtaining a greater progressive value is given a player, thus making it possible to enhance entertainability.</p>
<p id="p-0602" num="0601">Next, the main CPU <b>41</b> serving as a host controller transmits merge information (step S<b>214</b>). The main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller transmits merge information via a communication interface <b>44</b>&#x2032; to other slot machines, each of which participates in the progressive link <b>150</b>. Other slot machines <b>10</b> each receive this information, and thereafter, perform a display process. Namely, other slot machines <b>10</b> each receive merge information from the host controller to be described later (step S<b>214</b>). The main CPU <b>41</b> of each of such other slot machines <b>10</b> receives, from the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller, the merge information stored in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; and transmitted via the communication interface <b>44</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0603" num="0602">At the same time, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller communicates with a common display device <b>300</b>, and the common display device <b>300</b> displays merge information. Specifically, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller controls the common display device <b>300</b> to display the progressive value added up at step S<b>213</b> and stored in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;. Therefore, the updated progressive value is displayed so that information such as the current progressive value or a plurality of merged progressive values can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0604" num="0603">At step S<b>215</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller judges whether or not to create the progressive link <b>150</b>. Specifically, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller judges whether or not the number of progressive links raised in the created progressive link participant list is less than a predetermined number (for example, less than 3). Upon judging that the progressive link <b>150</b> is created (step S<b>215</b>: YES), the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller proceeds to step S<b>216</b>.

In the embodiment, the payment condition for the jackpot <b>151</b> is randomly set by means of the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller, without being limitative thereto. For example, it may be a routine to judge a pattern of the progressive links <b>150</b> included in the progressive link participant list so as to control creation of a new jackpot <b>151</b> serving as a progressive link <b>150</b> of the same pattern. Upon creating the new jackpot <b>151</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller sets the amount of prize money for each jackpot <b>151</b> (maximum value of payout amount); a minimum BET amount in one standalone game; and the number of slot machines that can participate, and stores the settings in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller.</p>
<p id="p-0606" num="0605">Next, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller performs a process of creating progressive link participant list information (step S<b>217</b>). In this process, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller samples current information pertinent to the progressive link <b>150</b> from the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller, and creates the progressive link participant list. The main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; progressive link participant list is created by progressive links <b>150</b> in which slot machines <b>10</b> participate. Specifically, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller incorporates, in the progressive link participant list information, the contents changed by the merging process of the progressive links <b>150</b> and the jackpot creation process. The main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller samples, from the RAM <b>43</b> of the host controller, the information pertinent to one or more progressive links <b>150</b> managed by the host controller, and creates the progressive link participant list. The items of information pertinent to the progressive links <b>150</b> include: the amount of prize money for each progressive link <b>150</b> (maximum value of payout amount); a minimum BET amount in one standalone game; and the number of slot machines that currently participate. The main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller stores the created progressive link participant list in the predetermined area of the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller.</p>
<p id="p-0607" num="0606">Next, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller updates progressive link participant list information. Specifically, the updated progressive link participant list information is stored in the predetermined area of the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller. Further, it may be a routine to transmit the update information to other slot machine <b>10</b> participating in the progressive link <b>150</b>, so that such other slot machines <b>10</b> display the received information. Further, it may also be a routine to transmit the updated information to the common display device <b>300</b> so that the common display device displays the received information. After this process has terminated, this CPU terminates a progressive link merging process.</p>
<p id="p-0608" num="0607">Game processing of the host controller will be described, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is a flowchart showing the game processing of the host controller. In the game processing of this embodiment, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; of any one slot machine <b>10</b>&#x2032;, serving as a host controller, performs control operation in place of the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b>. The processes of other slot machines <b>10</b> are not described here, since it is similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller performs the processes at steps S<b>251</b> to S<b>257</b> that follow. At step S<b>251</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller receives jackpot BET information and machine identification information having been transmitted from the slot machines <b>10</b>. Namely, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; performs the processes of the center controller shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, and other slot machines <b>10</b> perform the processes of the slot machine <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. Further, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; receives a participation signal, for example, BET information and machine identification information, from the gaming machines. The main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller stores the jackpot BET amount in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller, based upon the received jackpot BET information. Namely, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller accumulatively updates the first or second progressive value stored in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;, based upon the BET information received at step S<b>251</b>. The RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; stores the jackpot BET amount by other slot machines <b>10</b>, and the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller stores the jackpot BET amount in the area of the corresponding slot machine <b>10</b>&#x2032; of the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;, based upon machine identification information. Further, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller receives the machine identification information transmitted from the slot machines <b>10</b> at the abovementioned step S<b>55</b>, and stores the received link game count in the predetermined area of the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0609" num="0608">At step S<b>252</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller performs a process of updating the progressive value of the jackpot <b>151</b>. Specifically, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller adds up the respective jackpot BET amounts of slot machines <b>10</b>, the amounts having been stored in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller at step S<b>251</b>. Further, this main CPU adds up the jackpot BET amounts of all of the slot machines participating in the progressive links <b>150</b>, and stores the added-up progressive value in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller. For example, assuming that two slot machines participate in a progressive link <b>150</b>, if these slot machines <b>10</b> have invested 500 and 300 jackpot bets, the host controller adds up these BET numbers (500+300), and stores the added-up progressive value, i.e., &#x201c;800&#x201d;, in the RAM <b>43</b> of the host controller.</p>
<p id="p-0610" num="0609">At step S<b>253</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller performs a process of adding up the link game count. Specifically, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller counts the number of the respective link games at the slot machines, the counts having been stored in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller at the abovementioned step S<b>251</b>, adds up the counted number, and then, stores it in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;. The RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller stores the added-up value of the total link game count of all of the slot machines <b>10</b> participating in the progressive links <b>150</b>. For example, the link game counts of two slot machines <b>10</b> are 10 times and 25 times, respectively, these link game counts are added up (10+25), and the added-up value, i.e., &#x201c;35&#x201d; is stored in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the host controller.</p>
<p id="p-0611" num="0610">At step S<b>254</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller judges whether or not a winning jackpot is established.

Upon judging that the winning jackpot is established (step S<b>254</b>: YES), the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller proceeds to step S<b>255</b>. If not (step S<b>254</b>: NO), this main CPU terminates this subroutine.</p>
<p id="p-0612" num="0611">At step S<b>255</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller transmits a winning jackpot signal. Specifically, if the random numbers sampled at step S<b>254</b> coincide with specific numbers, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller transmits a winning jackpot signal to slot machines <b>10</b> to which the specific numbers have been randomly assigned as a winning jackpot. In other words, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller randomly determines whether or not to award a progressive bonus in a link game to any of the slot machines <b>10</b> participating in a merged link game, and awards to the slot machine <b>10</b> determined as the result of random determination the progressive bonus that is responsive to the added-up progressive value.</p>
<p id="p-0613" num="0612">At step S<b>256</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; serving as a host controller resets the progressive value of the jackpot <b>151</b>.

<p id="p-0620" num="0619">A game system according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail, referring to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is an explanatory view of a progressive participation process.</p>
<p id="p-0621" num="0620">First, an outline of games will be described. Slot machines <b>10</b> can perform a standalone game which a player at each of the slot machines <b>10</b> plays individually and a link game which is played by a plurality of players at other slot machines <b>10</b>. The players at the slot machines <b>10</b> can arbitrarily play link games while playing standalone games.</p>
<p id="p-0622" num="0621">A game system <b>100</b> according to the embodiment is made up of: a center controller <b>200</b> having a RAM <b>203</b> which stores a progressive value paid as a prize in a progressive bonus game serving as a link game; and a plurality of slot machines which can be connected to the center controller <b>200</b> via a communication line and can participate in a progressive bonus game in order to acquire a progressive value paid out as a prize. The progressive value stored in the RAM <b>203</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> is updated so as to increase BET information input from each of the slot machines <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0623" num="0622">At step S<b>132</b>, the center controller <b>200</b> monitors whether or not the progressive value updated based upon the BET information transmitted from each of the slot machines <b>10</b> has reached a predetermined value (for example, a value of 50%). If the progressive value has exceeded a predetermined value (for example, a value of 50%), the center controller <b>200</b> limits participation in a progressive bonus game relative to a slot machine which desires to do so from now. If not, the center controller allows such participation. In other words, the center controller <b>200</b> determines whether or not to participate in a progressive bonus game relative to a slot machine which desires to do so, in accordance with a state of the progressive value updated based upon the BET information. By limiting a period of time during which a player can participate in a progressive bonus game, it is possible to eliminate the player's feeling of unfairness in acquisition of the progressive value paid out as a prize common to a plurality of slot machines. The center controller <b>200</b> transmits, to a slot machine <b>10</b> which desires participation, information for determining whether or not the participation is permissible, based upon the contents of determination of participation in the progressive game determined according to the state of the progressive value (step S<b>134</b>, S<b>136</b>).</p>

Specifically, if each of the random numbers sampled at step S<b>213</b> coincides with a specific number, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; transmits a winning jackpot signal, as a winning jackpot, to a slot machine to which the specific number has been assigned.</p>
<p id="p-0763" num="0762">At step S<b>215</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; of the host slot machine <b>10</b>&#x2032; resets the progressive value of the jackpot. In other words, upon judging that the progressive bonus has been awarded at step S<b>213</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; resets the progressive value stored in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;. Specifically, the main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; resets the progressive values of the winning jackpots stored in the RAM <b>43</b>&#x2032;; the jackpot BET amounts by slot machines <b>10</b>; a total number of standalone games; and the values of the numbers of standalone games by slot machines <b>10</b>. After this process has terminated, the main CPU terminates this subroutine. The main CPU <b>41</b>&#x2032; repeatedly executes the progressive bonus acquisition processes (the abovementioned processes at steps S<b>208</b> to S<b>215</b>) in order to repeatedly perform a progressive bonus game (jackpot) for obtaining a progressive bonus.</p>
<p id="p-0764" num="0763">In the embodiment, even though the center controller is employed, the slot machine <b>10</b> controls progressive links to enable a process of disabling a slot machine <b>10</b> to newly participate in a progressive link in which a progressive value is 50% or more of the jackpot prize money. In this manner, a game system can be provided which eliminates the player's feeling of unfairness in acquisition of a jackpot common to a plurality of slot machines by limiting a period of time during which they can participate in the jackpot.</p>

<p id="p-0772" num="0771">At step S<b>134</b>, the center controller <b>200</b> monitors whether the number of slot machines has reached a fixed number of participants, the slot machines participating in a progressive link updated based upon a participation signal transmitted from each of the slot machines <b>10</b>. The fixed number of participants used herein is randomly predetermined for each of the progressive links. If the number of slot machines participating in the progressive link exceeds the fixed number of participants, the center controller <b>200</b> limits participation in a progressive bonus game, of a slot machine desiring to do so from now. If not, the center controller permits participation in the progressive bonus game, of such slot machine. In other words, the center controller <b>200</b> determines whether or not to enable participation in the progressive bonus game, of the slot machine desiring to do so. This determination is made in response to a state of participation in the progressive bonus game updated based upon the participation signal transmitted from the slot machine. By limiting a period of time during which a player can participate in a progressive bonus game, it is possible to eliminate the player's feeling of unfairness in acquisition of the progressive value paid as a prize common to a plurality of slot machines. The center controller <b>200</b> transmits determination information as to whether or not to enable participation of the slot machine <b>10</b> desiring to do so. This transmission is based upon the contents of determining whether or not to enable participation in the progressive bonus game determined depending upon the state of participation in the progressive bonus game (step S<b>135</b>, S<b>137</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0848" num="0847">At step S<b>112</b>, a progressive link is newly created in a pattern in which the number of the current progressive links is insufficient. For example, a description will be given by example of the progressive link participant list shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref>. First, the CPU <b>201</b> performs pattern classification of the current progressive links. Link <b>1</b> corresponds to pattern B; Link <b>2</b> corresponds to pattern A; and Link <b>3</b> corresponds to pattern C. Next, the number of progressive links by classified pattern is counted. Here, the number of progressive links in each pattern is counted to be one. Next, an insufficient number of progressive links is created referring to the settings of the jackpot condition setting table in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>. Here, one progressive link is assumed to be created in each of patterns B and C.</p>
<p id="p-0849" num="0848">Next, a process of jackpot condition setting in each pattern will be described. In the progressive link of pattern A, the fixed number of participants (the number of participable slot machines) ranges from 101 to 500, and a large number of slot machines can participate.

<p id="p-0851" num="0850">The progressive link of pattern B allows the fixed number of participants (the number of participable slot machines) to be set in the range of 51 to 100, and is formed as a middle-scale progressive link.

The minimum BET amount required to place a BET in a jackpot in one standalone game ranges from $11 to $100. The CPU <b>201</b> selects the minimum BET amount from the plurality of settings ranging from $11 to $100 in the same manner as that for the amount of prize money for a jackpot.

Namely, by setting a small amount of slot machines which can participate in a progressive link in which the jackpot progressive value is small, it is possible to provide to the slot machines a progressive link in which only a small amount of jackpot prize money can be acquired, whereas the winning probability is high. Further, by setting a large number of slot machines which can participate in a progressive link in which the jackpot progressive value is large, a progressive link in which the winning probability is lowered can be provided to the slot machines, whereas a large amount of jackpot prize money can be acquired.

The word &#x201c;loser&#x201d; used herein denotes a case in which no coin payout is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0902" num="0901">Next, an operation of the center controller <b>200</b> will be described. The CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> performs processes at step S<b>151</b> to S<b>157</b> that follow. At step S<b>151</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> receives the jackpot BET information and machine identification information, transmitted from the slot machine <b>10</b> at step S<b>55</b> mentioned above. After that, the CPU <b>201</b> stores the jackpot BET amount to the RAM <b>203</b>, based upon the received jackpot BET information. The RAM <b>203</b> stores the jackpot BET amount by slot machine <b>10</b>, and the CPU <b>201</b> stores the jackpot BET amount in a storage area of the corresponding slot machine <b>10</b> of the RAM <b>203</b>, based upon machine identification information. Further, the CPU <b>201</b> receives the machine identification information transmitted from the slot machine <b>10</b> at step S<b>55</b> mentioned above, and stores the received game count in a predetermined storage area of the RAM <b>203</b>. The RAM <b>203</b> stores the game count by slot machine <b>10</b>, and the CPU <b>201</b> stores the game count in a storage area of the corresponding slot machine <b>10</b> of the RAM <b>203</b>, based upon the machine identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0903" num="0902">At step S<b>152</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> performs a process of adding to a jackpot progressive value. Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> performs a process of adding up respective one of the jackpot BET amounts of slot machines <b>10</b>, stored in the RAM <b>203</b>, and adds up the jackpot BET amounts of all of the slot machines participating in progressive links, and stores the added up progressive value in the RAM <b>203</b>. For example, assuming that two slot machines <b>10</b> participate in a progressive link, if the jackpot BET numbers invested by the two slot machines <b>10</b> are 500 and 300, respectively, the center controller <b>200</b> adds up these BET numbers (500+300), and stores the added-up progressive value of &#x201c;800&#x201d; in the RAM <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0904" num="0903">At step S<b>153</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> performs a game count adding up process. Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> performs a process of adding up respective ones of the game counts of slot machines, stored in the RAM <b>203</b> at step S<b>151</b> mentioned above, and stores, in the RAM <b>203</b>, an added-up value of the total games of all of the slot machines participating in progressive links. For example, if the game counts of two slot machines <b>10</b> are 10 and 25, respectively, the center controller <b>200</b> adds up these game counts (10+25), and stores the added up value of &#x201c;35&#x201d; in the RAM <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0905" num="0904">At step S<b>154</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> judges whether the progressive value added at step S<b>152</b> reaches 50% of the maximum value of jackpot payout set at the progressive link creation process mentioned above. For example, when the maximum value of jackpot payout is set at $1,000,000, the CPU <b>201</b> judges whether the progressive value stored in the RAM <b>203</b> is $500,000 or more. Upon judging that the progressive value reaches 50% of the maximum value of jackpot payout (S<b>154</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> proceeds to step S<b>155</b>, or if not (S<b>154</b>: NO), the CPU terminates this subroutine.</p>
<p id="p-0906" num="0905">At step S<b>155</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> judges whether a winning jackpot is established. Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> assigns a specific number to a slot machine having transmitted jackpot BET information and machine identification information at step S<b>55</b>, and samples random numbers from predetermined numeric range including the specific number. After that, the CPU <b>201</b> judges whether one of the sampled random numbers coincides with the specific number. Upon judging that the winning jackpot is established (S<b>155</b>: YES), the CPU <b>201</b> proceeds to step S<b>156</b>, or if not (S<b>155</b>: NO), the CPU terminates this subroutine.</p>
<p id="p-0907" num="0906">At step S<b>156</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> transmits a winning jackpot signal. Specifically, when one of the random numbers sampled at step S<b>155</b> coincides with the specific number, the CPU <b>201</b> transmits the winning jackpot signal as the winning jackpot to the slot machine to which the specific number has been assigned.</p>
<p id="p-0908" num="0907">At step S<b>157</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> of the center controller <b>200</b> resets the jackpot progressive value. Specifically, the CPU <b>201</b> resets: the progressive value of a winning jackpot, stored in the RAM <b>203</b>; the jackpot BET amount by slot machine <b>10</b>; total game count; and the value of game count by slot machine <b>10</b>. After this process has terminated, the CPU terminates this subroutine.</p>

The center controller <b>200</b><i>a </i>grasps the number of progressive links exiting in the game system <b>100</b>. If it is smaller than a predetermined number, this center controller newly creates a jackpot, and performs control to maintain the number at the predetermined number or more. At this time, the above center controller transmits a signal of causing a center controller, which does not create a progressive link, to newly create a jackpot. The table described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> may be employed as to jackpot condition setting at the time of newly creating a jackpot.</p>
<p id="p-0913" num="0912">The center controller <b>200</b><i>a </i>makes a search for a progressive link <b>150</b> with a low participation rate from the progressive links existing in the game system <b>100</b>.

Further, the above center controller judges whether the number of slot machines currently participating in the progressive link <b>150</b><i>b </i>reaches the fixed number of participants. If the number of slot machines currently participating in the progressive link <b>150</b><i>b </i>reaches the fixed number of participants, the center controller <b>200</b><i>b </i>transmits a participation rejection signal to the slot machine <b>10</b><i>x</i>. If not, this center controller registers the slot machine <b>10</b><i>x </i>in the progressive link <b>150</b><i>b</i>, and transmits a participation permission signal to the slot machine <b>10</b><i>x</i>. Therefore, a slot machine <b>10</b> cannot newly participate in the progressive link <b>150</b><i>b </i>in which the number of currently participating slot machines reaches the fixed number of participants.</p>
