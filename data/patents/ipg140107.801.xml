<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Application is a U.S. Nationalization of PCT Application No. PCT/US03/22338, filed Jul. 16, 2003, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/396,505 filed Jul. 16, 2002. The prior applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a temperature control system, method and apparatus. More specifically, a system, method and apparatus for controlling a range of temperature attributes of a beverage contained within a server or reservoir is disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The correct temperature of a beverage at the time of dispensing from a server has been a subject of interest in the food service industry. Whether in a home, office, restaurant or retail setting, a beverage consumer has expectations that hot and cold beverages will be provided or otherwise dispensed within certain temperature ranges. When a hot or cold beverage is served at too high or too low a temperature the resultant product may be undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a retail setting, such as in a restaurant or store, a beverage consumer's displeasure may lead the consumer to discard the beverage and no longer purchase beverages from a particular vendor who sold the beverage, or the vendor may have to offer an alternative beverage. Either option is wasteful, not cost effective, and can be damaging to consumer relationships.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As with other food products, hot beverages such as coffee or tea have a period of time or &#x201c;life&#x201d; during which flavor characteristics are optimal or at least desirable. Various factors can influence the &#x201c;life&#x201d;. For example, it might be possible to extend the life of a heated beverage by reducing evaporation due to exposure of the beverage to the atmosphere, regulating the temperature of the beverage, and preventing overheating or &#x201c;cooking&#x201d; of the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Attempts have been made to extend the &#x201c;life&#x201d; of a heated beverage retained in a server by regulating the temperature of beverage in the server. One form of beverage server utilizes heat resistant and heat conductive material for a beverage reservoir. A flame from a source such as a gelled fuel is placed under the reservoir to heat the beverage contained therein. This arrangement may not be preferred because the flame does not provide uniform or controllable heating of the beverage in relation to the quantity of beverage retained in the server, the amount of fuel, the temperature of the fuel, and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Warming plates have been used to keep beverages such as coffee hot. Such warming plates can be an improvement over the exposed flame systems in that the plates generally produce more consistent heat at a generally constant power level. However, such warming plates generally have not been controllable and have a tendency to result in cooking of the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to applying heat to a beverage, other methods of regulating the temperature of a stored beverage have been employed. Passive servers, such as those which use insulated reservoirs, for example, glass, or metal insulated thermal servers, have been used to prevent heat loss of a beverage after the heated beverage is placed within the reservoir. Some degree of heat loss still occurs despite the use of insulation and as a result, the beverage may only be kept at a desired temperature for a limited period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Based on the above information and other reasons which may not have been mentioned, there exists a need for a temperature control system, method and apparatus which can be used to extend the duration and consistency of the life of a beverage within a beverage server by controlling various factors associated with a the temperature of a beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure envisions a temperature control system, method and apparatus employing at least a controller and a temperature control assembly which work in combination with each other to facilitate control of numerous temperature attributes of an associated beverage contained within a beverage server. The temperature control system should be capable of working in conjunction with a beverage maker or a remote station for serving a beverage away from the beverage maker.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional features will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of the drawings illustrating at least one embodiment of the disclosure. Additional features will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of the drawings.</p>

No. 6,393,966 issued May 28, 2002 provide additional information related to the use of a beverage server in combination with a beverage maker and a remote station. The aforementioned U.S. Patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. These aforementioned patents are also assigned to the assignee of the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term beverage as used herein is intended to be broadly defined and interpreted. As used herein, beverage is intended to include to all consumable liquids, including but not limited to coffees, teas, hot chocolate, juices, flavored drinks, soups, au jus, gravy and any other consumable liquids for which a desired serving temperature is to be provided and maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of the beverage server <b>20</b> is comprised of a housing <b>21</b> including generally vertical side wall <b>22</b>, a bottom portion <b>24</b> and a top portion <b>26</b>. The housing <b>21</b>, vertical side wall <b>22</b>, bottom portion <b>24</b> and top portion <b>26</b> form a generally hollow structure defining an interior cavity or chamber <b>28</b>. It is contemplated that other geometric structures such as a cylinder or other suitable shape may be used to accomplish the same or similar function of the beverage server <b>20</b>. A reservoir structure <b>11</b> defining a reservoir cavity <b>13</b> in which the beverage is retained. Beverage retained in the reservoir <b>11</b> contacts in internal surface <b>15</b> of the reservoir. This internal surface <b>15</b> can be controllably heated as will be described herein to impart heat energy to the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Insulation <b>27</b> is provided to decrease heat loss to the environment. An example of an insulation which could be used in the embodiment as shown in the figures is a polyurethane expanded foam insulation. It is expected that one of ordinary skill in the art will be able to choose from a variety of insulation materials suitable for a desired set of conditions. Insulation <b>27</b> is provided not only between the generally vertical wall <b>22</b> but also over the top portion <b>26</b> of the interior cavity <b>28</b>. The insulation <b>27</b> in the area above the interior cavity <b>28</b> has a thickness dimension <b>23</b> which is generally greater than a thickness dimension <b>25</b> of the vertical side wall <b>22</b>. It should be noted that the thickness description above refers to heat retaining characteristics. If a thin high heat retention insulation is used above the interior cavity <b>28</b>, then it may be thinner than a different insulation having a lower heat retention characteristic used in the vertical side walls <b>22</b>. The type of server shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> is a thermally insulated or thermal server or dispenser of generally known construction such as SoftHeat&#xae; servers as provided by Bunn-O-Matic Corporation, Springfield, Ill. The additional structures, methods of use and controls in combination with such a SoftHeat&#xae; server is further disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The top portion <b>26</b> is dimensioned to contain at least one aperture <b>30</b> through which a beverage <b>32</b> may be introduced into the interior cavity <b>28</b> and provide access for cleaning. It is contemplated that aperture <b>30</b> may be at least partially occluded or sealed by a lid <b>34</b>. The lid <b>34</b> may be attached to the aperture after beverage <b>32</b> is introduced into the interior cavity <b>28</b>. The lid <b>34</b> also may be present while beverage <b>32</b> is being introduced into the interior cavity <b>28</b>. The lid <b>34</b> may be designed so as to allow a beverage <b>32</b> to flow through the lid <b>34</b> into interior cavity <b>28</b>. For example, a &#x201c;Safety-Fresh&#xae;&#x201d; container and lid such as is produced by Bunn-O-Matic Corporation, Springfield, Ill., and as set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,739,898 and 5,480,054 and assigned to the assignee of the present application which are incorporated herein by reference, in their entirety may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At least one outlet aperture or serving port <b>36</b> is provided on the beverage server <b>20</b>. the serving port or outlet aperture <b>36</b> extends through the reservoir <b>11</b> and housing <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the outlet aperture <b>36</b> is located generally near the bottom portion <b>24</b> of beverage server <b>20</b> either on the bottom of the server <b>20</b> or on a wall <b>22</b> of the server. The outlet aperture <b>36</b> is in communication with a serving valve or faucet <b>38</b>. The serving valve <b>38</b> may be any manually or automatically controllable valve known to those of skill in the art. For example, the server valve <b>38</b> may be of the manual form such as shown in the figures in which a handle <b>39</b> is actuated to place a valve structure within the valve <b>38</b> to dispense liquid from the outlet aperture <b>36</b> and through the nozzle <b>43</b>. Additionally, it is envisioned that an electronically controlled valve such as an electronic dispensing valve may be coupled to the controller <b>80</b> such that a push button selection or operation of a manual handle will provide a signal to the controller instructing the valve to be operated and control and dispense beverage therethrough. It is contemplated that the serving valve <b>38</b> may be manually controllable by a user of the beverage server <b>20</b> or may be controlled by a controller <b>80</b>. The controller <b>80</b> may further operate serving valve <b>38</b> in response to a preprogrammed series of signals such as the amount of time the serving valve <b>38</b> is to remain open or any other signal desired by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The controller <b>80</b> may be responsive to a signal from a control panel <b>82</b> such as a switch, push button, numeric keypad, or any other suitable selectable control apparatus known to those of skill in the art. Such a control panel <b>82</b> may be used to program the controller <b>80</b> of the temperature control system <b>10</b> to input control information and signals. Additionally, other methods and devices may be used to input control information. For example, the information may be programmed via the coupling or connector <b>64</b>. In this example, the information may be transmitted to the controller <b>80</b> from the brewer, station <b>60</b> or other device coupled to the connector <b>64</b>. Additionally, other devices including conductive, inductive, RF wireless, and other communication devices are envisioned to be included in the means for programming the temperature control system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, many of the same features shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are illustrated. The controller <b>80</b> is shown as a circuit board including various components for operating the temperature control system <b>10</b> of the present invention. A timer of know construction is included with the controller <b>80</b> to provide a program or operating time reference for purposes of operating the controller and the associated components as described herein. One of skill in the art will appreciate how to employ a timer in conjunction with the present disclosure to provide a means for time controlling at least a portion of the operation of the controllable heating methods disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The controller <b>80</b> may be carried in the brewer <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>A shown for illustrative purposes only as controller <b>84</b> in the partial fragmentary section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to indicate that the controller <b>84</b> is carried on the brewer. Additionally, a controller <b>80</b> is shown illustratively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as controller <b>86</b> in the partial fragmentary area of the remote station <b>60</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As such, the embodiment of the server <b>20</b> with all of the displays, controls and other components may not be required in each and every situation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The bottom cross section view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> taken along line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown without the faucet <b>38</b> and other structures on the front face of the server. This has been eliminate for purposes of clarity in describing the structures and components as shown in the bottom cross-sectional view.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">One of ordinary skill in the art provided with the disclosure provided herein will be able to construct and program a controller <b>80</b> based on known components. For example, the connector <b>64</b> and the coupling of the server with a brewer or remote station (brewer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, remote station <b>60</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) is shown and described in the patents identified herein above and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning to temperature control system <b>10</b> of the present disclosure, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows controller <b>80</b> on beverage server <b>20</b>. It is contemplated that controller <b>80</b> may be located anywhere on or in beverage server <b>20</b>. The controller <b>80</b> may alternatively be a separate unit coupled to the beverage server, a beverage maker or a remote station for example, for purposes of retrofitting a server, a beverage maker or a remote station. It is further contemplated that controller <b>80</b> may also operate a plurality of beverage servers <b>20</b>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, controller <b>80</b> may operate as part of or in combination with beverage maker controller <b>84</b> or remote station controller <b>86</b> to allow for control of all temperature attributes of beverage <b>32</b> within beverage server <b>20</b> at one or a plurality of locations.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An alternative embodiment contemplates a beverage maker controller <b>84</b> or a remote station controller <b>86</b> controlling a beverage server <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, the controller <b>80</b> on beverage server <b>20</b> might not be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Controller <b>80</b> may control temperature control assembly <b>40</b> over line <b>42</b>. A feedback to controller <b>80</b> is provided over line <b>44</b> from the temperature sensing device <b>46</b>. The temperature sensing device <b>46</b> may take the form of any temperature sensing or detecting device known in the art, for example a thermostat as shown herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, temperature control assembly <b>40</b> includes a heating element <b>41</b> located generally proximate to bottom portion <b>24</b>. However, it is contemplated that the heating element <b>41</b> may be a electrical, thermo-chemical reaction chamber, steam transfer structure, hot water filled structure, phase changing exothermic or endothermic material, light or infrared source, microwave source or any device known to those of skill in the art for adding energy to or removing energy from a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The heating element <b>41</b> illustrated is an active heating element in that it receives energy and transfers the energy to the beverage through the reservoir. The active heating element is generally retained in the server chamber <b>28</b> such as the blanket or sheet heater as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The heater <b>41</b> may also be placed in the cavity <b>13</b> of the reservoir <b>11</b> using heating elements of known construction.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is also envisioned that a passive heating element could be used for the heating element <b>41</b>. A passive heating element is charged with energy or heat and positioned in close proximity to or contact with the beverage. The passive heating element then dissipates heat to the beverage to maintain a level of heat in the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is also contemplated that temperature control assembly <b>40</b> may be designed to remove heat energy from a liquid thereby keeping a cold beverage cool. In this application, temperature control system <b>40</b> may include a cooling element <b>41</b><i>a </i>such as a Peltier device, a conventional compressor/coolant refrigeration system, or any other device known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show additional embodiments and locations of heating element <b>41</b> of the temperature control system <b>40</b>. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, heating element <b>41</b>B is shown as a water jacket surrounding interior cavity <b>28</b>. In this embodiment, beverage <b>32</b> is heated or cooled over a greater surface area from the perimeter of interior beverage <b>32</b>. Such a water jacket may be defined by a cavity formed between the exterior surface <b>49</b> and the interior cavity <b>28</b> and a second wall <b>51</b>. Water or any other suitable material can be placed in the resulting cavity <b>53</b> providing heat transfer to the beverage <b>32</b>. In this embodiment, a heating element <b>41</b><i>a </i>is provided in the form of a strip or blanket heater which heats a portion of the material in the cavity <b>53</b>. Circulation of the material in the cavity provides heat transfer to the beverage <b>32</b>. Alternatively, a blanket heater may be wrapped around the entire wall <b>51</b> to heat the material within the cavity <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows another embodiment in which heating element <b>41</b> is a structure protruding into the center of interior cavity <b>28</b>. In this embodiment, beverage <b>32</b> is again heated over a greater surface area. The heating element <b>41</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> includes holes <b>55</b> to allow the passage of beverage <b>32</b> therethrough. In this manner, a larger heating surface is provided with the benefit of the holes <b>55</b> to allow convection flow therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As an additional consideration, a circulating apparatus <b>92</b> may be provided, coupled over line <b>94</b> to controller <b>80</b>. The circulating apparatus <b>92</b> may be any mechanical means, for example, a pump or a blade, which can circulate the beverage contained within beverage server <b>20</b>. The circulation created by circulation apparatus <b>92</b> may allow for more even heating of the beverage by temperature control system <b>40</b>. Generally, in the absence of circulating apparatus, heat energy will be circulated through the beverage by means of convection currents in the beverage which result from the heating process.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In any embodiment, temperature control system <b>40</b> includes and is controlled by controller <b>80</b>. Controller <b>80</b> may be preprogrammed for a series of activations and deactivations over a range of temperatures and conditions, which when communicated over line <b>42</b>, activate or deactivate, energize and deenergize the temperature control system <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, controller <b>80</b> may be preprogrammed by the manufacturer to maintain beverage <b>32</b> contained within beverage server <b>20</b> at a certain temperature. When beverage <b>32</b> is introduced to interior cavity <b>28</b> of beverage server <b>20</b>, the temperature sensor <b>46</b> measures, senses or detects temperature and communicates that measurement over line <b>44</b> to controller <b>80</b>. The temperature sensor <b>46</b> may be positioned proximate to the outlet port <b>36</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> or may be positioned in a different location relative to the server as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. If the temperature measured by the temperature sensor <b>46</b> is lower than the preprogrammed temperature value or range, controller <b>80</b> sends a signal over line <b>42</b> to activate temperature control assembly <b>40</b>. In this example, as the heating element <b>41</b> adds heat energy to beverage <b>32</b>, the temperature sensor <b>46</b> measures the temperature and communicates the measurements signal or information over line <b>44</b> to controller <b>80</b>. After the temperature sensor <b>46</b> measures and communicates a temperature measurement to controller <b>80</b> which meets or exceeds the preprogrammed temperature, controller <b>80</b> sends a signal over line <b>42</b> to deactivate heating element. The controller is also capable of creating a trend of temperature information to help the system to &#x201c;anticipate&#x201d; when a desired temperature is being approached so as to not overheat the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Through a series of measurements, activations and deactivations, the temperature control system <b>40</b> regulates the temperature of beverage <b>32</b> contained within beverage server <b>20</b>. The objective of this improved control of the temperature of the beverage, server and other portions and variables in the system is to minimize the amount of heat or energy that is added to the beverage in order to maintain the optimal serving temperature and flavor and minimize any potential adverse effect of heat on the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is also contemplated that the controller <b>80</b> may control heating element <b>41</b> to engage at various levels of heat output from nominal heat output to full heat output. Further, it is contemplated that controller <b>80</b> may activate and deactivate heating element <b>41</b> to cycle the heat on and off allowing for pulses of heat at any of the various levels of heat output. These various levels of heat output and various time intervals of heat output will give the user a broader range of control of the temperature attributes of beverage <b>32</b> and help prevent overheating or &#x201c;cooking&#x201d; of the beverage <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, in a situation such as a banquet or a conference, where a large volume of beverage needs to be made in advance and then be dispensed at a later time it may be desirable for the temperature control assembly <b>40</b> to operate at a constant reduced heat output level until the beverage is to be served. Then, while the beverage is being served, it may be desirable for the heating element <b>41</b> to operate at the highest possible heat output level. This may be necessary to compensate for heat loss which may occur during dispensing as the result of atmosphere transfer as beverage is dispensed. For example, when the beverage is held in the server prior to dispensing the heat loss is relatively slow. However, as the beverage is dispensed the heat transfer rate increases. Heat transfer or heat loss increases as a result of atmosphere being introduced into the container as beverage is dispensed. The system can be programmed to compensate for the increased rate of heat transfer, for example, by detecting an increase in dispense rate and adding heat to the server in response to the detected dispense rate increase.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another situation, where for example a beverage is introduced into the beverage server <b>20</b> at a temperature below optimum serving temperature, it may be desirable for the heating element <b>41</b> to operate at a highest possible heat output level for a period of time to raise the temperature of the beverage as rapidly as possible to the desired serving temperature and then cycle off. As the beverage sits in the beverage server <b>20</b> over time, it may then be desirable to have the heating element <b>41</b> cycle on and off for short periods of time or bursts to intermittently warm the beverage. Or, it may be preferred to have the heating element <b>41</b> constantly operate at a lower heat output level, thus maintaining a generally constant temperature of the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Yet another feature of the present disclosure is the ability to control the interior temperature of a beverage server <b>20</b> prior to introduction of a beverage into the interior cavity <b>28</b> of beverage server <b>20</b>. When a beverage is made, it is oftentimes at the proper temperature for serving. However, when the beverage is introduced into a container of a different temperature, for example room temperature, the temperature of the beverage will change depending on the temperature of the container into which it was introduced. For example, if hot coffee were introduced into a room temperature container, the coffee would loose heat to the container and become cooler.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The present disclosure further contemplates a &#x201c;preheat&#x201d; operation. When a &#x201c;preheat&#x201d; operation is activated from the control panel <b>82</b>, or automatically upon initiating a brew cycle, controller <b>80</b> activates heating element <b>41</b>. The preheat operation may be manually operated or a preprogrammed operation of the system. In response to signals from the temperature sensor <b>46</b>, controller <b>80</b> then operates heating element <b>41</b> at a predetermined heat output level until a proper predetermined temperature or user selected temperature is achieved. Prior to the desired preheat temperature being achieved, the controller <b>80</b> may lock out the beverage maker <b>62</b> to prevent beverage making at the maker <b>62</b> and dispensing into the server. The lock out feature may be of any method or combination or methods. For example, the lock out may lock out the brewing mechanism to prevent brewing prior to attaining &#x201c;pre-heat&#x201d; levels. After the desired temperature is attained, controller <b>80</b> may then communicate with beverage maker <b>62</b> to indicate that beverage maker <b>62</b> may then begin a beverage making cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is envisioned that the &#x201c;preheat&#x201d; operation be user selectable or programmable as to both duration and temperature. Further, an override may be provided. For example, in a high volume output situation, a beverage server <b>20</b> may be returned to the beverage maker <b>62</b> to be replenished with fresh beverage. It is likely that if the entire contents of beverage server <b>20</b> were depleted rapidly, the beverage server <b>20</b> would already be at or near the temperature of the beverage to be introduced into the beverage server. In such a scenario, it may be desirable to override any preprogrammed &#x201c;preheat&#x201d; operation and immediately introduce beverage into the beverage server <b>20</b>. Also, in this situation, the internal server temperature may be sensed, the heater activated to bring the server up to temperature and then allow beverage to be dispensed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another aspect of the temperature control system <b>10</b> of the present disclosure is to provide a variety of control options. It is envisioned that a purchaser of the temperature control system <b>10</b> as a system to connect to existing equipment, or the server <b>20</b> having the system <b>10</b>, may purchase the system from the manufacturer with temperature attributes preprogrammed into the memory of the controller <b>80</b>. The preprogrammed temperature attributes could be based on predetermined general settings or could be dependant on the type of beverage for which the system was to be used to control temperature. Such predetermined general setting could be established by the manufacturer or the customer. For example, it is envisioned that a customer ordering a quantity of servers may specify one or more of the attributes to be preprogrammed. Such a customer might be a franchise operation seeking to attain uniformity across its franchises.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is also contemplated that the purchaser of the temperature control system <b>10</b> may wish to customize the preprogrammed temperature attributes. For example, a large restaurant, or food-service company with nationwide or worldwide locations may desire to ensure uniform beverage serving temperatures throughout its operations. In such a situation, the restaurant could provide temperature specifications to the manufacturer which could then be programmed into the memory of the controller <b>80</b> of the temperature control system <b>10</b>, thus creating a uniform beverage dispensing temperature customized to the particular user.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, a variety of beverages may be dispensed from the same beverage server <b>20</b> at different times. In such an application, it may be desirable to select a unique temperature for each beverage to be served. It is envisioned that control panel <b>82</b> may contain a variety of indicators and selectors which would allow a user to select a type of beverage. The user selection would allow the controller <b>80</b> to regulate the temperature attributes assigned to the selected beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, if coffee and hot chocolate were two possible choices of beverages to be contained within a particular beverage server <b>20</b>, two different temperatures or temperature ranges may be required. It may be determined that it is desirable to serve the coffee at a serving temperature of 185&#xb0; F.&#xb1;5&#xb0; F. However, it may be desirable to serve the hot chocolate at a reduced temperature for example a temperature of 170&#xb0; F.&#xb1;5&#xb0; F. because hot chocolate might be likely to be consumed by young children who may be more sensitive to heat or if it is determined that the optimal temperature for optimal flavor of hot chocolate is different than coffee or tea.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Yet another possible control option is to provide an end user with the ability to directly control the temperature of the beverage contained within the beverage server <b>20</b>. In order to directly control the temperature of the beverage, a temperature display <b>48</b> is coupled to the temperature sensor <b>46</b> over line <b>50</b>. Temperature display <b>48</b> may also receive the temperature data from controller <b>80</b>. The temperature display <b>48</b> may take the form of an LCD display, mechanical temperature gage, temperature responsive material, or any other means of indicating temperature known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">After viewing the current temperature of a beverage contained within a beverage server <b>20</b>, the user may then select a different temperature by entering the different temperature on the control panel <b>82</b>. The different temperature would then be communicated to the controller <b>80</b> over line <b>88</b>. The controller <b>80</b> could then respond by activating or deactivating the heating element <b>41</b> to either increase or decrease the temperature of the beverage within beverage server <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition to being part of an end user control option, the temperature display <b>48</b> also may serve a marketing purpose, in that end users may prefer to see the temperature of the beverage they are about to dispense from the beverage server <b>20</b>. This may be desirable when an end user is cold and wishes to warm themselves with a hot beverage. Seeing the temperature of the beverage may have a psychological impact on the end user's decision to purchase a particular beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Beyond marketing, the temperature display <b>48</b> also allows for easy monitoring of the temperature of the beverage contained within a particular beverage server <b>20</b>. For example, a store clerk can visually verify that a beverage contained within a particular beverage server <b>20</b> is within a particular serving temperature range specified for the particular beverage.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">This wide range of power options will allow the temperature control system <b>10</b> to keep beverages at a desired temperature in a variety of applications such as in a restaurant service area where a remote station is not feasible due to space constraints but 110 VAC power is available, an outdoor catering setting where no external power is available, or in an disaster relief vehicle where battery power is available.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the temperature control system <b>10</b> is capable of operating in combination with a beverage maker <b>62</b>.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With the foregoing in mind and further disclosure provided herein, it is envisioned that the server can be provided with a controller as well as the brewer and remote station. In this regard, the server can act independently, can be controlled by the brewer and any information which may have been updated at the brewer, and may be controlled by the remote station and any other specific information related to use of the server at a remote station. In this regard, the system can be designed to provide a high degree of flexibility to accommodate specific needs at any one of a variety of locations.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It is also envisioned that the temperature control system <b>10</b> can be embodied in a beverage maker or brewer <b>62</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Such a brewer is of generally known construction such that it includes a heated water dispensing system <b>67</b>. The heated water dispensing system <b>67</b> includes a heated water reservoir <b>79</b> coupled to an inlet line <b>73</b> having a controllable valve <b>75</b> to controllably admit water to the reservoir and a controllable outlet valve <b>81</b> connected to an outlet port <b>83</b> of the reservoir <b>79</b>. The outlet valve <b>81</b> is coupled to the controller <b>80</b><i>c</i>. Further included in the heated water dispensing system is a dispense line <b>85</b> for passing liquid dispensed from the reservoir <b>79</b> to a sprayhead <b>87</b>. A heating element <b>77</b> is provided for the reservoir <b>79</b> and coupled to a controller <b>80</b><i>c</i>. Controlled dispensing through the sprayhead <b>87</b> delivers water to a brewing funnel <b>89</b> including a filter <b>91</b> which contains a brewing substance <b>93</b>. A brewed beverage <b>95</b> can be dispensed from the funnel <b>89</b> to a carafe <b>20</b><i>c</i>. A heating element <b>41</b><i>c </i>is coupled to the controller <b>80</b><i>c </i>for controllably regulating heat provided to the carafe <b>20</b><i>c</i>. The carafe <b>20</b><i>c </i>is yet another form of server <b>20</b>. The carafe <b>20</b><i>c </i>is an example of using the temperature control system with a generally non-insulated server or dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">It is envisioned that the controller <b>80</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> coupled to the brewer <b>62</b><i>a </i>provides the functions of the temperature control system <b>10</b><i>c</i>. The embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> can provide the heating functions as described throughout the present application. In this regard, the warmer <b>41</b><i>c </i>can be used to preheat the server <b>20</b><i>c </i>at the initiation of a brewing cycle when switch <b>101</b> is activated sending a signal to controller <b>80</b><i>c </i>to initiate sequences used to control the controllable valve <b>75</b>, <b>81</b> during the brewing process. The warmer <b>41</b><i>c </i>coupled to the controller <b>80</b><i>c </i>can be used to provide heat to the server <b>20</b><i>c </i>during and after the brewing process and terminate heat after a predetermined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Additionally, as described in greater detail throughout this application the warmer <b>41</b><i>c </i>can be controllably activated and deactivated (turned on and off) to provide pulses of heat in a variety of selectable patterns over a period of time. The period of time may be defined between brew cycle activations such that activation of switch <b>101</b> indicates to the controller <b>80</b><i>c </i>that a new brew cycle has been initiated and that the preprogrammed temperature control system <b>10</b><i>c </i>should be reinitiated or otherwise restarted. The heater <b>41</b><i>c </i>can be positioned at the remote dispensing station <b>60</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> to provide the controlled heating system and functions as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As an additional consideration, a beverage may be made directly in beverage server <b>20</b> without the need for beverage server <b>20</b> to be brought into proximity with beverage maker <b>62</b>. By allowing for independent operation of temperature control system <b>10</b>, beverage server <b>20</b> can act as a mixing container for a beverage. For example, any number of liquid or powdered concentrates, such as coffee concentrate may be introduced into interior cavity <b>28</b> of beverage server <b>20</b>. Water may then be added in a desired quantity. A user may then select a desired temperature from the control panel <b>82</b>. After selecting a desired temperature, the beverage server <b>20</b> may be left until the temperature control system <b>10</b> has caused the beverage contained within the beverage server <b>20</b> to reach the desired temperature, at which time the beverage may be served.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A volume display <b>72</b> may also be located on beverage server <b>20</b>. The volume display <b>72</b> may take the form of a sight gage (shown as <b>72</b><i>a </i>in the drawings), LCD readout, series of indicators, or any other means of displaying volume known to those of skill in the art. The electronic version of the volume display <b>72</b> is coupled over line <b>74</b> to sensor <b>90</b> contained within interior cavity <b>28</b>. It is envisioned that the sensor <b>90</b> could be external to the cavity <b>28</b> to sense the level of the contents, such as using an ultra sonic sensor or other non-invasive sensor. Sensor <b>90</b> may sense the level of beverage remaining within beverage server <b>20</b>. Sensor <b>90</b> may be a conductive sensor, a plurality of conductive sensors, an optical sensor, or any other suitable sensing apparatus known to those of skill in the art. It is also contemplated that sensor <b>90</b> may be coupled to controller <b>80</b> and that volume display <b>72</b> may receive its information from controller <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The sensor <b>90</b> as shown in the figures is of a probe-type sensor. The probe-type sensor includes several probes, typically two long probes and a short probe to detect at least two levels in the server. Alternatively, individual probes may be placed on the side wall of the cavity to detect discreet levels.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A freshness timer <b>76</b> may also be located on the beverage server <b>20</b>. The freshness timer <b>76</b> is coupled over line <b>78</b> to indicator <b>79</b> and is also be coupled to controller <b>80</b> over line <b>78</b>. The freshness timer <b>76</b> can be embodied in the form of a control which can be set by the user, either in the form of a separate control or an integrated control in a general control panel. The freshness timer <b>76</b> is used to set a predetermined period of time to communicate the information to the controller for use in the pre-programmed or during programming the variables related to the temperature control system <b>10</b>. After a predetermined period of time has elapsed from a preprogrammed event occurring, freshness timer <b>76</b> will activate indicator <b>79</b>. The predetermined time may be user determinable and represent the maximum time at which a beverage may be served when flavor characteristics of the beverage are optimum. The freshness timer <b>76</b> may also respond to a change in temperature outside of a predetermined range or for a change in temperature which lasts for a predetermined time as an indicator that the beverage contained within beverage server <b>20</b> is no longer within serving parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In addition to an indicator, it is also contemplated that freshness timer <b>76</b> may also be coupled to serving valve <b>38</b> or controller <b>80</b> and be capable of controllably closing serving valve <b>38</b> in response to the above mentioned events.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Another aspect of the present disclosure which falls under the category of temperature control is the ability to automatically power-off the system. In this embodiment, the controller <b>80</b> controls the heating element <b>41</b> in response to the predetermined time indicated by the freshness timer <b>76</b> or otherwise programmed into the controller <b>80</b>. In this regard, the controller <b>80</b> terminates power to the heating element <b>41</b> after a preprogrammed or manually determined freshness period has expired. By terminating power to the heating element <b>41</b>, overheating or &#x201c;cooking&#x201d; of the beverage is prevented. Terminating the heating of the beverage allows the beverage to &#x201c;coast&#x201d;, or remain at a relatively high temperature for an extended period of time. This &#x201c;coasting&#x201d; is possible because of the thermal properties of beverage server <b>10</b>, which prevent the beverage from rapidly cooling off. As noted with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> herein, the heating element <b>41</b><i>c </i>can also be terminated to prevent overheating or &#x201c;cooking&#x201d; of the coffee therein. While the properties of some of the carafe-style servers <b>20</b><i>c </i>may not be the same as those of other servers <b>20</b> which include insulation as described above, the posting period can extend the freshness and flavor time period of the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">By preventing &#x201c;cooking&#x201d; of the beverage, the flavor characteristics of the beverage may be maintained for a longer period of time. In other words, it can be determined that the flavor characteristics of the coffee may be maintained for a period of, for example, twenty minutes. After the predetermined period of time, the continued heating of the coffee may cause some degradation of the flavor characteristics. By turning off the heat, the flavor characteristics can be extended. In other words, the heat is provided so long as, and in suitable pulses or does, to not significantly alter the characteristics of the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In combination with the thermal properties of the beverage server <b>20</b>, a twenty minute period of time for retaining coffee may be extended to thirty minutes, forty minutes or more depending on the thermal properties of the server. It is envisioned that the heating time can be longer than 20 minutes, such as 1 hour at full heating capability or reduced heating capability. Additionally, further description will be provided with regard to various heating timing diagrams as found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-19</figref>. In this regard, in each of the sequences disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-19</figref> the controller <b>80</b> can terminate power to the heating element <b>41</b> at the end of a particular cycle allowing the beverage to slowly cool off or &#x201c;coast&#x201d; at the end of the cycle. Such coasting may result in dispensing a beverage product that is cooler than optimal serving temperature but will prevent transforming, via continued heating, the beverage into a product with an undesirable taste.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The freshness timer <b>76</b> will continue to countdown after the power has turned off which adds a further predetermined time the lockout feature mentioned above with regard to the valve <b>38</b> will be controllably operated. In other words, building upon the example provided above, the freshness timer <b>76</b> is initiated to allow the temperature control assembly <b>40</b> to operate for twenty minutes. After the twenty minute period has been reached, the controller <b>80</b> turns off the temperature control assembly <b>40</b> to prevent further heating of the coffee. The system of the present example has been studied and predetermined that the thermal characteristics of the server allow for an additional forty minutes of dispensing, under normal conditions, without detectable changes in the flavor characteristics or temperature of the coffee. The freshness timer <b>76</b> continues to count down for this forty minute period of time. After the additional forty minutes has expired, the controller <b>80</b> can be used to lock out the valve <b>38</b> to prevent dispensing from the beverage server <b>20</b>. The controller <b>80</b> can then be used to activate an indicator which will indicate to a consumer as well as an operator of the equipment that a new batch of coffee needs to be brewed, because the beverage currently contained within the beverage server <b>20</b> no longer has the preprogrammed freshness characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the beverage server <b>20</b> is prepared for receiving a new batch of coffee, the freshness timer <b>76</b> and automatic shutoff or lockout features need to be reset. The features can be reset as part of the initiation of the brewing cycle. For example, when the beverage server <b>20</b> is coupled to brewer <b>62</b> or if the beverage server <b>20</b> is stationed at the brewer <b>62</b>, the freshness timer <b>76</b> component of the controller <b>80</b> is automatically reset by means of the programming operating the controller which may reset the freshness timer <b>76</b> and automatic shutoff features. This resetting can occur when power is removed from the beverage server <b>20</b> or upon activation of a brewing cycle. Resetting these features allows for new parameters relating to the freshness timer <b>76</b> and automatic shutout or lockout features to be reset depending upon the quantity of beverage to be produced, the type of beverage to be produced, and other factors which may have an effect on the freshness time of the beverage to be dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A beverage type indicator <b>96</b> may also be located on beverage server <b>20</b>. It is envisioned that the beverage type indicator <b>96</b> is an independent indicator coupled to controller <b>80</b> over line <b>98</b>. The beverage type indicator <b>96</b> may take the form of an LCD display screen, a series of indicator lights, or any other means of indicating known to those of skill in the art. The beverage type indicator <b>96</b> serves to inform a user as to the type of beverage contained within beverage server <b>20</b>. For example, the beverage type indicator <b>96</b> may indicate that the beverage server <b>20</b> contains coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea, or any other beverage. The beverage type indicator <b>96</b> may be set by any number of manual or automatic means. For example, a user may select the type of beverage to be made from control panel <b>82</b> or the type of beverage to be made may be detected by a sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-19</figref> several illustrations of timing diagrams are provided. Timing diagrams provide a general graphic illustration of the methods of applying heat to a server using the temperature control system <b>80</b> of the present disclosure. Examples of times and time periods may be given but the timing diagrams provided herein are not limited to any specific time limitations. Rather, these timings diagrams are provided to provide illustrations which will be instructive to a user of the temperature control system disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the server starts out with no power to the heating element <b>41</b>. At time <b>200</b> an activation event occurs such as initiating a brew cycle by operating a brew switch. Upon activation (<b>200</b>) the system applies heat &#x201c;on&#x201d; to the server for a predetermined period of time t<b>1</b> or initial heating period. At the expiration of time t<b>1</b>, the heat is turned off (<b>202</b>). When the heat is turned off the beverage is allowed to cool &#x201c;coast&#x201d; for a period of time t<b>2</b> since heat energy is no longer being added to the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">At the end of time t<b>2</b> an event (<b>204</b>) may occur. Such an event may be locking out the server by controller <b>80</b> activating or locking out the dispense valve <b>38</b>. Also the event <b>204</b> may include activation of indicator light indicating that the time t<b>2</b> has expired. The times t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b> are programmable in length as preferred by the user for the various recipes, beverages, beverage producing substances used. For example the time t<b>1</b> may be 20 minutes as described above or any other period of time such as 30, 45, 1 hour, 1.25 hours, 1.5 hours. The time t<b>2</b> can be programmed for such time periods as well. Additionally, the event <b>204</b> may be the activation of a new brew cycle such that the entire timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is reset to point <b>200</b> shown thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The total length of time t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b>, or dispense time &#x201c;td&#x201d; can be determined by the user on each individual brew cycle or may be determined in a preprogrammed manner by saving it in the memory of controller <b>80</b> set a particular defined freshness period. As such, the &#x201c;freshness period&#x201d; generally corresponds to the dispense period of time, or the time period <b>200</b>-<b>204</b>, &#x201c;td&#x201d; as shown in the figures. This is a period of time that can be defined as the period of time during which there is no appreciable or significant change in the characteristics of the beverage during the heating cycles over the period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">the heating cycles, periods or pulses collectively define a heating time. This is the total time during which heat is applied to the beverage during the dispense time &#x201c;td&#x201d;. The heating time is the time which is determined to be suitable to maintain the beverage at a desired temperature or within a general temperature range without significant alteration of the characteristics of the beverage. In other words, any change in the flavor of the beverage, such as coffee, would be acceptable over a given period of time when an amount of heat energy, generally defined in terms of the &#x201c;heating time&#x201d; is applied to the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It should also be appreciated that the timing diagrams described herein can be used individually or may be combined in other patterns. As such these timing diagrams are not limited and do not limit the scope of the claims hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> a preheat period &#x201c;C&#x201d; is provided. &#x201c;t&#x201d; is a period of time that extends from the initiation of the brew cycle (<b>200</b>) to time period <b>206</b>. The time &#x201c;t&#x201d; allows the system to preheat the server <b>20</b> prior to dispensing beverage into the server. Actual brewing or other beverage preparation occurs at the delayed point in time (<b>206</b>). The time period t is defined in terms of time or temperature. In this regard, the time period &#x201c;t&#x201d; from <b>200</b> to <b>206</b> would be preset or defined by the user as a predetermined period of time in minutes and seconds. Alternatively, the system can use the temperature sensor to detect when a sufficient temperature in the server has been achieved. The remaining heating and determination of heating as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is similar to or identical to that as described herein above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an embodiment of the heating methods is shown in which the application of heat &#x201c;on&#x201d; is started in a similar manner to that as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this regard, heat is initially applied for period <b>200</b>-<b>202</b>, t<b>1</b>. At a predetermined time <b>202</b> heat is turned off. After initial heating, pulsing of heat &#x201c;on&#x201d; (<b>208</b>) can be provided at periodic intervals spaced by periods of no heat &#x201c;off&#x201d; (<b>210</b>). Pulsing can be initiated at the outset of the brew cycle <b>200</b> or may be continued for a period of time after initial heating. The pulsing <b>208</b> can provide incremental additional heat to the beverage to help maintain the temperature level of the beverage in the server. While the pulsing may be used to add the incremental heat without the potentially detrimental effects of continuous heating or &#x201c;cooking&#x201d; the beverage. While the temperature of the beverage may drop slightly during the &#x201c;off&#x201d; periods <b>210</b>, the on pulses <b>208</b> may be used to boost the level to help maintain the temperature. It may be found that the temperature may decline slightly throughout the pulses. In this regard, the pulses can be tailored through testing or other means to provide suitable pulse &#x201c;on&#x201d; (<b>208</b>) periods.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The pulses as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> may be continued for an indefinite period of time until the server is drained, until the server is removed from its power source or until the initiation of a new brew cycle. The condition of draining the server may be detected by a level sensor in the server or removal of the server from the power source such that removal from the power source results in resetting the temperature control system.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The timing diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is essentially a combination of the methods and timing diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As such, the pulses <b>208</b> are provided in combination with a preheating time &#x201c;t&#x201d; to preheat the server. By comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, it can be seen that the pulse &#x201c;on&#x201d; length may be varied depending on the results desired.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b> show additional variations of the timing diagrams and heating methods as described herein above. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a time period &#x201c;tx&#x201d; as defined as the period for a brew cycle. Brew cycle being defined from point <b>200</b> to point <b>212</b>. Time can be predetermined as a specific time in terms of minutes and seconds and can be programmed as an indefinite period of time related to the activation and deactivation of a brewing component such as a brewing water dispensing valve <b>81</b>. Brewing water dispensing valve <b>81</b> is illustratively provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> but it should be understood that this type of control can be found in the aforementioned patents incorporated herein by reference as well as other brewing systems. By using the brewing component, the event can be programmed but the specific period of the event can be left to a particular recipe. A variety of other brewing system components or sensors may be used to indicate the end of the brew cycle. Regardless of the component or method of sensing the end of the brew cycle it is envisioned that this can be used to easily and efficiently program the method and system of the temperature control system.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the method of setting the initial &#x201c;on&#x201d; heat period. &#x201c;tx&#x201d; for time period <b>200</b>-<b>212</b> is used in combination with heat pulsing similar to that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. This heat pulsing method may be used to achieve results similar to that as described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> herein above.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> provides yet a further variation on the timing diagram associated with the turning on and turning off of heat relative to the beverage. In this regard, heat is provided during the brew cycle time &#x201c;tx&#x201d; (<b>200</b>-<b>212</b>). It should also be appreciated that the method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> can be used similar to the methods as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>. Instead of the multiple, relatively short pulses as depicted in previous figures, a relatively long &#x201c;off&#x201d; pulse <b>210</b> and a relatively long &#x201c;on&#x201d; pulse <b>208</b> is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. It may determine depending on the characteristics of the beverage to be heated that it is preferably to provide the initial &#x201c;on&#x201d; heating time and then provide a relatively long &#x201c;off&#x201d; heating time. At the conclusion of the initial &#x201c;off&#x201d; heating time (<b>210</b>) a relatively long &#x201c;on&#x201d; heating time (<b>208</b>) may be provided. In this regard, the second relatively long heating period <b>208</b> may provide sufficient heat energy to elevate the temperature of the beverage without cooking the beverage to further extend the temperature and flavor freshness life of the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows yet a further variation in which the &#x201c;on&#x201d; pulses have variable length of time. In this regard, the initial on heating-time <b>200</b>-<b>212</b> may be keyed to any of the aforementioned initial heating times. After the initial heating time the &#x201c;on&#x201d; heating times may decrease in time such that the &#x201c;on&#x201d; pulse for period <b>208</b> is greater than the &#x201c;on&#x201d; pulse for period time <b>214</b>. In this regard, time periods <b>216</b> and time period <b>218</b> may also decrease. It will be appreciated that the &#x201c;off&#x201d; time periods <b>210</b> may be uniform between the &#x201c;on&#x201d; time periods or may be varied in length. Through a series of tests or other calculations optimal time &#x201c;on&#x201d; pulsing and &#x201c;off&#x201d; pulsing may be determined. In this regard, the temperature control system as disclosed herein and claimed hereafter is envisioned to provide complete flexibility in controlling these time periods either by the user or by the system automatically setting these time periods. Time periods may be automatically set by the system if the system is programmed to recognize a particular beverage preparation recipe or a particular type of beverage to be produced. Time periods may also be keyed to the quantity of beverage to be initially produced such that a larger quantity of beverage will create a larger heat sinking mass which may require more temperature initially, as well as may provide a longer &#x201c;coasting&#x201d; time during which the heating element <b>41</b> is turned &#x201c;off.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Still further variations on the control of the temperature are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> a maximum &#x201c;on&#x201d; power is shown (<b>220</b>). The maximum on power is correlated or designed to accommodate the particular beverage being brewed, brewing system or other beverage preparation system constraints. Considering the foregoing disclosure information related to pulsing times &#x201c;on&#x201d; and pulsing times &#x201c;off&#x201d; an additional variable, the level of power applicable to the heating element <b>41</b> can be combined. In this regard, the initial &#x201c;on&#x201d; time t<b>1</b> or tx may be used. Additionally a preheat time &#x201c;f&#x201d; may be used during this initial time period. Further, it should be appreciated that with any of the foregoing timing diagrams there is not a need for an initial lengthy time period, depending on the beverage being heated but rather timing may begin at the outset of the brew cycle or other time period.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, it is shown that the maximum power need not be applied throughout the entire heating cycle &#x201c;td&#x201d;. Rather, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the power during the &#x201c;on&#x201d; pulses (<b>208</b>) may actually decrease with each subsequent pulse. While such pulses are shown in generally equal decreasing steps, it is envisioned that a variety of techniques may be used to increase or decrease the power associated with each &#x201c;on&#x201d; pulse. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> it may be desirable to wrap up to a particular maximum heat (<b>220</b>). Once again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the pulse &#x201c;on&#x201d; duration and the pulse &#x201c;off&#x201d; duration may be equal, symmetrical or may be greater or smaller depending on the particular results to be achieved. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, one variation on such combinations of heating and pulsing would be to start out at a lower temperature and apply pulses of increasing heat energy. Additionally, it may be desirable to decrease the length of time the increased heat energy is applied thereby quickly adding a considerable amount of energy over a short period of time potentially lessening any detrimental effects associated with heating.</p>
