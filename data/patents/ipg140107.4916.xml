<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Exemplary Embodiment</heading>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Structure</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Hereinafter, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an image forming apparatus <b>1</b> according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In the present exemplary embodiment, the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> is a printer. The image forming apparatus <b>1</b> includes a controller <b>10</b>, a storage unit <b>20</b>, a communication unit <b>30</b>, an operation unit <b>40</b>, and an image forming unit <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The controller <b>10</b> includes a central processing unit (CPU), a read only memory (ROM), and a random access memory (RAM) (not shown). The CPU executes a control program stored in the ROM or the storage unit <b>20</b>, thereby controlling various members of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>. The storage unit <b>20</b> is a non-volatile storage device, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), and stores various programs and data. The communication unit <b>30</b> is an interface for performing communication with external apparatuses, such as a personal computer, through a USB cable or a communication network (such as a telephone line or a local area network (LAN)). The operation unit <b>40</b> includes a display device, a transparent touch panel superposed on a screen of the display device, and operation keys. The operation unit <b>40</b> receives an operation from a user through the touch panel and the operation keys, and provides information to the user by displaying an image on the display device. The image forming unit <b>50</b> forms an image on a recording medium (for example, a sheet of paper) by using a toner on the basis of an image signal supplied by the controller <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Next, the structure of the image forming unit <b>50</b> will be described in detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view of the image forming unit <b>50</b>. Two-dot chain line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a transport path of a recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The image forming unit <b>50</b> includes two sheet feeders <b>501</b><i>a </i>and <b>501</b><i>b</i>. The sheet feeders <b>501</b><i>a </i>and <b>501</b><i>b </i>are capable of containing different types (material and size) of recording media. For example, the sheet feeder <b>501</b><i>a </i>may contain high-quality paper, and the sheet feeder <b>501</b><i>b </i>may contain Japanese paper. The high-quality paper is an example of a recording medium having a small in-plane resistance variation, and the Japanese paper is an example of a recording medium having a large in-plane resistance variation. Here, the in-plane resistance variation is a quantity that represents two-dimensional variation of the electrical resistance (hereinafter simply referred to as a resistance) of a recording medium in the in-plane direction of the recording medium (i.e., not in the thickness direction). The in-plane resistance variation is calculated, for example, as the variance of the in-plane distribution of the resistance of the recording medium. Each of the sheet feeders <b>501</b><i>a </i>and <b>501</b><i>b </i>feeds recording media therefrom one by one at timings instructed by the controller <b>10</b>. Sheet transport rollers <b>502</b> transport the recording medium fed from the sheet feeder <b>501</b><i>a </i>or <b>501</b><i>b </i>to a second transfer unit, which is constituted by a second transfer roller <b>507</b> and a backup roller <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An exposure device <b>503</b> includes a laser light source and a polygon mirror. On the basis of an image signal supplied by the controller <b>10</b>, the exposure device <b>503</b> irradiates toner image forming units <b>504</b>Y, <b>504</b>M, <b>504</b>C, <b>504</b>K, <b>504</b>T<b>1</b>, and <b>504</b>T<b>2</b> with laser beams. In the present exemplary embodiment, the toner image forming units <b>504</b>Y, <b>504</b>M, <b>504</b>C, <b>504</b>K, <b>504</b>T<b>1</b>, and <b>504</b>T<b>2</b> constitute a toner image forming device that forms a toner image by using at least one of plural toners.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As described below in detail, the toner image forming units <b>504</b>Y, <b>504</b>M, <b>504</b>C, and <b>504</b>K respectively develop latent images, which have been formed on photoconductor drums due to laser irradiation by the exposure device <b>503</b>, by using yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan C, and black (K) color toners and thereby form color toner images. The toner images formed by the toner image forming units <b>504</b>Y, <b>504</b>M, <b>504</b>C, and <b>504</b>K are transferred (first-transferred) onto an intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> so as to overlap. The color toners described above have the same viscoelasticity, because the compositions of the color toners are the same except for the coloring agent such as pigment. That is, the difference in the viscoelasticity between the color toners is negligibly small as compared with the values of the viscoelasticities of the color toners.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The viscoelasticity of a toner is represented by, for example, the storage modulus. Because the storage modulus changes with the temperature, the viscoelasticity of a toner is determined so that that toner has a certain storage modulus at a predetermined temperature by using a curve representing the relationship between storage modulus and temperature. In the present exemplary embodiment, the storage modulus of a color toner is adjusted to, for example, about 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Pa at 80&#xb0; C. (which is an example of a predetermined temperature). The viscoelasticity (storage modulus) is adjusted by, for example, changing the type and amount of inorganic powder (inorganic particles) added to toner particles. The inorganic particles may be known inorganic particles, such as silica particles, titanium oxide particles, alumina particles, cerium oxide particles, or particles obtained by hydrophobizing the surfaces of such particles. A combination of two types of such known inorganic particles may be used. Surface-treated silica particles may be used. For example, silica particles that are surface-treated by using a silane coupling agent, a titanium coupling agent, a silicone oil, or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The gloss of a toner that is fixed on a recording medium is influenced by the viscoelasticity of the toner. The higher the viscoelasticity, the lower the gloss. Therefore, the viscoelasticity of the toner may be adjusted so that the toner has a predetermined gloss when a predetermined amount of toner is fixed on a specified recording medium (sheet). For example, the value of the viscoelasticity (storage modulus) of the color toners described above (about 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Pa at 80&#xb0; C.) is adjusted so that the gloss that is measured at a measurement angle of 60&#xb0; is 65&#xb1;5 when a toner (having a volume mean diameter=5.8 &#x3bc;m) in the amount in the range of 3.0 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to 4.0 g/m<sup>2 </sup>is fixed at 140&#xb0; C. on a high-quality coated paper having a basis weight of 127 g/m<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, the storage modulus of the color toners may be usually in the range of 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Pa to 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Pa at 80&#xb0; C., although the storage modulus may vary depending on the specified recording medium and the predetermined gloss. The volume mean diameter of a toner is measured, for example, by using a Coulter Multisizer II (made by Beckman Coulter Inc.) with an aperture diameter of 50 &#x3bc;m. The value 5.8 &#x3bc;m of the volume mean diameter of the toner is an example, and the volume mean diameter may have another value. In this case, the amount of toner per unit area of the sheet may be optimized so as to obtain a desired gloss.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first and second transparent toners are respectively made, for example, by adding silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) to a low-molecular weight polyester resin. The first and second transparent toners do not include a coloring agent such as a pigment (i.e., the pigment content is equal to or smaller than 0.01 mass %), and becomes colorless and transparent after being fixed. The first transparent toner and the second transparent toner have different viscoelasticities. To be specific, in the present exemplary embodiment, the storage modulus of the first transparent toner, which represents the viscoelasticity, is adjusted to about 2&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>Pa at 80&#xb0; C., and the storage modulus of the second transparent toner, which represents the viscoelasticity, is adjusted to about 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Pa at 80&#xb0; C. That is, in the present exemplary embodiment, the first transparent toner has a viscoelasticity that is higher than (in this example, about four times higher than) that of the color toners, and the second transparent toner has a viscoelasticity corresponding to that of the color toners. (In other words, the difference between the viscoelasticities of the second transparent toner and the color toners is negligibly small as compared with the value of the viscoelasticity of the second transparent toner or the color toners). Such viscoelasticity of the first transparent toner is obtained by adjusting the type and amount of the inorganic powder (inorganic particles) added to the toner particles as described above. The composition of the second transparent toner is the same as that of the color toners except that the second transparent toner does not include a coloring agent such as a pigment.

The photoconductor drum <b>5041</b>, which is an example of an image carrier having a charge-generating layer and a charge-transporting layer, is rotated in the direction of arrow A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (counterclockwise) by a drive unit (not shown). The charger <b>5042</b> charges a surface of the photoconductor drum <b>5041</b> to a predetermined potential. The charged surface of the photoconductor drum <b>5041</b> is exposed to a laser beam (exposure beam) emitted by the exposure device <b>503</b>, whereby an electrostatic latent image is formed. The developing device <b>5043</b>, which is a tandem-type developing device in this example, contains toner (such as the yellow toner or the first transparent toner), which is a developer, and generates a potential difference (development bias) between the developing device <b>5043</b> and the surface of a corresponding photoconductor drum <b>5041</b>. The toner contained in the developing device <b>5043</b> is attached to the electrostatic latent image, which has been formed on the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>5041</b>, due to the potential difference, whereby a toner image is formed on the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>5041</b>.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> is an endless belt that is supported by belt transport rollers <b>506</b> with a tension. At least one of the belt transport rollers <b>506</b> has a drive unit, and rotates the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> in a direction indicated by arrow B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. At this time, other belt transport rollers <b>506</b> that do not have a drive unit are rotated by the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>. As the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> rotates in the direction indicated by arrow B, the toner images, which have been transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> by the toner image forming units <b>504</b>, move to the second transfer unit, which is constituted by the second transfer roller <b>507</b> and the backup roller <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second transfer roller <b>507</b> and the backup roller <b>508</b> generate a potential difference between the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> and the second transfer roller <b>507</b> at a position at which the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> faces the recording medium. Due to the potential difference (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;second transfer voltage&#x201d;), the toner images on the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> are transferred (second-transferred) to a recording medium that is nipped between the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> and the second transfer roller <b>507</b>. It is necessary that the second transfer voltage be at an appropriate level because, if the second transfer voltage is too low, an electric field generated between the second transfer roller <b>507</b> and the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> is not sufficiently strong and the toners on the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> are not normally transferred to the recording medium, and if the second transfer voltage is too high, discharge occurs between the second transfer roller <b>507</b> and the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> and the toners are not normally transferred to the recording medium. The second transfer voltage is usually determined at an optimal value in accordance with the basis weight (weight per unit area) of the recording medium. The basis weight of the recording medium differs depending on the material and the thickness of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The recording medium, onto which the toner images have been transferred, is transferred to a fixing unit <b>509</b>. The fixing unit <b>509</b> includes a heating roller <b>5091</b> and a pressing roller <b>5092</b>. The recording medium is heated and pressed while passing between the heating roller <b>5091</b> and the pressing roller <b>5092</b>, and thereby the toner images, which have been transferred to the recording medium by the second transfer unit, are fixed on the recording medium. The recording medium, on which the toner images have been fixed, passes between output rollers <b>510</b> and is output to an output tray <b>511</b> that is disposed on the upper surface of the image forming unit <b>50</b>.</p>

The in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> measures the optical density of a toner image fixed on the recording medium. Therefore, the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> is disposed downstream of the second transfer unit in the transport direction of the sheet. Here, the optical density (hereinafter simply referred to as &#x201c;density&#x201d;) refers to the density of an image that is defined by, for example, D=log<sub>10 </sub>(1/R), where R is the reflectivity of a relevant part of the image. The in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> may include a light emitting member that irradiates a transported recording medium with light having a predetermined intensity, a CCD optical sensor that receives reflected light reflected from the recording medium, and a mirror that guides the reflected light to the optical sensor (see, for example, FIG. 11 of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication 2010-169958 (Patent Document 2)). The optical sensor transmits a signal representing the intensity of the received reflected light to the controller <b>10</b>. The controller <b>10</b> calculates the optical density on the basis of the intensity of the reflected light represented by the signal received from the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> and the predetermined intensity of light emitted from the light emitting member.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> measures the densities (reflectivities) of parts of a toner image formed on the recording medium, and thereby obtains the two-dimensional density distribution of the toner image.

Alternatively, plural light emitting members and optical sensors may be arranged in a direction that intersects the transport direction of the recording medium. In other words, the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> may have any structure as long as the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> is capable of generating a signal that represents the two-dimensional density distribution of a toner image formed on the recording medium.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of determining the in-plane resistance variation of a recording medium according to the present exemplary embodiment. The process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is started, for example, when a user sets a recording medium to be used in the sheet feeder <b>501</b><i>a </i>or <b>501</b><i>b</i>, and selects the resistance variation determination mode by operating the operation unit <b>40</b>. The selection of the resistance variation determination mode is enabled, for example, by providing a hardware button for selecting the resistance variation determination mode on the operation unit <b>40</b> and detecting that a user presses the hardware button or by displaying a software button on the display device of the operation unit <b>40</b> and detecting that a user touches a position at which the software button is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step S<b>1</b>, the display controller <b>140</b> displays a screen that prompts a user to input the basis weight of the recording medium, whose resistance variation is to be determined, on the display device of the operation unit <b>40</b>. If the controller <b>10</b> determines in step S<b>2</b> that the basis weight has been input by the user through the operation unit <b>40</b>, the process proceeds to step S<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step S<b>3</b>, the second transfer voltage controller <b>150</b> acquires a second transfer voltage VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the input basis weight. The voltage VT<b>1</b> may be calculated on the basis of a predetermined formula. Alternatively, the second transfer voltage VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the input basis weight may be acquired by referring a table that is stored in the storage unit <b>20</b> beforehand and that stores correspondence between the values of the basis weight and the values of the second transfer voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step S<b>4</b>, the image signal generating unit <b>120</b> sends a reference density image signal used for determining the resistance variation to the image forming unit <b>50</b>, and the image forming unit <b>50</b> forms an image on the recording medium set in the sheet feeder <b>501</b><i>a </i>or <b>501</b><i>b </i>on the basis of the reference density image signal. The reference density image signal is a signal indicating that, for example, single-colored (for example, cyan) images having a predetermined density (for example, a density of 100% assuming that the maximum density available with the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> is 100%) are to be formed in plural regions of one recording medium without using a transparent toner. That is, if a toner transfer failure does not occur, the images formed in the regions of the recording medium on the basis of the reference density image signal have no density variation. In this example, the reference density image signal is a signal indicating that cyan single-color images having a density of 100% are to be formed in three regions (first to third regions) of one recording medium. On the basis of such a reference density image signal, the toner image forming unit <b>504</b>C of the image forming unit <b>50</b> forms three cyan single-color toner images and transfers the toner images to the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>. The second transfer unit transfers the toner images, which have been transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>, to the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In step S<b>4</b>, when forming the images in the first to third regions of the recording medium, the second transfer voltage controller <b>150</b> controls the second transfer voltage as follows. When transferring a toner image from the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> to the first region of the recording medium, the second transfer voltage is set at VT<b>1</b>, which has been acquired in step S<b>2</b>. When transferring a toner image to the second region, the second transfer voltage is set at VT<b>2</b> that is lower than VT<b>1</b>. When transferring a toner image is to the third region, the second transfer voltage is set at VT<b>3</b> that is higher than VT<b>1</b>. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, three images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b> corresponding to the three second transfer voltages VT<b>1</b> to VT<b>3</b> are formed on one recording medium. The three images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b> on the recording medium are fixed by the fixing unit <b>509</b>, and the recording medium passes the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b>. At this time, the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> generates a signal indicating two-dimensional density distributions of the images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b>, and sends the signal to the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In step S<b>5</b>, on the basis of the signal from the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b>, the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b> measures the variation of the density of each of the images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b>, which have been formed in step S<b>4</b>, in an in-plane direction of the recording medium (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;in-plane density variation&#x201d;). To be specific, the variance of the two-dimensional density distribution of each of the image I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b> (i.e., the variance of densities at plural points that are distributed two-dimensionally in the images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b>) is obtained as a value representing the in-plane density variation of each of the images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b>. The variance of the two-dimensional density distribution of each of the images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b> is an example of a characteristic value representing the density variation at plural points in each of the images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph illustrating an example of a measurement result of the in-plane density variation when high-quality paper (basis weight=82 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and Japanese paper (basis weight=82 g/m<sup>2</sup>) are used as the recording medium. (In this example, the in-plane density variation is the variance of the two-dimensional density distribution of each of the images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b>). In this example, the second transfer voltage VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight (82 g/m<sup>2</sup>) is 2.0 kV, the voltage VT<b>2</b> lower than voltage VT<b>1</b> is 1.0 kV, and the voltage VT<b>3</b> higher than voltage VT<b>1</b> is 3.0 kV.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when high-quality paper is used as the recording medium and the second transfer voltage is VT<b>2</b> or VT<b>3</b>, the in-plane density variation is large. In contrast, when the second transfer voltage is VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight of the recording medium, the density variation is negligibly small. This is interpreted as follows. When high-quality paper, which has a small in-plane resistance variation, is used as the recording medium and the second transfer voltage is set at VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight, toner that has been transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> is transferred to the recording medium without a transfer failure or with only a slight transfer failure, whereby the obtained image (I<b>1</b>) has only a small in-plane density variation. In contrast, when the second transfer voltage is set at VT<b>2</b> or VT<b>3</b>, a shortage in the electric field used to transfer the toner or discharge may occur in the regions on which the image I<b>2</b> or I<b>3</b> are to be formed, whereby parts to which the toner is not normally transferred to the recording medium may be generated randomly. As a result, a density difference may arise between a part of the recording medium to which the toner is normally transferred and a part of the recording medium to which the toner is not normally transferred (that is, part or all of the toner to be transferred to the latter part of the recording medium remains on the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>). Thus, when high-quality paper is used as the recording medium, there is a large difference between (the absolute values of) the in-plane density variation of an image formed on the recording medium on the basis of the reference density image signal when the second transfer voltage is set at V<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight and the in-plane density variation of an image formed on the recording medium when the second transfer voltage is set at VT<b>2</b>, which is lower than VT<b>1</b>, or at VT<b>3</b>, which is higher than VT<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the other hand, when Japanese paper is used as the recording medium, the in-plane density variations are large in all three cases where the second transfer voltage is VT<b>1</b>, VT<b>2</b>, and VT<b>3</b>, and there is substantially no difference between the in-plane density variations in these cases. This is interpreted as follows. When Japanese paper, which has a large in-plane resistance variation, is used as the recording medium and the second transfer voltage is set at VT<b>2</b>, which is lower than VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight, an appropriate voltage (or electric field) is generated between the recording medium and the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> and the toner is normally transferred to a part of the recording medium having a low resistance. However, the toner is not normally transferred to a part of the recording medium having a high resistance, because the voltage is insufficient. Therefore, a density difference arises between the part having a high resistance and the part having a low resistance, which leads to a large in-plane density variation. When the second transfer voltage is set at VT<b>3</b>, which is higher than VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight, an appropriate voltage is generated between the recording medium and the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> and the toner is normally transferred to a part of the recording medium having a high resistance. However, the toner is not normally transferred to a part of the recording medium having a low resistance, because the voltage is too high and discharge occurs. Therefore, a density difference arises between the part having a high resistance and the part having a low resistance, which leads to a large in-plane density variation. When the second transfer voltage is set at VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight, transfer failures may randomly occur in a part having a low resistance and a part having a high resistance. Also in this case, a large in-plane density variation occurs in an obtained image. Thus, when Japanese paper is used as the recording medium, there is only a small difference between (the absolute values of) the in-plane density variation of an image formed on the recording medium on the basis of the reference density image signal when the second transfer voltage is set at V<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight and the in-plane density variation of an image formed on the recording medium on the basis of the reference density image signal when the second transfer voltage is set at VT<b>2</b>, which is lower than VT<b>1</b>, or at VT<b>3</b>, which is higher than VT<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present exemplary embodiment, whether the in-plane resistance variation of a recording medium is larger than a predetermined value is determined on the basis of the relationship between the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium and the in-plane density variation of an image formed on the recording medium on the basis of the reference density image signal. To be specific, in step S<b>6</b> of the flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b> determines whether (the absolute value of) the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the in-plane density variations of the images I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b>, and I<b>3</b>, which have been obtained in step S<b>5</b>, is smaller than a predetermined threshold. If the difference is smaller than the threshold (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; in step S<b>6</b>), the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b> determines that the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is larger than the predetermined value (step S<b>7</b>). If the difference is equal to or larger than the threshold (&#x201c;NO&#x201d; in step S<b>6</b>), the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b> determines that the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is equal or smaller than the predetermined value (step S<b>8</b>). That is, in this case, the in-plane density variations of the images I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b>, and I<b>3</b> obtained in step S<b>5</b> or the signal representing the two-dimensional density distributions of the images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b>, which are transmitted from the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> and used for calculating the in-plane density variations of the images I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b>, and I<b>3</b> correspond to an example of characteristic information that represents a characteristic of in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After determining the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium in steps S<b>7</b> and S<b>8</b>, the process proceeds to step S<b>9</b>. In step S<b>9</b>, the controller <b>10</b> stores, in a table, correspondence between an identifier of the recording medium (such as a number that is automatically allocated by the controller <b>10</b> or the product name of the recording medium input by a user) and information representing whether the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is larger than a predetermined value (such as a flag having a value 0 if the in-plane resistance variation is larger than the predetermined value and having a value 1 if the in-plane resistance variation is equal to or smaller than the predetermined value), and finishes the resistance variation determination mode.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a table T<b>1</b>, which is an example of such a table.

The table T<b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> stores correspondence among a number allocated by the controller <b>10</b>, the product names of recording media, and values of a flag representing whether the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is larger than a predetermined value.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When, for example, a user sets a recording medium in the sheet feeder <b>501</b><i>a </i>or <b>501</b><i>b</i>, the controller <b>10</b> accesses the storage unit <b>20</b> or the external apparatus and refers to the table T<b>1</b> and displays the content of the table T<b>1</b> on the display device of the operation unit <b>40</b> before the user selects the resistance variation determination mode.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As described above, when the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> is in the normal operation mode, the image signal generating unit <b>120</b> generates image signals corresponding to the toners on the basis of the image data, which is input from the image data acquiring unit <b>110</b>, and the determination result related to the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium, which is input from the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> in the normal operation mode. In step S<b>11</b>, the image signal generating unit <b>120</b> determines whether the information representing the determination result, which is input from the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b>, indicates that the in-plane resistance variation of the currently-used recording medium is large. If the image signal generating unit <b>120</b> determines that the information representing the determination result, which is input from the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b>, indicates that the in-plane resistance variation of the currently-used recording medium is large (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; in step S<b>11</b>), the process proceeds as follows. In step S<b>12</b>, the image signal generating unit <b>120</b> performs color separation of the image data that is input from the image data acquiring unit <b>110</b> and generates image signals corresponding to yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (c), and black (K). Moreover, the image signal generating unit <b>120</b> generates an image signal corresponding to the first transparent toner so that the first transparent toner, which has a viscoelasticity higher than that of the color toners, forms an image that covers the entire surface of the recording medium (from which a margin may be excluded). In step S<b>13</b>, the image forming unit <b>50</b> forms an image on the recording medium on the basis of the image signals sent from the image signal generating unit <b>120</b>. At this time, the second transfer voltage controller <b>150</b> sets a comparatively low second transfer voltage that enables a toner image to be normally transferred to a part of the recording medium having a low resistance (for example, a voltage VT<b>2</b>, which is lower than the voltage VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Because the first transparent toner image forming unit <b>504</b>T<b>1</b> of the image forming unit <b>50</b> is disposed upstream of the color toner image forming units <b>504</b>Y, <b>504</b>M, <b>504</b>C, and <b>504</b>K in the direction in which the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> moves, the transparent toner image formed by the first transparent toner is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> before the toner images formed by the color toners are transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>. Therefore, the transparent toner image formed by the first transparent toner forms the lowermost layer (a layer closest to the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>) on the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>, and the toner images formed by the color toners are superposed on the transparent toner image. The toner images transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> are transported to the second transfer unit as described above, and the second transfer unit transfers the toner images to the recording medium. As a result, the transparent toner image formed by the first transparent toner forms the uppermost layer on the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic sectional view illustrating the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> and a recording medium after the second transfer is finished. This second transfer is performed under the following condition: a comparatively low voltage that is suitable for a part of the recording medium having a low resistance is set as the second transfer voltage, a transparent toner and a color toner are used, and a recording medium having a resistance variation is used. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a region R<b>1</b> is a part of the recording medium having a low resistance and a region R<b>2</b> is a part of the recording medium having a high resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, all toners, including the transparent toner, are normally transferred from the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> to the region R<b>1</b> of the recording medium, because the region R<b>1</b> having a low resistance is subjected to an appropriate transfer electric field. That is, no toner remains on the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>. The color toner is entirely transferred to the region R<b>2</b> of the recording medium, while a part of the transparent toner remains on the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> because the region R<b>2</b> having a high resistance is subjected to an insufficient transfer electric field. In other words, the transparent toner serves to reduce adhesion of the color toner to the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> and thereby assists the transfer of the color toner. Thus, even if a recording medium having a large resistance variation is used, the color toner is normally transferred from the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> to all parts of the recording medium by using the transparent toner and by setting a voltage that is suitable for a part of a recording medium having a low resistance as the second transfer voltage (for example, a voltage VT<b>2</b> lower than the voltage VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight). Note that, although one color toner is used in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, plural (any of Y, M, C, and K toners) may be used. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the amount of the transparent toner transferred to the recording medium has variation in the in-plane direction of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a graph illustrating the in-plane density variation of an image formed on Japanese paper in the following three cases: (1) a case where a transparent toner is not used, (2) a case where a second transparent toner having a viscoelasticity substantially the same as that of the color toners is used as the transparent toner, and (3) a case where a first transparent toner having a viscoelasticity higher than that of the color toners is used. In each of these cases, the second transfer voltage is set at the voltage VT<b>2</b>, which is lower than the voltage VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight, and a single-color cyan image having a density of 100% is formed on Japanese paper.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the second transparent toner having substantially the same viscoelasticity as the color toners is used as the transparent toner, the density variation of an obtained image is larger than that when a transparent toner is not used. This is interpreted as follows. When the transparent toner is used in order to improve transfer of a color toner to the recording medium, the variation of the transfer of the color toner is reduced. However, because the amount of the transparent toner transferred to the recording medium has variation as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, variation of gloss due to the variation of the transferred amount of the transparent toner is detected as a density variation of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In contrast, the density variation of an image obtained by using the present exemplary embodiment (in which the first transparent toner is used) is reduced as compared with the case where a transparent toner is not used. The transferred amount of the transparent toner has variation also when the present exemplary embodiment is used. However, higher the viscoelasticity of a toner, smaller the variation in gloss relative to the transferred amount of the toner. Therefore, with the present exemplary embodiment, in which the first transparent toner having a viscoelasticity higher than that of the color toners is used, it is unlikely that the variation of the transferred amount of the first transparent toner is detected as a variation of gloss. Accordingly, the density variation of the image is smaller than that in the case where the second transparent toner is used. That is, the present exemplary embodiment uses the first transparent toner, which has a viscoelasticity higher than that of the color toner, for a recording medium having a large in-plane resistance variation such as Japanese paper, and thereby reduces variation of the transferred amount of the color toner due to the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium and suppresses variation of gloss due to the variation of the transferred amount of the first transparent toner on the recording medium. As a result, the density variation of an obtained image is reduced. Because the viscoelasticity of the first transparent toner is higher than that of the color toners, the gloss of an image formed on the recording medium is influenced by only the first transparent toner, which forms the uppermost layer on the recording medium, and is not influenced by the color toner. The viscoelasticity (storage modulus) of the first transparent toner may be equal to or higher than twice the viscoelasticity (storage modulus) of the color toners at the same temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if it is determined in step S<b>11</b> that the determination result, which is input from the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b>, indicates that the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is small (&#x201c;NO&#x201d; in step S<b>11</b>), the process proceeds as follows. In step S<b>14</b>, the image signal generating unit <b>120</b> generates image signals corresponding to yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (c), and black (K) from the image data that is input from the image data acquiring unit <b>110</b>. Moreover, the image signal generating unit <b>120</b> generates an image signal corresponding to the second transparent toner so that the second transparent toner, which has a viscoelasticity corresponding to that of the color toners, forms an image. In step S<b>15</b>, the image forming unit <b>50</b> forms an image on the recording medium on the basis of an image signal sent from the image signal generating unit <b>120</b>. The toner image may be formed by the second transparent toner so as to correct, for example, the variation of the height of the toner images formed by the color toners (i.e., the amount of the second transparent toner is small in a part where the height of the color toner layers is large, and the amount of the second transparent toner is large in a part where the height of the color toner layers is small). As described above, when a recording medium having a low in-plane resistance variation such as high-quality paper is used, the toners, including the transparent toner, are normally transferred from the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>, so that unintentional variation of the transferred amount of the transparent toner does not occur on the recording medium. As described above, the composition of the second transparent toner may be the same as that of the color toners except that the second transparent toner does not include a coloring agent. However, the composition of the second transparent toner is not limited thereto. The second transparent toner may have any composition as long as (the absolute value of) the difference between the storage modulus (viscoelasticity) of the second transparent toner and the storage modulus of the color toners is smaller than (the absolute value of) the difference between the storage modulus (viscoelasticity) of the first transparent toner and the storage modulus of the color toners and the variation of gloss due to variation of the height of the color toner images are corrected by using the second transparent toner. Note that this gloss control using the second transparent toner may be omitted.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The exemplary embodiment described above may be modified as follows. The following modifications may be used in combination.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">First Modification</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the exemplary embodiment described above, single-color images having a predetermined density (for example, cyan images having a density of 100%) are formed in plural regions of the recording medium by applying different second transfer voltages (VT<b>1</b>, VT<b>2</b>, and VT<b>3</b>) without using a transparent toner. If the density variation of the images (I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b>, and I<b>3</b>) is within a predetermined range, it is determined that the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is larger than a predetermined value. The present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the in-plane resistance variation of a recording medium may be determined in the following way.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of determining the in-plane resistance variation of a recording medium according to the first modification. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the steps the same as those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are denoted by the same numerals and detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In step S<b>3</b>, the second transfer voltage VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight is acquired. In step S<b>34</b>, the image signal generating unit <b>120</b> sends a reference density image signal for determining the resistance variation to the image forming unit <b>50</b>, and the image forming unit <b>50</b> forms an image (first image) on the recording medium on the basis of the reference density image signal. In the present modification, the reference density image signal is a signal indicating that a cyan single-color image having a density of 100% is to be formed in a predetermined region of the recording medium (for example, the entire region of the recording medium excluding a margin). The toner image forming unit <b>504</b>C of the image forming unit <b>50</b> forms the cyan single-color toner image on the basis of the reference density image signal, and transfers the toner image to the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>. The second transfer unit transfers the toner image from the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> to the recording medium. Moreover, in step S<b>34</b>, the image forming unit <b>50</b> sets the second transfer voltage at VT<b>2</b>, which is lower than the voltage VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step S<b>35</b>, the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b> calculates the in-plane density variation of the image formed in step S<b>34</b> on the basis of a signal from the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> (i.e., a signal representing the two-dimensional density distribution of the image formed in step S<b>34</b>). Also in the present modification, the in-plane density variation is calculated as the variance of two-dimensional density distribution of the image formed on the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step S<b>36</b>, the image forming unit <b>50</b> forms an image on the basis of the reference density image signal the same as that used in step S<b>34</b> so as to be superimposed on the image that has been formed on the recording medium in step S<b>34</b>. That is, the toner image forming unit <b>504</b>C of the image forming unit <b>50</b> forms a cyan single-color toner image on the basis of the same reference density image signal and transfers the image to the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b>. The second transfer unit transfers the toner image from the intermediate transfer belt <b>505</b> so as to be superimposed on the image that has been formed on the recording medium in step S<b>34</b> (the image obtained after the second-time transfer will be referred to as the second image). In step S<b>36</b>, the image forming unit <b>50</b> sets the second transfer voltage at VT<b>3</b>, which is higher than VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight. The operation of forming and superimposing the image on the image that has been formed on the recording medium may be performed by returning the recording medium on which the image has been formed to the second transfer unit by using a known medium-reversing mechanism (not shown). Alternatively, a user return the recording medium to the sheet feeder <b>501</b><i>a </i>or <b>501</b><i>b </i>after the recording medium has been output to the output tray <b>511</b> after the first-time second transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In step S<b>37</b>, the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b> measures the in-plane density variation of the image formed in step S<b>36</b> on the basis of a signal from the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> (i.e., a signal representing the two-dimensional density distribution of the image formed in step S<b>36</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a graph illustrating the in-plane density variation after the first-time transfer and the in-plane density variation after the second-time transfer when transfer is performed twice at the different second transfer voltages onto the same surface of each of Japanese paper (basis weight=82 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and high-quality paper (basis weight=82 g/m<sup>2</sup>) so as to form images that overlap. In this example, as with the exemplary embodiment described above, the second transfer voltage VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight (82 g/m<sup>2</sup>) is 2.0 kV, the voltage VT<b>2</b> lower than the voltage VT<b>1</b> is 1.0 kV, and the voltage VT<b>3</b> higher than voltage VT<b>1</b> is 3.0 kV. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in the case of Japanese paper, the in-plane density variation after the second-time transfer is substantially smaller than the in-plane density variation after the first-time transfer. This is interpreted as follows. Japanese paper has a large in-plane resistance variation. Therefore, in the first-time transfer, which is performed with a relatively low second transfer voltage VT<b>2</b>, a part of the recording medium having a low resistance is subjected to an appropriate electric field and the toner is appropriately transferred in the part, while a part of the recording medium having a high resistance is subjected to an insufficient electric field and density variation occurs in the part. When the second-time transfer is performed at a relatively high second transfer voltage VT<b>3</b>, the part of the recording medium having a high resistance is subjected to an appropriate electric field and the toner is appropriately transferred. The electric field weakens before the second-time transfer due to discharge, so that the toner is not appropriately transferred to the part having a low resistance in the second transfer. However, the toner has been transferred to the part in the first transfer. That is, in the case of Japanese paper, by performing transfer twice at different second transfer voltages, the toner is transferred to the part having a low resistance and to the part having a high resistance. As a result, the in-plane density variation of an image after the second-time transfer is smaller than that after the first-time transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In contrast, in the case of high-quality paper, the in-plane density variation after the second-time transfer is not smaller than that after the first-time transfer. This is interpreted as follows. The high-quality paper has a small in-plane resistance variation. Therefore, in the first-time transfer, which is performed with a relatively low second transfer voltage VT<b>2</b>, randomly-distributed parts of the recording medium are subjected to an appropriate electric field and transfer failure of the toner randomly occurs in the image forming region, whereby the in-plane density variation occurs. When the second-time transfer is performed at the relatively high second transfer voltage VT<b>3</b>, discharge randomly occurs in the image formation region and transfer failure of the toner randomly occurs. Thus, in the case of high-quality paper, transfer failure randomly occurs in the first-time and in the second-time transfer, so that the in-plane density variation of the image due to transfer failure is not reduced even when transfer is performed twice.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the first modification, whether the in-plane resistance variation is larger than a predetermined value is determined on the basis of the above-described relationship between the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium and the in-plane density variation of the image formed on the recording medium. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in step S<b>38</b>, the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b> determines whether the in-plane density variation of an image obtained after the second transfer is smaller than the in-plane density variation of an image obtained after the first transfer when the first-time and second-time transfer have been performed at different second transfer voltages so as to form overlapping images on the same surface of the recording medium. If the in-plane density variation of the image obtained after the second transfer is smaller than the in-plane density variation of the image obtained after the first transfer (&#x201c;YES&#x201d; in step S<b>38</b>), the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b> determines that the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is larger than a predetermined value (step S<b>7</b>). In the in-plane density variation of the image obtained after the second transfer is equal to or larger than the in-plane density variation of an image obtained after the first transfer (&#x201c;NO&#x201d; in step S<b>38</b>), the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b> determines that the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is smaller than a predetermined value (step S<b>8</b>). That is, in this example, the in-plane density variation of an image obtained after the first-time transfer, which is measured in step S<b>35</b>, and the in-plane density variation of an image obtained after the second transfer, which is measured in step S<b>37</b>, or a signal that is sent from the in-line sensor unit <b>550</b> and that is used for calculating these in-plane density variations correspond to an example of characteristic information that represents a characteristic of the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">After determining the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium in steps S<b>7</b> and S<b>8</b>, the process proceeds to step S<b>9</b>. In step S<b>9</b>, the controller <b>10</b> stores correspondence between an identifier of a recording medium and information representing whether the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is larger than a predetermined value in the table T<b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and finishes the resistance variation determination mode.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the first modification described above, the second transfer voltage for the first-time transfer may be set at VT<b>3</b>, which is higher than VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight, and the second transfer voltage for the second transfer may be set at VT<b>2</b>, which is lower than VT<b>1</b> determined in accordance with the basis weight.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Second Modification</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the exemplary embodiment described above, when the resistance variation determination mode is selected by a user's operation on the operation unit <b>40</b>, whether the in-plane resistance variation of a recording medium is larger than a predetermined value is determined by forming an image on the recording medium by the image forming unit <b>50</b> on the basis of the reference density image signal and by analyzing the formed image. However, determination of the in-plane resistance variation of a recording medium according to the present invention is not limited to the determination performed in the resistance variation determination mode.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, the in-plane resistance variations of various recording media may be measured in a factory beforehand, and a table (for example, the table T<b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) that stores correspondence between the identifier (for example, the product name) of the recording media and a flag (which is an example of characteristic information) representing whether the in-plane resistance variation of each of the recording media is larger than a predetermined value may be stored, for example, in the storage unit <b>20</b> or in an external apparatus that is connected through the communication unit <b>30</b>. When, for example, a user sets a recording medium in the sheet feeder <b>501</b><i>a </i>or <b>501</b><i>b</i>, the controller <b>10</b> displays the content of the table on the display device of the operation unit <b>40</b>. Then, the user may specify the recording medium set in the sheet feeder <b>501</b><i>a </i>or <b>501</b><i>b </i>among the displayed recording media by operating the operation unit <b>40</b>. When the user specifies the recording medium, the resistance variation determination unit <b>130</b> refers to the table and acquires the value of the flag corresponding to the recording medium and determines whether the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is larger than a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this case, if the value of the flag corresponding to the recording medium that the user has set in the sheet feeder <b>501</b><i>a </i>or <b>501</b><i>b </i>is not stored in the table, the user may select the resistance variation determination mode described above. (For example, a button for selecting the resistance variation determination mode may be displayed on the display device of the operation unit <b>40</b>). If the user selects the resistance variation determination mode and the determination result of the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is obtained in the resistance variation determination mode, the controller <b>10</b> additionally stores a correspondence between the identifier of the recording medium and information representing the determination result in the table.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The information stored in the table and representing the characteristic of the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is not limited to the flag representing whether the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium is larger than a predetermined value.

Examples such information include data on two-dimensional distribution of the in-plane electrical resistance of the recording medium (in-plane resistance distribution) and the variance of the in-plane resistance distribution calculated by using the data. The recording sheet used need not be specified by operating the operation unit <b>40</b>. When, for example, the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> performs printing on a request from an external apparatus such as a personal computer, the content of the table may be displayed on the external apparatus so as to allow a user to specify the recording medium by operating the external apparatus.</p>

For example, the three images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b> corresponding to the three second transfer voltages VT<b>1</b> to VT<b>3</b> may be formed on three recording media of the same type (i.e., having the same identifier (for example, the product name)). It is not necessary that the three images I<b>1</b> to I<b>3</b> corresponding to the three second transfer voltage VT<b>1</b> to VT<b>3</b> be formed.

However, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, as described in the paragraph [0010] of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication 2007-4066 (Patent Document 1), the in-plane resistance distribution of the recording medium may be measured by using a dielectric relaxation measuring apparatus, the in-plane resistance variation of the recording medium may be calculated as the variance of the in-plane resistance distribution, and whether the calculated in-plane resistance variation is larger than a predetermined value may be determined.</p>
