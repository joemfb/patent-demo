<p id="p-0001" num="0000">According to some embodiments, a central platform may receive one or more publication preferences associated with a consumer. Based on the publication preferences, the central platform may access a publication database to identify a publication potentially of interest to the consumer. At least one retail location where the identified publication may be currently available can be determined based at least in part on a current location associated with the consumer. A notification message may then be transmitted to a consumer device to indicate the at least one retail location.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Some embodiments relate to mobile consumer devices and printed publications. More specifically, some embodiments provide consumer notifications via mobile consumer devices, wherein the notifications are associated with the availability of printed publications at nearby retail locations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Printed publications may be made available for sale to consumers at various times. For example, a new comic book in a particular series might become available on a weekly or monthly basis. Moreover, different publication series typically become available on different schedules (e.g., on different days of the week or different dates in the month). As a result, it can be difficult for a consumer to remember or otherwise be aware that a new publication is available, especially when he or she is potentially interested in a substantial number of different publication series.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Moreover, a consumer may be interested in new publications that are written by a particular author, that were drawn by his or her favorite illustrator, and/or that feature a particular character (e.g., a villain). All of these factors can make it more difficult for the consumer to be aware when publications of interest become available. Further, even if a consumer is aware that a new publication of interest is available, he or she might not know where the publication is sold (e.g., when he or she is traveling in an unfamiliar town). In addition, there might be no simple way for the consumer to contact one or more retail locations (e.g., to ask whether or not a particular comic book is currently in stock).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, methods and mechanisms to efficiently and automatically transmit consumer notifications associated with printed publication retail locations may be provided by some embodiments herein.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">At various times, printed publications may be made available for sale to consumers. For example, a new comic book in a particular series might become available on a weekly or monthly basis. Moreover, different publication series typically become available on different schedules (e.g., on different days of the week or different dates in the month). As a result, it can be difficult for a consumer to remember or otherwise be aware that a publication is available, especially when he or she is potentially interested in a substantial number of different publication series.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a system <b>100</b> according to some embodiments. In particular, the system <b>100</b> includes a central platform <b>110</b> in communication with a number of mobile consumer devices <b>120</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;central platform&#x201d; <b>110</b> may be associated with, for example, a mobile device application, an email server, a wireless telephone service, a social media network, a web platform, and/or a web site user database. Moreover, the term &#x201c;mobile consumer device&#x201d; <b>120</b> may refer to, for example, a Personal Computer (PC), a mobile or laptop computer, a wireless telephone, a smartphone, a gaming device, a tablet computer, and/or an electronic book reader. According to some embodiments, the central platform <b>110</b> stores information about consumers, such as publication preferences associated with each consumer (e.g., indicating which comic book series are of particular interest) and/or purchase history information (e.g., indicating which comic books he or she has purchased in the past).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The central platform <b>110</b> is further in communication with a publication database <b>130</b>. The publication database <b>130</b> may, for example, store information about recently issued publications, including comic book series identifiers, comic book characters, comic book illustrators, comic book authors, and/or comic book genres. The central platform <b>110</b> may also be in communication with a retailer apparatus <b>140</b> (e.g., a computer or database associated with a comic book stores) and/or third-party services <b>150</b> (e.g., the central platform <b>110</b> might communicate with mobile consumer device <b>120</b> via social networking web sites).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Some or all of the devices illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be associated with Web browsers to access services and information provided by the central platform <b>110</b> via HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) communication and/or the Internet. For example, a consumer may manipulate a user interface of a mobile consumer device <b>120</b> to input information (e.g., &#x201c;I am interested in the following comic book series . . . &#x201d;). Examples of a Web client that might execute at a mobile consumer device <b>120</b> include, but are not limited to, a Web browser, an execution engine (e.g., JAVA, Flash, Silverlight) to execute associated code in a Web browser, and/or a dedicated standalone application.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represents a logical architecture for describing processes according to some embodiments, and actual implementations may include more or different elements arranged in other manners. Moreover, each system described herein may be implemented by any number of devices in communication via any number of other public and/or private networks. Two or more of the devices of may be co-located, may be a single device, or may be located remote from one another and may communicate with one another via any known manner of network(s) and/or a dedicated connection. Moreover, each device may comprise any number of hardware and/or software elements suitable to provide the functions described herein as well as any other functions. Other topologies may be used in conjunction with other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">All systems and processes discussed herein may be embodied in program code stored on one or more computer-readable media. Such media may include, for example, a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, magnetic tape, and solid state Random Access Memory (RAM) or Read Only Memory (ROM) storage units. According to some embodiments, a memory storage unit may be associated with access patterns and may be independent from the device (e.g., magnetic, optoelectronic, semiconductor/solid-state, etc.) Moreover, in-memory technologies may be used such that databases, etc. may be completely operated in RAM memory at a processor. Embodiments are therefore not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow diagram of a process <b>200</b> that might be performed, for example, by the central platform <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with some embodiments, but embodiments are not limited thereto. In this regard, all processes described herein may be executed by any combination of hardware and/or software. The processes may be embodied in program code stored on a tangible medium and executable by a computer to provide the functions described herein. Further note that the flow charts described herein do not imply a fixed order to the steps, and embodiments may be practiced in any order that is practicable.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The process <b>200</b> may be executed, for example, when information changes (e.g., a new comic books becomes available) or on a periodic basis (e.g., each night). At S<b>210</b>, the central platform <b>110</b> may receive at least one publication preference associated with a consumer. As used herein, a &#x201c;publication&#x201d; may refer to any printed fiction or non-fiction material, such as a comic book or graphic novel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The publication preference might be, for example, associated with a comic book series, a comic book character, a comic book illustrator, a comic book author, and/or a comic book genre. For example, the consumer might access a web page associated with the central platform <b>110</b> and enter information about his or her favorite comic book series and/or comic book authors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an example of a consumer preference display <b>300</b> according to some embodiments described herein. In this example, the consumer may enter or select his or her name <b>310</b>, favorite comic book series <b>320</b>, and/or favorite comic book authors <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at S<b>220</b> a publication database may be accessed to identify a publication potentially of interest to the consumer based on his or her publication preferences. For example, the publication database might store information about comic book series that are currently available at retail locations, including the series name and the characters featured in each issue. The central platform <b>110</b> may search through the printed publication database to find matches between available comic books and a particular consumer's preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The identification of a publication potentially of interest to the consumer could also be based on a past purchase made by the consumer, whether in the form of a physical publication or in digital form. For example, if a consumer usually buys comic books written by a particular author, the central platform <b>110</b> may determine that a new comic book written by that author may be of interest that that consumer. As other examples, an identification of a publication potentially of interest to the consumer might be based on feedback information provided by the consumer (e.g., a customer review left on a web site), purchases made by other parties associated with the consumer (e.g., his or her friends on Facebook), trade show information, demographic information associated with the consumer (e.g., a particular comic book might be of interest to girls between the ages of 12 and 14), and/or pricing information.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At S<b>230</b>, at least one retail location where the identified publication may be currently available is determined. This information could be stored, for example, in the printed publication database or a separate retailer database. According to some embodiments, the retail location might be identified based on the types of comic books that are typically available from that store (e.g., and the retail location might or might not actually have a copy of the comic book current in stock). According to other embodiments, the retail location could be identified based on actual inventory information maintained by the retailer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The determination may be, for example, based at least in part on a current location associated with the consumer. For example, a mobile consumer device <b>120</b> might transmit the current location of the consumer to the central platform <b>110</b>. The central platform <b>110</b> could then identify retail locations that are physically proximate to the consumer (e.g., within a two mile or ten block radius). Note that the identified retail location could also be based on a current location of a retailer (e.g., a retailer who moves from one trade show location to another), a current location of the consumer device, and/or a distance preference associated with the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Note that S<b>220</b> and/or S<b>230</b> could be performed on a periodic basis, upon a change in the publication preference associated with the consumer, upon an update to the publication database, and/or upon a change in a current location associated with the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At S<b>240</b>, a notification message may be automatically transmitted to a consumer device associated with the consumer. The notification message may, for example, indicate the retail location determined at S<b>230</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;automatically&#x201d; may refer to an action that can be taken without human intervention. According to some embodiments, the notification message graphically indicates the at least one retail location on a map displayed on the consumer device.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to some embodiments, the central platform <b>110</b> is remote from the consumer device. Note, however, that according to other embodiments at least a portion of the functionality of the central platform <b>110</b> incorporated within the consumer device. For example, the consumer preferences and publication database could be stored at the consumer device (which could then locally generate and display consumer notifications).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, methods and mechanisms to provide automatic consumer notifications regarding printed publications and/or retail locations are described by some embodiments herein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an example of a consumer notification display <b>400</b> according to some embodiments described herein. In this example, the display graphically indicates two retail locations <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> on a map along with the consumer's current location <b>430</b>. Note that, according to some embodiments the comic book potentially of interest to the consumer (e.g., Spider-Man&#x2122; in the display <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) might or might not be currently stocked at the retail locations <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>. According to other embodiments, the central platform <b>110</b> may instead determine a retail location where the identified publication is actually currently available based at least in part on inventory information received from a retailer apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the central platform <b>110</b> is not aware of whether or not a particular retail location currently has a printed publication in stock, the notification transmitted to the consumer device might facilitate a communication directly between the consumer and the retail location. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram of a process <b>500</b> in accordance with another embodiment. The process <b>500</b> might be performed, for example, by mobile consumer device or central platform <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At S<b>510</b>, a retailer contact icon associated with the retail location might be graphically displayed to the consumer along with the notification message. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an example of a consumer notification display <b>600</b> including a &#x201c;call store&#x201d; icon <b>610</b>. At S<b>520</b>, a selection of the retailer contact is received from the consumer (e.g., he or she may click or select the &#x201c;call store&#x201d; icon <b>610</b>). At S<b>530</b>, a communication between the consumer and the retail location is automatically facilitated responsive to said selection. For example, when the consumer device is a wireless telephone or smartphone, a telephone call might be automatically placed to a phone number associated with the retail location (and the consumer can ask the retailer whether or not the comic book is currently in stock). According to other embodiments, the display <b>600</b> may also be used to email the store, check the store's inventory, and/or automatically facilitate a reservation or purchase by the consumer of the publication from the retail location (e.g., and he or she can then visit to the retail store to pick up the comic book).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram overview of a central platform <b>700</b> according to some embodiments. The central platform <b>700</b> may be, for example, associated with any of the devices described herein.
