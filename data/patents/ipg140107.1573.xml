<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of a multi-function power strip are shown and described. Generally, the multi-function power strip comprises a cord for connection to an electrical power source; a plurality of outlet modules in electrical connection with the cord, wherein said plurality of outlet modules are in electrical connection with each other; and a transformer module, said transformer module in electrical connection with at least one of the outlet modules, and adapted to receive electrical power therefrom, said transformer module further comprising, a transformer adapted to transform electrical power into a plurality of voltages suitable for powering a plurality of different models of electronic accessories, and a connector electrically connected to the transformer, and having a plurality of pins, each of the plurality of pins having a designated one of the plurality of voltages supplied thereto, and wherein the connector is configured to engage with a plurality of plugs, each of the plugs forming an electrical connection with a designated one of the plurality of pins and a neutral pin, thereby forming a circuit to provide a suitable one of the plurality of voltages to an electronic accessory; and wherein the outlet modules and the transformer module are releasably joined together. Thus, embodiments of the multi-function power strip are assembled by combining together and electrically connecting a number of modular components into a single assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a top view of a first embodiment of the multi-function power strip. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, multi-function power strip <b>100</b> is comprised of endcaps <b>101</b> and rail <b>102</b>. Various modular components (which will be discussed in greater detail infra) are engaged with rail <b>102</b> and retained in engagement with rail <b>102</b> by end caps <b>101</b>. Endcaps <b>101</b> may attach to rail <b>102</b> by means of screws or other fasteners commonly used in the art. Alternatively, endcaps <b>101</b> may engage with rail <b>102</b> by means of a friction-fit or snap-fit, and thereby be retained in connection to the rail <b>102</b>. First endcap <b>101</b><i>a </i>is provided with a coupler (not shown) into which a cord (not shown) can be received. Alternatively, first end cap <b>101</b><i>a </i>may be provided with a hole therethrough so that a cord (not shown) may be connected to a connector on the first module in the multi-function power strip. The cord (not shown) provides standard household electrical power, which one of skill in the art would appreciate can be between 110 and 240 volts, alternating current, with a frequency between 50 and 60 Hz. The cord (not shown) may be adapted to plug into different types of outlets, e.g. North American outlets, European outlets or Australian outlets. Cords, capable of being plugged into different types of outlets, may be provided to the user, so that said power strip is suitable for connecting it to outlets in any locale. If the cord is received in the endcap, the endcap is electrically connected to the first modular component in the multi-function power strip, thereby providing household electrical power to the first modular component, and all other modular components that are joined thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it will be appreciated that a number of modular components are engaged with rail <b>102</b>. All of the modular components are electrically connected together, and each receives electrical power from the previous component in the chain. The structure and function of each will now be explained in greater detail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of a multi-function power strip <b>100</b> may include a switch module <b>110</b>. Switch module <b>110</b> is provided with switch <b>111</b>. Switch <b>111</b> may be a single pole, single throw switch. As one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate, switch <b>111</b> may be any type of switch known to the art which is capable of operating under the load conditions imposed by the transmission and handling of ordinary household electrical power, as referenced above. Switch module <b>110</b> may be electrically coupled to the first end cap <b>101</b><i>a</i>, and in such a way it receives household electrical power from the cord (not shown) through the first endcap <b>101</b><i>a</i>. Switch module <b>110</b> is also electrically coupled to the next modular component in the chain, which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is fuse module <b>120</b>. Electrical power flows into switch module <b>110</b>, through switch <b>111</b>, and out of switch module <b>110</b> into the next modular component in the chain. An indicator light (not shown) may be provided on the housing of switch module <b>110</b>, or it may be incorporated into the switch <b>111</b>, as in the case of a rocker switch with light to indicate it is in the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; position, thereby alerting a user to the status of the power strip. By manipulating switch <b>111</b>, a user may selectively turn on and off the flow of electrical power through switch module <b>110</b> to other modular components further down the chain electrically connected to switch module <b>110</b>. For this reason, switch module <b>110</b> may be provided near the beginning of the chain of modular components but it need not be. As with all of the modular components disclosed herein, the order of the components is not critical to the operation of the multi-function power strip. As long as the modular components are in electrical connection with each other, the order in which they are assembled is a matter of convenience to suit the nature of the area being serviced by the multi-function power strip.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the next modular component in the chain following the switch module <b>110</b> is the fuse module <b>120</b>. As with all of the modular components described, fuse module <b>120</b> is electrically connected to and receives electrical power from the component in the chain before it (i.e. in this case, the switch module). Electrical power then passes through a fuse <b>121</b> and then flows out of fuse module <b>120</b> into the next component in the chain. As one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate, fuse <b>121</b> may be any type of fuse known to the art which is capable of operating under the load conditions imposed by the transmission and handling of ordinary household electrical power. Alternatively, fuse <b>121</b> may be a circuit breaker, a ground fault circuit interrupter or any other device designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit by detecting a fault condition and interrupting continuity to discontinue electrical flow. The fuse <b>121</b> may be completely enclosed in the housing of fuse module <b>120</b>, such that it is not accessible by a user. Alternatively, in cases where a circuit breaker or other device that must be reset by a user after a fault occurs are used, the fuse <b>121</b> may be mounted so that it protrudes from the housing of fuse module <b>120</b>, so as to be accessible by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a first outlet module <b>130</b>. As with all of the modular components described, first outlet module <b>130</b> is electrically connected to and receives electrical power from the component in the chain before it (i.e. in this case, the fuse module). The flow of electrical power is then split, and is sent both to outlet receptacles <b>131</b> and out of first outlet module <b>130</b> into the next component in the chain. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many different configurations of outlet receptacles <b>131</b> have been developed and implemented in various countries throughout the world. For example, Type A and Type B outlet configurations are commonly used in North America. The Type C outlet configuration is commonly used in continental Europe. The Type G outlet configuration is commonly used in the United Kingdom and the Type I configuration is commonly used in Australia and New Zealand. The following outlet configurations are recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art: a Type A outlet, a Type B outlet, a Type C outlet, a Type D outlet, a Type E outlet, a Type F outlet, a Type E/F hybrid outlet, a Type G outlet, a Type H outlet, a Type I outlet, a Type J outlet, a Type K outlet, a Type L outlet, and a Type M outlet. Outlet receptacles <b>131</b> may take the form of any of the outlet configurations recited above. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the outlet configuration of first outlet module <b>130</b> is a Type G outlet. In this way, the power strip may be adapted to function in various countries using different outlet configurations. Within the housing of first outlet module <b>130</b> may be provided a fuse <b>132</b> in the electrical power supply line ahead of outlet receptacles <b>131</b>, to protect any electrical circuits plugged into the outlet receptacles from overload or short circuit. Fuse <b>132</b> may be used in addition to or in place of a fuse module <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a second outlet module <b>140</b>. Second outlet module <b>140</b> is the same in all respects as first outlet module <b>130</b>, except that second outlet module <b>140</b> may have a different outlet configuration than first outlet module <b>130</b>. Alternatively, second outlet module <b>140</b> may have the same outlet configuration as first outlet module <b>130</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, second outlet module <b>140</b> has a Type B outlet configuration, which is different than first outlet module <b>130</b>, which has a Type G outlet configuration. As with all of the modular components described, second outlet module <b>140</b> is electrically connected to and receives electrical power from the component in the chain before it (i.e. in this case, the first outlet module). The flow of electrical power is then split, and is sent both to outlet receptacles <b>141</b> and out of second outlet module <b>140</b> into the next component in the chain. Although not shown, within the housing of second outlet module <b>140</b> may be provided a fuse in the electrical power supply line ahead of outlet receptacles <b>141</b>, to protect any electrical circuits plugged into the outlet receptacles from overload or short circuit. The fuse may be used in addition to or in place of a fuse module <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The transformer module <b>150</b> is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As with all of the modular components described, transformer module <b>150</b> is electrically connected to and receives electrical power from the component in the chain before it (i.e. in this case, the second outlet module). Disposed within the transformer module is a transformer (not shown). The transformer receives household electrical power from the previous component in the chain. The transformer is adapted to transform the household electrical power into a plurality of voltages suitable for powering a plurality of different models of electronic accessories. By way of example and without limitation, the transformer may be one of those supplied by the Trade Management Group Ltd. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any transformer capable of operating under the load conditions imposed by the transmission and handling of ordinary household electrical power and capable of producing a plurality of output voltages may be suitable for use in transformer module <b>150</b>. By way of example, and without limitation, the transformer may be adapted to produce the following output voltages: 16V, 18V, 20V, 22V and 24V. All of the preceding voltages may be provided at a current of approximately 5 A or less. Transformer module <b>150</b> may include a primary output connection <b>151</b>. Primary output connection <b>151</b> may be provided with a plurality of pins (not shown). Each of the plurality of pins may have a designated one of the plurality of voltages produced by the transformer supplied thereto. Additionally, a neutral pin may be provided as one of the plurality of pins in the primary connector. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that in addition to pins, other forms of contacts known in the art could be used to supply each of the plurality of voltages at an associated discrete contact so that one of the plurality of voltages may be selected by a user by selecting the appropriate contact. Any form of contacts known in the art could be used in place of pins, and these other forms of contacts fall under the definition of pins as used herein. In use, a plurality of cords with plugs may be provided to the user. Each of the plurality of plugs will fit into the primary output connector <b>151</b> in such a way as to form an electrical connection with a designated one of the plurality of pins and the neutral pin, thereby forming a circuit to provide a suitable one of the plurality of voltages to an electronic accessory. Each of the plurality of plugs will only fit into the primary output connector <b>151</b> in a specified way, thus each of the cords and associated plugs supplies one of the designated voltages to an electronic accessory. The user determines which plug and cord combination to use to power a specified electronic accessory.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Transformer module <b>150</b> may also be provided with a secondary output connector <b>152</b>. In addition to the voltages produced by the transformer and output to the primary output connector <b>151</b>, the transformer may be adapted to produce certain secondary output voltages. By way of example and without limitation, the secondary output voltages produced by the transformer may be: 5V, 12V, 15V, and 22V. All of the preceding voltages may be provided at a current of approximately 5 A or less. In a similar fashion as described above, secondary output connection <b>152</b> may be provided with a plurality of pins (not shown). Each of the plurality of pins may have a designated one of the plurality of secondary output voltages produced by the transformer supplied thereto. Additionally, a neutral pin may be provided as one of the plurality of pins in the secondary connector. In use, a plurality of cords with plugs may be provided to the user. Each of the plurality of plugs will fit into the secondary output connector <b>152</b> in such a way as to form an electrical connection with a designated one of the plurality of pins and the neutral pin, thereby forming a circuit to provide a suitable one of the plurality of secondary output voltages to a secondary electronic accessory. Each of the plurality of plugs will only fit into the secondary output connector <b>152</b> in a specified way, thus each of the cords and associated plugs supplies one of the designated secondary output voltages to a secondary electronic accessory.

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is USB module <b>160</b>. As with all of the modular components described, USB module <b>160</b> is electrically connected to and receives electrical power from the component in the chain before it (i.e. in this case, the transformer module). USB module is provided with USB ports <b>161</b>, which are standard Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports. Power may be provided to USB ports <b>161</b> in two ways. In a first embodiment, the transformer in transformer module <b>150</b> may produce a USB electrical power output. By way of example and without limitation, such USB electrical power output may be a 5V, 2 A direct current power output. The USB electrical power output is then sent from the transformer module <b>150</b> to the USB module <b>160</b> and distributed through the USB ports <b>161</b>. In an alternate embodiment, a USB transformer may be provided within USB module <b>160</b>. In this embodiment, the USB module receives household electrical power from the prior component in the chain (i.e. the transformer module) and steps it down to a voltage suitable for distribution through the USB ports <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Several other aspects of the USB module <b>160</b> will now be further explained. Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification to establish communication between devices and a host controller (usually a personal computer), and can be used to connect computer peripherals to a personal computer. USB connections can also be used with other devices such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB connectors supply electric power to the devices connected thereto, so devices connected by USB ports may not require a power source of their own. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the parameters of the output from the USB ports <b>161</b> is governed by the USB standard. The USB 2.0 standard is commonly used in many applications, and USB module <b>160</b> and the output of USB ports <b>161</b> may be selected to conform to that standard. Alternatively, the USB 3.0 standard has recently been introduced, and USB module <b>160</b> and the output of USB ports <b>161</b> may be selected to conform to that standard. As noted above, USB connections may be used to supply power to a device or to recharge the batteries contained in a portable device. When used for charging, the electrical power supplied to the USB ports <b>161</b> may be 5V and 0.5 A. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that certain electronic accessories, most notably Apple&#xae; products, require a higher charging amperage than those of devices which comply with the USB standards. Such devices requiring higher charging amperages may require as much as 2 A for proper charging. It should appreciated that the power supplied to all or a portion of USB ports <b>161</b> could be standard USB power or higher amperage charging power to accommodate devices which require higher charging amperages.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Additionally, it should be appreciated that charging electronic devices and providing USB power are not the only functions that the USB module <b>160</b> can perform. USB module <b>160</b> may also serve as a USB hub. A USB hub is a device that expands a single USB port into several so that there are more ports available to connect devices to a host system. In such an arrangement, one of the USB ports <b>161</b><i>a </i>may be designated a USB hub port and may be connected via a USB cable (not shown) to a USB port on a personal computer. USB module <b>160</b> may contain electronic circuitry required to allow USB module <b>160</b> to act as a USB hub. Most USB hubs use one or more integrated controller (IC's), of which several designs are available from various manufacturers and are well known to persons of skill in the art. The IC's control the flow of data between the USB hub port <b>161</b><i>a </i>and the remaining USB ports <b>161</b>, and thereby allows the remaining USB ports <b>161</b> to act as additional USB ports connected to the personal computer connected to the USB hub.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is network module <b>170</b>. Depending on the functionality implemented, network module <b>170</b> may or may not require a source of electrical power. In an embodiment where network module <b>170</b> does require electrical power, network module <b>170</b> is electrically connected to and receives electrical power from the component in the chain before it (i.e. in this case, the USB module). The power received by network module <b>170</b> may be standard household electrical power, and network module <b>170</b> may contain a transformer (not shown) for stepping down the household electrical power to a voltage suitable for use in the network module. Alternatively, the component in the chain before the network module <b>170</b> (in this case, the USB module) may transform the household electrical power into a voltage suitable for use in the network module <b>170</b> and then pass that voltage on to the network module <b>170</b>. Network module <b>170</b> is provided with network ports <b>171</b>. Network ports <b>171</b> may be RJ45 connectors for receiving LAN (Local Area Network) data signals. Alternatively, network ports <b>171</b> may be RJ11 connectors for receiving telephone signals, or BNC connectors for receiving cable TV signals or other data signals. One of ordinary skill will appreciate that network ports <b>171</b> may take the form of any connector necessary to connect the required data stream to the network module <b>170</b>. Inside network module <b>170</b> is provided a fuse, circuit breaker or the like (not shown). The fuse, circuit breaker or the like is electrically connected between first network port <b>171</b><i>a </i>and second network port <b>171</b><i>b</i>, and provides voltage and current surge protection between the two ports. In operation, a data feed cable (not shown) is connected to first network port <b>171</b><i>a</i>. A personal computer or other device may then be connected via a data cable to second network port <b>171</b><i>b</i>. In the event of a voltage or current spike in the data circuit, the fuse, circuit breaker or the like provided in network module <b>170</b> will trip, thereby preventing said voltage or current spike from reaching the personal computer or other device connected to second network port <b>171</b><i>b</i>. In this way, network module <b>170</b> may act as a pass-through surge suppressor for LAN, telephone, CATV or other data feeds.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It should be appreciated that network module <b>170</b> may also have more advanced features. For instance, network module <b>170</b> may function as a network switch. A network switch serves as a controller, enabling networked devices to exchange data with each other efficiently. Network switches are capable of inspecting data packets as they are received, determining the source and destination device of each packet, and forwarding them appropriately. By delivering messages only to the connected device intended, a network switch conserves network bandwidth. If network module <b>170</b> is to be configured as a network switch, electrical power may be provided to the network module <b>170</b> as described supra. If network module <b>170</b> is to be configured as a network switch, network module <b>170</b> may be provided with more network ports than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, network module <b>170</b> may be provided with four network ports. One of the network ports may be designated a LAN input port and may be connected via a LAN cable (not shown) to a local area network. Network module <b>170</b> may be provided with electronic circuitry required to allow network module <b>170</b> to act as a network switch. Most network switches use one or more integrated controller (IC's), of which several designs are available from various manufacturers and are well known to persons of skill in the art. The IC's control the flow of data between the LAN input port and the remaining network ports, and thereby allows the remaining network ports to act as additional network ports for connecting additional devices to the local area network. The network switch electronic circuitry inside the network module <b>170</b> directs data on the LAN to the appropriate devices connected to the network ports. Thus, the switch allows multiple devices to be connected to a single LAN connection, and provides for the accurate routing of data to the devices so connected.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a top exploded view of an embodiment of a multi-function power strip <b>100</b>. Like numbers will be used to designate components already described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first endcap <b>101</b><i>a </i>and endcap <b>101</b> are provided, as is rail <b>102</b>. Additionally, switch module <b>110</b>, fuse module <b>120</b>, first outlet module <b>130</b>, second outlet module <b>140</b>, transformer module <b>150</b>, USB module <b>160</b> and network module <b>170</b> are provided. As can be readily seen in the exploded view, all of the aforementioned modules are slidably engaged with the rail <b>102</b>, and retained in engagement with the rail <b>102</b> by the endcaps <b>101</b>. As has been previously pointed out, it should be appreciated that not all of the aforementioned modules need be provided in every embodiment of the power strip. For example, only a single outlet module may be provided, or the USB and/or network modules may be left out of the configuration. Thus, depending on the customer's desire for the functionality of the device, certain modules may be excluded from the assembly, or certain modules may be included in numbers in excess of what has been shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as in the case where a customer desires numerous outlet modules in addition to all the other modules. It should be readily appreciated that rail <b>102</b>, as an extruded part, may be cut to any length and therefore may accommodate any number of modules as requested by the customer. The only limitation on the number of modules, and hence the overall length of rail <b>102</b> and relatedly the assembly <b>100</b> is that the maximum power that can be drawn by the combination of all of the modules in the power strip is 4000 Watts. As long as the combined modules draw less than the aforementioned maximum power, any combination of modules, and any length of rail <b>102</b> necessary to accommodate those modules may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are module connectors <b>210</b>. Module connectors <b>210</b> electrically connect the various modules in the power strip assembly together. Module connectors <b>210</b> mate with electrical contacts formed in the housings of the various modules (not shown) and thereby electrically connect two adjacent modules together. The structure of the module connectors <b>210</b> will be explained in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, note that certain modules do not employ module connectors <b>210</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, USB module <b>160</b> and network module <b>170</b> use attached connectors <b>220</b> to electrically connect those modules to the previous component in the chain. Attached connectors <b>220</b> have essentially the same structure as module connectors <b>210</b> with the exception being that attached connectors <b>220</b> are permanently attached to the module that they connect to the previous component in the chain. One of ordinary skill will readily appreciate that either module connectors <b>210</b> or attached connectors <b>220</b> could be used to electrically connect any or all of the modules in the power strip together, and the selection of either module connector <b>210</b> or attached connector <b>220</b> is simply a matter of preference or improvement of the manufacturability of the power strip.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an isometric exploded view of an embodiment of the multi-function power strip <b>100</b>. Like numbers will be used to designate components already described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, first endcap <b>101</b><i>a </i>and endcap <b>101</b> are provided, as is rail <b>102</b>. Additionally, switch module <b>110</b>, fuse module <b>120</b>, first outlet module <b>130</b>, second outlet module <b>140</b>, transformer module <b>150</b>, USB module <b>160</b> and network module <b>170</b> are provided. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the manner in which the various modules engage with rail <b>102</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> all of the modules are provided with tabs <b>310</b>. Tabs <b>310</b> slidably engage with groove <b>320</b> in rail <b>102</b>, and thereby retain the modules in the rail. Endcaps <b>101</b> and <b>101</b><i>a </i>engage with the ends of rail <b>102</b>, and have holes <b>330</b> provided therein for attachment means (not shown) to secure the endcaps <b>101</b>, <b>101</b><i>a </i>to the rail <b>102</b>. The modules can be slid into and out of engagement with rail easily for assembly and for disassembly in the event it becomes necessary to replace one of the modules.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a block diagram showing the inter-relation of parts in an embodiment of the multi-function power strip. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, power source <b>400</b> is a standard household electrical power source and is the power input into the multi-function power strip. The electric power may then pass through components <b>410</b> which may be an on/off switch, a circuit breaker or a fuse. The electrical power may pass through a single one, two or all three of these components, depending on the configuration of the multi-function power strip. Electrical power may then pass through an optional timer or occupancy sensor <b>420</b>. If component <b>420</b> is a timer module, it may be a standard programmable timer that is configured to permit the flow of electrical power to components down the chain for certain periods of the day, and to block the flow of electrical power to components down the chain for certain other periods of the day. Such timers are well known to those of skill in the art, as is their inclusion in a circuit of this type. If component <b>420</b> is a vacancy/occupancy sensor module, it may contain an occupancy sensor or a vacancy sensor adapted to detect the presence of a person in the area adjacent to the power strip and to turn off electrical power to components down the chain of the power strip when a person is not present in the area adjacent to the power strip. An occupancy sensor detects the presence of a person in an area adjacent to the sensor and activates a switch to provide electricity to a device upon the detection of a person. A vacancy sensor requires a user to activate a switch to turn on an electrical appliance, and the vacancy sensor then turns off the appliance when it detects that the person has left the area. Either an occupancy sensor or a vacancy sensor can be used in module <b>420</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any occupancy or vacancy sensor switch suitable for use in the area around a power strip would be suitable for use as an occupancy/vacancy sensor in module <b>420</b>. Occupancy/vacancy sensor may an infrared sensor, an acoustic sensor or any other type of sensor adapted to be used as an occupancy/vacancy sensor. In operation, when the occupancy/vacancy sensor module detects the presence of a person in the area surrounding the power, it allows the flow of electrical power to modules down the chain of the power strip. If the occupancy/vacancy sensor does not detect the presence of a person in the area surrounding the power strip, it interrupts the flow of electrical power to the components down the chain.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, electrical power then passes into outlet modules <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>450</b> and <b>460</b>. The dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> show possible routes for the electrical power, showing that it may travel through one, two, three or all four of the outlet modules, depending on the configuration of the power strip. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the outlet modules are all of different configurations, outlet module <b>430</b> is a United States configuration outlet; outlet module <b>440</b> is a European configuration outlet; outlet module <b>450</b> is a United Kingdom configuration outlet; and outlet module <b>460</b> is a Chinese configuration outlet. One of ordinary skill will appreciate that the outlet modules may all have different configurations as shown or they may all be of a single configuration, or they may be a combination of two or more configurations. Each of the outlet modules is configured so that electrical power may be transferred to a device plugged into the outlet module, and also that electrical power is transferred to the next component in the chain. From the last outlet module, electrical power then flows into the transformer module <b>470</b>. As discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, transformer module <b>470</b> steps down household electrical power to a plurality of voltages suitable for powering electronic accessories and outputs those voltages though a multi-pinned connector adapted to mate with a plurality of plugs and thereby supply the appropriate voltages to electronic accessories. Electrical power then flows into USB module <b>480</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, transformer module <b>470</b> may step household electrical power down to a 5V 2 A output for USB module <b>480</b>. Alternatively, USB module <b>480</b> may contain a transformer which transforms electrical power into a voltage suitable for use in USB module <b>480</b>. In such an embodiment, household electrical power would flow from transformer module <b>470</b> to USB module <b>480</b>. USB module <b>480</b> may receive data from and transmit data to a personal computer or other device in the case where USB module <b>480</b> acts as a USB hub. USB module <b>480</b> may provide a source of power to network module <b>490</b>. Network module <b>490</b> may act as a pass-through surge suppressor or network cables, phone cables or other data feeds. Alternatively, network module <b>490</b> may act as a network switch and may receive data from and transmit data to a personal computer or other device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a side perspective view of the module connector and module used in an embodiment of the multi-function power strip. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a second outlet module <b>140</b>. However, as set forth in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, module connectors <b>210</b> can be used with any of the modules described in the various embodiments of the multi-function power strip. Tabs <b>310</b>, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Module connector <b>210</b> has a body <b>500</b> with a first end <b>500</b><i>a</i>. The opposite end of body <b>500</b> (not shown) is a mirror image of first end <b>500</b><i>a</i>. Body <b>500</b> of module connector <b>210</b> can be fabricated from any suitable material known in the art, for example, plastic. Apertures <b>510</b> are provided in first end of body <b>500</b><i>a </i>and extend all the way through the body to the opposite end (not shown). In such a way, the body <b>500</b> has a hollow interior formed by the apertures <b>510</b>. Three apertures <b>510</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, however, it should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that any number of apertures could be used, depending on the number of connections that must be made between the modules. By way of example and without limitation, the three apertures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may accommodate positive, negative and ground connections between modules. In applications where an additional number of connections are required, as for example in cases where data or transformed voltages are also to be transferred between modules, more apertures may be provided. Body <b>500</b> may also be provided with an alignment boss <b>512</b>. Alignment boss <b>512</b> mates with alignment groove <b>513</b> on the module. Alignment boss <b>512</b> and alignment groove <b>513</b> ensure that the module connector <b>210</b> and the module are connected in the appropriate orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Disposed within the apertures <b>510</b> are contacts <b>511</b>. Similar contacts (not shown) are disposed in apertures on the opposite end of body <b>500</b> (not shown). The contacts <b>511</b> may be made from copper or any material suitable for conducting electricity. The contacts <b>511</b> mate with and form an electrical connection with the blades <b>514</b> disposed in the module. The contacts <b>511</b>, and the similar contacts (not shown) on the opposite end of body <b>500</b> are electrically connected. The similar contacts (not shown) on the opposite end of body <b>500</b> are likewise adapted to mate with blades (not shown) on an adjacent module. In this way, the contacts in the module connector <b>210</b> form an electrical connection between two adjacent modules. The blades <b>514</b> are disposed in opening <b>515</b> in module <b>140</b> and do not protrude past the side of module <b>140</b>. In this way, the blades are prevented from making accidental contact with persons or things which may cause an electrical shock or short circuit. The modular connector <b>210</b> is able to slide into opening <b>515</b> in module <b>140</b>. By sliding modular connector <b>210</b> into engagement in opening <b>515</b>, the contacts <b>511</b> and blades <b>514</b> come into engagement, thereby creating the electrical connection between the module <b>140</b> and the modular connector <b>210</b>. Modular connector <b>210</b> connects to an adjacent module in a like manner, thereby establishing an electrical connection between two adjacent modules. With the blades <b>514</b> recessed in the opening <b>515</b> and the contact <b>511</b> recessed in apertures <b>510</b>, there are no exposed terminals on the connectors which connect the modules together.</p>
