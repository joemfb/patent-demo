<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a metal catalyst and a fuel cell using an electrode that includes the catalyst. In particular, a metal catalyst has an improved catalytic efficiency in an electrochemical reaction and has a structure that promotes the permeation of gaseous reactants. A fuel cell that uses an electrode that includes the catalyst has improved efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fuel cells are emerging as a future source of clean energy that can replace fossil fuels.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The fuel cell is a power generating system that produces direct current by an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. A fuel cell includes a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) that has an electrolyte interposed between an anode and a cathode, and flow field plates for transferring gases. The electrodes include catalyst layers that are formed on supporting layers made of carbon paper or carbon cloth. However, it is difficult for gaseous reactants to reach the catalysts in the catalyst layer, and protons produced by the electrochemical reaction do not move rapidly. Thus catalysts have not been used effectively in electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The cathode and the anode are prepared by casting a slurry including a catalyst and an ionomer on a gas diffusion layer as a supporting layer, and drying the resultant to form a catalyst layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the catalyst layer of an electrode is prepared in this way, the ionomer is doped in the catalyst or is simply mixed with the catalyst, which degrades the dispersion properties of the catalyst and causes agglomeration of the catalyst and the ionomer in the catalyst layer. As a result, an increase in the amount of unreacted catalyst due to secondary pores and non-uniform ionomers causes a reduction of catalyst utilization, a lack of fuel supply paths, and a reduction of the permeability of fuel, thereby significantly reducing the performance of the fuel cell. In addition, it is difficult to form and control a three-phase interface for an electrochemical reaction, and the catalytic efficiency is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the structure of a conventional metal catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, in a conventional metal catalyst <b>10</b>, Pt particles <b>13</b> are present on the surface of the carbon <b>11</b>, and PBI <b>12</b> is close to the carbon <b>11</b>. In this structure, the dispersion properties of PBI and Pt/C deteriorate, and it is difficult to obtain a three-phase interface for an electrochemical reaction, and thus the catalytic efficiency is reduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides a metal catalyst that exhibits an improved catalytic efficiency by having a three-phase interfacial structure that can facilitate contact between gaseous reactants and the catalyst. This allows it to rapidly transfer protons produced by an electrochemical reaction between the gaseous reactants.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also provides a method for preparing the catalyst, a method for preparing an electrode with improved efficiency by including a catalyst layer using the metal catalyst, and a fuel cell using the electrode prepared according to the method.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A metal catalyst of the present invention includes a conductive catalyst material and a proton conductive material coating layer formed on the conductive catalyst material. This configuration allows the catalyst to easily form and control a three-phase interface for an electrochemical reaction, facilitate the contact between gaseous reactants and the catalyst through a thin coating layer of a proton conductive material formed on catalyst particles, and effectively transfer protons generated in the electrochemical reaction. When an electrode is formed using the catalyst, an ideal three-phase interfacial electrode structure may be formed, and a fuel cell that includes the electrode may have improved performance, such as high efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the process of preparing the metal catalyst and an electrode using the metal catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a method for preparing the metal catalyst of the present invention includes doping the proton conductive material with an acid and mixing it with a first solvent and a conductive catalyst material. This coats the proton conductive material onto the surface of the conductive catalyst material.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Then, the above mixture is cast onto a supporting layer and dried. The resulting coating may be a continuous or a discontinuous film. The drying temperature is in the range of about 80&#xb0; C. to about 120&#xb0; C. The resulting coating is separated from the supporting layer to obtain a conductive catalyst containing film. The conductive catalyst containing film is pulverized and sieved to obtain a metal catalyst with a specific particle size. The particle size is preferably in the range of about 50 &#x3bc;m to about 70 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The proton conductive material may be an ionomer including, but not limited to polybenzimidazole (PBI), polyetherketone, polyetherimide, polysulfone, perfluorosulfonic acid, and the above ionomers doped with an acid.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the metal catalyst of the present invention, the concentration of the proton conductive material is preferably about 1 wt % to about 50 wt %, in particular, about 3 wt % to about 10 wt %, based on the total weight of the conductive catalyst material. When the concentration of the proton conductive material is less than about 1 wt %, the efficiency of the catalyst is reduced due to an inability to form a three-phase interface in the catalyst layer. When the concentration of the proton conductive material is greater than about 50 wt %, the diffusion of gaseous reactants to the catalyst is slowed by the thick coating of the proton conductive material on the electrical conductive catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The acid may include, but is not limited to phosphoric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Examples of the conductive catalyst material may include Pt, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Cu, Ag, Au, Sn, Ti, Cr, mixtures thereof, alloys thereof, and a carbon material having these elements supported thereon, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The supporting layer may include, but is not limited to a Teflon&#xae; sheet, a Mylar&#xae; film, a glass substrate, a polyethylene terephthalate sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first solvent disperses or dissolves the conductive catalyst material and the ionomer. Examples of the first solvent may include, but are not limited to N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), dimethylformamide (DMF), and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), etc. The concentration of the first solvent may be about 900 wt % to about 4000 wt % based on the weight of the ionomer. When the concentration of the first solvent is less than about 900 wt %, the proton conductive material is not sufficiently dissolved and the conductive catalyst material is not uniformly dispersed. When the concentration of the first solvent is greater than about 4000 wt % it takes too long to dry.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">After the above process, the metal catalyst may be doped with an acid to further enhance the metal catalyst's proton conductivity. Phosphoric acid or similar acids may be used for this. The acid concentration may be about 200 mol % to about 1000 mol %, and preferably about 200 mol % to about 750 mol %, based on 100 moles of the proton conducting material.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although it is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, when metal catalyst particles coated with PBI are doped with phosphoric acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>is bound to an N&#x2014;H site of PBI through a hydrogen bond, to form a proton transfer path. The carbon <b>11</b> acts as an electron transfer path, and protons are transferred by phosphoric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In order to form an electrode, the metal catalyst is then mixed with a hydrophobic binder and a second solvent, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The mixture is then coated onto an electrode supporting layer and dried. The drying temperature of the coating is in the range of about 60&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C. When the drying temperature is out of the above range, the coating is not dried well and the carbon carrier is oxidized, which is not preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The hydrophobic binder may include, but is not limited to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). The concentration of the hydrophobic binder may be about 1 wt % to about 40 wt % based on the total weight of the metal catalyst. When the concentration of the hydrophobic binder is out of the above range, satisfactory proton conductivity and electrical conductivity of the electrode can not be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second solvent is selected based on the hydrophobic binder, and is not limited as long as it does not dissolve the proton conductive material and can dissolve or disperse the hydrophobic binder. The second solvent may include a fluorine-based organic solvent, for example. The concentration of the second solvent is about 500 wt % to about 10,000 wt % based on the total weight of the metal catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The electrode supporting layer may include, but is not limited to carbon paper or carbon cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The electrode facilitates the formation of a three-phase interface for an electrochemical reaction, improves the contact between the gaseous reactants and the catalyst through the thin coating layer on the catalyst, and effectively transfers protons produced by the electrochemical reaction.</p>
