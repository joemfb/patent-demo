<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Acoustic devices generally include a signal device and a sound wave generator electrically connected to the signal device. The signal device inputs signals to the sound wave generator, such as loudspeakers. A loudspeaker is an electro-acoustic transducer that converts electrical signals into sound.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are different types of loudspeakers that can be categorized according to their working principle, such as electro-dynamic loudspeakers, electromagnetic loudspeakers, electrostatic loudspeakers, and piezoelectric loudspeakers. These various types of loudspeakers use mechanical vibration to produce sound waves. In other words they all achieve &#x201c;electro-mechanical-acoustic&#x201d; conversion. Among the various types, the electro-dynamic loudspeakers are the most widely used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A thermophone based on the thermoacoustic effect was made by H. D. Arnold and I. B. Crandall (H. D. Arnold and I. B. Crandall, &#x201c;The thermophone as a precision source of sound,&#x201d; Phys. Rev. 10, pp 22-38 (1917)). However, the thermophone adopting the platinum strip produces weak sounds because the heat capacity per unit area of the platinum strip is too high.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is needed, therefore, is to provide a thermoacoustic device having good sound effect and high efficiency.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a thermoacoustic device <b>10</b> in one embodiment includes a sound wave generator <b>102</b> and a signal input device <b>104</b>. The sound wave generator <b>102</b> is capable of producing sounds by a thermoacoustic effect. The signal input device <b>104</b> is configured to input signals to the sound wave generator <b>102</b> to generate heat.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Sound Wave Generator</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sound wave generator <b>102</b> has a very small heat capacity per unit area. The sound wave generator <b>102</b> can be a conductive structure with a small heat capacity per unit area and a small thickness. The sound wave generator <b>102</b> can have a large specific surface area for causing the pressure oscillation in the surrounding medium by the temperature waves generated by the sound wave generator <b>102</b>. The sound wave generator <b>102</b> can be a free-standing structure. The term &#x201c;free-standing&#x201d; includes, but is not limited to, a structure that does not have to be supported by a substrate and can sustain the weight of it when it is hoisted by a portion thereof without any significant damage to its structural integrity. That is to say, at least part of the sound wave generator can be suspended. The suspended part of the sound wave generator <b>102</b> will have more sufficient contact with the surrounding medium (e.g., air) to have heat exchange with the surrounding medium from both sides of the sound wave generator <b>102</b>. The sound wave generator <b>102</b> is a thermoacoustic film. The sound wave generator <b>102</b> has a small heat capacity per unit area and a large surface area for causing the pressure oscillation in the surrounding medium by the temperature waves generated by the sound wave generator <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the sound wave generator <b>102</b> can be or include a graphene layer. A thickness of the graphene layer can be less than 10 micrometers. In some embodiments, the thickness of the graphene layer is in a range from about 10 nanometers to about 200 nanometers. The graphene layer includes at least one graphene. The graphene is a one-atom-thick planar sheet of sp<sup>2</sup>-bonded carbon atoms that are densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice. The size of the graphene can be very large (e.g., several millimeters). However, the size of the graphene is generally less than 10 microns (e.g., 1 micron). In one embodiment, the graphene layer is a pure structure of graphene. The graphene layer can be or include a single graphene or a plurality of graphenes. In one embodiment, the graphene layer includes a plurality of graphenes, the plurality of graphenes is stacked with each other or located side by side. The plurality of graphenes is combined with each other by van der Waals attractive force. The graphene layer can be a continuous integrated structure. The term &#x201c;continuous integrated structure&#x201d; includes, but is not limited to a structure that is combined by a plurality of chemical covalent bonds (e.g., sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds, sp<sup>1 </sup>bonds, or sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds) to form an overall structure. A thickness of the graphene layer can be less than 1 millimeter. A heat capacity per unit area of the graphene layer can be less than or equal to about 2&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>J/cm<sup>2</sup>*K. In some embodiments, a heat capacity per unit area of the graphene layer consisting of one graphene can be less than or equal to about 5.57&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>J/cm<sup>2</sup>*K. The graphene layer can be a free-standing structure. The graphene has large specific surface. A transmittance of visible light of the graphene layer can be in a range from 67% to 97.7%.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In other embodiments, the sound wave generator <b>102</b> can be or includes a carbon film. The carbon film includes at least one carbon nanotube layer and at least one the grapheme layer. In some embodiments, the carbon film can consist only of the carbon nanotube layer and the graphene layer. The at least one carbon nanotube layer and the at least one graphene are stacked with each other. The carbon film can include a number of carbon nanotube layers and a number of graphene layers alternatively stacked on each other. The carbon nanotube layer and the grapheme layer can combine with each other via van der Waals attractive force. The carbon nanotube layer can include a plurality of micropores defined by adjacent carbon nanotubes, and the graphene layer covers the plurality of micropores. Diameters of the micropores can be in a range from about 1 micrometer to about 20 micrometers. A thickness of the carbon film can be in a range from 10 nanometers to about 1 millimeter. Length and width of the carbon film are not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The carbon nanotube layer includes a number of carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotube layer can be a pure structure of carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube layer are combined by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. The carbon nanotube layer has a large specific surface area (e.g., above 30 m<sup>2</sup>/g). The larger the specific surface area of the carbon nanotube layer, the smaller the heat capacity per unit area will be. The smaller the heat capacity per unit area, the higher the sound pressure level of the sound produced by the sound wave generator <b>102</b>. The thickness of the carbon nanotube layer can range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 1 millimeter. The carbon nanotube layer can include a number of pores. The pores are defined by adjacent carbon nanotubes. A diameter of the pores can be less 50 millimeters, in some embodiment, the diameter of the pores is less 10 millimeters.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube layer can be orderly or disorderly arranged. The term &#x2018;disordered carbon nanotube layer&#x2019; refers to a structure where the carbon nanotubes are arranged along different directions, and the aligning directions of the carbon nanotubes are random. The number of the carbon nanotubes arranged along each different direction can be almost the same (e.g. uniformly disordered). The carbon nanotubes in the disordered carbon nanotube layer can be entangled with each other. The carbon nanotube layer including ordered carbon nanotubes is an ordered carbon nanotube layer. The term &#x2018;ordered carbon nanotube layer&#x2019; refers to a structure where the carbon nanotubes are arranged in a consistently systematic manner, e.g., the carbon nanotubes are arranged approximately along a same direction and/or have two or more sections within each of which the carbon nanotubes are arranged approximately along a same direction (different sections can have different directions). The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube layer can be single-walled, double-walled, or multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotube layer can include at least one carbon nanotube film. In other embodiments, the carbon nanotube layer is composed of one carbon nanotube film or at least two carbon nanotube films. In other embodiment, the carbon nanotube layer consists of one carbon nanotube film or at least two carbon nanotube films.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the carbon nanotube film can be a drawn carbon nanotube film. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the drawn carbon nanotube film includes a number of successive and oriented carbon nanotubes joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. The drawn carbon nanotube film can have a large specific surface area (e.g., above 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g). The drawn carbon nanotube film is a freestanding film. Each drawn carbon nanotube film includes a number of successively oriented carbon nanotube segments joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. Each carbon nanotube segment includes a number of carbon nanotubes substantially parallel to each other, and joined by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. Some variations can occur in the drawn carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotubes in the drawn carbon nanotube film are oriented along a preferred orientation. The drawn carbon nanotube film can be treated with an organic solvent to increase the mechanical strength and toughness of the drawn carbon nanotube film and reduce the coefficient of friction of the drawn carbon nanotube film. The thickness of the drawn carbon nanotube film can range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 100 micrometers. The drawn carbon nanotube film can be used as a carbon nanotube layer directly.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The carbon nanotubes in the drawn carbon nanotube film can be single-walled, double-walled, or multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The diameters of the single-walled carbon nanotubes can range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 50 nanometers. The diameters of the double-walled carbon nanotubes can range from about 1 nanometer to about 50 nanometers. The diameters of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes can range from about 1.5 nanometers to about 50 nanometers. The lengths of the carbon nanotubes can range from about 200 micrometers to about 900 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The carbon nanotube layer can include at least two stacked drawn carbon nanotube films. The carbon nanotubes in the drawn carbon nanotube film are aligned along one preferred orientation, an angle can exist between the orientations of carbon nanotubes in adjacent drawn carbon nanotube films, whether stacked or adjacent. An angle between the aligned directions of the carbon nanotubes in two adjacent drawn carbon nanotube films can range from about 0 degrees to about 90 degrees (e.g. about 15 degrees, 45 degrees or 60 degrees).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other embodiments, the carbon nanotube film can be a flocculated carbon nanotube film. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the flocculated carbon nanotube film can include a plurality of long, curved, disordered carbon nanotubes entangled with each other. The carbon nanotubes can be substantially uniformly dispersed in the carbon nanotube film. Adjacent carbon nanotubes are acted upon by van der Waals attractive force to obtain an entangled structure with micropores defined therein. Because the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are entangled with each other, the carbon nanotube layer employing the flocculated carbon nanotube film has excellent durability, and can be fashioned into desired shapes with a low risk to the integrity of the carbon nanotube layer. The thickness of the flocculated carbon nanotube film can range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 1 millimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in other embodiments, the carbon nanotube film can be a pressed carbon nanotube film. The pressed carbon nanotube film is formed by pressing a carbon nanotube array. The carbon nanotubes in the pressed carbon nanotube film are arranged along a same direction or along different directions. The carbon nanotubes in the pressed carbon nanotube film can rest upon each other. Adjacent carbon nanotubes are attracted to each other and are joined by van der Waals attractive force. An angle between a primary alignment direction of the carbon nanotubes and a surface of the pressed carbon nanotube film is about 0 degrees to approximately 15 degrees. The greater the pressure applied, the smaller the angle obtained. In one embodiment, the carbon nanotubes in the pressed carbon nanotube film are arranged along different directions, the carbon nanotubes can be uniformly arranged in the pressed carbon nanotube film. Some properties of the pressed carbon nanotube film are the same properties along the direction parallel to the surface of the pressed carbon nanotube film, such as conductivity, intensity, etc. The thickness of the pressed carbon nanotube film can range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 1 millimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the sound wave generator <b>102</b> is a carbon film consisting of one carbon nanotube layer stacked with one graphene layer. The carbon nanotube layer consists of two stacked drawn carbon nanotube films. The angle between the alignment directions of the carbon nanotubes in the two adjacent drawn carbon nanotube films is about 90 degrees. The graphene layer is a single layer of graphene. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a transmittance of visible light of the carbon film is larger than 60%. The thermoacoustic device <b>10</b> using the carbon film as the sound wave generator <b>102</b> can be a transparent device.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The graphene layer is very compact, but it has low strength. The carbon nanotube layer has high strength and includes a mount of micropores; and the carbon film including the carbon nanotube layer and the graphene layer has an advantage of compactness and high strength. When the carbon film is used as the sound wave generator <b>102</b>, because the graphene layer covers the micropores in the carbon nanotube layer, and the carbon film has a larger contacting area with the surrounding medium, the sound wave generator has a higher efficiency. The thickness of the carbon nanotube layer and the graphene layer can be very thin, and a thickness and a heat capacity of the carbon film can be minimal, which makes the sound wave generator have a good sound effect and high sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The thermoacoustic device <b>10</b> has a wide frequency response range and a high sound pressure level. The sound pressure level of the sound waves generated by an embodiment of the thermoacoustic device <b>10</b> can be greater than 50 dB. The frequency response range of the thermoacoustic device <b>10</b> can be from about 1 Hz to about 100 KHz with a power input of 4.5 W. The total harmonic distortion of the thermoacoustic device <b>10</b> is extremely small, e.g., less than 3% in a range from about 500 Hz to 40 KHz. The thermoacoustic device <b>10</b> can be used in many apparatus, such as, telephone, Mp3, Mp4, TV, computer. Further, because the thermoacoustic device <b>10</b> can be transparent, it can be stuck on a screen directly.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Energy Generator</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The signal input device <b>104</b> is used to input signals into the sound wave generator. The signals can be electrical signals, optical signals or electromagnetic wave signals. With variations in the application of the signals and/or strength applied to the sound wave generator <b>102</b>, the sound wave generator <b>102</b> according to the variations of the signals and/or signal strength produces repeated heating. Temperature waves, which are propagated into surrounding medium, are obtained. The surrounding medium is not limited, just to make sure that a resistance of the surround medium is larger than a resistance of the sound wave generator <b>102</b>. The surrounding medium can be air, water or organic liquid. The temperature waves produce pressure waves in the surrounding medium, resulting in sound generation. In this process, it is the thermal expansion and contraction of the medium in the vicinity of the sound wave generator <b>102</b> that produces sound. This is distinct from the mechanism of the conventional loudspeaker, in which the mechanical movement of the diaphragm creates the pressure waves.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the signal input device <b>104</b> includes a first electrode <b>104</b><i>a </i>and a second electrode <b>104</b><i>b</i>. The first electrode <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>104</b><i>b </i>are electrically connected with the sound wave generator <b>102</b> and input electrical signals to the sound wave generator <b>102</b>. The sound wave generator <b>102</b> can produce joule heat. The first electrode <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>104</b><i>b </i>are made of conductive material. The shape of the first electrode <b>104</b><i>a </i>or the second electrode <b>104</b><i>b </i>is not limited and can be lamellar, rod, wire, and block among other shapes.

If the carbon nanotube layer includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes oriented in a same direction, the direction can be parallel with the first electrode <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>104</b><i>b</i>. That is to say, the carbon nanotubes are oriented from the first electrode <b>104</b><i>a </i>to the second electrode <b>104</b><i>b</i>. Thus, electrical signals output from the electrical signal device can be input into the sound wave generator <b>102</b> through the first and second electrodes <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b</i>.

A distance between the signal input device <b>104</b> and the sound wave generator <b>102</b> is not limited as long as the electromagnetic wave signal <b>1020</b> is successfully transmitted to the sound wave generator <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the signal input device <b>104</b> is a laser-producing device. The laser-producing device is located apart from the sound wave generator <b>102</b> and faces to the sound wave generator <b>102</b>. The laser-producing device can emit a laser. The laser-producing device faces to the sound wave generator <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, when the substrate <b>208</b> is made of transparent materials, the laser-producing device can be disposed on either side of the substrate <b>208</b>. The laser signals produced by the laser-producing device can transmit through the substrate <b>208</b> to the sound wave generator <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The sound wave generator <b>102</b> absorbs the electromagnetic wave signals <b>1020</b> and converts the electromagnetic energy into heat energy. The heat capacity per unit area of the carbon nanotube layer is extremely small, and thus, the temperature of the carbon nanotube layer can change rapidly with the input electromagnetic wave signals <b>1020</b> at the substantially same frequency as the electromagnetic wave signals <b>1020</b>. Thermal waves, which are propagated into surrounding medium, are produced. Therefore, the surrounding medium, such as ambient air, can be heated at an equal frequency as the input of electromagnetic wave signal <b>1020</b> to the sound wage generator <b>102</b>. The thermal waves produce pressure waves in the surrounding medium, resulting in sound wave generation. In this process, it is the thermal expansion and contraction of the medium in the vicinity of the sound wave generator <b>102</b> that produces sound. The operating principle of the sound wave generator <b>102</b> is the &#x201c;optical-thermal-sound&#x201d; conversion.</p>
