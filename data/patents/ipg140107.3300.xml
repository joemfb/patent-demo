<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to IC wafer technology and more particularly, to an IC wafer having electromagnetic shielding effects. The invention relates also to method for making an IC wafer having electromagnetic shielding effects.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, electronic products have been gradually focused on characteristics of high performance and small size. In consequence, the operation speed and device density of integrated circuits for electronic products must be enhanced. However, the larger operation speed and device density of an integrated circuit, the higher electromagnetic interference impact is concerned between the adjacent devices of the integrated circuit and with the surrounding electronic components of the applied electronic product.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To solve the aforesaid problem, after semiconductor wafer slicing and IC chip packaging, a metallic shielding mask may be installed, during the module fabrication of finishing an end product, to isolate integrated circuit(s) from other electronic components, protecting integrated circuit(s) against external electromagnetic fields and achieving electromagnetic shielding effects. However, the installation of such a shielding mask relatively increases the dimension of the end product and requires an extra module step, in consequence, the production cost and time of the electronic product will be relatively increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. It is the main object of the present invention to provide an IC wafer having electromagnetic shielding effects, which saves much production cost and time of the electronic product.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve this and other objects of the present invention, an IC wafer defining a plurality of die zones is provided. the IC wafer comprises an integrated circuit layer having a top surface on which a plurality of solder pads which are located at the border area of each of the die zones are disposed, an insulated layer disposed on the top surface of the integrated circuit layer and opened with a plurality of through holes respectively corresponding to the solder pads, and an electromagnetic shielding layer arranged at the top surface of the insulated layer within each of the die zones and electrically isolated from the solder pads of the integrated circuit layer. Thus, the electronic product made by the integrated circuit of the IC wafer does not require any further shielding mask, simplifying the fabrication and lowering the production cost. Further, the method of making the IC wafer facilitates further packaging process.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another object of the present invention to provide an IC wafer fabrication method for fabricating an IC wafer having electromagnetic shielding effects, which simplifies the IC wafer manufacturing process, lowers the IC wafer manufacturing cost and facilitates a follow-up packaging process.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve this and other objects of the present invention, an IC wafer fabrication method for fabricating the IC wafer defining a plurality of die zones, each of which is adapted to be embedded with an electronic device and provided with a border area adapted to be arranged with a plurality of conductive bumps electrically connected to the electronic device for being used in a further packaging process, the IC wafer fabrication method comprises the steps of: a) forming an integrated circuit layer carrying an electronic device therein and having a top surface on which a plurality of solder pads are arranged and respectively electrically connected to said electronic device; b) applying an insulated layer covering said solder pads on the top surface of said integrated circuit layer; c) forming a seed layer covering said insulated layer and said solder pads; d) forming a photoresist layer on a top surface of said seed layer and then patterning said photoresist layer to form an opening in each of said die zones, and then filling a shielding block in each said opening such that said shielding block and a part of said seed layer which is combined beneath said shielding block form an electromagnetic shielding layer; and e) removing a residual of said photoresist layer from said seed layer and making the part of said seed layer, which is combined with said shielding block, be spaced laterally from each of said solder pads.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, an IC wafer made according to the present invention omits a shielding mask installation procedure in further posterior module fabrication. Further, the conductive bumps provided for the packaging process can be implanted not only after the IC wafer fabrication as usual but also simultaneously with the electromagnetic shielding layer introduced by the IC wafer fabrication of the present invention disclosed above, thereby simplifying the follow-up packaging process.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an IC wafer <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention defines a plurality of die zones <b>12</b>. The IC wafer <b>10</b> comprises an integrated circuit layer <b>20</b>, an insulated layer <b>30</b> and an electromagnetic shielding layer <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The integrated circuit layer <b>20</b> comprises a plurality of solder pads <b>22</b> arranged at the top surface thereof and respectively electrically connected to an electronic device <b>24</b> embedded therein. Each solder pad <b>22</b> is located at the border area of each die zone <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The insulated layer <b>30</b> is located on the top surface of the integrated circuit layer <b>20</b>, defining a through hole <b>32</b> corresponding to each solder pad <b>22</b> for the implantation of a package layer <b>34</b>. The package layer <b>34</b> comprises a conductive bump <b>36</b> and a seed layer <b>44</b>. The conductive bump <b>36</b> is mounted in the through hole <b>32</b> of the insulated layer <b>30</b> and protrudes over the top surface of the insulated layer <b>30</b>. The seed layer <b>44</b> is arranged between the conductive bump <b>36</b> and both of the sidewall of the through hole <b>32</b> and the associating solder pad <b>22</b>. The arrangement of the seed layer <b>44</b> enhances the bonding force between the conductive bump <b>36</b> and the associating solder pad <b>22</b>, Further, distribution of the seed layer <b>44</b> along the sidewall of the through hole <b>32</b> can isolate the insulated layer <b>30</b>, avoiding electric current leakage or moisture influence. However, the package layer <b>34</b> can simply provide the conductive bump <b>36</b> for positive bonding force and electrical conduction with the associating solder pad <b>22</b>, achieving the same expected effects.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The electromagnetic shielding layer <b>40</b> is disposed above the electronic device <b>20</b> and spaced from each through hole <b>32</b> at a predetermined distance and electrically isolated from the solder pads <b>22</b>. The electromagnetic shielding layer <b>40</b> comprises a shielding block <b>42</b> and a seed layer <b>44</b>. The shielding block <b>42</b> is selected from the group consisting of a magnetic material, a conductive material and a physical synthesis of a magnetic material and a conductive material. The seed layer <b>44</b> is arranged between the insulated layer <b>30</b> and the shielding block <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In view of the aforesaid structure, it can be understood that the IC wafer <b>10</b> of the present invention has the electromagnetic shielding layer <b>40</b> be directly formed on the top surface of the insulated layer <b>30</b> during the fabrication for the purpose of electromagnetic shielding, omitting further shielding mask installation procedure as mentioned in the prior art and effectively saving production time and cost. Further, the arrangement of the electromagnetic shielding layer <b>40</b> varies with the type of the electronic device in the integrated circuit layer <b>20</b>. If the electronic device <b>24</b> in the integrated circuit layer <b>20</b> is an active device or passive device exhibiting giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, the electromagnetic shielding layer <b>40</b> can be used as a magnet or magnetic conductor, which is the material selected from a magnetic material or the physical synthesis of a magnetic material and a conductive material. Further, for enabling the electromagnetic shielding layer <b>40</b> to effectively cover over the top side of the electronic device <b>24</b>, the area of arrangement of the electromagnetic shielding layer <b>40</b> is preferably approximately equal to the area of the die zone <b>12</b>. It is notable that, due to the consideration of material hardness as a magnet or magnetic conductor, a big area distribution may lead to the electromagnetic shielding layer crack during a follow-up high temperature manufacturing process subject to a temperature change. Therefore, the electromagnetic shielding layer <b>40</b> is preferably configured to provide multiple shielding blocks <b>42</b> and to have the shielding blocks <b>42</b> be arranged in a parallel manner and kept from one another, and the cover area of the shielding blocks <b>42</b> can be greater than the area of arrangement of the electronic device <b>24</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After understanding of the structural details of the IC wafer <b>10</b>, the fabrication of the IC wafer <b>10</b> is now explained hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1I</figref>, an IC wafer manufacturing process in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention comprises the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">a): forming an integrated circuit layer <b>20</b> having an electronic device <b>24</b> embedded therein and a plurality of solder pads <b>22</b> located on the top surface thereof and respectively electrically connected to the electronic device <b>24</b>;</p>
