<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation-in-part application of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/256,343, filed on Oct. 20, 2005, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a battery module having a plurality of unit batteries. In particular, the present invention relates to a battery module having improved structure of partitioning walls between its unit batteries to provide enhanced battery durability and efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a secondary battery, i.e., a unit battery, may be a type of a rechargeable battery, as opposed to a primary battery that cannot be recharged. A low capacity secondary battery may include a single battery cell to supply power to portable electronic device, such as mobile phones, laptop computers, and camcorders. A high capacity secondary battery may include a plurality of battery cells, i.e., battery module, to supply power to electrical motors, such as a motor of a hybrid vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A conventional battery module may include a plurality of unit cell batteries, wherein each unit battery may include an electrode group, a separator positioned between positive and negative electrodes in the electrode group, positive and negative terminals connected to charge collectors, and a casing with a cap to store the batteries and electrodes therein. The casing may usually be formed to have predetermined intervals between the unit batteries, such that partitioning walls may be interposed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A conventional battery module may also include end plates at the outermost ends thereof. The end plates may be pressed towards each other with the unit batteries therebetween in order to reduce the thickness of the electrode groups of the unit batteries and, thereby, improve the efficiency, i.e., charging/discharging, of the battery units.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when the end plates are pressed to reduce the thickness of the electrode groups, the conventional structure of the partitioning walls may prevent sufficient compression. In particular, the conventional partitioning walls may be structured such that their edges may be in contact with the casing of the battery module, thereby minimizing the amount of inward compression the surface of the casing may undergo. Such minimized inward compression may result either in insufficient thickness reduction of the electrode group, i.e., reduced shifting distance of ions, or in excessive force, thereby subjecting the unit batteries to potential deformation and damage.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there exists a need for a battery module having an improved partitioning wall structure providing enhanced battery durability and efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is therefore directed towards a battery module, which substantially overcomes one or more of the problems due to the limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is therefore a feature of an embodiment of the present invention to provide a battery module having an improved partitioning wall structure providing enhanced charging/discharging efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is therefore another feature of the present invention to provide a battery module having an improved partitioning wall structure capable of providing enhanced durability.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">At least one of the above and other features and advantages of the present invention may be realized by providing a battery module, including at least one unit battery having an electrode group and a battery casing, and at least one partitioning wall coupled to the at least one unit battery, wherein the at least one partitioning wall may have a smaller size as compared to the at least one unit battery. The size of the at least one partitioning wall may be equal to a size of the electrode group of the at least one unit battery. Further, a center of the at least one partitioning wall may be attached to a center of the battery casing of the at least one unit battery.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The battery module according to an embodiment of the present invention may further include a plurality of unit batteries and a plurality of partitioning walls interposed in an alternating array. Additionally, each partitioning wall may include a plurality of protrusions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, at least one fixing member may be coupled to each battery unit. As such, each partitioning wall may be positioned between at least two fixing members. The at least one fixing member may be formed of an elastic material. Additionally, the battery module may include a housing having a space for a cooling fluid, wherein the at least one fixing member may be positioned in a direction parallel to a direction of flow of the cooling fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The at least one fixing member may have a semicircular shape. Alternatively, the at least one fixing member may have a longitudinal shape, wherein the at least one fixing member may have a width that is larger than the width of the protrusions of the partitioning walls. The at least one fixing member may also have a rectangular protrusion shape, wherein it may have a width that is equal to or smaller than the width of the protrusions of the partitioning walls. Additionally, such a battery module may include a plurality of rectangular-shaped fixing member integrated with the battery casing of the unit battery.</p>

The electrode terminals <b>11</b><i>b </i>may be formed on an outside surface of the battery casing <b>11</b><i>a</i>, such that they may protrude outwardly from the battery casing <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The partitioning walls <b>12</b> of the battery module <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention may be formed between the unit batteries <b>11</b>. In particular, each partitioning wall <b>12</b> may be positioned between two adjacent unit batteries <b>11</b> to form an alternating array of unit batteries <b>11</b> and partitioning walls <b>12</b>. In other words, each partitioning wall <b>12</b> may be coupled to one unit battery <b>11</b> to form a single array unit. A plurality of such single array units may be assembled into an alternating array, such that each partitioning wall <b>12</b> may have a parallel unit battery <b>11</b> at each side.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each partitioning wall <b>12</b> may provide a medium for a cooling fluid between the unit batteries <b>11</b>, such that sufficient temperature control, i.e., cooling, of the unit batteries <b>11</b> may be supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The partitioning wall <b>12</b> may include a base <b>12</b><i>a </i>and a plurality of protrusions <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The base <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be formed in any shape known in the art to facilitate construction of the partitioning wall <b>12</b>, e.g., a rectangular plate. The plurality of protrusions <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be formed in the base <b>12</b><i>a </i>in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the base <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and they may be uniformly disposed thereon, i.e., having uniform and predetermined intervals therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The size of the partitioning wall <b>12</b> may be smaller than the size of the unit battery <b>11</b>. In particular, the length and height of the base <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the partitioning wall <b>12</b>, as measured along the x-axis and z-axis, respectively, may be smaller than the length and height, respectively, of the battery casing <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the unit battery <b>11</b>. As such, the edges of the partitioning walls <b>12</b> may not be in contact with the battery casing <b>11</b><i>a </i>due to their shorter length. For example, the size of the partitioning wall <b>12</b> may be substantially equal to the size of the electrode group <b>43</b> in the unit battery <b>11</b>, i.e., have the same length and height, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The partitioning wall <b>12</b> may be attached to the unit battery <b>11</b> such that the center of the base <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be affixed to the center of the battery casing <b>11</b><i>a</i>. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that such attachment may be advantageous because any force exerted by the partitioning walls <b>12</b> onto the unit batteries <b>11</b> may be directed towards the center of the unit batteries <b>11</b>, thereby eliminating pressure from the edges of the unit batteries <b>11</b> and minimizing the overall force applied thereto by the end plates <b>36</b> as will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The pair of end plates <b>36</b> of the battery module <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention may be formed at the two outermost ends of the battery module <b>100</b>, such that the plurality of unit batteries <b>11</b> and partitioning walls <b>12</b>, i.e., alternating array, may be positioned therebetween. The pair of end plates <b>36</b> may be connected to support the alternating array therebetween. In particular, each one of the end plates <b>36</b> may have a thru-hole <b>36</b><i>a </i>at each of its corners to facilitate assembly of the battery module <b>100</b>. More specifically, a connecting member <b>30</b> may be inserted into each thru-hole <b>36</b><i>a </i>of one end plate <b>36</b> and a corresponding thru-hole <b>36</b><i>a </i>of another end plate <b>36</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to form a supporting structure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The connecting member <b>30</b> may include a bar portion <b>32</b> having a flange portion <b>31</b> at one end a thread <b>34</b> at another end, such that after the connecting member <b>30</b> is inserted through both end plates <b>36</b>, a nut <b>33</b> may be connected to the thread <b>34</b> of the bar portion <b>32</b> of the connecting member <b>30</b> to secure connection thereof. The battery module <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention may include four connecting members <b>30</b>, such that the battery module <b>100</b> may be secured along four sides simultaneously to form a supporting structure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Securing four nuts <b>33</b> to the four connecting members <b>30</b> may provide sufficient force to push the pair of end plates <b>36</b> together and, thereby, compress the plurality of the unit batteries <b>11</b> and plurality of partitioning walls <b>12</b> together as well. Such compression may minimize the distance between the plurality of the unit batteries <b>11</b> and plurality of partitioning walls <b>12</b>, thereby improving the battery efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another embodiment of a battery module according to the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, a battery module <b>200</b> may include a plurality of unit batteries <b>11</b>, a plurality of partitioning walls <b>12</b> interposed between the unit batteries <b>11</b> to provide a path for a cooling fluid, end plates <b>36</b> for supporting the unit batteries <b>11</b>, and a plurality of fixing members <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is noted that some of the particular elements included in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> are the same elements described previously with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>. Accordingly, only elements and details that may be distinguishable from the previous embodiment will be described hereinafter. Details and descriptions that may be found in both embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> will not be repeated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The fixing members <b>25</b> of the battery module <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention may have a longitudinal shape, e.g., rectangular bar, circular bar, triangular bar, and so forth, and they may be installed lengthwise in each of the upper and lower ends of the unit battery <b>11</b> by any way known in the art, e.g., adhesive, to support the partitioning wall <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>. In particular, the fixing members <b>25</b> may be attached in parallel to the partitioning walls <b>12</b>, such that each partitioning wall <b>12</b> may be positioned between two fixing members <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fixing members <b>25</b> may be formed of an elastic material, such as silicon or rubber. Preferably, the fixing members <b>25</b> may be formed of a silicon material having an excellent thermal conductivity. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>, the fixing members <b>25</b> may be formed to have a width that is larger than the width of the protrusions <b>12</b><i>b</i>, wherein both widths may be measured from an outer surface of the battery casing <b>11</b><i>a </i>along the y-axis, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In particular, the difference between the widths of the fixing members <b>25</b> and the protrusions <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be referred to as T, wherein T may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art with respect to the size of the unit battery <b>11</b> and the structure of the battery module <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the structure of the fixing members <b>25</b>, i.e., material and width, may facilitate compression thereof upon application of force. In other words, when the end plates <b>36</b> exert force to compress the plurality of unit batteries <b>11</b> and partitioning walls <b>12</b> therebetween, the fixing members <b>25</b> may contract to have a smaller width. When the fixing members <b>25</b> are contracted to have a width that is equal to the width of the protrusions <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the force exerted by the end plates <b>36</b> may be directed towards the partitioning walls <b>12</b> in order to inwardly compress the unit batteries <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this respect, it should be noted that the initial force exerted by the end plates <b>36</b> onto the fixing members <b>25</b> may be redirected and uniformly applied to the unit batteries <b>11</b> through the partitioning walls <b>12</b>. Compression of the unit batteries <b>11</b> by the partitioning walls <b>12</b> may reduce the thickness of the electrode groups <b>43</b> in the unit batteries <b>11</b> and, thereby, minimize the shifting distance of the activation material ions contained therein, i.e., improve charging/discharging efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The battery module <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention may also include a housing <b>15</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The housing <b>15</b> may be formed in any suitable hollow volumetric shape known in the art, e.g., cylindrical, spherical, hexagonal, and so forth, to provide sufficient storage space for the battery module <b>200</b>. Additionally, the housing <b>15</b> may include an inlet <b>15</b><i>a </i>and an outlet <b>15</b><i>b </i>for providing an inlet and an outlet, respectively, for the cooling fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In particular, the cooling fluid according to an embodiment of the present invention may be introduced into the housing <b>15</b> through the inlet <b>15</b><i>a</i>, flow through the partitioning walls <b>12</b> along the x-axis, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and exit the housing <b>15</b> through the outlet <b>15</b><i>b</i>. Since the cooling fluid may flow along the x-axis, its direction may be parallel to the direction of the fixing members <b>25</b>, as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, thereby minimizing any interference between the cooling fluid and any of the battery module <b>200</b> elements.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another embodiment of a battery module according to the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a battery module may include a plurality of unit batteries <b>11</b>, a plurality of partitioning walls <b>12</b> with protrusions <b>12</b><i>b</i>, end plates <b>36</b> for supporting the unit batteries <b>11</b>, and a plurality of fixing members <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is noted that some of the particular elements included in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are the same elements described previously with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>. Accordingly, only elements and details that may be distinguishable from the previous embodiment will be described hereinafter. Details and descriptions that may be found in both embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> will not be repeated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The fixing members <b>45</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention may be formed as a plurality of semicircles, i.e., a cross-section cut away around the z-axis, such that at least two fixing members <b>45</b> may be installed in each of the upper and lower ends of the unit battery <b>11</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In particular, the plane of the semicircular fixing members <b>45</b>, i.e., xy-plane, may be perpendicular to the plane of the partitioning wall <b>12</b>, i.e., xz-plane. Accordingly, each partitioning wall <b>12</b> may be positioned between two rows of fixing members <b>45</b>, each row including a plurality of fixing members <b>45</b>, as further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">More specifically, the linear portions of the semicircles may be in contact with the unit battery <b>11</b>, while the circular portion of the semicircles may protrude away from the unit battery <b>11</b> in the same direction as the protrusions <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The fixing members <b>45</b> may protrude outwardly further than the partitioning wall <b>12</b>. In other words, the radius of the semicircle of each fixing member <b>45</b> may be longer than the width of the protrusions <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The fixing members <b>45</b> may be formed of an elastic material, e.g., silicon, rubber, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the structure of the fixing members <b>45</b>, i.e., material and circular shape, may facilitate compression thereof upon application of force. In other words, exertion of force by the end plates <b>36</b> to compress the plurality of unit batteries <b>11</b> and partitioning walls <b>12</b> therebetween may contract the fixing members <b>45</b>. It should be noted that the circular shape of the fixing members <b>45</b> may have a relatively smaller cross-section as compared to longitudinal shapes, e.g., rectangular bar, thereby requiring smaller force and shorter time to achieve a desirable level of compression.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another embodiment of a battery module according to the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a battery module may include a plurality of unit batteries <b>11</b>, a plurality of partitioning walls <b>12</b>, end plates <b>36</b> for supporting the unit batteries <b>11</b>, and a plurality of fixing members <b>55</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The fixing members <b>55</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention may be formed as a plurality of rectangular protrusions extending in the same direction as the protrusions <b>12</b><i>b</i>, such that at least four fixing members <b>55</b> may be attached to the unit battery <b>11</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In particular, the fixing members <b>55</b> may be attached to a surface of the unit battery <b>11</b>, such that at least one fixing member <b>55</b> may be positioned along one side of the partitioning wall <b>12</b> coupled thereto. Accordingly, each partitioning wall <b>12</b> may be surrounded by at least four fixing members <b>55</b>, i.e., one on each side, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The fixing members <b>55</b> may be either integrated with the battery casing <b>11</b><i>a </i>into a single structure or separately attached to the battery casing <b>11</b><i>a</i>.
