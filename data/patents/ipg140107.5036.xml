<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present embodiments relate to determining when a physical location of a contact or user matches a task location associated with a task in a task list. An alert message may be transmitted to the contact when the physical location of the contact or user matches the task location. The physical location of the contact and user may be determined using a global positioning system (GPS) device, such as a cellular telephone. The alert message may be sent to the user and/or the contact. The alert message may be sent to the user as a reminder to complete a task. However, the alert message may be sent to the contact as a request, for example, to complete the task for the contact.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are many advantages to transmitting an alert message based on a contact's location. One such advantage is that the user may have tasks completed even when the user is not physically present at the task location.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As used herein, the term &#x201c;contact&#x201d; includes a person, human-being, entity (e.g., company), or electronic device known to the user. The term &#x201c;user&#x201d; includes a human or electronic device owning, using, controlling, operating, or managing a task list, a contact list, or both the task list and contract list. Contact data, which identifies the contact, may be stored in the user's contact list.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, an alert system is provided. The alert system includes a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory is computer-readable storage media configured to store instructions that are operable to be executed by the processor. The memory stores instructions that may be executed to determine a physical location of a contact in a contact list or a user managing the contact list; determine a physical location associated with a task in a task list; compare the physical location of the contact with the physical location associated with the task; determine when the physical location of the contact matches the physical location associated with the task; and transmit an alert message indicating the task.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, a method for sending an alert message is provided. The method includes determining a physical location of a contact in a contact list or a physical location of a user that manages the contact list. The physical location of the contact is compared with a physical location associated with a task in a task list. When the physical location of the contact matches the physical location associated with the task, an alert message is transmitted about the task.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another aspect, an alert system is provided. The alert system includes a task manager, a contact manager, an environment having one or more establishments, and an alert device. The task manager may be configured to support a task list having one or more tasks and one or more task locations associated with the one or more tasks. The task list may be registered or managed by a user. The contact manager may be configured to support a contact list having a list of one or more contacts known to the user. The one or more contacts may be human-beings. The one or more establishments may be located at the one or more task locations. The alert device may be configured to compare physical locations of the one or more contacts or physical location of the user with the one or more task locations. The alert device may be configured to transmit an alert message when one of the one or more contacts is at or near one of the one or more task locations.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an alert system <b>10</b>. The alert system <b>10</b> may include one or more communication devices <b>12</b> (hereinafter, communication device <b>12</b>), one or more mobile devices <b>20</b> (hereinafter, mobile device <b>20</b>), and a server <b>30</b>. The server <b>30</b> may be coupled with the communication device <b>12</b> and/or mobile device <b>20</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;coupled with&#x201d; may include directly connected or indirectly connected through one or more intermediary components. The intermediary components may include software and/or hardware components. The connection may be a wireless connection, wired connection, or a series of wireless and/or wired connections.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The system <b>10</b> may be used to alert a user <b>14</b> and/or a contact <b>52</b> using an alert message <b>60</b>. The server <b>30</b> may transmit the alert message <b>60</b> to the communication device <b>12</b> and/or mobile device <b>20</b> when the contact <b>52</b> and/or the user <b>14</b> is at or near a task location <b>44</b> for a task in a task list.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one illustration of the alert system <b>10</b>, John manages an electronic task list and a contact list. John creates a task in the electronic task list. The task is &#x201c;buy shampoo.&#x201d; A task location, such as &#x201c;convenience store,&#x201d; is associated with the task. John's roommate, Lance, goes into a convenience store to buy a pack of gum. Because Lance's contact data is stored in John's contact list, the alert system <b>10</b> may monitor Lance's physical location using Lance's global positioning system (GPS)-enabled telephone. Upon entering the convenience store, the alert system <b>10</b> may transmit an alert message <b>60</b> to Lance and/or John. The alert message may indicate that Lance is in a convenience store and can buy shampoo for John. The alert message may be used to initiate communication between Lance and John and/or request Lance to complete the task.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The communication device <b>12</b> may be operated by a user <b>14</b>. The user <b>14</b> may be a human being, computer, automation system, or other device registered, authorized, permitted, or operable to control a task list and/or contact list. The mobile device <b>20</b> may be operated by a contact <b>52</b>. As discussed above, a contact <b>52</b> is a person, human-being, or electronic device known to a user <b>14</b>. The user <b>14</b> may know the contact <b>52</b> through family, friends, common acquaintances, colleagues, professional connections, social networks, or other networks, or the user <b>14</b> employs the contact <b>52</b>, such as a personal assistant. In the illustration above, John is the user <b>14</b> and Lance is the contact <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The communication device <b>12</b> may be a personal computer, cellular telephone, mobile device, personal digital assistant, or other device operable to control a task list and/or contact list. In one example, the communication device <b>12</b> may be a global positioning system (GPS)-enabled mobile device.

The user <b>14</b> may view messages transmitted to the communication device <b>12</b>. For example, a text message may be sent to and displayed on the communication device <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The communication device <b>12</b> may be used to manage an electronic task list (hereinafter, task list) <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Table 1 illustrates one example of a task list <b>40</b>. The task list <b>40</b> may include a task <b>42</b>, task location <b>44</b>, due date <b>46</b>, and alert policy <b>48</b>. The task list <b>40</b> may include additional, different, or less information. A list of tasks <b>42</b> to be completed, such as chores, jobs, projects, meetings, gatherings, social tasks, employment tasks, or other tasks may be included. In the illustration above, &#x201c;buy shampoo&#x201d; is a task <b>42</b>. In addition to the tasks defined in the task list <b>40</b>, John may enter &#x201c;buy shampoo&#x201d; in the task list <b>40</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The task list <b>40</b> may be an electronic to-do list, time management list, or personal information manager. The task list <b>40</b> may be an electronic inventory tool which serves as an alternative or supplement to a memory of the user <b>14</b>. The task list <b>40</b> may be used in self-management, business management, project management, and software development. One or more list may be included in the task list <b>40</b>, or multiple, separate task lists may be used. For example, an employment task list may be combined with a social task list. Exemplary task lists include the &#x201c;Tasks&#x201d; feature in Microsoft Outlook&#x2122; sold by Microsoft Inc., the &#x201c;Task List 5.2&#x201d; application sold by Apple Inc., or other similar task list features.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to manage a task list <b>40</b>, the communication device <b>12</b> may include an input. The input may be a keyboard, mouse, microphone, touch-screen, or other device for inputting information or instructions into the communication device <b>12</b>. The user <b>14</b> may manage the task list <b>40</b> using the input. In another embodiment, the communication device <b>12</b> may automatically manage the task list <b>40</b> based on predetermined policies or user's past tendencies.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Managing the task list <b>40</b> may include adding, removing, or editing one or more entries in the task list <b>40</b>. An entry may include a task <b>42</b>, task location <b>44</b>, due date <b>46</b>, alert policy <b>48</b>, a combination thereof, or other information in the task list <b>40</b>. For example, a new task <b>42</b> may be added to the task list <b>40</b>. In addition to adding the new task <b>42</b>, the task location <b>44</b>, due date <b>46</b> and alert policy <b>48</b> for the new task may be added to the task list <b>40</b> or modified. Additional, different, or less information may be added with the new task. In another example, once a task has been completed, the task <b>42</b> and associated information may be removed. Removing a task <b>42</b> may include checking a completion box or otherwise deleting the task <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The task location <b>44</b> may be a location where the task <b>42</b> may be completed. The task location <b>44</b> may be a general location (e.g., grocery store), specific location (e.g., Building Z, 123 Oak St.), or physical coordinates (e.g., longitude and latitude coordinates). The due date <b>46</b> may be a target due date, final due date, or actual date. For example, the due date <b>46</b> for picking up the dry cleaning may be a target due date if the clothes are not needed by Saturday. The due date <b>46</b> for picking up the dry cleaning may be a final due date if the clothes are needed for an event on Saturday evening. In another example, the due date <b>46</b> for the cookout may be an actual date. In other words, the cookout may be taking place on Sunday. The due date <b>46</b> may include a time, for example, 7:00 pm.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The alert policy <b>48</b> may be a contact (e.g., Bill) or contact group (e.g., Family, Colleague) that may be used for filtering alert messages <b>60</b> for a particular task <b>42</b>. Contacts that are not defined in the alert policy <b>48</b> may not trigger an alert message <b>60</b> and/or may not receive an alert message <b>60</b>. The alert policy <b>48</b> allows the user <b>14</b> to control alert messages <b>60</b>. For example, the user <b>14</b> may use the alert policy <b>48</b> to prevent an alert message from being sent each time that a colleague enters a grocery store. The user <b>14</b> may know that it is unlikely that the colleague will be willing to &#x201c;Pick up Groceries.&#x201d; The alert policy <b>48</b> may be set each time a task <b>42</b> is created. Alternatively, the alert policy <b>48</b> may be automatically set based on predetermined policies or past tendencies for a particular task <b>42</b>. For example, the task &#x201c;Pick up Dry Cleaning&#x201d; may default to the contact group &#x201c;Family.&#x201d; In an alternative embodiment, the alert policy <b>48</b> may be a predefined rule, such as &#x201c;do not send an alert message between 8 am and 5 pm&#x201d; or other user defined policy. Accordingly, the user <b>14</b> may tailor transmission of the alert message <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The communication device <b>12</b> may be used to manage a contact list <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Table 2 illustrates an exemplary contact list <b>50</b>. The contact list <b>50</b> may include a contact <b>52</b>, contact information <b>54</b>, and contact group <b>56</b>. Additional, different, or less information may be provided in the contact list <b>50</b>. For example, each contact <b>52</b> may be associated with multiple communication devices and/or multiple contact groups <b>56</b>. The contact list <b>50</b> may be an electronic collection of one or more contacts <b>52</b>. A contact <b>52</b> may be a person or electronic device known to the user <b>14</b>. The user <b>14</b> may desire to communicate with the contact <b>52</b>. In order to do so, the user <b>14</b> may use the communication information <b>54</b>. The communication information <b>54</b> may include a phone number, email address, text messaging address or number, video conferencing identification, a combination thereof, or other number or address for communicating with the contact <b>52</b>. In one embodiment, the user <b>14</b> may be listed as a contact <b>52</b> in the contact list <b>50</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The user <b>14</b> may manage the task list <b>40</b> using an input of the communication device <b>12</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the communication device <b>12</b> may automatically manage the contact list <b>50</b> based on predetermined policies or the user's <b>14</b> past tendencies. For example, the communication device <b>12</b> may update the contact list <b>50</b> based on updates to an electronic social network, such as Facebook or MySpace. An updated phone number in an electronic social network may be reflected in the contact list <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The communication information <b>56</b> may be an address or number used to establish a communication connection with the mobile device <b>20</b> or a different device. For example, the phone number &#x201c;123-456-7890&#x201d; may be used to contact Jane's cellular telephone. However, the email address &#x201c;bill@xxxx.yyy&#x201d; may be used to send an email message to Bill's cellular telephone; not Bill's automotive navigation system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The contact group <b>56</b> may define a group of contacts <b>52</b>. The contact group may be defined based on the relation to the user <b>14</b>. For example, members of the user's <b>14</b> family may belong to the contact group &#x201c;Family.&#x201d; Friends of the user <b>14</b> may belong to the contact group &#x201c;Friend.&#x201d; People that work with the user <b>14</b> may belong to the contact group &#x201c;Colleague.&#x201d; Other contact groups <b>56</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The mobile device <b>20</b> may be a cellular telephone, personal digital assistant, media device, global positioning device (GPS), automotive navigation system, or other mobile device for which a physical location may be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The mobile device <b>20</b> may be a GPS enabled mobile device. Exemplary mobile devices <b>20</b> include the iPhone&#x2122; made by Apple Inc., the HTC Fuze&#x2122; made by HTC Corporation, the N&#xfc;vi&#xae; 1250 navigation system made by Garmin Ltd., or other mobile devices with physical location enabled capabilities. As used herein, the term &#x201c;physical location enabled capabilities&#x201d; includes the ability to determine (e.g., locate) or provide information to assist in determining the physical location of the mobile device. The mobile device <b>20</b> may determine the physical location or another device may determine the physical location. In either case, the physical location of the mobile device may be determined. Non-GPS positioning may be used, such as relying on cell triangulation, entry of information (e.g., twittering a current location), or other manual or automatic input.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A contact <b>52</b> may use the mobile device <b>20</b>. Using the mobile device <b>20</b> may include carrying the mobile device <b>20</b> (e.g., in the contact's <b>52</b> hand, bag, or car). As a result, a physical location of the mobile device <b>20</b> may represent (i.e., correspond with) a physical location of the contact <b>52</b>. A mobile device <b>20</b> may be associated with a contact <b>52</b>. For example, as shown in Table 2, the mobile device <b>20</b><i>a </i>may be associated with contact <b>52</b><i>a</i>, the mobile device <b>20</b><i>b </i>may be associated with contact <b>52</b><i>b</i>, and the mobile device <b>20</b><i>c </i>may be associated with contact <b>52</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The server <b>30</b> may include a processor <b>32</b> and memory <b>34</b>. Additional, different, or fewer components may be provided. The server <b>30</b> may be operable to continuously or periodically compare the location of one or more contacts <b>52</b> in a user's contact list <b>50</b> or the location of the user <b>14</b> with one, some, none, or all of the task locations <b>42</b> in a user's task list <b>40</b>. The server <b>30</b> may be an alert device that is operable to send an alert message <b>60</b> when the location of one or more of the contacts or the location of the user approaches or matches the task location <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an environment <b>200</b> in which the alert system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be used. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the environment <b>200</b> as a neighborhood, town, or city, in other embodiments, the alert system <b>10</b> may be used in a residential home environment, office building environment, commercial environment, nation-wide environment, and/or global environment. The size and shape of the environment <b>200</b> may or may not be restricted. For example, a corporation may restrict the environment <b>200</b> to buildings and/or streets used for business purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the environment <b>200</b> may include one or more establishments, such as a first dry cleaning store <b>202</b>, a second dry cleaning store <b>204</b>, a grocery store <b>206</b>, and a residential home <b>208</b>. Additional, different, or fewer establishments may be provided in the environment <b>200</b>. Any establishment may be used in the environment <b>200</b>. As used herein, an establishment is a store, building, office, desk, address, or other space located at a task location <b>44</b>. The establishment may provide a service or good to complete a task <b>42</b>. The establishment may be associated with project locations, such as labs and offices.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first dry cleaning store <b>202</b> may be named &#x201c;Wash and Suds.&#x201d; The second dry cleaning store <b>204</b> may be named &#x201c;Let us Clean It.&#x201d; The grocery store <b>206</b> may be named &#x201c;Generic Grocery Store.&#x201d; The residential home <b>208</b> may be located at 123 Oak St.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The server <b>30</b> may determine a physical location <b>210</b> of one or more contacts <b>52</b>, a physical location of the user <b>14</b>, or a combination thereof. Determining the physical location may include calculating the physical location, receiving the physical location from another device or remote database, accessing the physical location from memory <b>34</b>, or otherwise obtaining the physical location of the mobile device <b>20</b> associated with a contact <b>52</b> or a mobile device associated with the user <b>14</b>. The physical location <b>210</b> may be a set of physical location coordinates. The set of physical location coordinates may include one or more GPS coordinates. The GPS coordinates may be longitude and latitude coordinates, such as &#x201c;&#x2212;87.6216148,41.8902682,0.&#x201d; In one example, the server <b>30</b> may determine a physical location <b>210</b><i>a </i>of mobile device <b>20</b><i>b</i>, a physical location <b>210</b><i>b </i>of mobile device <b>20</b><i>b</i>, and a physical location <b>210</b><i>c </i>of mobile device <b>20</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The server <b>30</b> may determine a physical location <b>212</b> of one, some, or all of the establishments (e.g., task locations <b>42</b>) in the environment <b>120</b>. Determining the physical location <b>212</b> may include calculating the physical location <b>212</b>, receiving the physical location <b>212</b> from another device or remote database, accessing the physical location <b>212</b> from memory <b>34</b>, or otherwise obtaining the physical location <b>212</b> of the establishment. The physical location <b>212</b> may be a set of physical location coordinates. The set of physical location coordinates may include one or more GPS coordinates, such as longitude and latitude coordinates. Ranges of coordinates may be used. The location may be automatically mined, such as from the Internet, and/or input by the user <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The server <b>30</b> may continually or periodically compare the physical location <b>210</b> of a contact <b>52</b> and/or the physical location of the user <b>14</b> with the physical locations <b>212</b> of one, some, or all of the task locations <b>42</b> in the task list <b>40</b>. Comparing may include comparing coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the physical location <b>210</b> of the contact <b>52</b> is only compared to the physical locations <b>212</b> of the task locations <b>42</b> in the task list <b>40</b>. For example, because the second dry cleaning store <b>204</b>, the grocery store <b>206</b>, and the residential home <b>208</b> are task locations <b>42</b>, the physical location <b>210</b><i>a </i>of Jane <b>52</b><i>a </i>may be compared to the physical location <b>212</b><i>b </i>of the second dry cleaning store <b>204</b>, the physical location <b>212</b><i>c </i>of the grocery store <b>126</b>, and the physical location <b>212</b><i>d </i>of the residential home <b>208</b>. The physical location <b>210</b><i>a </i>of Jane <b>52</b> may not be compared to the physical location <b>212</b><i>a </i>of the first dry cleaning store <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another embodiment, the physical location <b>210</b> of the contact <b>52</b> is only compared to the physical locations <b>212</b> of the task locations <b>44</b> in the task list <b>40</b> of which an alert policy <b>48</b> matches the contact group <b>56</b> of the contact <b>52</b>. For example, because Jane <b>52</b><i>a </i>is in contact group <b>56</b> and there is a &#x201c;Family&#x201d; alert policy <b>46</b> for &#x201c;Picking up Groceries&#x201d; and &#x201c;Picking up Dry Cleaning,&#x201d; the physical location <b>210</b><i>a </i>of Jane <b>52</b><i>a </i>may be compared to the physical location <b>212</b><i>b </i>of the second dry cleaning store <b>204</b> and the physical location <b>212</b><i>c </i>of the grocery store <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In yet another embodiment, the physical location <b>210</b> of the contact <b>52</b> is compared to the physical locations <b>212</b> of all the establishments in the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an alternative embodiment, the location of the user <b>14</b> may be matched to the physical locations <b>212</b> of the task locations <b>44</b> in the task list <b>40</b>. For example, the user <b>14</b> may receive an alert message <b>60</b> when the location of the user <b>14</b> matches the physical location <b>212</b> of a task location <b>44</b>. One benefit of this embodiment is that the user <b>14</b> may be reminded to perform tasks <b>42</b>. The chance of the user <b>14</b> forgetting to perform a task <b>42</b> is reduced. In one embodiment, the user <b>14</b> is listed as a contact <b>52</b>. However, in other embodiments, the location of the user <b>14</b> is treated independently of those contacts <b>52</b> listed in the contact list <b>50</b>. For example, the location of the user <b>14</b> may be continuously or periodically compared to one or more task locations <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The server <b>30</b> may make intelligent correlations between establishments. Correlations may be based on services or goods provided by the establishments, the establishment's capability to complete the task, or user's preference. For example, in one embodiment, if the user <b>14</b> recorded a task location as &#x201c;Generic Grocery Store <b>206</b>,&#x201d; the server <b>30</b> may compare the physical location <b>210</b> of a contact <b>52</b>, such as Jane <b>52</b><i>a</i>, with the physical location of other grocery stores. The contact <b>52</b> may be able to complete the task <b>42</b> at a different establishment.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another example, the server <b>30</b> may be an alert device that includes a natural language processing engine that is operable to cross-reference a task to determine establishments where the task may be completed. The server <b>30</b> may also be operable to compare the location of the contact to a physical location of the establishments where the task may be completed. In one example of cross-referencing, when the task &#x201c;buy toilet paper&#x201d; is entered in the task list, the server <b>30</b> may user the natural language processing engine to identify all, some, or none of the establishments in a database that sell toilet paper. The physical location of the establishments that sell toilet paper may be compared to the physical location of the contact or the physical location of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, the server <b>30</b> may continually or periodically compare the physical location <b>210</b> of a contact <b>52</b> with a target zone <b>220</b> for a task location <b>44</b> in the task list <b>40</b>. The target zone <b>220</b> may be a zone that is around, near, or associated with the physical location <b>212</b> of the task location <b>44</b>. The target zone <b>220</b> may be one or more sets of coordinates that defines a zone. The target zone <b>220</b> may surround (e.g., three or more sets of coordinates) the physical location <b>212</b> of the task location <b>44</b>, such as a block or local area. Alternatively, the target zone <b>220</b> may be line (e.g., two sets of coordinates), such as a street or store front. The target zone <b>220</b> may be used to indicate when a contact <b>52</b> is nearing the task location <b>44</b>. The target zone <b>220</b> may be predefined or automatically set. For example, a target zone <b>220</b> may be automatically set to include five (5) square miles around the task location <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The server <b>30</b> may determine whether the physical location <b>210</b> of a contact <b>52</b> matches the physical location <b>212</b> of the task location <b>44</b> and/or the target zone <b>220</b>. Matching may include being the same or almost the same. For example, the physical location <b>210</b><i>a </i>of Jane <b>52</b><i>a </i>may match the physical location <b>212</b><i>b </i>of the second dry cleaning store <b>204</b> when Jane enters into the second dry cleaning store <b>124</b> or pulls into a parking lot for the second dry cleaning store <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The server <b>30</b> may generate an alert message <b>60</b>. The alert message <b>60</b> may be a text message, audio message, electronic mail message, video message, or other message that may be transmitted to the communication device <b>12</b> and/or mobile device <b>20</b>. The alert message <b>60</b> may include an alert description <b>62</b>, communication description <b>64</b>, and a payment description <b>66</b>. Additional, different, or less information may be provided. For example, the payment description <b>64</b> may not be included.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The server <b>30</b> may transmit the alert message <b>60</b> to communication device <b>12</b> and/or mobile device <b>20</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the alert message <b>60</b> may be posted to a social network service, such as Facebook, MySpace, or Linked-In. Other embodiments may include transmitting the alert message <b>60</b> to one or more devices or services operated, managed, owned, controlled, or viewed by the contact <b>52</b> or user <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The alert description <b>62</b> may describe the task <b>42</b>, the task location <b>44</b>, the user <b>14</b>, and the contact <b>52</b>. Additional, different, or less description may be provided. In one example, an alert description <b>62</b> may read &#x201c;Jane is at Generic Grocery Store.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The communication description <b>64</b> may provide a communication address/number or access to a communication address/number for the contact <b>52</b>. In one example, a communication description <b>64</b> may read: &#x201c;Send Text Message to 123-456-7890.&#x201d; The phone number may include a hyper-link. Alternatively, the user <b>14</b> may look Jane up in the contact list <b>50</b>, for example, by scrolling or searching.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The payment description <b>64</b> may provide payment options for completing the task <b>42</b>. The payment options may include a financial account number, such as a PayPal account number or routing number/address, for providing monetary resources to the contact <b>52</b>. For example, the server <b>30</b> may have access to Jane's financial account number, which may be her email address or bank account number. The payment description <b>64</b> may read: &#x201c;Financial account number is 8877223.&#x201d; A one-time credit card number may be provided in the payment description <b>64</b>. The payment description <b>64</b> provides a way for the user <b>14</b> to pay for the goods or services, or, alternatively, pay the contact <b>52</b> for completing the task.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The server <b>30</b> may transmit the alert message <b>60</b> to the communication device <b>12</b>, mobile device <b>20</b>, or both the communication device <b>12</b> and the mobile device <b>20</b>. An alert message <b>60</b> transmitted to a mobile device <b>12</b> may be different than an alert message <b>60</b> transmitted to a communication device <b>12</b>. For example, an alert message <b>60</b> transmitted to the mobile device <b>20</b> may read as follows: &#x201c;You may be able to assist [insert User <b>14</b> name]. [User <b>14</b>] is scheduled to [insert &#x201c;Task <b>42</b>&#x201d;] from [insert &#x201c;Task Location <b>46</b>&#x201d;]. Would you like to assist?

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The server <b>30</b> may transmit the alert message <b>60</b> when the physical location <b>210</b> of a contact <b>52</b> matches the physical location <b>212</b> of the task location <b>44</b> and/or the target zone <b>220</b>. The alert message <b>60</b> may be transmitted to the communication device <b>12</b>, mobile device <b>20</b>, or other device. The user <b>14</b> may view the alert message <b>60</b> on the communication device <b>12</b>. The contact <b>52</b> may view the alert message <b>60</b> on the mobile device <b>20</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the user <b>14</b> may use the communication device <b>12</b>, for example, a personal computer, to manage the task list <b>40</b> and contact list <b>50</b>; however, the alert message <b>60</b> may be transmitted to the user's mobile device, for example, cellular telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an alternative embodiment, the alert message <b>60</b> is a reminder. When the user <b>14</b> arrives at a location for any purpose, the alert may reminder the user <b>14</b> of a task to be performed, at least in part, at the location.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, the server <b>30</b> may transmit the alert message <b>60</b> to only contacts <b>52</b> in the contact group defined in the alert policy <b>48</b>. In order to do so, the server <b>30</b> may compare the alert policy <b>48</b> for the task <b>42</b> where the contact <b>52</b> is located to the contact group <b>56</b> to which the contact <b>52</b> belongs. If the alert policy <b>48</b> matches the contact group <b>56</b>, the server <b>30</b> may transmit the alert message <b>60</b> to the contact <b>52</b>. Otherwise, the server <b>30</b> may refrain from transmitting the alert message <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another embodiment, the server <b>30</b> may transmit the alert message <b>60</b> on the actual due date. The server <b>30</b> may compare the due date <b>46</b> to the actual date. Accordingly, the server <b>30</b> may transmit the alert message <b>60</b> when the physical location <b>210</b> of the contact <b>52</b> matches the task location <b>44</b> and the due date <b>46</b> matches the actual date. For example, an alert message <b>60</b> may be transmitted to the user <b>12</b> when Bill <b>52</b><i>c </i>arrives at the residential home <b>208</b> on Sunday. Otherwise, for example, on Saturday, the server <b>30</b> may not transmit an alert message <b>60</b> if Bill <b>52</b><i>c </i>arrives at the residential home <b>208</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a method <b>300</b> for sending an alert message. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method <b>300</b> may include determining a physical location of a contact in a contact list <b>310</b> or a user; determining a physical location of a task in a task list <b>320</b>; determining when the physical location of the contact or user matches with the physical location of the task <b>330</b>; determining when an alert policy is satisfied <b>340</b>; and transmitting an alert message indicating that the physical location of the contact matches the physical location of the task <b>350</b>. Additional, different, or fewer acts may be provided. The acts may be performed in the order shown or a different order. The method <b>300</b> may be performed by the system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or a different system.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In act <b>310</b>, an alert device may determine a physical location of a task in a user's task list. The physical location of the task may be a task location. In other words, the physical location of the task may a physical location where a task may be completed. For example, if the task is &#x201c;pick up groceries&#x201d; the task location may be &#x201c;grocery store.&#x201d; The physical location of the task may be a set of coordinates, such as longitude and latitude coordinates. A database may store the physical location of the task. The alert device may access the database to determine the physical location. For example, a service or business creates the database of local establishments or business locations. Alternatively, the alert device may request the physical location from a remote device. For example, Google&#xae; maps is used to determine the locations of nearby grocery stores.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In act <b>320</b>, the alert device may determine a physical location of a contact in a user's contact list or the physical location of the user. The physical location of the contact may be referred to as a contact location and the physical location of the user may be referred to as the user location. The contact location may be the contact's current location, for example, the location of the contact at any given time. The contact location may be determined by determining the physical location of a mobile device associated with the contact. For example, the mobile device may be registered to the contact. The mobile device may be a global positioning system (GPS)-enabled mobile device, such as a telephone, media player, or personal digital assistant. The alert device may directly determine the physical location of the contact or receive the physical location of the mobile device from a remote server or system, such as a system that is configured to determine a physical location of a GPS-enabled mobile device. The contact location may be continuously or periodically determined. The user location may be the user's current location, for example, the location of the contact at any given time. The user location may be determined in the same or similar manner that the contact location is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In act <b>330</b>, the alert device may determine when the contact location or user location matches the task location or a target zone for the task location. The contact location or user location may match the task location when the contact location or user location is at or near the task location. In the example above, the contact location may match the task location when the contact is at the grocery store. The contact location may also match the task location when the contact is near the grocery store, for example, in the parking lot. As used herein, the term &#x201c;near&#x201d; takes into account minor deviations during the comparison. For example, the term &#x201c;near&#x201d; takes into account that the contact location may not exactly match the task location even though the contact may be at the task location (e.g., a 10 meter or other tolerance due to GPS accuracy).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one embodiment, the alert device may define a target zone around, adjacent to, above, or below the task location. The target zone may be used to indicate that the contact is near the task location. For example, a target zone may be defined around the neighborhood in which the grocery store is located. Accordingly, the alert device may determine when the contact enters into, crosses, or approaches the target zone.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In act <b>340</b>, the alert device may determine whether an alert policy is satisfied. Determining whether an alert policy is satisfied may include comparing an alert policy group with a contact group associated with the contact whose location matches the task location or a target zone. The user may assign a contact group to the contact in the contact list. The user may also assign an alert policy group to a task. The alert device may compare the alert policy group with the contact group assigned to the contact. The alert policy may be satisfied when the alert policy group matches, includes, or is the contact group.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In act <b>350</b>, the alert device may transmit an alert message. The alert message may be transmitted when the contact location matches the task location or a target zone. Alternatively, or additionally, the alert message may be transmitted when the alert policy is satisfied. For example, in one embodiment, the contact location must match the task location or target zone and the alert policy must be satisfied before an alert message is transmitted. The likelihood of the contact assisting the user is increased. In other embodiments, the alert message may be transmitted when the contact location matches the task location or a target zone. The alert message may be a text message (e.g., an electronic mail message or short message service message), audio message (e.g., a voice mail message), graphical message (multimedia messaging service message), or other type of message.</p>
