<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to display devices, and particularly to a liquid crystal display (LCD) device and a driving method for the LCD device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Commonly used LCD devices have the advantages of portability, low power consumption, and low radiation, and are widely used in various electronic devices such as notebooks, personal digital assistants (PDAs), video cameras, televisions, and others. However, many of these LCD devices have certain shortcomings, such as a long response time because liquid crystals in the LCD devices have a certain viscosity, which results in blurring when the LCD devices display moving images due to the slow response time.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a motion estimation/motion compensation (ME/MC) technology for solving the blurring problem has been proposed. That is, when an LCD device displays an image, a data processing chip thereof receives any two consecutive frames of the image, estimates and compares the two consecutive frames, and obtains new data in a range between the data of the two consecutive frames according to data of the two consecutive frames. The new data generates a new frame with a new image. The data processing chip then outputs the data of the former of the two consecutive frames, the data of the new image, and the data of the latter of the two consecutive frames, sequentially. Accordingly, when the LCD device displays a moving image, blur is eliminated or lessened.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, when the LCD device inserts the new frame between the two consecutive frames, a frame frequency of an image signal output by the LCD device accordingly needs to be double that of an original image signal received by the LCD device. In the same frame period, charge time of pixels of the LCD device is halved, which lowers the contrast ratio of the LCD device. Display of the LCD is, accordingly, deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed, therefore, is an LCD device and a driving method thereof which can overcome the described limitations.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Reference will now be made to the drawings to describe various embodiments in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a schematic circuit block diagram of one embodiment of an LCD device <b>1</b> is shown. The LCD device <b>1</b> includes a display control circuit <b>2</b> and a liquid crystal panel <b>4</b>. The display control circuit <b>2</b> directs the liquid crystal panel <b>4</b> to display images, and includes an image data processing unit <b>10</b>, a buffer <b>12</b>, a timing controller <b>14</b>, and a driving circuit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The image data processing unit <b>10</b> functions as a ME/MC. The image data processing unit <b>10</b> receives data of each frame of an external image signal and compares data of an n+1 frame and data of an n frame, where n is a natural number, the n frame denotes the previous frame of the external image signal received by the image data processing unit <b>10</b>, and the n+1 frame denotes a current frame of the external image signal received by the image data processing unit <b>10</b>. If the data of the n+1 frame is the same as that of the n frame, the image data processing unit <b>10</b> determines the image represented by the data of the n+1 frame is a still image, then converts the data of the n+1 frame to obtain a converted signal, and outputs the converted signal. If the data of the n+1 frame is different from that of the n frame, the image data processing unit <b>10</b> determines the image represented by the data of the n+1 frame is a moving image, then generates new data, which can form a frame of a new image signal, by calculating the data of the n frame and the data of n+1 frame, where the frame of the new image signal can be defined as an inserted frame, and the new image represented by data of the inserted frame is a transitional frame from the n frame to the n+1 frame. The image data processing unit <b>10</b> converts the data of the inserted frame to obtain a converted signal, and outputs the converted signal between the n frame and the n+1 frame, namely, after the n frame and before the n+1 frame.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The buffer <b>12</b>, such as a memory buffer, stores the data of the n frame received by the image data processing unit <b>10</b>, and outputs the data of the n frame and updates the storage from the data of the n frame to that of the n+1 frame when the image data processing unit <b>10</b> receives the data of the n+1 frame.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The timing controller <b>14</b> receives the converted signal output from the image data processing unit <b>10</b> corresponding to each frame, detects a frame frequency of each frame, and outputs a control signal according to the frame frequency of each frame to the driving circuit <b>16</b>. When the data of the n+1 frame received by the image data processing unit <b>10</b> is the same as that of the n frame, the frame frequency of the n+1 frame is defined as a first frequency. When the data of the n+1 frame is different from that of the n frame, the frame frequencies of the inserted frame and the n+1 frame are the same and defined as a second frequency. The second frequency may be double the first frequency, and the first frequency actually equal to the frame frequency of each frame of the external image signal. When the first frequency is detected, the timing controller <b>14</b> outputs a first control signal to the driving circuit <b>16</b> corresponding to the first frequency, and then the driving circuit <b>16</b> outputs a plurality of first gray scale voltages to drive the liquid crystal panel <b>4</b> to display the image represented by the data of the n+1 frame. When the second frequency is detected, the timing controller <b>14</b> outputs a second control signal to the driving circuit <b>16</b> corresponding to the second frequency, and the driving circuit <b>16</b> outputs a plurality of second gray scale voltages to drive the liquid crystal panel <b>4</b> to sequentially display the images represented by the data of inserted frame and the n+1 frame.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first and the second gray scale voltages are polarity inversion signals relative to a reference voltage, where the gray scale voltage more than the reference voltage is defined as positive polarity gray scale voltage, and the gray scale voltage less than the reference voltage is defined as negative polarity gray scale voltage. For the same gray scale, an absolute value of the second gray scale voltage is predetermined to exceed that of the first gray scale voltage. For example, if an image of the n+1 frame displays a gray scale of 128 having positive polarity, when the timing controller <b>14</b> detects that the frame frequency of the n+1 frame is the first frequency, the driving circuit <b>16</b> outputs a first gray scale voltage, the first gray scale voltage is a positive polarity gray scale voltage, and may be +4V, and when the timing controller <b>14</b> detects that the frame frequency of the n+1 frame is the second frequency, the driving circuit <b>16</b> outputs a second gray scale voltage, the second gray scale voltage is a positive polarity gray scale voltage, and may be +4.3V. If an image of the n+1 frame displays a gray scale of 128 having negative polarity, when the timing controller <b>14</b> detects that the frame frequency of the n+1 frame is the first frequency, the driving circuit <b>16</b> outputs a first gray scale voltage, the first gray scale voltage is a negative polarity gray scale voltage, and may be about &#x2212;4V, and when the timing controller <b>14</b> detects that the frame frequency of the n+1 frame is the second frequency, the driving circuit <b>16</b> outputs a second gray scale voltage, the second gray scale voltage is a negative polarity gray scale voltage, and may be about &#x2212;4.3V. That is, the absolute value of the second gray scale voltage exceeds that of the first gray scale voltage for the same gray scale.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The image data processing unit <b>10</b>, the buffer <b>12</b>, the timing controller <b>14</b>, and the driving circuit <b>16</b> are detailed as follows, where it is to be understood, an exemplary and a preferred embodiment. Even so, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The image data processing unit <b>10</b> includes a signal receiver <b>110</b> and a processor <b>120</b>. The signal receiver <b>110</b> receives the data of each frame of the external image signal.

The processor <b>120</b> compares the data of the n frame and the data of the n+1 frame. If the data of the n frame and the n+1 frame are the same, the processor <b>120</b> converts the data of the n+1 frame to a low voltage differential signal (LVDS), and outputs the LVDS of the n+1 frame to the timing controller <b>14</b>. If the data of the n frame and the n+1 frame are different, the processor <b>120</b> calculates according to the data of the n frame and the n+1 frame, and generates data of an inserted frame, converts the data of the inserted frame to a corresponding LVDS, and outputs the LVDS of the inserted frame to the timing controller <b>14</b>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The transistor <b>191</b> includes a gate electrode G, a drain electrode D, and a source electrode S. The gate electrode G of the transistor <b>191</b> is connected to the control circuit <b>145</b>, the drain electrode D of the transistor <b>191</b> is connected to the node <b>187</b> via the resistor <b>193</b>, and the source electrode S of the transistor <b>191</b> is grounded.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the voltage modulating circuit <b>161</b> receives the first control signal from the control circuit <b>145</b>, the transistor <b>191</b> is switched on, a voltage on the node <b>187</b> is pulled down such that a difference between the voltage on the node <b>187</b> and the reference voltage is less than the predetermined value. Accordingly, the PWM controller <b>173</b> outputs a first square-wave pulse signal to switch the transistor <b>175</b> on or off. When the PWM controller <b>173</b> switches off the transistor <b>175</b> via the first square-wave pulse signal, and the diode <b>177</b> is cut off, the conductor <b>171</b> receives the DC voltage of the external power supply via the input terminal <b>169</b> and charges. When the PWM controller <b>173</b> switches on the transistor <b>175</b> via the square-wave pulse signal, and the diode <b>177</b> is conducted, the conductor <b>171</b> discharges and the capacitors <b>179</b> charges, until an output voltage of the output terminal <b>185</b> equals the first voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the voltage modulating circuit <b>161</b> receives the second control signal from the control circuit <b>145</b>, the transistor <b>191</b> is switched off. A voltage on the node <b>187</b> is approximately equal to a divided voltage on the resistor <b>183</b>, and a difference between the voltage on the node <b>187</b> and the reference voltage exceeds the predetermined value. Accordingly, the PWM controller <b>173</b> outputs a second square-wave pulse signal to the transistor <b>175</b> to switch the transistor <b>175</b> on or off. The duty ratio of the second square-wave pulse signal exceeds that of the first square-wave pulse signal. When the PWM controller <b>173</b> switches the transistor <b>175</b> off via the second square-wave pulse signal, and the diode <b>177</b> is cut off, the conductor <b>171</b> receives the DC voltage of the external power supply via the input terminal <b>169</b> and charges. Due to duty ratio of the second square-wave pulse signal exceeding that of the first square-wave pulse signal, a period when the transistor <b>175</b> is switched off is longer. Thus, a charge time of the conductor <b>171</b> is longer and the energy stored by the conductor <b>171</b> is accordingly higher. When the PWM controller <b>173</b> switches on the transistor <b>175</b> via the second square-wave pulse signal, and the diode <b>177</b> is conducted, the conductor <b>171</b> discharges and the capacitor <b>179</b> charges, until an output voltage of the output terminal <b>185</b> equals the second voltage. Accordingly, the second voltage exceeds the first voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, if the DC voltage provided by the external power supply is 5V, the first voltage equals 12V and the second voltage is 14V, a contrast ratio of an image displayed by the liquid crystal <b>4</b> under driven by the second gray scale voltages corresponding to the second voltage can be substantially the same as that under driven by the first gray scale voltages corresponding to the first voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The LCD device <b>1</b> detects the frame frequency of each frame of an image, when the frame frequency is the first frequency, the first gray scale voltages are provided to the liquid crystal panel <b>4</b>. When the frame frequency is the second frequency, the second gray scale voltages are provided to the liquid crystal panel <b>4</b>. Thus, when the data of the n+1 frame is different from that of the n frame, an image of the inserted frame and an image of the n+1 frame are displayed by driven under the second gray scale voltages. Due to the second gray scale voltage exceeding the first gray scale voltage for the same gray scale, even though the second frequency exceeds the first frequency and in a certain frame period a charge time of pixels of the liquid crystal panel <b>4</b> is short, the pixels can be charged enough to be driven by a larger second gray scale voltages. Therefore, the contrast ratio and the display of the LCD device <b>1</b> are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In other alternative embodiments, the buffer <b>12</b> can be integrally formed in the image data processing unit <b>10</b>. The transistor <b>175</b> can be integrally formed in the PWM controller <b>163</b>. The timing controller <b>14</b> can convert the LVDSs to mini LVDSs. When the data of the n+1 frame is different from that of the n frame, the image data processing unit <b>10</b> can generate more than one inserted frame of images between the n frame and the n+1 frame of images, and accordingly the frame frequency of the inserted frames can be three times more than the frame frequency of the external image signal received by the image data processing unit <b>10</b>.</p>
