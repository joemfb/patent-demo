<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to memory cell structures and methods of forming memory cell structures having enhanced isolation of the memory cells for use in non-volatile memory devices including, for example, resistance memory devices and phase change memory devices, to memory devices formed by such methods, and to systems including such memory devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various types of non-volatile memory devices employ materials that can be caused to selectively exhibit more than one stable value of electrical resistivity. To form a single memory cell (i.e., one bit), a volume of such a material may be provided between two electrodes. A selected voltage (or current) may be applied between the electrodes, and the resulting electrical current (or voltage) therebetween will be at least partially a function of the particular value of the electrical resistivity exhibited by the material between the electrodes. A relatively higher electrical resistivity may be used to represent a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in binary code, and a relatively low electrical resistivity may be used to represent a &#x201c;0&#x201d; in binary code, or vice versa. By selectively causing the material between the electrodes to exhibit relatively high and low values of electrical resistivity, the memory cell can be selectively characterized as exhibiting either a 1 or a 0 value.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One particular type of such non-volatile memory devices is a phase change memory device. In a phase change memory cell, the material provided between the electrodes is capable of exhibiting at least two microstructural phases or states, each of which exhibits a different value of electrical resistivity. For example, the so-called &#x201c;phase change material&#x201d; may be capable of existing in a crystalline phase (i.e., the atoms of the material exhibit relative long range order) and an amorphous phase (i.e., the atoms of the material do not exhibit any or relatively little long range order). Typically, the amorphous phase is formed by heating at least a portion of the phase change material to a temperature above the melting point thereof, and then rapidly cooling the phase change material to cause the material to solidify before the atoms thereof can assume any long range order. To transform the phase change material from the amorphous phase to a crystalline phase, the phase change material is typically heated to an elevated temperature below the melting point, but above a crystallization temperature, for a time sufficient to allow the atoms of the material to assume the relatively long range order associated with the crystalline phase. For example, Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5 </sub>(often referred to as &#x201c;GST&#x201d;) is often used as a phase change material. This material has a melting point of about 600&#xb0; C., and is capable of existing in amorphous and crystalline states. To form the amorphous (high resistivity) phase, at least a portion of the material is heated to a temperature above the melting point thereof by applying a relatively high current through the material between the electrodes (the heat being generated due to the electrical resistance of the phase change material) for as little as 10 nanoseconds to 100 nanoseconds. As the GST material quickly cools when the current is interrupted, the atoms of the GST do not have sufficient time to form an ordered crystalline state, and the amorphous phase of the GST material is formed. To form the crystalline (low resistivity) phase, at least a portion of the material may be heated to a temperature of above 400&#xb0; C., which is above the crystallization temperature and near, but below, the melting point of the GST material, by applying a relatively lower current through the GST material between the electrodes for a sufficient amount of time (e.g., as little as about 30 nanoseconds) to allow the atoms of the GST material to assume the long range order associated with the crystalline phase, after which the current flowing through the material may be interrupted. The current passed through the phase change material to cause a phase change therein may be referred to as the &#x201c;programming current.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various memory devices having memory cells comprising variable resistance material, as well as methods for forming such memory devices and using such memory devices are known in the art.

The memory device <b>100</b> may include an integrated circuit comprising a plurality of memory cells (e.g., a first memory cell <b>102</b> and a second memory cell <b>104</b>).

The substrate may comprise, for example, a material such as glass or sapphire, or the substrate may comprise a full or partial wafer, which may facilitate processing using conventional semiconductor fabrication processes. In some embodiments, the substrate may comprise a dielectric material <b>118</b>.

This relatively high current flowing through the variable resistance material <b>110</b> may be referred to as the programming current and is used to heat at least a portion <b>112</b> of the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> to a sufficient temperature to cause a change in the state or phase of the portion <b>112</b> of the variable resistance material <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The portion <b>112</b> of the variable resistance material <b>110</b> then may exhibit an electrical resistivity (and, inversely, a conductivity) in the second state or phase that differs from the electrical resistivity in the first state or phase. As a result, the presence of the second state or phase can be detected by again providing a relatively low voltage between the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> and measuring the magnitude (e.g., amps) of the resulting current passing between the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>, which will be different from the magnitude of the measured current when the portion <b>112</b> of the variable resistance material <b>110</b> is in the first state or phase. By way of example and not limitation, this second state or phase (and, hence, the second current magnitude) may be selected to represent a &#x201c;0&#x201d; in binary code.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The heat generated in the variable resistance material <b>110</b> as the programming current is passed therethrough by the electrodes <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> is due to the electrical resistance of the variable resistance material <b>110</b>. Furthermore, the amount of heat generated in the portion <b>112</b> of the variable resistance material <b>110</b> is at least partially a function of the current density in the portion <b>112</b> of the variable resistance material <b>110</b>. For a given current passing through the variable resistance material <b>110</b> between the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>, the current density in the variable resistance material <b>110</b> is at least partially a function of the size (e.g., cross-sectional area) of the smaller of the electrodes <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. By using a first electrode <b>106</b> having a relatively small size, the current density in the portion <b>112</b> of the variable resistance material <b>110</b> is increased, and the programming current required to cause a phase change in the portion <b>112</b> of the variable resistance material <b>110</b> is reduced. By decreasing the required programming current, the energy required to operate the memory device <b>100</b> may be decreased. As a result, memory devices <b>100</b> having a relatively smaller first electrode may be operated using less power relative to memory devices having a relatively larger first electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may include yet another region of dielectric material, which is referred to herein as a passivation material <b>116</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;passivation material&#x201d; means and includes any dielectric material that is used to electrically, physically or electrically and physically protect or isolate another material. Similar to the dielectric materials discussed above, the passivation material <b>116</b> may comprise, for example, an oxide material (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, etc.), a nitride material (e.g., Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, AlN, etc.), or a combination of oxide and nitride materials. The passivation material <b>116</b> may be disposed over a portion of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. For example, the passivation material <b>116</b> may be disposed over a portion of the first electrode <b>106</b>, a portion of the second electrode <b>108</b>, and a portion of the dielectric material <b>114</b> surrounding the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some embodiments, the passivation material <b>116</b> may be substantially conformal on, and substantially surround, the exposed portions of the first electrode <b>106</b>, the second electrode <b>108</b>, and the dielectric material <b>114</b> surrounding the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b>. The passivation material <b>116</b> may be formed on a portion of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> as an at least substantially conformable layer having an average thickness of between about two nanometers (2 nm) and about one thousand nanometers (1,000 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the passivation material <b>116</b> may electrically isolate the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> from each other and from additional surrounding memory cells. In some embodiments, the passivation material <b>116</b> may form a barrier around the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> to protect the materials of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. For example, the passivation material <b>116</b> may be formed on the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> at relatively low temperature (e.g., 200&#xb0; C.). The passivation material <b>116</b> may protect the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> by preventing the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> from evaporation or sublimation that may be caused by subsequent processing at relatively higher temperature (e.g., about 300&#xb0; C. or more). In some embodiments, the passivation material <b>116</b> may also partially inhibit impurities (e.g., oxygen) from diffusing into the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The memory device <b>100</b> may include a cavity <b>122</b> disposed between the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. As used herein a &#x201c;cavity&#x201d; means an area or region substantially devoid of solid material. For example, the cavity <b>122</b> may comprise an area separating adjacent memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. The cavity <b>122</b> may, for example, contain a vacuum (i.e., a vacuum cavity), a gas, a liquid, etc. As used herein, the term &#x201c;vacuum&#x201d; means a space within the cavity <b>122</b> that is substantially empty of matter and has a pressure of 500 torr or less. It is noted that while the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the cavity <b>122</b> extending between the first memory cell <b>102</b> and the second memory cell <b>102</b>, the cavity <b>122</b>, or cavities, may be disposed over multiple sides of each of the memory cells and may, in some embodiments, substantially surround the memory cells. For example, when a plurality of memory cells are arranged in a plurality of rows and columns, a cavity, or cavities, may be disposed over multiple sides of the memory cells extending around each of the memory cells, between each memory cell and the memory cells adjacent thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The cavity <b>122</b> may provide enhanced isolation of the memory cell <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. For example, as discussed above, in memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> including a volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b>, a relatively high voltage is used to change the state or phase of the variable resistance material <b>110</b>. The cavity <b>122</b> may thermally insulate the variable resistance material <b>110</b> of a first memory cell <b>102</b> from heat generated in an adjacent second memory cell <b>104</b>. For example, the cavity <b>122</b> disposed between adjacent memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may laterally isolate the heat generated in each of the first memory cell <b>102</b> and the second memory cell <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the cavity <b>122</b> may comprise a vacuum having a thermal conductively relatively lower than that of air or a conventional dielectric material. The relatively lower thermal conductivity of the vacuum may increase the lateral, thermal isolation of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> by decreasing the amount of heat transferred between the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the cavity <b>122</b> may contain a fluid (e.g., a liquid or gas) having a lower thermal conductive relative to the thermal conductivity of a conventional dielectric material. The cavity may be at least substantially free of solid matter.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The cavity <b>122</b> may have a first dimension D<sub>11 </sub>between the second electrodes <b>108</b> of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and between the volumes of variable resistance material <b>110</b> of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the cavity <b>122</b> may have a second dimension D<sub>12 </sub>greater than the first dimension D<sub>11</sub>. For example, the cavity <b>122</b> may extend underneath the volumes of variable resistance material <b>110</b> (i.e., the cavity <b>122</b> extends along a proximal side of the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> toward the dielectric material <b>114</b> surrounding the first electrode <b>106</b>). By extending between the dielectric material <b>114</b> surrounding the first electrode <b>106</b> of each of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, the second dimension D<sub>12 </sub>of the cavity <b>122</b> is greater than the first dimension D<sub>11</sub>. The additional distance (i.e., the second dimension D<sub>12</sub>) may provide a larger volume of the cavity <b>122</b> between the first electrodes <b>106</b> of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. The larger volume may decrease the amount of heat transferred between the first electrodes <b>106</b> of adjacent memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some embodiments, the cavity <b>122</b> may be partially bounded by the passivation material <b>116</b>.

Similarly, the first dimension D<sub>11 </sub>of the cavity <b>122</b> may be defined between passivation material <b>116</b> disposed over the second electrode <b>108</b> and the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> of each of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. The second dimension D<sub>12 </sub>may extend between the passivation material <b>116</b> disposed over the dielectric material <b>114</b> surrounding the first electrode <b>106</b> of each of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The memory device <b>100</b> may further include a dielectric material disposed over (e.g., on) and between distal end portions of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. For example, a non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> (e.g., a non-conformal passivation material) may be disposed over each of the second electrodes <b>108</b> of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may be disposed over the passivation material <b>116</b> overlying the second electrode <b>108</b> of each of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. The non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may partially bound the cavity <b>122</b> and, in some embodiments, hermetically seal the cavity <b>122</b>. For example, the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may extend between the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> to form a distal boundary of the cavity <b>122</b> and to seal a vacuum within the cavity. The sealed cavity <b>122</b> may thermally insulate the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As discussed in further detail below, the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may be non-conformal in the sense that the material tends to have poor step coverage (e.g., the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may extend across an opening leading to the cavity <b>122</b> without substantially filling the cavity <b>122</b>). For example, the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may extend along the second electrode <b>108</b> of the each of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. The non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may also extend over the cavity <b>122</b> across the gap between the second electrode <b>108</b> of the first memory cell <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> of the second memory cell <b>104</b>, which gap may have a width of, for example, 0.005 micron to 0.1 micron.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may be disposed over the second electrode <b>108</b> of each of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and extend across the cavity <b>122</b>, or cavities, disposed between the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> to partially form a distal boundary of the cavity <b>122</b>. For example, the passivation material <b>116</b> may form a portion of the boundary of the cavity <b>122</b> and the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may form another portion of the cavity <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the cavity <b>122</b> may be substantially enclosed. For example, the portions of the passivation material <b>116</b> and the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> forming the cavity <b>122</b> may enclose the cavity <b>122</b> (i.e., the interior space of the cavity <b>122</b> may be sealed from space exterior to the cavity <b>122</b>). As discussed above, in some embodiments, the sealed cavity <b>122</b> may include an interior space comprising a vacuum (i.e., the space contained within the cavity <b>122</b> is substantially empty of matter).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The cavity <b>122</b> may also have a height (e.g., dimension D<sub>13</sub>) extending, for example, between the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> and the dielectric material <b>118</b>.

In practice, however, a plurality of memory cells may be formed substantially simultaneously, and the memory cells may comprise memory cells of one or of a plurality of memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In each of the embodiments discussed below, the materials forming the memory device may be formed, grown, or otherwise provided thereon. The various materials may be formed using, for example, deposition techniques (e.g., chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), sputtering, thermal evaporation, or plating) and patterning techniques (e.g., masking and etching) known in the art of integrated circuit fabrication. The dielectric materials comprise an oxide or silicon nitride, and may be formed by chemical vapor deposition, by decomposing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), or by any other process known in the art of integrated circuit fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Additionally, the materials or portions thereof may be removed using, for example, a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process, an etching process, a lift-off process, or a combination thereof. Etching processes may include, for example, removing portions of the material using a mask and an anisotropic reactive ion (i.e., plasma) etching process and removing the material using a mask and an isotropic wet chemical etching process. It is noted that the particular composition of the gases used to generate the reactive ions, the particular composition of the chemical etchant, and the operating parameters of the etching process may be selected based on the composition of the mask, the material to be etched, and the surrounding materials.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">An embodiment of a method that may be used to form, for example, the memory device <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be formed on and in electrical communication with a conductive material <b>120</b> formed on or in a dielectric material <b>118</b>. The memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may include a first electrode <b>106</b>, a second electrode <b>108</b>, and a volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> disposed between the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>. The first electrode <b>106</b> may be formed on and extend from the conductive material <b>120</b> to the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b>. A dielectric material <b>114</b> may be formed on the conductive material <b>120</b> and may surround the first electrode <b>106</b>. An additional dielectric material <b>118</b> (e.g., an oxide material) may surround the dielectric material <b>114</b> and the conductive material <b>120</b>. The volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> may be formed on the first electrode <b>106</b> and the dielectric material <b>114</b> surrounding the first electrode <b>106</b>.

For example, a portion of the second electrode <b>108</b> and the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> may be removed to form a line stripe structure (i.e., the second electrode <b>108</b> and the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> may extend between two or more memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>). Alternatively, a portion of the second electrode <b>108</b> and the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> may be removed to form a mesa structure (i.e., portions of the second electrode <b>108</b> and the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> are removed to form a discrete structure on each of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>). The portion of the second electrode <b>108</b> and the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> may be removed by processes such as, for example, photolithography patterning and etching. By way of example and not limitation, the portions may be formed by patterning a mask to form an aperture therein at the location at which it is desired to remove the portions of the second electrode <b>108</b> and the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b>. The second electrode <b>108</b> and the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b> may be etched through the aperture in the mask using, for example, an anisotropic reactive ion etching process, to expose the underlying dielectric material <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, a portion of the dielectric material <b>118</b> may also be removed using a mask and etch process to form the cavity <b>122</b>. By way of example and not limitation, an isotropic wet chemical etching process may be used to remove a portion of the dielectric material <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the dielectric material <b>118</b> may comprise an oxide material (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>) and the dielectric material <b>114</b> may comprise a nitride material (e.g., Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, an etchant with selectivity to the oxide material (i.e., an etchant with a particular composition configured to remove the oxide material at a faster rate as compared to the removal rate of other materials) may be used to remove the oxide and to expose the dielectric material <b>114</b> and, in some embodiments, a portion of the conductive material <b>120</b>. For example, the etchant may be left on for approximately eight minutes to etch approximately 80 nanometers of the oxide material in a direction proximal end of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. In additional embodiments, the cavity <b>122</b> may be formed using a single isotropic wet chemical etching process instead of a separate anisotropic reactive ion etching process followed by an isotropic wet chemical etching process. In some embodiments, the dielectric material <b>118</b> may be etched such that the cavity <b>122</b> extends from the distal end of the second electrode <b>108</b> of each of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> to the distal end of the conductive material <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, after etching the dielectric material <b>118</b>, a passivation material <b>116</b> may be formed on (e.g., by a CVD or ALD process) the exposed portions of the first electrode <b>106</b>, the second electrode <b>108</b>, and the dielectric material <b>114</b> surrounding the volume of variable resistance material <b>110</b>.

As discussed above, the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may be non-conformal as the material tends to have poor step coverage (e.g., the material will tend to be formed in a linear or planar manner and not to deposit or fill depressions or cavities). As appreciated by those skilled in the art, &#x201c;step coverage&#x201d; is defined as a ratio of field coverage to sidewall coverage in the context of deposition over a gap such as a via or cavity. For example, as the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> is formed on the second electrodes <b>108</b> of the memory cells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, the non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may extend across a portion of the cavity <b>122</b> from the second electrode <b>108</b> of the first memory cell <b>102</b> to the second electrode <b>108</b> of the second memory cell <b>104</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The non-conformal dielectric material <b>128</b> may seal the cavity <b>122</b> and may, in some embodiments, form a vacuum within the cavity <b>122</b>.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In view of the above description, some embodiments of the present invention include memory devices having memory cells including a cavity extending between the memory cells. In some embodiments, the memory devices may include a volume of variable resistance material disposed between two electrodes. A portion of the memory cells and a passivation material formed over the memory cells may partially form the cavity extending between two memory cells. In additional embodiments, the present invention comprises electronic systems that include one or more such memory devices. The one or more such memory devices may be in electrical communication with an electronic signal processor.

Such methods may include removing a selected amount of dielectric material disposed between the memory cells in a memory device to form a cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Embodiments of the present invention may be particularly useful in forming memory cell structures including enhanced isolation of the memory cells for use in a memory device. Particularly, providing enhanced isolation of the memory cells by a vacuum cavity formed between the memory cells may allow for enhanced thermal isolation of the memory cells. Memory devices, in particular memory devices including a phase change memory cell, may undergo high temperature changes to alter the state of the memory cell. The voltage applied to the phase change material may bleed from one memory cell to adjacent memory cells and the heat generated in one memory cell may also bleed to the adjacent memory cells. Such thermal and electrical crosstalk between cells my cause unintentional changes in the state of the memory cells. Additionally, forces caused by the thermal expansion and contraction of the memory cell structures during high temperatures changes may introduce stresses into the structures. Providing a vacuum cavity between the memory cells may allow for reduced thermal and electrical crosstalk between the cells and reduce unintentional state changes in the memory cells and undesirable data loss. Moreover, providing a cavity between the memory cells may allow the cell to freely expand and relax, thereby, reducing the stress caused by thermal expansion and contraction and improving the structural integrity of the cells.</p>
