<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 12/657,969, filed 1 Feb. 2010, which claims the benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 61/283,941, filed 11 Dec. 2009, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 111(b).</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to engine compartment cooling systems. In particular, it relates to an axial fan and heat exchanger operated system for thermal management of the interior of an engine compartment mounted through the quarter panel of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Systems for cooling the engine of a motor vehicle are well known in the art. Engine compartments have long since been equipped with a heat exchanger, such as a radiator, and fan assembly for cooling a liquid circulating through the engine block and heat exchanger of the motor vehicle. However, auxiliary systems are desirably in order to either supplement or to enhance engine cooling during operation under hot or heavy load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One such example is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,175 to Carroll. There, a cooling air system for an internal combustion engine has an engine enclosure and a plenum connected to the engine enclosure. A radial flow fan is disposed in the plenum. An inlet duct in the engine compartment directs drawn outside ambient air toward a radiator located within the engine compartment. A shroud extending into the plenum directs air flow passing through the radiator axially toward the radial flow fan. An outlet opening at the top end of the plenum exhausts radially directed heated air flow elevationally to the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the foregoing systems offer some utility, a major disadvantage in such systems lies in the fact that they are complicated in construction, often require unsightly design changes to the engine compartment, are costly in construction, and circulate ambient air from the outside of the vehicle through the engine compartment. Thus, what is needed is an engine compartment cooling system which is simple in construction and which is capable of retrofit application with an existing engine compartment construction. It is also needed to provide a supplemental engine cooling system which is easy to install and operate, light in weight and which exhausts engine heat generated by the engine through a fender well of the motor vehicle. The present invention satisfies these needs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an engine compartment cooling system which exhausts engine heat through a fender well of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another object of the present invention to provide an engine compartment cooling system which is easily installed for retrofit application, on an existing quarter panel, of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is another object of the present invention to provide an engine compartment cooling system which is light in weight, low in cost, and easily operated either manually from the interior of a passenger compartment or thermostatically.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To overcome the problems of the prior art methods and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, briefly in combination with an engine compartment having an engine, a hood, and at least two front quarter panel side walls defining an interior engine compartment, an engine compartment cooling system, is provided which includes a clear hole in at least one of the side walls positioned between a passenger compartment and a forward portion of a fender wheel well. At least one axial fan assembly has a fan housing, a plurality of fan blades, a motor shaft, and a fan motor. The fan assembly is mounted in the clear hole. A fan motor control system is operatively connected to a first temperature sensor for sensing a temperature of the engine compartment, and sending a first signal data to a controller operable to optimize a fan speed of the fan assembly based on the temperature of the engine compartment. A heated air flow path originates from the engine compartment and is exhausted outwardly through the fan assembly into an ambient air engine compartment and is exhausted outwardly through the fan assembly into an ambient air flow for cooling of the engine compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional advantages of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will be obvious from that description or can be learned from practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention can be realized and obtained by the apparatus particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Unless specifically defined otherwise, all technical or scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Although any of the methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described. Reference will now be made in detail to the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like numerals represent like features of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the drawing figures, the preferred embodiment of the An engine compartment cooling system is provided. The engine compartment includes an engine <b>22</b>, a hood, and at least two front quarter panel side walls <b>24</b> which define an interior engine compartment <b>20</b>. Such engine compartments are of a configuration which is well known in the diesel tractor and automotive industry as well known in the art. A clear hole, such as a rectangular opening, is positioned in at least one of the side walls <b>24</b>, preferably between the passenger compartment <b>26</b> and a forward portion <b>28</b> of a fender wheel well. The clear hole is desirably positioned high enough in relation to the engine <b>22</b> so that the heated air flow <b>2</b> originating from the engine <b>22</b> travels upwardly and outwardly. A fan housing assembly <b>10</b> is mounted adjacent to the clear hole and defines a hot air inlet from the interior of the engine compartment and an outlet which exhausts the hot air outwardly to ambient. A heated air flow path <b>2</b> originates at the engine <b>22</b>, heating the engine compartment interior <b>20</b>, while operating under heavy loads, and extends outwardly to exhaust into the ambient air through the clear hole. At least one axial fan assembly <b>10</b> is mounted to a fan housing <b>16</b>. The fan housing <b>16</b> is fitted within the quarter panel <b>24</b> in the clear hole. The fan is of a design which is well known as an axial fan and includes a plurality of fan blades <b>12</b>, a motor shaft <b>14</b> and a fan motor. The fan assembly <b>10</b> is mounted in the housing <b>16</b> so that the air flow path <b>2</b> is exhausted in a direction which is travels along a path relative to the motor shaft <b>14</b>. The fan motor is wired to any direct-current power source of the motor vehicle which is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fan motor is preferably manually operated by motor controller, such as a toggle or rheostat switch <b>52</b>, positioned within the interior of the passenger compartment <b>26</b>, such as on a dashboard, but, may, also be thermostatically operated using a signal received from a sensor <b>30</b> desirably positioned within the interior of the engine compartment <b>20</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the fan housing <b>16</b> is a rectangular shaped frame and is thereby configured to receive at least two axial fans and fan motor assemblies. It is also desirable to include an air flow exhaust shutter <b>13</b> assembly connected to the housing <b>16</b> so that the air flow path <b>2</b> is variably restricted from control of temperature within the interior engine compartment <b>20</b>. The exhaust shutter <b>13</b> is desirably an air flow baffle which pivots either vertically or horizontally in relation to the housing <b>16</b>. The shutter <b>13</b> may be either manually operated from the passenger compartment <b>26</b>, or thermostatically operated as a result of engine temperature, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, in yet another embodiment of the present invention, the air flow exhaust shutter <b>17</b> slides freely, forward and rearward, within a channeled, generally rectangular, frame member <b>15</b>. The exhaust shutter <b>17</b> is preferably produced from an aluminum or fiberglass sheeting, painted, and operates in an open position so as to allow the airflow to exhaust from the engine compartment <b>20</b> for cooling, or in a closed position, under colder operating conditions, so that the engine compartment retains heat and the fan blades <b>12</b> do not engage in an autorotation when exposed to ambient air while travelling. The channeled frame member <b>15</b> is a metal frame having flanged portions for slidably receiving the exhaust shutter <b>17</b>, and mounting to the quarter panel with a threaded fastener or rivet. The frame member <b>15</b> is rigidity fastened to an outer wall of the quarter panel <b>24</b>. In use, one simply slides the exhaust shutter <b>17</b> in a predetermined forward or rearward alignment, with respect to the fan assembly <b>10</b>, for optimum temperature control of the engine compartment. The exhaust shutter <b>17</b> may also, but need not, include a motor drive and control (not shown) for manually or thermostatically operating the exhaust shutter <b>17</b> in a forward or rearward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the cooling system may, but need not, include a second remote mount fluid cooler loop in addition to the fan loop, described above. This remote mount fluid cooling loop includes a liquid-to-air heat exchanger <b>40</b>, engine coolant valve <b>36</b>, temperature sensor <b>58</b>, and fan <b>42</b> components, and is useful to supplement the main radiator <b>30</b> and primary fan <b>32</b> engine coolant system in order to further optimize thermal management of the engine <b>22</b> and interior of the engine compartment <b>20</b>. In this manner, the remote mount thermal management cooling system may employ the use of one or more manual or electric fluid pumps <b>34</b>, electric valves <b>36</b> and electric fans <b>12</b>, <b>42</b>. These electric components may replace one or more mechanical components which typically operate in accordance with the speed and temperature of the engine. The remote mount fluid cooler assembly preferably includes a stacked plate cooler core and waterproof/dustproof fan motor housed in an aluminum shroud and mounting bracket for mounting in the fender well of the motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The remote mount engine temperature control loop includes a fan <b>42</b> and a heat exchanger or radiator <b>40</b>. A temperature sensor <b>56</b> senses the temperature of the engine coolant, and sends a signal to the controller <b>50</b> which is related to the sensed temperature. Based on the sensed temperature of the engine coolant, the controller <b>50</b> can command the mechanical or electrically operated valve <b>36</b>, to allow some or all of the engine coolant to pass through the radiator <b>40</b>, thereby facilitating heat exchange from the engine coolant to the ambient air. Conversely, the controller <b>50</b> can command the valve <b>36</b> into a full bypass condition, such that all of the engine coolant by basses the radiator <b>40</b>, and is pumped back into the engine <b>22</b> at times, such as just after engine startup and before the engine <b>22</b> has reached a desired operating temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition to the engine coolant temperature sensor <b>56</b>, temperature sensors <b>54</b> and <b>58</b> are also in communication with the controller <b>50</b>. The temperature sensor <b>54</b> senses the temperature of the heated air in the engine compartment <b>20</b>, as it leaves the engine <b>22</b>, where the controller <b>50</b> can command the fan motor, of the fan assembly <b>10</b>, to operate so that heated air <b>2</b> is exhausted from the engine compartment <b>20</b> through the fender well and into the ambient air. Conversely, the controller <b>50</b> can command the fan assembly <b>10</b> to switch to an off condition when not in use. Likewise, temperature sensor <b>58</b> also senses the temperature of the heated air <b>2</b>, in the engine compartment <b>20</b>, where the controller <b>50</b> can command the fan <b>42</b> to operate either together with, or independently of, the fan assembly <b>10</b> in order to thermally manage the engine <b>22</b> and engine compartment <b>20</b> under a wide variety of operating conditions in order to maximize power efficiency. In order to optimize operation of the fan assembly <b>10</b>, fan <b>42</b> and valve <b>36</b>, the controller <b>50</b> is programmed with operation data that provides optimized operating speeds and engine coolant circulation loops for the combined operation of the fan assembly <b>10</b>, fan <b>42</b> and the valve <b>36</b>. Each of these operating speeds and coolant loops corresponds to an amount of heat transfer between the engine coolant, engine <b>22</b>, and the engine compartment <b>20</b>. Based at least in part on inputs from the temperature sensors <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b>, the controller <b>50</b> uses the operation data to operate the fan assembly <b>10</b>, fan <b>42</b>, and the valve <b>36</b> to provide the desired amount of heat transfer between the engine <b>22</b>, engine compartment <b>20</b> and the engine coolant, while minimizing the power consumption during operation of the motor vehicle under a wide variety of operating load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In use, the switch <b>52</b> is also in communication with the controller <b>50</b> and may include visual indicators so that the operator is able to view the temperature sensed operating conditions input to the controller <b>50</b> by the sensors <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b> in order to manually override the controller output command signals to the valve <b>36</b>, pump <b>34</b>, fans <b>10</b> and <b>42</b>, and heat exchanger <b>40</b>. In this manner, the operator maintains the ability to override independent control of each component of the thermal management system in order to optimize operation of the various components of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the present invention has been described in connection with the embodiments as described and illustrated above, it will be appreciated and understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that modifications may be made in the cooling system assembly, in accordance with the present invention, without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as described and claimed herein.</p>
