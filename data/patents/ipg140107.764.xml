<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is entitled to and claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/247,047 filed Sep. 30, 2009, and titled &#x201c;Method of Singulating Embryos,&#x201d; the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A sexual propagation for plants has been shown for some species to yield large numbers of genetically identical embryos, each having the capacity to develop into a normal plant. Such embryos must usually be further cultured under laboratory conditions until they reach an autotrophic &#x201c;seedling&#x201d; state characterized by an ability to produce their own food via photosynthesis, resist desiccation, produce roots able to penetrate soil, and fend off soil microorganisms. Some researchers have experimented with the production of artificial seeds, known as manufactured seeds, in which individual plant somatic or zygotic embryos are encapsulated in a seed coat. Examples of such manufactured seeds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,701,699, issued to Carlson et al., the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typical manufactured seeds include a seed shell, synthetic gametophyte and a plant embryo. A manufactured seed that does not include the plant embryo is known in the art as a &#x201c;seed blank.&#x201d; Such a seed blank typically is a cylindrical capsule having a closed end and an open end. Synthetic gametophyte is placed within the seed shell to substantially fill the interior of the seed shell. A longitudinally extending hard porous insert, commonly known as a cotyledon restraint, may be centrally located within the synthetic gametophyte and includes a centrally located cavity extending partially through the length of the cotyledon restraint. The cavity is sized to receive the plant embryo therein. The well-known plant embryo includes a radicle end and a cotyledon end. The plant embryo is deposited within the cavity of the cotyledon restraint cotyledon end first and is sealed within the seed blank by at least one end seal. There is a weakened spot in the end seal to allow the radicle end of the embryo to penetrate the end seal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are automated processes available to mass produce manufactured seeds of the type described above. One such automated process is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/982,951, entitled System and Method of Embryo Delivery for Manufactured Seeds, and assigned to Weyerhaeuser Company of Federal Way, Washington, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, embryos are manually plucked from a growing medium and are physically placed on the plate for retrieval and insertion into a seed blank. Although such manual processes are effective, they are not without their limitations. As a non-limiting example, such manual operations are both labor and time intensive and, therefore, expensive. As part of the process to produce large numbers of somatic embryos available for insertion in manufactured seeds, it is desirable to minimize the manual labor element from the process.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> diagrammatically depicts an automated system <b>20</b> for implementing a method of singulating embryos in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure. The system <b>20</b> is suitably mounted in conjunction with an assembly for assembling manufactured seeds (not shown) or is remotely located from such an assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The system <b>20</b> includes an embryo storage assembly <b>22</b>, a programmable logic controller (PLC) <b>24</b>, a placement mechanism <b>26</b>, and an embryo deposit assembly <b>28</b>. The embryo storage assembly <b>22</b> includes a singulation vessel <b>30</b>, a lift mechanism <b>32</b>, and a sensor <b>34</b>. The singulation vessel <b>30</b> is suitably a container having a plurality of embryos <b>40</b> suspended in a fluid, such as a sterile, Nanopure water. Preferably, the fluid is agitated to a sufficient degree to suspend all embryos <b>40</b>. The singulation vessel <b>30</b> is mounted on the lift mechanism <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The lift mechanism <b>32</b> includes a base plate <b>50</b> coupled to a well-known lift <b>52</b>, such as a screw drive or a scissor lift, to assist in maintaining a substantially constant head at the outlet of the singulation vessel <b>30</b>. Within the meaning of this disclosure and used in this context, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is intended to include engineering acceptable variations resulting in a nearly constant fluid flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although the use of a lift <b>52</b> to assist in maintaining a substantially constant head, other devices known to maintain a substantially head are also acceptable. As a non-limiting example, a pump (not shown) may be placed in fluid communication with the singulation vessel <b>30</b> to maintain the substantially constant flow rate. Thus, such devices are acceptable equivalents and are within the scope of the present disclosure. Further, while maintaining a substantially constant head is preferred, a variable head is also within the scope of the present disclosure as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embryos <b>40</b> are transported between the singulation vessel <b>30</b> and the placement mechanism <b>26</b> by fluid flowing through tubing <b>60</b>. The tubing <b>60</b> extends between the singulation vessel <b>30</b> and the placement mechanism <b>26</b> and the sensor <b>34</b> is suitably positioned adjacent the tubing <b>60</b> to sense and/or detect embryos <b>40</b> within the tubing <b>60</b>, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the illustrated and exemplary embodiment, the flow rate of embryos <b>40</b> through the tubing <b>60</b> is controlled by the lift <b>52</b>. Specifically, and as is well-known, the flow rate within the tubing <b>60</b> is proportional to the square root of the vertical distance between the outlet of the tubing <b>60</b> at the placement mechanism <b>26</b> and the liquid level in the singulation vessel <b>30</b>. As the fluid in the singulation vessel <b>30</b> is decreased, the height of the singulation vessel <b>30</b> is raised by the lift mechanism <b>32</b>. The lift <b>52</b> raises the singulation vessel <b>30</b> at a fixed rate proportional to the flow rate of fluid inside of the tubing <b>60</b> to maintain a substantially constant flow rate. In other embodiments, the lift <b>52</b> may be raised or lower to increase or decrease, respectively, the flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The tubing <b>60</b> includes an inner diameter sufficiently large to permit entry of a single embryo <b>40</b> to enter the tubing <b>60</b> at any given time. Although multiple embryos <b>40</b> may be positioned longitudinally within the tubing <b>60</b>, it is desirable that only a single embryo may enter the tubing <b>60</b> at any given time. It is also preferred that the tubing <b>60</b> be of a material, such as silicone, that is transparent or semi-transparent to permit detection of an embryo within the tubing <b>60</b> by the sensor <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The sensor <b>34</b> is a well-known, laser-based visual sensor used to detect when an embryo <b>40</b> exits the singulation vessel <b>30</b>. One such sensor <b>34</b> is model No. LV-H300/100 Series, manufactured and sold by Keyence Corporation of Osaka, Japan. The sensor <b>34</b> is suitably mounted to the base plate <b>50</b> with the tubing <b>60</b> operatively disposed between components of the sensor <b>34</b>. The sensor <b>34</b>, in turn, is in communication with the PLC <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The system <b>20</b> may include a second, well-known sensor (not shown) in communication with the singulation vessel <b>30</b>. This second sensor is used to measure the hydrostatic head of the fluid in the singulation vessel <b>30</b>. One such sensor is model No. FW-H07, manufactured and sold by Keyence Corp. of Osaka, Japan. Such a sensor uses ultrasonic sound waves to measure distance. Although an ultrasonic sensor is preferred, other types of sensors, including laser and radar based, are within the scope of the present disclosure. The second sensor is in communication with the PLC <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The well-known PLC <b>24</b> suitably has an operator interface to control the singulation process and the raising and lowering of the lift mechanism <b>32</b>. One such PLC <b>24</b> is a DirectLOGIC 205 Modular Programmable Logic Controller (DL205 PLC), manufactured and sold by Koyo Electronics Industries Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The PLC <b>24</b> is programmable to interface with the lift mechanism <b>32</b>, the sensor <b>34</b>, the second sensor, and the placement mechanism <b>26</b> during operation of the system <b>20</b>, as well as to permit the operator to adjust operational parameters. Operational parameters, such as the number of embryos <b>40</b> placed on the embryo deposit assembly <b>28</b>, the spacing between the embryos <b>40</b>, and the location of embryos <b>40</b> on the embryo deposit assembly <b>28</b> may all be programmed as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The PLC <b>24</b> may be programmed to control the spacing and placement of embryos <b>40</b> on the embryo deposit assembly <b>28</b> by tracking the embryo as it flows through the tubing <b>60</b>. In such an embodiment, the PLC <b>24</b> includes a clock or timer and a registry. One such registry is an embryo location registry (&#x201c;ELR&#x201d;). The ELR includes binary registers that represent locations along the length of the tubing <b>60</b>. As an example, the ELR may segregate the tubing <b>60</b> into fifty registers, which represent fifty sequential locations in the tubing <b>60</b>. The first register location is suitably located closest to the sensor <b>34</b> and the last register is located at the end of the tubing <b>60</b> where it connects to the placement mechanism <b>26</b>. The ELR tracks and logs as a function of time the path of embryos within the tubing <b>60</b>, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The placement mechanism <b>26</b> includes a robotic arm <b>80</b>. Motion of the robotic arm <b>80</b> is controllable relative to the embryo deposit assembly <b>28</b> to position the outlet of the tubing <b>60</b> over an open location on the embryo deposit assembly <b>28</b>. One suitable robotic arm <b>80</b> is an Ultramotion robotic arm, model No. DA25-HT17-8 NO-B/4, manufactured and sold by Ultramotion of Mattituck, N.Y. To achieve the desired motion of the robotic arm <b>80</b>, the placement mechanism <b>26</b> also includes a well-known stepping motor (not shown), such as model No. PK266-E2.0A, manufactured and sold by Oriental Motor U.S.A. Corp. of Torrance, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The robotic arm <b>80</b> has two degrees of freedom to provide precise placement of embryos <b>40</b> on the embryo deposit assembly <b>28</b>. In that regard, it is preferred that the robotic arm <b>80</b> translates longitudinally along an axis indicated by the arrow <b>70</b>. Further, the robotic arm <b>80</b> moves along the axis perpendicular to arrow <b>70</b>, i.e., in and out of the page. The outlet of the tubing <b>60</b> on the robotic arm <b>80</b> is suitably oriented at an angle relative to a vertical axis so that, as the fluid exits from the tubing <b>60</b>, it is not perpendicular to the embryo deposit assembly <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is also desirable that the robotic arm <b>80</b> is controlled by the PLC <b>24</b>, in combination with the ELR, sensor <b>34</b>, and/or the second sensor. As a non-limiting example, if an embryo <b>40</b> is detected by the sensor <b>34</b>, it sends a signal to the PLC <b>24</b> indicating the presence of the embryo. This signal is entered in the ELR as a &#x201c;true.&#x201d; If an embryo <b>40</b> is not detected by the sensor <b>34</b>, then the register is &#x201c;false.&#x201d; A &#x201c;true&#x201d; registry is noted as a &#x201c;1,&#x201d; while a &#x201c;false&#x201d; registry is noted as a &#x201c;0.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The number of registries in the ELR is a function of the length of the tubing <b>60</b>. For example, if the tubing <b>60</b> is 20 inches long and there are fifty registers, each register represents 0.4 inches of tubing <b>60</b>. Further, in this example, the travel time of an embryo from the sensor <b>34</b> to the placement mechanism <b>26</b> is approximately one second. As a result, each registry of the ELR represents approximately 20 ms of time. The clock updates the registry every 20 ms, such that the registers are shifted forward and each register is updated with a &#x201c;1&#x201d; or a &#x201c;0.&#x201d; Further, the speed of the robotic arm <b>80</b> is also updated every 20 ms and is programmed to match the spacing between the embryos, as desired by the operator to control the spacing of the embryos deposited onto the embryo deposit assembly <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embryo deposit assembly <b>28</b> includes a singulation frame <b>82</b> and a drainage vessel <b>84</b>. The singulation frame <b>82</b> suitably includes a supporting material that allows fluid to pass through while retaining embryos. The supporting material also preferably provides a color contrast between the supporting material and the embryo such that there is contrast between the embryos and the supporting material. One such supporting material suitable for use with the system <b>20</b> is Nitex&#xae; nylon, model No. 03-125/45. The drainage vessel <b>84</b> suitably supports a vacuum (not shown) for fluid removal and to aid in holding the embryos in a fixed location.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Operational aspects of the system <b>20</b> constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure may be best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>. The beginning of the operational sequence is represented by the start block <b>100</b> by initiating the system <b>20</b> to zero the ELR, indicated by the block <b>102</b>. Also, fluid flow through the system <b>20</b> is initiated and the lift mechanism <b>32</b> raises the singulation vessel <b>30</b> at a rate to maintain a substantially constant liquid head throughout the system <b>20</b>. This is illustrated by the block <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The timer is enabled, indicated by block <b>110</b>, and the sensor <b>34</b> determines whether an embryo <b>40</b> is detected in the tubing <b>60</b> and indicated by the decision block <b>106</b>. If an embryo <b>40</b> is detected by the sensor <b>34</b>, a &#x201c;1&#x201d; is placed in the first registry location of the ELR, indicated by the block <b>108</b>. Thereafter, the timer is evaluated to determine whether or not a predetermined period of time, such as 20 ms, has expired, and as indicated by the decision block <b>112</b>. If an embryo is not detected by the sensor <b>34</b>, the PLC will advance ahead to the block <b>112</b> and evaluate whether the timer has timed out.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If the timer has not timed out, the ELR returns to block <b>106</b> to evaluate whether an embryo has been detected. If the timer has timed out, then the ELR shifts the registry by one position forward, indicated by the block <b>114</b>. Also, as indicated by the block <b>116</b>, the timer is reset.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As indicated by the block <b>118</b>, the PLC evaluates whether there is a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in the last ELR registry, indicating the presence of an embryo <b>40</b> at the very end of the tube <b>60</b>. If there is a &#x201c;0&#x201d; in the last registry, indicating that there is no embryo in the last registry, the PLC determines whether every registry of the ELR is a &#x201c;0,&#x201d; indicated by the block <b>120</b>. If every registry is empty, the robotic arm <b>80</b> is turned off, as indicated by the block <b>122</b>, and the PLC returns back to block <b>110</b> to enable the increment timer and to evaluate whether an embryo is again detected by the sensor <b>34</b>, as indicated by block <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring back to the block <b>118</b>, if the last registry in the ELR contains a &#x201c;1,&#x201d; then the PLC evaluates whether any other registry in the ELR contains a &#x201c;1,&#x201d; thereby indicating the presence of another embryo in the tubing <b>60</b>. This is indicated by the block <b>124</b>. As represented by the block <b>126</b>, if no other registry in the ELR contains a &#x201c;1,&#x201d; then the speed of the robotic arm <b>80</b> is set to a minimum speed. This may be accomplished by an inclusion of a lookup table containing predetermined robotic arm speeds as a function of the number of embryos in the tubing <b>60</b>. Such a lookup table is well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If there is a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in any one or more other registry of the ELR, then the PLC sets the robotic arm speed based on the last and next to the last registry positions in the ELR by referring to the lookup table, as noted above. This is indicated by the block <b>128</b>. Thereafter, as indicated by the block <b>130</b>, the output speed is transmitted to the robotic arm <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Before depositing the embryo onto the singulation frame <b>82</b>, the &#x201c;X&#x201d; position of the robotic arm <b>80</b> relative to the width of the singulation frame <b>82</b> is evaluated. Specifically, as indicated by the block <b>132</b>, the &#x201c;X&#x201d; position of the robotic arm <b>80</b> is evaluated to determine whether it has reached the maximum width of the singulation frame <b>82</b>. If yes, then the robotic arm <b>80</b> is advanced one position forward in the longitudinal direction, or &#x201c;Y&#x201d; direction, of the singulation frame <b>82</b> and the direction of the robotic arm <b>80</b> in the &#x201c;X&#x201d; direction is reversed, as indicated by the block <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After the &#x201c;X&#x201d; position of the robotic arm <b>80</b> is reversed, the PLC zeroes out the &#x201c;X&#x201d; position, indicated by the block <b>136</b>. Thereafter, the embryo is deposited on the singulation frame <b>82</b>, as indicated by the block <b>138</b>. Returning to block <b>132</b>, if the &#x201c;X&#x201d; position is not reached, the blocks <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are bypassed and the embryo is deposited on the singulation frame <b>82</b>, as noted in block <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is desired that the PLC <b>24</b> be programmed to control the robotic arm <b>80</b> such that it deposits embryos in a predetermined position on the singulation frame <b>82</b>. As a non-limiting example, the PLC <b>24</b> may be programmed such that the robotic arm <b>80</b> deposits embryos on the singulation frame <b>82</b> on their sides. In such a position, both the cotyledon and radical ends contact the supporting material of the singulation frame <b>82</b>, or only the cotyledon or radical end contacts the supporting material of the singulation frame <b>82</b>. As another non-limiting example, the robotic arm <b>82</b> may deposit embryos on the supporting material such that succeeding embryos are spaced from preceding embryos. Accordingly, such predetermined positions, as well as equivalents thereof, are within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After the embryo is deposited on the singulation frame <b>82</b>, and as indicated by the block <b>140</b>, the ELR determines whether a desired number of embryos deposited on the singulation frame <b>82</b> have been reached. If &#x201c;no,&#x201d; the ELR is returned to block <b>110</b> and the evaluation is repeated. If the maximum number of embryos has been deposited on the singulation frame <b>82</b>, the process is now complete, as indicated by the block <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Operation of an alternate method of singulating embryos may be best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. It should be noted that components of this alternate embodiment that are the same as those described with respect to the first embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> have the same reference number.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The beginning of the operational sequence is represented by the start block <b>100</b> by initiating the system <b>20</b> to &#x201c;0&#x201d; the ELR, indicated by the block <b>102</b>. Simultaneously, fluid flow through the system <b>20</b> is initiated and indicated by the block <b>204</b>. An increment timer <b>1</b> is enabled, indicated by the block <b>206</b>, and the singulation rate, or data point, is calculated, as indicated in the block <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The embryo singulation rate is compared to the set point to determine whether or not the embryo singulation rate is equal to the set point, as indicated by the decision block <b>210</b>. The singulation rate is defined as the number of detected embryos per unit time. To calculate it, the number of embryos detected in a moving window of time is divided by the size (in time) of the window, e.g., 50 detections in the last 60 seconds. The window is &#x201c;moving&#x201d; forward in time, as the most recent window is always used. If the embryo singulation rate does not equal that set point, the hydrostatic head setpoint is adjusted. If the singulation rate needs to be decreased, the hydrostatic head setpoint is lowered. This is indicated by the block <b>212</b>. Then the hydrostatic head of the liquid within the singulation vessel <b>30</b> is measured by the second sensor. One such ultrasonic sensor is described above. This is indicated by the block <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a comparison of the liquid hydrostatic head is made relative to the set point to determine whether or not the hydrostatic head is equal to the set point, as indicated by the block <b>216</b>. If the hydrostatic head is not at the set point, the raise rate of the singulation vessel <b>30</b> by the lift mechanism <b>32</b> is adjusted, as indicated by the block <b>218</b>. In summary, the singulation rate controller adjusts the hydrostatic head setpoint (i.e., the target flow rate of fluid/embryos) and the hydrostatic head controller adjusts the rise rate of the singulation kettle in an attempt to drive the hydrostatic head to its target (aka setpoint). Following adjustment of the hydrostatic head, calculate the length (i.e., number of registers) of the ELR, as indicated by the block <b>220</b>. The length of the ELR is calculated based on the distance between the sensor (<b>34</b>) and the outlet of tubing (<b>60</b>) and the flow rate of the fluid (i.e., hydrostatic head). As the flow rate (head) increases the velocity of the fluid/embryos increases in tubing (<b>60</b>), which is turn reduces the time between detection and placement on s-frame (<b>82</b>). The number of registers required is this time divided by the time of timer <b>2</b> in block <b>220</b>. Following block <b>220</b>, a second increment timer is enabled, as shown in the block <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The sensor <b>34</b> determines whether an embryo <b>40</b> is detected in the tubing <b>60</b> and indicated by the decision block <b>106</b>. If an embryo <b>40</b> is detected by the sensor <b>34</b>, a &#x201c;1&#x201d; is placed in the first registry location of the ELR, indicated by the block <b>108</b>. Thereafter, the second increment timer is evaluated to determine whether or not a predetermined period of time, such as 20 milliseconds, has expired, and as indicated by the decision block <b>222</b>. If an embryo is not detected by the sensor <b>34</b>, the PLC will advance ahead to block <b>222</b> to determine whether the second increment timer has timed out.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">If the second increment timer has not timed out, the ELR returns to block <b>106</b> to evaluate whether an embryo has been detected. If the second increment timer has timed out, then the ELR shifts the registry by one position forward and places a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in the next registry location, indicated by the block <b>114</b>. Also, as indicated by the block <b>116</b>, the second increment timer is reset.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As indicated by the decision block <b>118</b>, the PLC evaluates whether there is a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in the last or &#x201c;trigger&#x201d; ELR registry, indicating the presence of an embryo <b>40</b> at the very end of the tube <b>60</b>. If there is a &#x201c;0&#x201d; in the last registry, indicating that there is no embryo in the last or trigger registry, the PLC determines whether the first incremental timer has timed out, indicated by the decision block <b>224</b>. If the first incremental timer has not timed out, then the PLC will advance back to enable the second increment timer, indicated by the block <b>221</b>. If, however, the first increment timer has timed out, the PLC returns back to enable Timer<b>1</b>, as indicated by the block <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Returning to the decision block <b>118</b>, if the last or trigger registry in the ELR contains a &#x201c;1,&#x201d; then the PLC deposits an embryo on the singulation frame <b>82</b>, as noted in the block <b>138</b>. After depositing the embryo onto the singulation frame <b>82</b>, the &#x201c;X&#x201d; position of the robotic arm relative to the width of the singulation frame <b>82</b> is evaluated. Specifically, as indicated by the block <b>132</b>, the &#x201c;X&#x201d; position of the robotic arm <b>80</b> is evaluated to determine whether it has reached the maximum width of the singulation frame <b>82</b>. If it has reached the maximum width of the singulation frame <b>82</b>, then the robotic arm <b>80</b> is advanced one position forward in the longitudinal direction, or &#x201c;Y&#x201d; direction, of the singulation frame <b>82</b>, and the direction of the robotic arm <b>80</b> in the &#x201c;X&#x201d; direction is reversed, as indicated by the block <b>134</b>. After the &#x201c;X&#x201d; position of the robotic arm is reversed, the PLC zeroes out the &#x201c;X&#x201d; position, indicated by the block <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If the &#x201c;X&#x201d; position is not reached in block <b>132</b>, the robotic arm <b>80</b> is moved one position in the &#x201c;X&#x201d; axis, as indicated by the block <b>226</b>. Doing so moves the robotic arm <b>80</b> to the next open position on the singulation frame <b>82</b>. Thus, removal of at least one of the plurality of embryos may be synchronized with the data point, such as the hydrostatic head, and the flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thereafter, the PLC determines whether a desired number of embryos deposited on the singulation frame <b>82</b> have been reached, as indicated by the block <b>140</b>. If the desired number of embryo counts has not been reached, the program returns to block <b>204</b> and the process is repeated. If the maximum number of embryos has been deposited on the singulation frame <b>82</b>, the process is now complete, as indicated by the block <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">While illustrative embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. As a non-limiting example, the sensor <b>34</b> may be positioned at any point along the tubing <b>60</b>. In one alternate embodiment, the sensor <b>34</b> may be positioned adjacent the robotic arm <b>80</b>. In such an alternate embodiment, the PLC <b>24</b> may be programmed to actuate the robotic arm <b>80</b> to deposit the sensed embryo as soon as it receives an input signal from the sensor <b>34</b>. Positioning the sensor <b>34</b> adjacent the robotic arm <b>80</b> works in a system <b>20</b> that has either constant or non-constant fluid flow. Also, the method of the present disclosure may be implemented in a variety of systems and, therefore, the described system for implementing the method is provided for illustration purposes only and is not intended to be limiting.</p>
