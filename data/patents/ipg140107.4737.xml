<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a hearing device and to a method of operating a hearing device. It relates to methods and apparatuses according to the opening clauses of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Under a hearing device, a device is understood, which is worn in or adjacent to an individual's ear with the object to improve the individual's acoustical perception. Such improvement may also be barring acoustic signals from being perceived in the sense of hearing protection for the individual. If the hearing device is tailored so as to improve the perception of a hearing impaired individual towards hearing perception of a &#x201c;standard&#x201d; individual, then we speak of a hearing-aid device. With respect to the application area, a hearing device may be applied behind the ear, in the ear, completely in the ear canal or may be implanted, wherein in particular in the present patent application, the hearing device may comprise or consist of different parts which are worn in different ones of the named locations.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Under audio signals we understand electrical signals, analogue and/or digital, which represent sound.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">From DE 10 2005 006 404 B3, an In-The-Ear hearing device is known, which can temporarily be complemented by a supplementary module attachable to a hearing device user's head. The In-The-Ear hearing device has all components and functionalities required for operation, whereas the supplementary module can change or add functionalities.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,987,146, an open ear canal hearing aid system is disclosed which comprises a plurality of ear canal tubes sized for positioning in an ear canal of a user so that the ear canal is at least partially open for directly receiving ambient sounds. The hearing aid system comprises a case to which the ear canal tubes are connected and which is designed to fit behind a user's ear. In said case, a sound processor is arranged for amplifying ambient sounds received through one of the ear canal tubes and for producing processed sounds and for supplying the processed sounds to the second ear canal tube. A speaker is arranged within said case, and a microphone is arranged at that end of one of the ear canal tubes which is located in the ear canal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In WO 2008/010716 A2, a hearing-aid device is presented, which comprises a device housing intended and adapted to be worn outside an ear of a user and which co-acts with an in-the-ear part. The in-the-ear part is physically separated from the device housing but electronically connected thereto and comprises a microphone and a loudspeaker. The device housing or the in-the-ear part comprises a digital processing device in which sound picked up by the microphone is processed, and the processed sound is fed to the loudspeaker.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One object of the invention is to create an alternative type of hearing device. In addition, a corresponding method for operating a hearing device shall be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the invention is to provide a hearing device comprising a very small In-The-Ear part.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the invention is to provide a hearing device with particularly natural directional clues, in particular a hearing device which preserves the hearing device user's heard-related transfer function (HRTF) particularly well.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the invention is to provide a possibility to individualize a hearing device in a particularly simple way.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the invention is to provide a possibility to adapt a hearing device to the needs and preferences of a user (&#x201c;hearing device fitting&#x201d;) in a particularly simple way, in particular in case of varying needs or preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the invention is to provide a hearing device, components of which can be particularly easily replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object of the invention is to provide a particularly failure-insensitive, in particularly corrosion-insensitive hearing device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further objects emerge from the description and embodiments below.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">At least one of these objects is at least partially achieved by apparatuses and methods according to the patent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The hearing device comprises
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0017">an outer part to be worn behind a hearing device user's ear,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0018">an inner part to be worn within the hearing device user's ear, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0019">a connecting portion operationally interconnecting said outer part and said inner part;
<br/>
wherein an output transducer is comprised in said outer part or in said connecting portion, and wherein said inner part comprises an input transducer and, operationally interconnected between said input transducer and said output transducer, a signal processing unit.
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0020">The outer part can also be referred to as BTE part (Behind-The-Ear part), and the inner part can also be referred to as ITE part (In-The-Ear part). The inner part can in particular be an ITC part (In-The-Canal part) or a CIC part (Completely-In-the-Canal part).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0021">The output transducer is a means for generating acoustic sound, in particular from audio signals.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0022">Through this, the inner part can be particularly small, since the output transducer is not arranged therein, but arranged in the outer part or in the connecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0023">Furthermore, with the output transducer arranged in the outer part or in the connecting portion, problems caused by ear wax at or in the output transducer are very unlikely to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0024">Furthermore, from an electronics and a signal transmission point of view, it is advantageous to have the input transducer (which usually generates relatively weak signals) close to the signal processing unit. This reduces the amount of stray signals and electromagnetic interference, thus providing particularly high quality audio signals.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0025">Furthermore, having the input transducer in the user's ear canal or at the entrance thereof ensures that the user has a particularly well and natural hearing experience, because the natural directional clues in particular the HRTFs are largely preserved.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0026">Furthermore, with the output transducer arranged in the outer part or in the connecting portion and the input transducer and the signal processing unit arranged in the inner part, a modular hearing device can be realized which allows to replace or add or remove parts of the hearing device and corresponding functionalities in a convenient fashion, in particular in conjunction with fitting of the hearing device in which case the hearing device has to be functionally, typically electrically connected to an external unit such as a fitting system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0027">In one embodiment, the output transducer is an output mechanical-to-electrical converter, in particular a loudspeaker, also referred to as receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0028">In one embodiment, the input transducer is an input mechanical-to-electrical converter, e.g., a microphone.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0029">In one embodiment, the inner part is inoperable without said outer part because no output transducer or no electrical-to-acoustical converter is provided in the inner part.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0030">In one embodiment, no signal processing unit, more particularly no audio signal processing unit is provided in said outer part.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0031">In one embodiment, said outer part is detachable from said inner part. This strongly facilitates a replacement of one of said parts, in particular of the outer part.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0032">In one embodiment, the hearing device consists of said outer part and said inner part and said connecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0033">In one embodiment, said connecting portion is detachably connected to said outer part or to said inner part or to both, said outer part and said inner part. This strongly facilitates the exchange of parts of the hearing device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0034">In one embodiment, a part of said hearing device comprising said output transducer is detachably connectable to at least a portion of said outer part. This strongly facilitates the removal of parts of the hearing device, but still allows to program and fit the hearing device while at least said part is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0035">In one embodiment, said connecting portion comprises a plug and said outer part or said inner part comprises a corresponding socket or vice versa, i.e. said connecting portion comprises a socket and said outer part or said inner part comprises a corresponding plug.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0036">In one embodiment, said connecting portion comprises a tube member for providing guidance for acoustic sound outputted from said output transducer to said inner part. In one embodiment, said tube member provides guidance for said acoustic sound through said inner part.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037">In one embodiment, said hearing device comprises a data storage unit comprising data individual to said hearing device user, wherein said data storage unit is comprised in said inner part. In one embodiment, said data individual to said hearing device user comprise signal processing parameter settings individual to said hearing device user.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0038">In one embodiment, no data individual to said hearing device user are comprised in said outer part.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0039">In one embodiment, an energy storage unit suitable for powering said signal processing unit is comprised in said inner part. In one embodiment, said energy storage unit is a rechargeable energy storage unit, e.g., a capacitor or an accumulator. A rechargeable energy storage unit has the advantage that the hearing device user can have at least two of those, one in use in the hearing device and another one being recharged in the meantime.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0040">In one embodiment, no energy storage unit suitable for powering said signal processing unit is comprised in said outer part. This way, the inner part can be very small.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0041">In one embodiment, said inner part is inoperable without said outer part because of lacking an energy storage unit suitable for powering said signal processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0042">In one embodiment, only said outer part comprises an energy storage unit suitable for powering said signal processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0043">In one embodiment, said outer part comprises an energy storage unit, wherein said signal processing unit is configured to be powered by energy drawn from said energy storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0044">In one embodiment, said outer part comprises an energy storage unit, wherein said signal processing unit is configured to be powered by energy drawn from said energy storage unit, and wherein said energy storage unit is a component of a power supply unit of said hearing device, and wherein at least one further component, e.g., a control circuit or a voltage transformer, is comprised in said inner part.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a partially block-diagrammatical illustration of a hearing device <b>1</b>. The hearing device <b>1</b> comprises an inner part <b>3</b> worn within a user's ear <b>5</b>, more particularly within the user's ear canal <b>16</b>, and an outer part <b>2</b> worn behind the user's ear, more particularly behind the user's concha. The hearing device <b>1</b> furthermore comprises a connecting portion <b>12</b>, which is symbolized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by a dotted arrow, and which provides an operational connection between inner part <b>3</b> and outer part <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075">The inner part <b>3</b> comprises an input transducer <b>6</b> such as a microphone or a microphone arrangement, and a signal processing unit <b>7</b> such as a digital signal processor (DSP). There is no battery and no other energy storage unit comprised in said inner part <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0076">The outer part <b>2</b> comprises an output transducer <b>8</b> such as a loudspeaker, an energy storage unit <b>4</b> such as a battery, and a user interface <b>11</b> comprising two user controls, a volume control <b>19</b> and a program select button <b>18</b>. As indicated by reference number <b>28</b> (thick dotted line), a portion of outer part <b>2</b> comprising output transducer <b>8</b> is detachably connected to the rest of outer part <b>2</b>. This allows, e.g., to detach a portion of outer part <b>2</b> for fitting the hearing device <b>1</b> to the hearing needs and preference of the hearing device user. E.g., the same detachable connector could be used for connecting said portion of outer part <b>2</b> comprising output transducer <b>8</b> to said rest of outer part <b>2</b> and for connecting said portion of outer part <b>2</b> comprising output transducer <b>8</b> (and therewith connecting also connecting portion <b>12</b> and inner part <b>3</b>) to a fitting system or fitting device such as a computer with a suitable software. During fitting, an energy storage unit <b>4</b> within the hearing device <b>1</b> can be dispensed with since energy can be provided via the detachable connection, e.g., from the fitting system, and user interface <b>11</b> can be dispensed with, too, since the corresponding functions can be controlled via the detachable connection, e.g., using the fitting system. A useful and high degree of modularity can be obtained by means of said detachable connection (ref. <b>28</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0077">Basic functions of the hearing device <b>1</b> are to convert incoming acoustic sound <b>9</b> into audio signals S<b>1</b>, which is accomplished by input transducer <b>6</b>, and to process these audio signals S<b>1</b> in dependence of hearing needs and preference of the user, which is accomplished by signal processing unit <b>7</b>, and to convert the so-obtained audio signals S<b>2</b> into outgoing sound <b>10</b>, which is accomplished by output transducer <b>8</b>. The outgoing sound <b>10</b> will reach the user's ear drum <b>17</b> in order to be perceived by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0078">The signal processing taking place in signal processing unit <b>7</b> can be adjusted by the user by means of the user interface <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a partially perspective illustration of a hearing device <b>1</b>. Most of the reference symbols have already been explained above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The shape and size of outer part <b>2</b> is strongly influenced by the largest comprised component, i.e. by the battery for which a battery door <b>20</b> is provided. The outer part <b>2</b> can be considerably smaller than conventional BTE hearing devices, since signal processing unit <b>7</b> and input transducer <b>6</b> are comprised in inner part <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0080">The inner part <b>3</b> can be considerably smaller than conventional ITE hearing devices such as ITC and CIC hearing devices, because neither the energy storage unit <b>4</b> nor the output transducer <b>8</b> has to be comprised in inner part <b>3</b>. This results in a high wearing comfort. And, the outer shape of inner part <b>3</b> can rather easily be designed to be very well adjusted to the user's ear, more particularly to the shape of the user's ear canal. It is well possible to provide a custom-made shell for the inner part which is individually shaped for each user's ear canal shape. But it is also possible, in particular due to the smallness of the inner part, to provide an inner part which is only in part or even not at all individually selected for the user or adjusted to the user's ear canal shape: E.g., the inner part could be the same for all users or for each user of one of a couple of groups of users, while it is provided with a compliant or resilient material such as a soft foam or some other soft elastic material, e.g., a suitable silicone, so as to adjust itself to each user's individual ear canal shape.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0081">Connecting portion <b>12</b> comprises a tube member <b>23</b> and a plug <b>25</b> fitting into a socket provided by outer part <b>2</b> allowing to easily separate outer part <b>2</b> from inner part <b>3</b>. Tube member <b>23</b> allows to guide acoustic sound generated by output transducer <b>8</b> to inner part <b>3</b>. Furthermore, connecting portion <b>12</b> provides a wired connection integrated in tube member <b>23</b> which allows to transmit data and/or signals between inner part <b>3</b> and outer part <b>2</b>. Alternatively or additionally, it is possible to provide a wireless connection between inner part <b>3</b> and outer part <b>2</b> for transmitting data and/or signals between inner part <b>3</b> and outer part <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a block-diagrammatical illustration of a hearing device <b>1</b> emphasising operational aspects and showing additional components.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0083">In addition to the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an additional input transducer <b>15</b>, comprised in the outer part <b>2</b>, which generates audio signals S<b>1</b>&#x2032;, a data storage unit <b>14</b> comprised in inner part <b>3</b>, comprising data individual to the hearing device user, a control unit <b>21</b> comprised in inner part <b>3</b>, which alternatively could be comprised in outer part <b>2</b>, and a transceiver <b>24</b> comprised in inner part <b>3</b>, which also could alternatively be comprised in outer part <b>2</b>, and an antenna <b>22</b> for use in conjunction with transceiver <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0084">Electrical energy is transmitted from energy storage unit <b>4</b> in outer part <b>3</b> to signal processing unit <b>7</b>, to control circuit <b>21</b> and (not indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to transceiver <b>24</b>, via wired connection <b>13</b>. A wireless connection, e.g., using induction, could also be used for that purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0085">The operational connection for transmitting audio signals S<b>1</b>&#x2032; and/or S<b>2</b> and/or electrical signals from user interface <b>11</b> can be provided by wired connection <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0086">A bus system can be established on wired connection <b>13</b> for transmitting audio signals S<b>1</b>&#x2032; and/or S<b>2</b> and/or said control signals. This is an elegant way of communicating signals and/or data between inner part <b>3</b> and outer part <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0087">Control circuit <b>21</b> controls signal processing unit <b>7</b> and transceiver <b>24</b> and exchanges data with data storage unit <b>14</b>. It furthermore receives electrical signals from user interface <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0088">Data storage unit <b>14</b> is preferably comprised in inner part <b>3</b> which facilitates the exchange of data with signal processing unit <b>7</b>. The data individual to the hearing device user can comprise, e.g., data descriptive of the user's hearing loss and/or data descriptive of signal processing parameter settings adjusted to the hearing needs and preferences of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0089">Transceiver <b>24</b> allows to establish communication connections with devices separate from the hearing device <b>1</b>. The antenna <b>22</b> can be comprised in the inner part <b>3</b> and/or in the connecting portion <b>12</b> and/or in the outer part <b>2</b>. Preferably, antenna <b>22</b> is comprised fully or in part in connecting portion <b>12</b>. An elegant way to comprise antenna <b>22</b> in connecting portion <b>12</b> is to use electrical connection <b>13</b> as antenna <b>22</b> or as a part thereof. A direct current provided by energy storage unit <b>4</b> will not interfere with antenna signals. Furthermore, it is also possible to separate antenna signals from other signals possibly transmitted via wired connection <b>13</b> such as audio signals S<b>1</b>&#x2032;,S<b>2</b> and control signals from user interface <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0090">The antenna <b>22</b> can be used, e.g., for programming (fitting) the hearing device in a wireless fashion, i.e. without galvanically connecting a programming system or device (such as a computer with a suitable programming software) with the hearing device.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0091">The hearing device <b>1</b> according to the invention can be considered a modular hearing device. It is possible, confer, e.g., to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to distribute the hearing device components in such a way that predominantly components which are rather individual to the hearing device user are comprised in the inner part <b>3</b>, which usually will have a shape that is more or less individually adapted to the user's ear (in particular the user's ear canal), whereas components which can or have to be easily replaced are predominantly comprised in the outer part <b>2</b>. This way, servicing the hearing device is simplified. It is possible, e.g., even to replace the whole outer part <b>2</b> by a different outer part having a different shape or color, or by one suitable for a different battery type or with a different user interface, or by one with or without a wired or wireless connectivity. Such a connectivity can be a connectivity to and/or from external devices or systems such one or more microphones, consumer electronics devices (such as music players), communication devices (such as mobile phones), one- or two-way radio equipment, testing hearing device equipment, hearing diagnostics equipment, hearing device fitting equipment, hearing device programming equipment. Said wireless connectivity can based, e.g., on FM (frequency modulation).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a block-diagrammatical illustration of a hearing device, illustrating another possible way of providing a useful modularity. Most reference numbers have already been explained above. Whereas in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, the output converter <b>8</b> is arranged in the outer part <b>2</b>, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is integrated in connecting portion <b>12</b>. Connecting portion <b>12</b> is detachably connected to at least one of outer part <b>2</b> and inner part <b>3</b>, in particular to both, outer part <b>2</b> and inner part <b>3</b>, as indicated by reference numbers <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, respectively. Preferably, connecting portion <b>12</b> and therewith output transducer <b>8</b> is detachably connectable at least to outer part <b>2</b>. This allows, in a very comparable way to what was explained above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to fit (adjust) the hearing device to needs and preferences of a hearing device user having a plug or socket connected at <b>26</b> (with energy storage unit <b>4</b> and user interface <b>11</b> removed) so as to provide a connection to an external fitting system, while input transducer <b>6</b>, output transducer <b>8</b> and signal processing unit <b>7</b> being still available. For example, output transducer <b>8</b> could be integrated in a plug belonging to connecting potion <b>12</b> such as&#x2014;referring to FIG. <b>2</b>&#x2014;plug <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0093">In general, detachable connections <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> can be realized, e.g., in form of plug-and-socket connections, a plug in one of the interconnected parts and a socket in the other.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0094">Aspects of the embodiments above have been described in terms of functional units. As is readily understood, these functional units may be realized in virtually any number of hardware and/or software components adapted to performing the specified functions.</p>
