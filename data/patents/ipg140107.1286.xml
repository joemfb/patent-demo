<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/312,056, filed Dec. 6, 2011, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to seating units, and more particularly to seating units with reclining capability.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a recliner chair will move from an upright position, in which the backrest is generally upright, to one or more reclined positions, in which the backrest pivots to be less upright. The movement of the seating unit between the upright and reclined positions is typically controlled by a pair of synchronized reclining mechanisms that are attached to the seat, backrest and base of the chair. Many recliners will have an extendable footrest or ottoman that provides support for the occupant's feet in the reclined position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One particularly popular recliner is the &#x201c;three-way&#x201d; recliner, which has two reclined positions: an intermediate &#x201c;TV position&#x201d;, in which the footrest or ottoman of the chair is projected forwardly from the chair while the backrest remains substantially upright relative to the seat; and a &#x201c;fully reclined position&#x201d;, in which the backrest is less upright (i.e., it has been reclined to a shallower angle relative to the floor). In a &#x201c;three-way&#x201d; recliner, the backrest pivots relative to the seat as the chair takes its fully reclined position; this differs from a &#x201c;two-way&#x201d; recliner, in which the backrest and seat are rigidly fixed and do not pivot relative to one another as the chair moves to the fully reclined position, and from a &#x201c;one-way&#x201d; recliner, which typically has no intermediate &#x201c;TV&#x201d; position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One recliner chair feature that has become popular in some models is a headrest that is retracted when the recliner chair is in its upright position and extends when the reclining chair moves to a reclined position. Such a headrest can provide support for the occupant's head, which may increase comfort for a reclining occupant. An exemplary headrest is described and illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,346,277 to Holobaugh et al. The chair illustrated therein includes a headrest that is generally horizontally disposed atop the backrest when the chair is in the upright position and generally vertically disposed above the backrest when the chair is in a reclined position. A headrest that folds within a cavity in the rear surface of the backrest, then inverts as it extends, is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,125 to Rogers. Another example is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,669,921 to Hoffman et al., which discloses a headrest that separates from the backrest when the footrest extends. The disclosures of each of these patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As chair styling continues to evolve, it may be desirable to provide additional headrest configurations.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a first aspect, embodiments of the present invention are directed to a reclining seating unit. The reclining seating unit comprises: a base configured to rest on an underlying surface; a seat; a backrest; a reclining mechanism attached to the base, seat and backrest, the reclining mechanism configured to move the seating unit between an upright position, in which the seat is disposed above the base and the backrest defines a first backrest angle relative to the seat, and a fully reclined position, in which the backrest has reclined relative to the seat to a second backrest angle that exceeds the first backrest angle; a headrest that is positioned in front of an upper portion of the backrest; and a headrest mechanism attached to the headrest and to the reclining mechanism. The headrest mechanism is configured to move the headrest from a retracted position when the seating unit is in its upright position to an extended position when the seating unit is in its fully reclined position. In the retracted position, the headrest is generally parallel with the backrest, and in the extended position, the headrest defines an angle with the backrest in which the front surface of headrest is rotated to partially face the front surface of the backrest.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a second aspect, embodiments of the present invention are directed to a reclining seating unit, comprising: a base configured to rest on an underlying surface; a seat; a backrest; a reclining mechanism attached to the base, seat and backrest, the reclining mechanism configured to move the seating unit between an upright position, in which the seat is disposed above the base and the backrest defines a first backrest angle relative to the seat, and a fully reclined position, in which the backrest has reclined relative to the seat to a second backrest angle that exceeds the first backrest angle; a headrest that is positioned in front of an upper portion of the backrest; and a headrest mechanism attached to the headrest and to the reclining mechanism. The headrest mechanism is configured to move the headrest from a retracted position when the seating unit is in its upright position to an extended position when the seating unit is in its fully reclined position, wherein in the extended position the headrest is tilted forward with respect to the backrest compared to the retracted position.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention will be described more particularly hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. The invention is not intended to be limited to the illustrated embodiments; rather, these embodiments are intended to fully and completely disclose the invention to those skilled in this art. In the drawings, like numbers refer to like elements throughout. Thicknesses and dimensions of some components may be exaggerated for clarity. Well-known functions or constructions may not be described in detail for brevity and/or clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;under&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;over&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is inverted, elements described as &#x201c;under&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;over&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;under&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of over and under. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. As used herein the expression &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Where used, the terms &#x201c;attached&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected&#x201d;, &#x201c;interconnected&#x201d;, &#x201c;contacting&#x201d;, &#x201c;coupled&#x201d;, &#x201c;mounted&#x201d; and the like can mean either direct or indirect attachment or contact between elements, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, some components of the seating units described herein (particularly mechanisms thereof) are illustrated herein as a series of pivotally interconnected links or members. Those skilled in this art will appreciate that the pivots between links or other components can take a variety of configurations, such as pivot pins, rivets, bolt and nut combinations, and the like, any of which may be suitable for use with the present invention. Also, the shapes and configurations of the links themselves may vary, as will be understood by those skilled in this art. Further, some links may be omitted entirely in some embodiments, and additional links may be included in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the figures, a reclining chair, designated broadly at <b>10</b>, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The chair includes a base <b>12</b> that rests on an underlying surface and includes a frame <b>14</b>, a seat <b>16</b>, a backrest <b>18</b>, and rear, main, and front ottomans <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>(only the main ottoman <b>20</b><i>b </i>is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). These structures are interconnected with a pair of reclining mechanisms <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). These components are discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the base <b>12</b> includes a flat, circular foundation <b>22</b> that rests on the floor or other underlying surface, a swivel unit <b>23</b> that is mounted on the foundation <b>22</b>, two longitudinally-extending rails <b>24</b> that are fixed to the top plate of the swivel unit <b>23</b>, two cross-members <b>25</b> that are fixed onto to the upper surfaces of the rails <b>24</b>, and arm brackets <b>26</b> that are fixed to the outer ends of the cross-members <b>25</b>. Thus, the rails <b>24</b>, the cross-members <b>25</b> and the arm brackets <b>26</b> form a rigid unit that rotates in concert with the upper plate of the swivel unit <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The frame <b>14</b> includes arms <b>29</b> and a rear panel <b>31</b> that spans the arms <b>29</b>. Each arm <b>29</b> comprises an inner panel <b>40</b> and an outer panel <b>42</b> that are separated by spacers <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b</i>, thereby forming a cavity <b>43</b> within each arm <b>29</b>. The arm brackets <b>26</b> are mounted to the inner surfaces of the inner panels <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the seat <b>16</b> includes side rails <b>16</b><i>a </i>and cross-members <b>16</b><i>b</i>, which combine to form a generally square structure. A cushion (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) rests on the side rails <b>16</b><i>a </i>and cross-members <b>16</b><i>b</i>. A seat panel <b>84</b> is mounted to the outside of each side rail <b>16</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Turning now to the reclining mechanism <b>21</b>, each of the reclining mechanisms <b>21</b> is a mirror image of the other reclining mechanism about a vertical plane that extends from the front of the chair <b>10</b> to the rear centered between the arms <b>29</b>. In the interest of brevity, only one reclining mechanism <b>21</b> will be described herein, with the understanding that the discussion is equally applicable to the other reclining mechanism <b>21</b>. Also, the reclining mechanism will be described first with respect to the fully reclined position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in order to illustrate more easily the interconnection of the various links thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the reclining mechanism <b>21</b> has an angled frame bracket <b>60</b> mounted to the inner surface of the inner arm panel <b>40</b>. A rear swing link <b>62</b> is attached at its lower end to the frame bracket <b>60</b> at a pivot <b>64</b> and extends upwardly and rearwardly therefrom. A front swing link <b>66</b> is attached at its lower end to the frame bracket <b>60</b> at a pivot <b>68</b> and extends upwardly and slightly rearwardly therefrom. A sequencer link <b>70</b> is attached to the frame bracket <b>60</b> via slot <b>70</b><i>a </i>that receives a pin <b>60</b><i>a </i>on the frame bracket <b>60</b>. The sequencer link <b>70</b> extends upwardly and rearwardly to attach to a connector link <b>72</b> at a pivot <b>76</b>; the front swing link <b>66</b> also attaches to the connector link <b>72</b> at a pivot <b>74</b>. The connector link <b>72</b> extends substantially rearwardly from the pivot <b>76</b> to a pivot <b>82</b> with a transition plate <b>78</b>. The transition plate <b>78</b>, which has three fingers, is attached by its middle finger to the seat panel <b>84</b> at a pivot <b>86</b>, and is also attached at its rear finger with the upper end of the rear swing link <b>62</b> at a pivot <b>89</b>. A control link <b>98</b> is attached to the seat panel <b>84</b> at a pivot <b>102</b> and to the connector link <b>72</b> at a pivot <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a tripartite backpost <b>88</b> is fixed to the backrest <b>18</b> and extends downwardly and forwardly therefrom. At one of its interior vertices, the backpost <b>88</b> is attached to the seat panel <b>84</b> at a pivot <b>90</b>. A drive link <b>92</b> is attached to the lower, forward end of the backpost <b>88</b> at a pivot <b>94</b> and extends forwardly therefrom to a pivot <b>96</b> with the lower portion of the transition plate <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a rear ottoman drive link <b>104</b> is attached at a pivot <b>106</b> to the seat panel <b>84</b> and extends forwardly therefrom. A spring <b>105</b> extends between the rear ottoman drive link <b>104</b> and the seat panel <b>84</b>. A front ottoman drive link <b>108</b> is attached at a pivot <b>110</b> to the seat panel <b>84</b> at a pivot that is positioned forwardly and upwardly from the pivot <b>106</b>. A rear ottoman extension link <b>112</b> is attached to the forward end of the rear ottoman drive link <b>104</b> at a pivot <b>116</b> and extends forwardly and upwardly therefrom; the rear ottoman extension link <b>112</b> is also attached to an intermediate section of the front ottoman drive link <b>108</b> at a pivot <b>114</b>. A front ottoman extension link <b>118</b> is attached at its rear end to the front end of the front ottoman drive link <b>108</b> at a pivot <b>120</b> and extends forwardly and upwardly therefrom generally parallel with the rear ottoman drive link <b>112</b>. A main ottoman bracket <b>122</b>, to which the main ottoman <b>20</b><i>b </i>is mounted, is attached to the forward ends of the rear ottoman drive link <b>112</b> and the front ottoman drive link <b>118</b> at, respectively, pivots <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring once again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a front ottoman bracket <b>128</b> is attached to the main ottoman bracket <b>122</b> at a pivot <b>130</b> and extends forwardly therefrom. The front ottoman <b>20</b><i>c </i>is mounted to the forward end of the front ottoman bracket <b>128</b>. A control link <b>132</b> extends between a pivot <b>134</b> with the front ottoman extension link <b>118</b> and a pivot <b>136</b> with the front ottoman bracket <b>128</b>. A rear ottoman bracket <b>138</b> is attached to the front ottoman extension link <b>118</b> at a pivot <b>140</b> and extends upwardly and rearwardly to support the rear ottoman <b>20</b><i>a </i>mounted thereon. A bracing link <b>142</b> extends between a pivot <b>144</b> with the rear ottoman extension link <b>112</b> and a pivot <b>146</b> with the rear ottoman bracket <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A drive link <b>168</b> is attached to the front ottoman drive link <b>108</b> at a pivot <b>172</b>, and extends rearwardly therefrom to a pivot <b>170</b> with the frame mounting bracket <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, the headrest <b>190</b> is attached to a headrest mechanism <b>200</b>, which controls its movement. The headrest mechanism <b>200</b> includes a extending link <b>202</b> that is pivotally mounted at a pivot <b>206</b> to a bracket <b>204</b> fixed to the seat rail <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The extending link <b>202</b> extends upwardly and rearwardly following the profile of the backrest <b>18</b>. An angled bracket <b>208</b> is positioned slightly forwardly of the upper portion of the extending link <b>202</b>. A headrest link <b>212</b> is pivotally attached at its lower end to the extending link <b>202</b> at a pivot <b>214</b> and at its intermediate portion to the upper end of the bracket <b>208</b> at a pivot <b>216</b>. The headrest <b>190</b> is fixed to the upper end of the headrest link <b>212</b>. The headrest <b>190</b> is generally parallel with the backrest <b>18</b>, with its front surface facing forwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Operation of the chair typically begins in the upright position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the upright position, the ottomans <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>are all folded beneath the seat <b>16</b>, with the main ottoman <b>20</b><i>b </i>positioned below the front of the seat <b>16</b> and vertically disposed, the rear ottoman <b>20</b><i>a </i>behind the main ottoman and vertically disposed, and the front ottoman <b>20</b><i>c </i>horizontally disposed and facing the underlying surface. The links comprising the portion of the reclining mechanism <b>21</b> that extends the ottoman (i.e., the front and rear ottoman drive links <b>108</b>, <b>104</b>, the front and rear ottoman extension links <b>118</b>, <b>112</b>, the front, main and rear ottoman brackets <b>128</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>138</b>, the control link <b>132</b>, and the bracing link <b>142</b>) are folded beneath the seat <b>16</b> as a pantographic linkage. The seat <b>16</b> is disposed above the base <b>12</b> and typically has a pitch angle of between about 5 and 8 degrees relative to horizontal, and the backrest <b>18</b> has a first backrest angle a of between about 60 and 80 degrees relative to horizontal. The components of the headrest mechanism <b>200</b> are in the positions discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, such that the headrest <b>190</b> is positioned above and generally parallel with the backrest <b>18</b>. The reclining mechanism <b>21</b> is maintained in place by tension in the spring <b>105</b>, which urges the reclining mechanism <b>21</b> toward the upright position.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To move the chair <b>10</b> to the TV position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the occupant of the chair <b>10</b> pushes forwardly on the arms <b>29</b>, which action forces the occupant's back rearwardly into the backrest <b>18</b>. Forcing the backrest <b>18</b> and seat <b>16</b> rearwardly relative to the base <b>12</b> draws the seat <b>16</b> and seat panel <b>84</b> rearwardly; this movement is largely controlled by the rear swing link <b>62</b>, the front swing link <b>66</b>, and the sequencer link <b>70</b>. As the seat <b>16</b> moves rearwardly, the drive link <b>168</b> rotates only slightly, with the net effect that the front ottoman drive link <b>108</b> rotates counterclockwise considerably about the pivot <b>110</b>. This action also extends the front and rear ottoman extension links <b>118</b>, <b>112</b>, which in turn rotates the rear ottoman link <b>104</b> counterclockwise about the pivot <b>106</b>. Once rotation of the rear ottoman drive link <b>104</b> causes the axis defined by the spring <b>105</b> to pass the pivot <b>106</b>, the spring <b>105</b> then urges the rear ottoman drive link <b>104</b> toward the TV position. Relative separation of the front and rear ottoman extension links <b>118</b>, <b>112</b> also rotates the main ottoman bracket <b>122</b> and the main ottoman <b>20</b><i>b </i>to a generally horizontal disposition in front of the seat <b>16</b>. Extension of the front ottoman extension link <b>118</b> and rotation of the main ottoman bracket <b>122</b> also draws forward and inverts the front ottoman bracket <b>128</b> and the front ottoman <b>20</b><i>c</i>. Extension and separation of the front and rear ottoman extension links <b>118</b>, <b>112</b> also forces the rear ottoman bracket <b>138</b> and the rear ottoman <b>20</b><i>a </i>upwardly and rotates the rear ottoman bracket about the pivot <b>140</b>. Extension of the ottomans <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>ceases when the lower edge of the front ottoman drive link <b>108</b> strikes a stop pin <b>112</b><i>a </i>on the rear ottoman extension link <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Rearward movement of the seat <b>16</b> also forces the backrest <b>18</b> rearwardly relative to the frame <b>14</b> and rotates the backrest <b>18</b> very slightly counterclockwise. However, the backrest <b>18</b> substantially retains the first backrest angle between it and the seat <b>16</b> observed in the upright position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As a result, the headrest <b>190</b> experiences little to no movement relative to the backrest <b>18</b>. In addition, rearward movement of the seat <b>16</b> draws the transition plate <b>78</b> rearward. This movement rotates the rear swing link <b>62</b> counterclockwise about the pivot <b>64</b> and draws the connecting link <b>72</b> rearwardly. As a result, the front swing link <b>66</b> and the sequencer link <b>70</b> rotate counterclockwise about their respective pivots <b>68</b>, <b>60</b><i>a </i>(the sequencer link <b>70</b> also rises slightly relative to the pin <b>60</b><i>a </i>in its slot <b>70</b><i>a</i>, such that the pin <b>60</b><i>a </i>is in the center of the slot <b>70</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To move the chair <b>10</b> to the fully reclined position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the occupant again pushes forwardly on the arms <b>29</b>, which forces the occupant's back into the backrest <b>18</b>. This action forces the backpost <b>88</b> and the backrest <b>18</b> to rotate counterclockwise about the pivot <b>90</b> and move to a reclined position relative to the seat <b>16</b>. Rotation of the backpost <b>88</b> drives the drive link <b>92</b> forwardly, which in turn causes the transition plate <b>78</b> to rotate counterclockwise about the pivot <b>89</b>. Rotation of the transition plate <b>78</b> drives the seat panel <b>84</b> upwardly. As the seat panel <b>84</b> rises, through the control link <b>98</b> it pulls the connecting link <b>72</b> upwardly and rotates it clockwise about the pivot <b>76</b>. Rotation ceases when an edge <b>78</b><i>a </i>of the transition plate <b>78</b> contacts a pin <b>84</b><i>a </i>on the seat panel <b>84</b>. In this position, the backrest <b>18</b> typically reclines at a second backrest angle &#x3b1;&#x2032; of between about 45 and 65 degrees relative to horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Also, the rising of the seat <b>16</b> relative to the backrest <b>18</b> forces the extending link <b>202</b> upwardly. This movement forces the headrest link <b>212</b>, and in turn the headrest <b>190</b>, to rotate clockwise about the pivot <b>216</b> from the retracted position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>6</b> to the extended position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>. In the fully reclined position, the headrest <b>190</b> has rotated to a forwardly-tilted position that defines an angle &#x3b2; of between about 25 and 35 degrees relative to the backrest <b>18</b>, wherein the front surface of the headrest <b>190</b> partially faces the front surface of the backrest <b>18</b> In this position, the headrest <b>190</b> can provide a more comfortable support for a seated occupant for some activities (for example, watching television).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The chair <b>10</b> can be returned to the TV and/or upright position by the occupant pushing downwardly with his feet on one or more of the ottomans <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>. The links of the reclining mechanism <b>21</b> will reverse the various movements described above.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Those skilled in this art will recognize that the headrest mechanism <b>200</b> may be employed with a variety of reclining seating units, including sofas and sectional units, rockers, and gliders, including those that have fewer, or even no, ottomans. Also, the headrest mechanism may be employed with different reclining mechanisms, including one-way, two-way, zero-wall and wall-proximity units, and can be used with seating units that actuate in different ways, such as handles, release levers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another embodiment of the chair <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> and designated broadly at <b>300</b>. The chair <b>300</b> may be identical to the chair <b>10</b> except for the configuration of the backrest <b>18</b>&#x2032; and, as a consequence, the headrest mechanism <b>304</b>. The backrest <b>18</b>&#x2032; extends to the full height of the chair <b>300</b> and has a cross-member <b>320</b> across the top. As such, the headrest <b>190</b>&#x2032; does not rest on top of the backrest as in the chair <b>10</b>, but instead rests in a pocket <b>322</b> located in front of the cross-member <b>320</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the headrest mechanism <b>304</b> includes an extending link <b>302</b> and a bracket <b>308</b> like those of the chair <b>10</b>. Also, the headrest link <b>312</b> is pivotally connected to the extending link <b>302</b> and the bracket <b>308</b> at pivots <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> in the manner of the headrest mechanism <b>200</b>. However, the headrest link <b>312</b> mounts to the rear surface of the headrest <b>190</b>&#x2032; rather than mounted from beneath.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation, the headrest mechanism <b>304</b> operates in the same manner as the headrest mechanism <b>200</b>, with the extending link <b>302</b> being forced upwardly relative to the backrest <b>18</b>&#x2032; as the seat rises in moving to the fully reclined position. This movement causes the headrest link <b>312</b>, and in turn the headrest <b>190</b>&#x2032;, to rotate forwardly relative to the backrest <b>18</b>&#x2032; away from the pocket <b>322</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The headrest mechanism <b>304</b> provides the chair designer with another option in designing a chair with a rotating headrest, if the preferred style is a backrest that, when viewed from the side, displays a single monolithic piece.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed as limiting thereof. Although exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention.</p>
