<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Section 371 of International Application No. PCT/JP2007/055298, filed Mar. 9, 2007, which was published in the Japanese language on Oct. 11, 2007, under International Publication No. WO 2007/114025 A1, and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to gas oil compositions, more specifically to gas oil compositions for a summer or winter season, suitable for both diesel combustion and homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Diesel combustion is referred to as combustion wherein ignition occurs (premixed combustion) when fuel injected to an engine combustion chamber evaporates, mixes with air and becomes a premixed gas with an appropriate fuel/oil ratio, and the gas undergoes an appropriate temperature condition. It is often the case that whether this ignition is good or poor is determined by evaluating the evaporation characteristics resulting from the distillation characteristics and cetane number indicating the self-ignition properties of fuel. If a higher output is required in the diesel combustion (high load conditions), it is necessary to continue the injection of fuel even after the self-ignition occurs. In this case, the fuel must be combusted while the injected fuel is diffused in air atmosphere using fluidized air in the interior of the engine combustion chamber (diffusive combustion). Therefore, what are demanded for fuel characteristics are those to assist premixed combustion and diffusive combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a combustion mode referred to as homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion deriving from these diesel combustion modes, and recently this combustion mode has brought attention because of the low emission properties and excellent fuel efficient properties. This combustion mode is different from the foregoing diesel combustion in that the whole combustion process of the former is premixed combustion and thus is not involved with diffusive combustion. However, as described above, ignition undesirably occurs due to the self-ignition properties of fuel and thus it is regarded as difficult to control ignition under high load conditions in particular. Therefore, there are many engines employing a combustion mode wherein homogenous charge compression ignition combustion is carried out only under low and middle load conditions and switched to a normal diesel combustion under high load conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that what are demanded for fuel characteristics are those to have both a factor to assist homogenous charge compression ignition combustion in low load conditions and a factor to assist diesel combustion under high load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a gas oil composition is produced by blending one or more types of base oils produced by subjecting a straight gas oil or straight kerosene, produced by atmospheric distillation of crude oil to hydrorefining or hydrodesulfurization. In particular, it is often the case that the blend ratio of the foregoing kerosene base oil and gas oil base oil is adjusted in order to ensure the cold flowability during a winter season. If necessary, the base oils are blended with additives such as cetane number improvers, detergents and cold flow improvers (see, for example, Non-Patent Document No. 1 below).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With regard to fuel for the above-described homogenous charge compression ignition combustion, Patent Document No. 1 discloses a diesel gas oil composition characterized in that it contains a relatively light catalytic cracked gas oil and is low in cetane number and high in density and aromatic content. This document describes that this composition can have both excellent low-temperature properties and low NOx and low PM properties in a homogenous charge compression ignition combustion application. However, it is easily anticipated that the aromatic content of the composition will be extremely large, leading to an increase in discharge of unburnt fuel. Further, as described above, it is currently often the case that homogenous charge compression ignition combustion is used in parallel with the conventional diesel combustion. It is thus apparent that the fuel of this document with a low cetane number, a high density and a high aromatic content is not suitable at all for homogenous charge compression ignition combustion. Further, it is also easily anticipated that soot or deposit will adhere to injection nozzles or EGR (exhaust gas recycle) control valves, due to the high aromatic content. Therefore, the diesel gas oil composition of this document fundamentally fails to be an environment friendly fuel. Similarly, Patent Document Nos. 2, 3 and 4 disclose that fuel compositions with distillation characteristics defined by functioning are effective for homogenous charge compression ignition combustion. However, as described above, distillation characteristics is not chemically involved with a factor to control the self-ignition properties of fuel, and in particular on the assumption of an improvement in homogenous charge compression ignition combustion of type wherein fuel is injected in an earlier stage, as proposed by the present invention, distillation characteristics are still less effective. An index which is defined by the temperature every certain distillate volume such as T90 but not by fraction volume can be a rough standard to learn the identity of fuel but does not make sense since it is not an absolute quantitative definition. Further, these fuel compositions are kept down in cetane number but are then likely to be reduced in the content of saturated hydrocarbon compounds and thus can be regarded as fuels which can not control ignition any time. Therefore, it is apparent that the characteristic definitions proposed by these documents can not be regarded as fuel characteristics that can control self-ignition, and then it is presumable that no environment friendly fuel has not accomplished yet.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, the environment friendly fuel is necessarily optimized in fuel characteristics every season in view of the environment where it is used. Fuel with excessively lightened distillation characteristics may often cause the seizure of injection pumps, cavitation damages and problems in high-temperature startability.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">That is, it is very difficult to design a high-quality fuel that can achieve at a high level both the requirements sought for a gas oil composition having both an excellent practical performance under conditions in a summer or winter season and environment friendly properties that can be applied to homogenous charge compression ignition combustion, and there exists no example or finding on the basis of studies of such a fuel satisfying various properties required for fuel other than the foregoing sufficiently and a practical process for producing the fuel.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0048">The present invention will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0049">The gas oil composition of the present invention necessarily contains an FT synthetic base oil. The FT synthetic base oil is composed of saturated hydrocarbon compounds, and the gas oil composition of the present invention can be easily produced by adjusting the blend of the hydrocarbon compounds. There is no particular restriction on the characteristics of the FT synthetic base oil as long as the characteristics of the gas oil composition of the present invention are satisfied. There is no particular restriction on base oils other than the FT synthetic base oil as long as the characteristics of the gas oil composition of the present invention are fulfilled. However, in order to allow the composition to exhibit sufficient environment friendly properties, it is preferable to blend the following petroleum base oil having been highly hydrotreated and animal- or vegetable-derived processed oils.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0050">The FT synthetic base oil referred herein denotes various synthetic oils such as liquid fractions corresponding to naphtha, kerosene and gas oil, produced by subjecting a mixed gas containing mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide (hereinafter may be often referred to as &#x201c;synthetic gas&#x201d;) to a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reaction; hydrocarbon mixtures produced by hydrorefining or hydrocracking such liquid fractions; and hydrocarbon mixtures produced by hydrorefining or hydrocracking liquid fractions and FT wax produced through a Fischer-Tropsch reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0051">The gas oil composition comprises preferably 20 percent by volume or more of the FT synthetic base oil. Further, the composition comprises more preferably 25 percent by volume or more, more preferably 30 percent by volume or more, more preferably 35 percent by volume or more of the FT synthetic base oil with the objective of lessening the occasion to increase the burden to the environment caused by sulfur components or aromatic components and carrying out more efficiently the adjustment of ignition required for homogenous charge compression ignition combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0052">There is no particular restriction on the characteristics of the FT synthetic base oil as long as the resulting gas oil composition will have the predetermined characteristics However, it is preferable to blend an FT synthetic base oil with a boiling point range of 140 to 380&#xb0; C. in view of easy production of the gas oil composition of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0053">The mixed gas which will be the feedstock of the FT synthetic oil is produced by oxidizing a substance containing carbon using oxygen and/or water and/or carbon dioxide as an oxidizing agent and further if necessary by a shift reaction using water so as to be adjusted in predetermined hydrogen and carbon monoxide concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0054">Substances containing carbon which may be used herein are generally gas components composed of hydrocarbons that are gas in normal temperatures such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and methane gas, petroleum asphalt, biomass, coke, wastes such as building materials and garbage, sludge, heavy crude oils that are difficult to be disposed in the usual manner, and mixed gas produced by exposing unconventional petroleum resources to elevated temperatures. However, in the present invention, there is no particular restriction on the feedstock as long as a mixed gas containing mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0055">The Fischer-Tropsch reaction requires a metal catalyst. It is preferable to use metals in Group 8 of the periodic table, such as cobalt, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, nickel and iron, more preferably metals in Group 8, Period 4, as an active catalyst component. Alternatively, there may be used a mixed metal group containing these metals in suitable amounts. These active metals are generally used in the form of a catalyst produced by supporting them on a support such as alumina, titania and silica-alumina. Alternatively, the use of the forgoing active metals in combination with a second metal can improve the performances of the resulting catalyst. Examples of the second metal include alkali or alkaline earth metals such as sodium, lithium and magnesium, zirconium, hafnium and titanium, which will be used depending on purposes such as increase in conversion rate of carbon monoxide or chain growth probability (a) which is an index of the production amount of wax.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0056">The Fischer-Tropsch reaction is a synthetic method for producing liquid fractions and FT wax using a mixed gas as the feedstock. It is generally preferable to adjust the ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide in the mixed gas in order to carry out the synthetic method efficiently. In general, the molar mix ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide (hydrogen/carbon monoxide) is preferably 1.2 or greater, more preferably 1.5 or greater, more preferably 1.8 or greater. The ratio is also preferably 3 or less, more preferably 2.6 or less, more preferably 2.2 or less.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0057">The reaction temperature at which the Fischer-Tropsch reaction is carried out using the foregoing catalyst is preferably 180&#xb0; C. or higher and 320&#xb0; C. or lower, more preferably 200&#xb0; C. or higher and 300&#xb0; C. or lower. At a reaction temperature of lower than 180&#xb0; C., carbon monoxide hardly reacts, resulting in a tendency that the hydrocarbon yield is reduced. At a reaction temperature of higher than 320&#xb0; C., gas such as methane is increasingly formed, resulting in a reduction in the production efficiency of liquid fractions and FT wax.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0058">There is no particular restriction on the gas hourly space velocity with respect to the catalyst. However, it is preferably 500 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or more and 4000 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or lower, more preferably 1000 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or more and 3000 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or lower. A gas hourly space velocity of less than 500 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>is likely to reduce the production of the liquid fuel while a gas hourly space velocity of more than 400 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>causes a necessity to increase the reaction temperature and increase the amount of gas to be produced, resulting in a reduction in the yield of the intended product.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0059">There is no particular restriction on the reaction pressure (partial pressure of a synthetic gas composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen). However, it is preferably 0.5 MPa or greater and 7 MPa or smaller, more preferably 2 MPa or greater and 4 MPa or smaller. If the reaction pressure is smaller than 0.5 MPa, the yield of liquid fuel would tend to decrease. If the reaction pressure is greater than 7 MPa, it is not economically advantageous because the amount of capital investment in facilities would be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0060">If necessary, liquid fractions and FT wax produced through the above-described FT reaction may be hydrorefined or hydrocracked in any suitable manner so as to be adjusted in distillation characteristics or composition to achieve the purposes of the invention. Hydrorefining or hydrocracking may be selected depending on the purposes and the present invention is not limited in selection to either one or both of them to such an extent that the gas oil composition of the present invention is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0061">Catalysts used for hydrorefining are generally those comprising a hydrogenation active metal supported on a porous support, but the present invention is not limited thereto as long as the same effects are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0062">The porous support is preferably an inorganic oxide. Specific examples include alumina, titania, zirconia, boria, silica, zeolite and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0063">Zeolite is crystalline aluminosilicate, examples of which include faujasite, pentasil and mordenite type zeolites. Preferred are faujasite, beta and mordenite type zeolites and particularly preferred are Y-type and beta-type zeolites. Y-type zeolites are preferably ultra stable.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0064">Preferred for the active metal are those of the following two types (active metal A type and active metal B type).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0065">The active metal A type is at least one type of metal selected from the group consisting of those in Group 8 of the periodic table. It is preferably at least one type selected from the group consisting of Ru, Rh, Ir, Pd and Pt, and is more preferably Pd and/or Pt. The active metal may be a combination of these metals, such as Pt&#x2014;Pd, Pt&#x2014;Rh, Pt&#x2014;Ru, Ir&#x2014;Pd, Ir&#x2014;Rh, Ir&#x2014;Ru, Pt&#x2014;Pd&#x2014;Rh, Pt&#x2014;Rh&#x2014;Ru, Ir&#x2014;Pd&#x2014;Rh, and Ir&#x2014;Rh&#x2014;Ru. A noble metal catalyst formed of these metals can be used after being subjected to a pre-reduction treatment under hydrogen flow. In general, the catalyst is heated at a temperature of 200&#xb0; C. or higher in accordance with predetermined procedures, circulating a gas containing hydrogen so that the active metal on the catalyst is reduced and thus exhibits hydrogenation activity.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0066">The active metal B type contains preferably at least one type of metal selected from the group consisting of those in Groups 6A and 8 of the periodic table, desirously two or more types of metals selected therefrom. Examples of these metals include Co&#x2014;Mo, Ni&#x2014;Mo, Ni&#x2014;Co&#x2014;Mo and Ni&#x2014;W. When a metal sulfide catalyst formed of these metals is used, it must undergo a pre-sulfurization process.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0067">The metal source may be a conventional inorganic salt or complex salt compound. The supporting method may be any supporting method that has been usually used for hydrogenation catalysts, such as impregnation and ion-exchange methods. When a plurality of metals are supported, they may be supported simultaneously using a mixed solution thereof or sequentially using a single solution containing each metal. The metal solution may be an aqueous solution or a solution using an organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0068">The reaction temperature at which hydrorefining is carried out using a catalyst composed of the active metal A type is preferably 180&#xb0; C. or higher and 400&#xb0; C. or lower, more preferably 200&#xb0; C. or higher and 370&#xb0; C. or lower, more preferably 250&#xb0; C. or higher and 350&#xb0; C. or lower, more preferably 280&#xb0; C. or higher and 350&#xb0; C. or lower. A reaction temperature of higher than 370&#xb0; C. is not preferable because the yield of the middle fraction is extremely reduced, resulting from an increase in a side reaction wherein the liquid fraction or FT wax is cracked to a naphtha fraction. A reaction temperature of lower than 270&#xb0; C. is not also preferable because alcohols can not be removed and thus remains in the reaction system.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0069">The reaction temperature at which hydrorefining is carried out using a catalyst composed of the active metal B type is preferably 170&#xb0; C. or higher and 320&#xb0; C. or lower, more preferably 175&#xb0; C. or higher and 300&#xb0; C. or lower, more preferably 180&#xb0; C. or higher and 280&#xb0; C. or lower. A reaction temperature of higher than 320&#xb0; C. is not preferable because the yield of the middle fraction is reduced, resulting from an increase in a side reaction wherein the liquid fraction or FT wax is cracked to a naphtha fraction. A reaction temperature of lower than 170&#xb0; C. is not also preferable because alcohols can not be removed and thus remains in the reaction system.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0070">The hydrogen pressure at which hydrorefining is carried out using a catalyst composed of the active metal A type is preferably 0.5 MPa or greater and 12 MPa or less, more preferably 1.0 MPa or greater and 5.0 MPa or less. Although a higher hydrogen pressure facilitates the hydrogenation reaction, there is generally an optimum point in economical sense.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0071">The hydrogen pressure at which hydrorefining is carried out using a catalyst composed of the active metal B type is preferably 2 MPa or greater and 10 MPa or less, more preferably 2.5 MPa or greater and 8 MPa or less, more preferably 3 MPa or greater and 7 MPa or less. Although a higher hydrogen pressure facilitates the hydrogenation reaction, there is generally an optimum point in economical sense.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0072">The liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) at which hydrorefining is carried out using a catalyst composed of the active metal A type is preferably 0.1 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or greater and 10.0 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or less, more preferably 0.3 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or greater and 3.5 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or less. Although a lower LHSV is advantageous for the reaction, a too low LHSV is not economically preferable because it requires an extremely large reactor volume, leading to an excessive capital investment in facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0073">The liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) at which hydrorefining is carried out using a catalyst composed of the active metal B type is preferably 0.1 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or greater and 2 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or less, more preferably 0.2 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or greater and 1.5 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or less, more preferably 0.3 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or greater and 1.2 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or less. Although a lower LHSV is advantageous for the reaction, a too low LHSV is not economically preferable because it requires an extremely large reactor volume, leading to an excessive capital investment in facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0074">The hydrogen/oil ratio at which hydrorefining is carried out using a catalyst composed of the active metal A type is preferably 50 NL/L or greater and 1000 NL/L or less, more preferably 70 NL/L or greater and 800 NL/L or less. Although a higher hydrogen/oil ratio facilitates the reaction, there is generally an optimum point in economical sense.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0075">The hydrogen/oil ratio at which hydrorefining is carried out using a catalyst composed of the active metal B type is preferably 100 NL/L or greater and 800 NL/L or less, more preferably 120 NL/L or greater and 600 NL/L or less, more preferably 150 NL/L or greater and 500 NL/L or less. Although a higher hydrogen/oil ratio facilitates the reaction, there is generally an optimum point in economical sense.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0076">Catalysts used for hydrocracking are generally those comprising a hydrogenation active metal supported on a support with solid acidic properties, but the present invention is not limited thereto as long as the same effects are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0077">As for the support with solid acidic properties, there are amorphous and crystalline zeolite types. Specific examples include silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia and silica-titania, which are of amorphous type and zeolites of faujasite, beta, MFI and mordenite types, preferably Y type and beta type. The Y type zeolites are preferably those that are ultra stable.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0078">Preferred for the active metal are those of the following two types (active metal A type and active metal B type).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0079">The active metal A type is at least one type of metal mainly selected from the group consisting of those in Groups 6A and 8 of the periodic table. It is preferably at least one type of metal selected from the group consisting of Ni, Co, Mo, Pt, Pd and W. A noble metal catalyst formed of these metals can be used after being subjected to a pre-reduction treatment under hydrogen flow. In general, the catalyst is heated at a temperature of 200&#xb0; C. or higher in accordance with predetermined procedures, circulating a gas containing hydrogen so that the active metal on the catalyst is reduced and thus exhibits hydrogenation activity.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0082">The reaction temperature at which hydrocracking is carried out using a catalyst composed of the active metal type A and active metal type B is preferably 200&#xb0; C. or higher and 450&#xb0; C. or lower, more preferably 250&#xb0; C. or higher and 430&#xb0; C. or lower, more preferably 300&#xb0; C. or higher and 400&#xb0; C. or lower.

The feedstock of the animal- or vegetable-derived processed oil is necessarily an animal or vegetable fat or a component derived therefrom. Examples of the animal or vegetable fat or the component originating therefrom used herein include natural or artificially made or produced animal or vegetable fats and animal or vegetable fat components originating therefrom. Examples of raw materials of the animal fats and animal oils include beef tallow, milk fat (butter), lard, mutton tallow, whale oil, fish oil, and liver oil. Examples of raw materials of the vegetable fats and vegetable oils include the seeds and other parts of coconut, palm tree, olive, safflower, rape (rape blossoms), rice bran, sunflower, cotton seed, corn, soy bean, sesame, and flaxseed.

In general, the hydrocarbon parts of these fatty acids contained in substances existing in nature are mostly of straight chain.

<p id="p-0099" num="0109">The feedstock contains a fraction whose boiling point is preferably 250&#xb0; C. or higher, more preferably a fraction whose boiling point is 300&#xb0; C. or higher, and more preferably a fraction whose boiling point is 360&#xb0; C. or higher. If the feedstock contains no fraction whose boiling point is 230&#xb0; C. or higher, the yield of a liquid product would be decreased due to an increase in gas formed during the production, possibly resulting in an increase in life cycle carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0110">Alternatively, the feedstock of the animal or vegetable-derived processed oil may be a mixture of an animal or vegetable fat and a component derived therefrom, with a petroleum hydrocarbon fraction. In this case, the ratio of the petroleum hydrocarbon fraction is preferably from 10 to 99 percent by volume, more preferably from 30 to 99 percent by volume, and more preferably from 60 to 98 percent by volume, of the total volume of the feedstock. If the ratio is less than the lower limit, there may arise the necessity of facilities for disposal of by-produced water. If the ratio exceeds the upper limit, it is not preferable in view of life cycle carbon dioxide reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0111">Conditions of hydrocracking the feedstock during the hydrotreating are those desirously wherein the hydrogen pressure is from 6 to 20 MPa, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) is from 0.1 to 1.5 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and the hydrogen/oil ratio is from 200 to 2000 NL/L, more desirously wherein the hydrogen pressure is from 8 to 17 MPa, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) is from 0.2 to 1.1 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and the hydrogen/oil ratio is from 300 to 1800 NL/L, more desirously wherein the hydrogen pressure is from 10 to 16 MPa, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) is from 0.3 to 0.9 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and the hydrogen/oil ratio is from 350 to 1600 NL/L. Each of the conditions is a factor exerting an influence on the reaction activity. For example, if the hydrogen pressure and hydrogen/oil ratio are less than the lower limits, the reactivity tends to reduce, and the activity tends to reduce rapidly. If the hydrogen pressure and hydrogen/oil ratio exceed the upper limits, an enormous plant investment for a compressor may be required. A lower liquid hourly space velocity tends to be more advantageous for the reactions. However, if the liquid hourly space velocity is lower than 0.1 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, an enormous plant investment for construction of a reactor with an extremely large volume may be required. If the liquid hourly space velocity exceeds 1.5 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the reaction tends to proceed insufficiently.</p>

The oxygen content can be measured with a conventional elemental analysis device. For example, the oxygen content is measured by converting a sample to CO or further to CO<sub>2 </sub>on platinum carbon and measuring the amount thereof using a thermal conductivity detector.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0143">The bulk modulus of the gas oil composition is necessarily 1250 MPa or greater and 1450 MPa or less. In general, when a high pressure is applied to a compressive fluid, such as gas oil, the fluid has behaviors that it is compressed depending on the surrounding temperature and pressure and the density (volume per volumetric flow) changes. This compressive modulus is defined as the bulk modulus (unit: MPa). When a diesel fuel is injected, the bulk modulus of the fuel fluid changes at a constant rate depending on the surrounding temperature and pressure as well as the physical properties and composition of the fuel. Therefore, for an injection system with injection properties that the injection is carried out under high pressure with a high degree of accuracy, such as electronically controlled fuel injection pumps, it is preferable to use a fuel which is stable in the numerical value of the bulk modulus so as to maintain the injection volume or rate predetermined for the system. Therefore, the bulk modulus of the gas oil composition of the present invention is necessarily 1250 MPa or greater and 1450 MPa or less, preferably 1270 MPa or greater and 1420 MPa or less, more preferably 1300 MPa or greater and 1400 MPa or less.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0144">The bulk modulus is not a matter that can be determined with a single fuel physical property or composition and should be defined as the result of being integrally affected with a plurality of physical properties and composition. It is thus reasonable in the technical view point to consider that the bulk modulus is one of the fuel properties that should be defined, in view of other physical properties and compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0145">Although there has existed no officially established method for measuring the bulk modulus, the brief thereof will be given with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> annexed herewith. A fuel to be measured is filled into a fixed volume container formed from material and having a structure, for which material and structure it is possible to demonstrate that changes in the volume of the container itself, resulting from the surrounding temperature and pressure change is sufficiently smaller than changes in the volume of the fuel resulting from the same change in the surrounding. Thereupon, the container is necessarily filled up only with the fuel to be measured. Into the container is inserted a fixed volume piston formed from material and having a structure, for which material and structure it is possible to demonstrate that changes in the volume of the piston itself resulting from the surrounding temperature and pressure changes are sufficiently smaller than changes in the volume of the fuel, resulting from the same change in the surrounding, so as to change the volume of the container. The fuel to be measured is compressed in conformity with its compressive modulus properties, and as the result, the pressure in the container changes. The pressure is then measured to calculate the bulk modulus.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0146">More detailed description will be given of a method for measuring the bulk modulus of a gas oil composition.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic structural view illustrating an example of an apparatus for measuring the bulk modulus. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a supply valve <b>2</b> is arranged on the upper surface of a fixed-volume container <b>1</b> to be in communication with the inside thereof, and an exhaust valve <b>3</b> is connected to the supply valve <b>2</b> at a certain position thereof. Further, a temperature sensor <b>4</b> and a pressure sensor <b>5</b>, and a piston <b>6</b> are arranged on a side and the bottom of the container <b>1</b>, respectively in communication with the interior thereof. The container <b>1</b> and piston <b>6</b> are each formed from a material and have a structure, with which material and structure the volume changes of the container and piston are sufficiently smaller than the volume change of the fuel when the surrounding temperature and pressure change in predetermined levels.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0148">When the measuring apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is used, a gas oil composition <b>100</b> to be measured is firstly supplied through the supply valve <b>2</b> into the container until the container is filled up with the fuel. Next, the volume in the container is changed with the piston.

Also in an electronically controlled fuel injection pump enabling a high pressure injection, wear on the sliding parts would likely occur. Therefore, with respect to the lubricity, the HFRR wear scar diameter (WS1.4) of the gas oil composition is necessarily 400 &#x3bc;m or smaller, preferably 380 &#x3bc;m or smaller, more preferably 360 &#x3bc;m or smaller.</p>

Among these cold flow improvers, preferred are ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer additives because they can be used for multi-purposes. Since commercially available products referred to as cold flow improvers are often in the form in which the active components contributing to the low-temperature fluidity (active components) are diluted with a suitable solvent. Therefore, the above amount of the cold flow improvers denotes the amount of the active components (active component concentration) when such commercially available products are added to the gas oil compositions of the present invention.</p>

If the content of the cetane number improver is less than 500 mg/L, the cetane number improving effect may not be attained sufficiently, leading to a tendency that PM, aldehydes, and NOx in the exhaust gas from a diesel engine are not reduced sufficiently. There is no particular restriction on the upper limit content of the cetane number improver. However, the upper limit is preferably 1400 mg/L or less, more preferably 1250 mg/L or less, more preferably 1100 mg/L or less, and most preferably 1000 mg/L or less, on the basis of the total mass of the gas oil composition.</p>

Such products in the name of cetane number improver are available in a state wherein the effective component contributing to an improvement in cetane number (i.e., cetane number improver itself) is diluted with a suitable solvent.

Among these, preferred are alkenyl succinimides and reaction products of carboxylic acids and amines. These detergents may be used alone or in combination. When an alkenyl succinimide is used, an alkenyl succinimide having a molecular weight of 1000 to 3000 may be used alone, or an alkenyl succinimide having a molecular weight of 700 to 2000 and an alkenyl succinimide having a molecular weight of 10000 to 20000 may be used in combination. Carboxylic acids constituting reaction products of carboxylic acids and amines may be of one or more types.

Examples of fatty acids having 12 to 24 carbon atoms include, but not limited thereto, linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, and myristic acid. Examples of aromatic carboxylic acids having 7 to 24 carbon atoms include, but not limited thereto, benzoic acid and salicylic acid. Amines constituting reaction products of carboxylic acids and amines may be of one or more types. Typical examples of amines used herein include, but not limited thereto, oleic amines. Various amines may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0247">There is no particular restriction on the amount of the detergent to be blended. However, the amount is preferably 30 mg/L or more, more preferably 60 mg/L or more, and more preferably 80 mg/L or more, on the basis of the total mass of the composition, because the detergent can perform its effect to suppress a fuel injection nozzle from plugging. The effect may not be obtained if the amount is less than 30 mg/L. On the other hand, if the detergent is blended in a too much amount, its effect as balanced with the amount is not obtained. Therefore, the amount of the detergent is preferably 300 mg/L or less and more preferably 180 mg/L or less because the detergent may increase the amounts of NOx, PM and aldehydes in the exhaust gas from a diesel engine. Conventional products in the name of detergent are available in a state wherein the effective component contributing to detergency is diluted with a suitable solvent. In the case where such products are blended with the gas oil compositions of the present invention, the content of the effective component is preferably within the above-described range.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3</heading>
<p id="p-0266" num="0276">Base oils with characteristics set forth in Table 1 were blended to produce gas oil compositions set forth in Table 2 (Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3). FT synthetic base oils 1 to 3 are hydrocarbon mixtures produced by converting natural gas to wax or a middle fraction through FT reaction, followed by hydrotreating. Since the reaction conditions (isomerization degree) vary, the resulting base oils vary in the ratio of the saturated hydrocarbon content. The highly hydrotreated base oil is a hydrocarbon base oil produced by further hydrotreating a gas oil base oil to further reduce the sulfur and aromatic contents. The processed oil derived from an animal or vegetable oil is an oil produced by hydrotreating palm oil (whole component) used as the raw material to remove the foreign substance. The hydrorefined gas oil corresponds to a commercially available gas oil which is used in a summer season. The fuel for high compression ratio is a fuel produced by blending the FT synthetic oils, hydrorefined base oil and highly hydrotreated base oil in suitable amounts, for a high pressure ratio diesel engine. Therefore, this fuel satisfies the requirements for the gas oil compositions of the present invention, other than the mixed ratio of each fraction and cetane number thereof. The compositions of Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were produced by blending these base oils in suitable amounts or using any of the base oils as the whole.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0277">The additives used in these examples are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0278">Lubricity improver: carboxylic acid mixture</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0279">mainly containing linoleic acid; and</p>

<p id="p-0271" num="0281">Table 2 sets forth the blend ratio of the gas oil compositions thus prepared and the 15&#xb0; C. density, 30&#xb0; C. kinematic viscosity, flash point, sulfur content, oxygen content, distillation characteristics, cetane index, cetane number, aromatic content, naphthene compound content, bulk modulus, cloud point, plugging point, pour point, hue, carbon residue content of the 10% distillation residue, insoluble content and peroxide number after an oxidation stability test, HFRR wear scar diameter and water content of each composition.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0282">The gas oil compositions used in Examples 1 to 3 were produced by blending 20 percent by mass or more of the FT synthetic base oils as set forth in Table 2. Further, as apparent from Table 2, gas oil compositions satisfying the characteristics as defined herein were easily produced without fail, in Examples 1 to 3 wherein the FT synthetic base oils were blended within the range defined herein. On the other hand, as apparent from Comparative Examples 1 to 3, where the compositions were prepared not using the foregoing specific base oils and the composition was prepared using the specific base oils which, however, the component ratio of each fraction or the like does not satisfy the definition of the present invention, the gas oil compositions as intended by the present invention were not necessarily produced.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0283">Next, the following various tests were carried out using the gas oil compositions of Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3. All results are set forth in Table 3. As apparent from Table 3, the gas oil compositions of Examples 1 to 3 exhibited excellent results regarding NOx, smoke, fuel consumption and effective ignition delay period during homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion and NOx, smoke, fuel consumption and high-temperature startability during normal combustion, compared with the gas oil compositions of Comparative Examples 1 to 3. Therefore, the gas oil compositions of Examples 1 to 3 are apparently high-quality gas oils that can achieve at a high level both an excellent practical performance under conditions in a summer season and environment friendly properties that can be applied to homogenous charge compression ignition combustion, which performance and properties were difficult to accomplish with the conventional gas oil compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0284">(Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition Combustion Test)</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0285">The test was carried out using an engine for experiment wherein on the basis of a commercially available engine 1 described below, the shape of the pistons of all the cylinders were changed to alter the compression ratio to 16 and the controlling part of the electronic controlled common rail type fuel injection pump are partly altered to make it possible to control the injection timing. The test was carried out under steady conditions (1200 rpm, 25% load equivalent conditions (input calorie between fuels was constant), fuel injection timing: 30&#xb0; C.A before top dead center, intake conditions: constant at normal temperature) to measure NOx, smoke and fuel consumption as well as effective ignition delay period. The effective ignition delay period is the value obtained by deducting the time required till ignition starts from the time required till fuel injection is completed. If the value is positive, it means that almost of all the injected fuel had enough time to be mixed with air, and thus homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion proceeds more effectively. Whereas, if the value is negative, it means that combustion starts before the fuel injection is completed, resulting in combustion which does not undergo sufficient premixing, accompanying extreme smoke generation. The fuel consumption was indicated by the relative value of the result of each composition against Comparative Example 1 which was set to 100 (lower value indicates better result).</p>

<p id="p-0292" num="0302">After the foregoing diesel combustion test was carried out, the temperature of the experiment room was kept at around 35&#xb0; C. After completion of the diesel combustion test, the engines was idled for about 1 minute. Thereafter, the engine was stopped and left for 5 minutes and then restarted. Thereupon, if the fuel enabled the engine to start normally, it is evaluated as &#x201c;Passed&#x201d;. If the engine did not start, took 10 seconds or longer to start, or had defects (hunting, stumble, vehicle speed reduction or engine stop), the fuel is evaluated as &#x201c;Not Passed&#x201d;.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Examples 4 to 6 and Comparative Examples 4 to 6</heading>
<p id="p-0296" num="0306">Base oils with characteristics set forth in Table 4 were blended to produce gas oil compositions set forth in Table 5 (Examples 4 to 6 and Comparative Examples 4 to 6). FT synthetic base oils 4 to 6 are hydrocarbon mixtures produced by converting natural gas to wax or a middle fraction through FT reaction, followed by hydrotreating. Since the reaction conditions (isomerization degree) vary, the resulting base oils vary in the ratio of the saturated hydrocarbon content. The highly hydrotreated base oil is a hydrocarbon base oil produced by further hydrotreating a gas oil base oil to further reduce the sulfur and aromatic contents. The processed oil derived from an animal or vegetable oil is an oil produced by hydrotreating palm oil (whole component) used as the raw material to remove the foreign substance. The hydrorefined gas oil corresponds to a commercially available gas oil which is used in a winter season. The fuel for high compression ratio is a fuel produced by blending the FT synthetic oils, hydrorefined base oil and highly hydrotreated base oil in suitable amounts, for a high pressure ratio diesel engine. Therefore, this fuel satisfies the requirements for the gas oil compositions of the present invention, other than the mixed ratio of each fraction and cetane number thereof. The compositions of Examples 4 to 6 and Comparative Examples 4 to 6 were produced by blending these base oils in suitable amounts or using any of the base oils as the whole.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0307">The additives used in these examples are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0308">Lubricity improver: carboxylic acid mixture</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0309">mainly containing linoleic acid;</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0310">Detergent: alkenyl succinimide mixture</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0311">Cold flow improver: ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer mixture</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0312">Table 5 sets forth the blend ratio of the gas oil compositions thus prepared and the 15&#xb0; C. density, 30&#xb0; C. kinematic viscosity, flash point, sulfur content, oxygen content, distillation characteristics, cetane index, cetane number, aromatic content, naphthene compound content, bulk modulus, cloud point, plugging point, pour point, hue, carbon residue content of the 10% distillation residue, insoluble content and peroxide number after an oxidation stability test, HFRR wear scar diameter and water content of each composition.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0313">The gas oil compositions used in Examples 4 to 6 were produced by blending 20 percent by mass or more of the FT synthetic base oils as set forth in Table 5. Further, as apparent from Table 5, gas oil compositions satisfying the characteristics as defined herein were easily produced without fail, in Examples 4 to 6 wherein the FT synthetic base oils were blended within the range defined herein. On the other hand, as apparent from Comparative Examples 4 to 6, where the compositions were prepared not using the foregoing specific base oils and the composition was prepared using the specific base oils which, however, the component ratio of each fraction or the like does not satisfy the definition of the present invention, the gas oil compositions as intended by the present invention were not necessarily produced.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0314">Next, the following various tests were carried out using the gas oil compositions of Examples 4 to 6 and Comparative Examples 4 to 6. All results are set forth in Table 6. As apparent from Table 6, the gas oil compositions of Examples 4 to 6 exhibited excellent results regarding NOx, smoke, fuel consumption and effective ignition delay period during homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion, and NOx, smoke, fuel consumption and low-temperature startability during normal combustion, compared with the gas oil compositions of Comparative Examples 4 to 6. Therefore, the gas oil compositions of Examples 4 to 6 are apparently high-quality gas oils that can achieve at a high level both an excellent practical performance under conditions in a winter season and environment friendly properties that can be applied to homogenous charge compression ignition combustion, which performance and properties were difficult to accomplish with the conventional gas oil compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0315">(Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition Combustion Test)</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0316">The test was carried out using an engine for experiment wherein on the basis of the above-mentioned commercially available engine 1 described below, the shape of the pistons of all the cylinders were changed to alter the compression ratio to 16 and the controlling part of the electronic controlled common rail type fuel injection pump were partly altered to make it possible to control the injection timing. The test was carried out under steady conditions (1200 rpm, 25% load equivalent conditions (input calorie between fuels was constant), fuel injection timing: 30&#xb0; C.A before top dead center, intake conditions: constant at normal temperature) to measure NOx, smoke and fuel consumption as well as effective ignition delay period. The effective ignition delay period is the value obtained by deducting the time required till ignition starts from the time required till fuel injection is completed. If the value is positive, it means that almost of all the injected fuel had enough time to be mixed with air, and thus homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion proceeds more effectively. Whereas, if the value is negative, it means that combustion starts before the fuel injection is completed, resulting in combustion which does not undergo sufficient premixing, accompanying extreme smoke generation. The fuel consumption was indicated by the relative value of the result of each composition against Comparative Example 4 which was set to 100 (lower value indicates better result).</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0317">The test method concerning engine test was carried out in accordance with Exhibit 29 &#x201c;Technical Standard for 13-Mode Exhaust Emission Test Procedure for Diesel Powered Motor Vehicles&#x201d; supervised by former Ministry of Transport Japan.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0318">(Diesel Combustion Test)</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0319">The commercially available engine 1 with no alternation in compression ratio or injection system was used and operated at 3200 rpm-80% load equivalent conditions (input calorie between fuels was constant) to measure NOx, smoke and fuel consumption. The results of the fuel of Comparative Example 4 was defined as 100, and the results of the other fuels were relatively evaluated by comparison with the results of Comparative Example 4 (smaller values indicate better results).</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0320">(Low-Temperature Startability Test)</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0321">An engine with the same alternation in compression ratio as the above-described commercially available engine 1 was equipped in a vehicle 1 described below. On a chassis dynamometer capable of controlling the environment temperature, each of the gas oil compositions was subjected to a test carried out at room temperature by (1) flashing (washing) the fuel system of a test diesel vehicle with a fuel to be evaluated; (2) draining out the flashing fuel; (3) replacing the main filter with new one; and (4) feeding the fuel tank with the fuel to be evaluated in a specific amount (&#xbd; of the tank volume of the test vehicle). The test was continued by (5) cooling rapidly the environment temperature from room temperature to 0&#xb0; C.; (6) keeping the temperature at 0&#xb0; C. for one hour; (7) cooling gradually at a rate of 1&#xb0; C./h till reaching to the predetermined temperature (&#x2212;110&#xb0; C.); and (8) starting the engine after the temperature was kept at the predetermined temperature for one hour. If the engine did not start even after 10 second cranking was repeated twice at an interval of 30 seconds, the fuel was evaluated as &#x201c;Poor&#x201d; at this moment. If the engine started while 10 second cranking was repeated twice at an interval of 30 seconds, it was idled for 3 minutes and then the vehicle was speeded up to 60 km/h over 15 seconds and driven at the low speed. When defects in operation (hunting, stumble, vehicle speed reduction or engine stop) were observed while the vehicle was speeded up to 60 km/h and driven at that speed for 20 minutes, the gas oil composition was evaluated as &#x201c;Not passed&#x201d; at this moment. If the engine ran until the end without any defect, the gas oil composition was evaluated as &#x201c;Passed&#x201d;.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Examples 7 to 9 and Comparative Examples 7 to 9</heading>
<p id="p-0328" num="0338">Base oils with characteristics set forth in Table 7 were blended to produce gas oil compositions set forth in Table 8 (Examples 7 to 9 and Comparative Examples 7 to 9). FT synthetic base oils 7 to 9 are hydrocarbon mixtures produced by converting natural gas to wax or a middle fraction through FT reaction, followed by hydrotreating. Since the reaction conditions (isomerization degree) vary, the resulting base oils vary in the ratio of the saturated hydrocarbon content. The highly hydrotreated base oil is a hydrocarbon base oil produced by further hydrotreating a gas oil base oil to further reduce the sulfur and aromatic contents. The processed oil derived from an animal or vegetable oil is an oil produced by hydrotreating palm oil (whole component) used as the raw material to remove the foreign substance. The hydrorefined gas oil corresponds to a commercially available gas oil which is used in a winter season. The fuel for high compression ratio is a fuel produced by blending the FT synthetic oils, hydrorefined base oil and highly hydrotreated base oil in suitable amounts, for a high pressure ratio diesel engine. Therefore, this fuel satisfies the requirements for the gas oil compositions of the present invention, other than the mixed ratio of each fraction and cetane number thereof. The compositions of Examples 7 to 9 and Comparative Examples 7 to 9 were produced by blending these base oils in suitable amounts or using any of the base oils as the whole.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0339">The additives used in these examples are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0340">Lubricity improver: carboxylic acid mixture</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0341">mainly containing linoleic acid;</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0342">Detergent: alkenyl succinimide mixture</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0343">Cold flow improver: ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer mixture</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0344">Table 8 sets forth the blend ratio of the gas oil compositions thus prepared and the 15&#xb0; C. density, 30&#xb0; C. kinematic viscosity, flash point, sulfur content, oxygen content, distillation characteristics, cetane index, cetane number, aromatic content, naphthene compound content, bulk modulus, cloud point, plugging point, pour point, hue, carbon residue content of the 10% distillation residue, insoluble content and peroxide number after an oxidation stability test, HFRR wear scar diameter and water content of each composition.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0345">The gas oil compositions used in Examples 7 to 9 were produced by blending 20 percent by mass or more of the FT synthetic base oils as set forth in Table 5. Further, as apparent from Table 8, gas oil compositions satisfying the characteristics as defined herein were easily produced without fail, in Examples 7 to 9 wherein the FT synthetic base oils were blended within the range defined herein. On the other hand, as apparent from Comparative Examples 7 to 9, where the compositions were prepared not using the foregoing specific base oils and the composition was prepared using the specific base oils which, however, the component ratio of each fraction or the like does not satisfy the definition of the present invention, the gas oil compositions as intended by the present invention were not necessarily produced.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0346">Next, the following various tests were carried out using the gas oil compositions of Examples 7 to 9 and Comparative Examples 7 to 9. All results are set forth in Table 9. As apparent from Table 9, the gas oil compositions of Examples 7 to 9 exhibited excellent results regarding NOx, smoke, fuel consumption and effective ignition delay period during homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion, and NOx, smoke, fuel consumption and low-temperature startability during normal combustion, compared with the gas oil compositions of Comparative Examples 7 to 9. Therefore, the gas oil compositions of Examples 7 to 9 were apparently high-quality gas oils that can achieve at a high level both an excellent practical performance under conditions in a winter season and environment friendly properties that can be applied to homogenous charge compression ignition combustion, which performance and properties were difficult to accomplish with the conventional gas oil compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0347">(Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition Combustion Test)</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0348">The test was carried out using an engine for experiment wherein on the basis of the above-mentioned commercially available engine 1 described below, the shape of the pistons of all the cylinders were changed to alter the compression ratio to 16 and the controlling part of the electronic controlled common rail type fuel injection pump are partly altered to make it possible to control the injection timing. The test was carried out under steady conditions (1200 rpm, 25% load equivalent conditions (input calorie between fuels was constant), fuel injection timing: 30&#xb0; C.A before top dead center, intake conditions: constant at normal temperature) to measure NOx, smoke and fuel consumption as well as effective ignition delay period. The effective ignition delay period is the value obtained by deducting the time required till ignition starts from the time required till fuel injection is completed. If the value is positive, it means that almost of all the injected fuel had enough time to be mixed with air, and thus homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion proceeds more effectively. Whereas, if the value is negative, it means that combustion starts before the fuel injection is completed, resulting in combustion which does not undergo sufficient premixing, accompanying extreme smoke generation. The fuel consumption was indicated by the relative value of the result of each composition against Comparative Example 7 which was set to 100 (lower value indicates better result).</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0349">The test concerning engine test was carried out in accordance with Exhibit 29 &#x201c;Technical Standard for 13-Mode Exhaust Emission Test Procedure for Diesel Powered Motor Vehicles&#x201d; supervised by former Ministry of Transport Japan.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0350">(Diesel Combustion Test)</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0351">The commercially available engine 1 with no alternation in compression ratio or injection system was used and operated at 3200 rpm-80% load equivalent conditions (input calorie between fuels was constant) to measure NOx, smoke and fuel consumption. The results of the fuel of Comparative Example 7 was defined as 100, and the results of the other fuels were relatively evaluated by comparison with the results of Comparative Example 7 (smaller values indicate better results).</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0352">(Low-Temperature Startability Test)</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0353">An engine with the same alternation in compression ratio as the above-described commercially available engine 1 was equipped in the above-mentioned vehicle 1 described below. On a chassis dynamometer capable of controlling the environment temperature, each of the gas oil compositions was subjected to a test carried out at room temperature by (1) flashing (washing) the fuel system of a test diesel vehicle with a fuel to be evaluated; (2) draining out the flashing fuel; (3) replacing the main filter with new one; and (4) feeding the fuel tank with the fuel to be evaluated in a specific amount (&#xbd; of the tank volume of the test vehicle). The test was continued by (5) cooling rapidly the environment temperature from room temperature to &#x2212;5&#xb0; C.; (6) keeping the temperature at &#x2212;5&#xb0; C. for one hour; (7) cooling gradually at a rate of 1&#xb0; C./h till reaching to the predetermined temperature (&#x2212;15&#xb0; C.); and (8) starting the engine after the temperature was kept at the predetermined temperature for one hour. If the engine did not start even after 10 second cranking was repeated twice at an interval of 30 seconds, the fuel was evaluated as &#x201c;Not passed&#x201d; at this moment. If the engine started while 10 second cranking was repeated twice at an interval of 30 seconds, it was idled for 3 minutes and then the vehicle was speeded up to 60 km/h over 15 seconds and driven at the low speed. When defects in operation (hunting, stumble, vehicle speed reduction or engine stop) were observed while the vehicle was speeded up to 60 km/h and driven at that speed for 20 minutes, the gas oil composition was evaluated as &#x201c;Not passed&#x201d; at this moment. If the engine ran until the end without any defect, the gas oil composition was evaluated as &#x201c;Passed&#x201d;.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Examples 10 to 12 and Comparative Examples 10 to 12</heading>
<p id="p-0347" num="0357">Base oils with characteristics set forth in Table 10 were blended to produce gas oil compositions set forth in Table 11 (Examples 10 to 12 and Comparative Examples 10 to 12). FT synthetic base oils 10 to 12 are hydrocarbon mixtures produced by converting natural gas to wax or a middle fraction through FT reaction, followed by hydrotreating. Since the reaction conditions (isomerization degree) vary, the resulting base oils vary in the ratio of the saturated hydrocarbon content. The highly hydrotreated base oil is a hydrocarbon base oil produced by further hydrotreating a gas oil base oil to further reduce the sulfur and aromatic contents. The processed oil derived from an animal or vegetable oil is an oil produced by hydrotreating palm oil (whole component) used as the raw material to remove the foreign substance. The hydrorefined gas oil corresponds to a commercially available gas oil which is used in a winter season. The fuel for high compression ratio is a fuel produced by blending the FT synthetic oils, hydrorefined base oil and highly hydrotreated base oil in suitable amounts, for a high pressure ratio diesel engine. Therefore, this fuel satisfies the requirements for the gas oil compositions of the present invention, other than the mixed ratio of each fraction and cetane number thereof. The compositions of Examples 10 to 12 and Comparative Examples 10 to 12 were produced by blending these base oils in suitable amounts or using any of the base oils as the whole.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0358">The additives used in these examples are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0359">Lubricity improver: carboxylic acid mixture</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0360">mainly containing linoleic acid;</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0361">Detergent: alkenyl succinimide mixture</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0362">Cold flow improver: ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer mixture</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0363">Table 11 sets forth the blend ratio of the gas oil compositions thus prepared and the 15&#xb0; C. density, 30&#xb0; C. kinematic viscosity, flash point, sulfur content, oxygen content, distillation characteristics, cetane index, cetane number, aromatic content, naphthene compound content, bulk modulus, cloud point, plugging point, pour point, hue, carbon residue content of the 10% distillation residue, insoluble content and peroxide number after an oxidation stability test, HFRR wear scar diameter and water content of each composition.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0364">The gas oil compositions used in Examples 10 to 12 were produced by blending 20 percent by mass or more of the FT synthetic base oils as set forth in Table 11. Further, as apparent from Table 11, gas oil compositions satisfying the characteristics as defined herein were easily produced without fail, in Examples 10 to 12 wherein the FT synthetic base oils were blended within the range defined in the present invention. On the other hand, as apparent from Comparative Examples 10 to 12, where the compositions were prepared not using the foregoing specific base oils and the composition was prepared using the specific base oils which, however, the component ratio of each fraction or the like does not satisfy the definition of the present invention, the gas oil compositions as intended by the present invention were not necessarily produced.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0365">Next, the following various tests were carried out using the gas oil compositions of Examples 10 to 12 and Comparative Examples 10 to 12. All results are set forth in Table 12. As apparent from Table 12, the gas oil compositions of Examples 10 to 12 exhibited excellent results regarding NOx, smoke, fuel consumption and effective ignition delay period during homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion, and NOx, smoke, fuel consumption and low-temperature startability during normal combustion, compared with the gas oil compositions of Comparative Examples 10 to 12. Therefore, the gas oil compositions of Examples 10 to 12 are apparently high-quality gas oils that can achieve at a high level and the same time an excellent practical performance under conditions in a winter season and environment friendly properties that can be applied to homogenous charge compression ignition combustion, which performance and properties were difficult to accomplish with the conventional gas oil compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0366">(Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition Combustion Test)</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0367">The test was carried out using an engine for experiment wherein on the basis of the above-mentioned commercially available engine 1 described below, the shape of the pistons of all the cylinders were changed to alter the compression ratio to 16 and the controlling part of the electronic controlled common rail type fuel injection pump were partly altered to make it possible to control the injection timing. The test was carried out under steady conditions (1200 rpm, 25% load equivalent conditions (input calorie between fuels was constant), fuel injection timing: 30&#xb0; C.A before top dead center, intake conditions: constant at normal temperature) to measure NOx, smoke and fuel consumption as well as effective ignition delay period. The effective ignition delay period is the value obtained by deducting the time required till ignition starts from the time required till fuel injection is completed. If the value is positive, it means that almost of all the injected fuel had enough time to be mixed with air, and thus homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion proceeds more effectively. Whereas, if the value is negative, it means that combustion starts before the fuel injection is completed, resulting in combustion which does not undergo extreme premixing, accompanying sufficient smoke generation. The fuel consumption was indicated by the relative value of the result of each composition against Comparative Example 7 which was set to 100 (lower value indicates better result).</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0368">The test concerning engine test was carried out in accordance with Exhibit 29 &#x201c;Technical Standard for 13-Mode Exhaust Emission Test Procedure for Diesel Powered Motor Vehicles&#x201d; supervised by former Ministry of Transport Japan.</p>

<p id="p-0360" num="0370">The commercially available engine 1 with no alternation in compression ratio or injection system was used and operated at 3200 rpm-80% load equivalent conditions (input calorie between fuels was constant) to measure NOx, smoke and fuel consumption. The results of the fuel of Comparative Example 10 was defined as 100, and the results of the other fuels were relatively evaluated by comparison with the results of Comparative Example 10 (smaller values indicate better results).</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0371">(Low-Temperature Startability Test)</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0372">An engine with the same alternation in compression ratio as the above-described commercially available engine 1 was equipped in the above-mentioned vehicle 1 described below. On a chassis dynamometer capable of controlling the environment temperature, each of the gas oil compositions was subjected to a test carried out at room temperature by (1) flashing (washing) the fuel system of a test diesel vehicle with a fuel to be evaluated; (2) draining out the flashing fuel; (3) replacing the main filter with new one; and (4) feeding the fuel tank with the fuel to be evaluated in a specific amount (&#xbd; of the tank volume of the test vehicle). The test was continued by (5) cooling rapidly the environment temperature from room temperature to &#x2212;15&#xb0; C.; (6) keeping the temperature at &#x2212;15&#xb0; C. for one hour; (7) cooling gradually at a rate of 1&#xb0; C./h till reaching to the predetermined temperature (&#x2212;25&#xb0; C.); and (8) starting the engine after the temperature was kept at the predetermined temperature for one hour. If the engine did not start even after 10 second cranking was repeated twice at an interval of 30 seconds, the fuel was evaluated as &#x201c;Not passed&#x201d; at this moment. If the engine started while 10 second cranking was repeated twice at an interval of 30 seconds, it was idled for 3 minutes and then the vehicle was speeded up to 60 km/h over 15 seconds and driven at the low speed. When defects in operation (hunting, stumble, vehicle speed reduction or engine stop) were observed while the vehicle was speeded up to 60 km/h and driven at that speed for 20 minutes, the gas oil composition was evaluated as &#x201c;Not passed&#x201d; at this moment. If the engine ran until the end without any defect, the gas oil composition was evaluated as &#x201c;Passed&#x201d;.</p>
