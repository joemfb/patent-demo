<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a crystal growth method, a crystal growth apparatus, a group-III nitride crystal, and a group-III nitride semiconductor device. In particular, the present invention relates to a crystal growth method and a crystal growth apparatus for a group-III nitride crystal, the group-III nitride crystal, and a group-III nitride semiconductor device employing the group-III nitride crystal applicable to a blue-violet light source, an ultraviolet light source (LED or LD) for an optical disk drive, a blue-violet light source for electro-photography printing system, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Now, a InGaAlN-family (group-III nitride) device used as violet through blue through green light sources is produced by a crystal growth process employing an MO-CVD method (organic metal chemical vapor phase growth method), an MBE method (molecular beam crystal growth method), etc. on a sapphire or SiC substrate in most cases. In using sapphire or SiC as a substrate, crystal defect caused due to a large expansivity difference and/or lattice constant difference from a group-III nitride may occur frequently. By this reason, there is a problem that the device characteristic may become worth, it may be difficult to lengthen the life of the light-emission device, or the electric power consumption may become larger.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, since a sapphire substrate has an insulating property, drawing of an electrode from the substrate like in another conventional light-emission device is impossible, and therefore, drawing the electrode from the nitride semiconductor surface on which crystal was grown is needed. Consequently, the device area may have to be enlarged, and, thereby, the costs may increase. Moreover, chip separation by cleavage is difficult for a group-III nitride semiconductor device produced on a sapphire substrate, and it is not easy to obtain a resonator end surface needed for a laser diode (LD) by cleavage, either. By this reason, a resonator end surface formation according to dry etching, or, after grinding a sapphire substrate to the thickness of 100 micrometers or less, a resonator end surface formation made in a way near cleavage, should be performed. Also in such a case, it is impossible to perform formation of a resonator end surface and chip separation easily by a single process like for another conventional LD, and, also, complication in process, and, thereby, cost increase may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve these problems, it has been proposed to reduce the crystal defects by employing a selective lateral growth method and/or another technique for forming a group-III nitride semiconductor film on a sapphire substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, a document &#x2018;Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 36 (1967), Part 2, No. 12A, pages L1568-1571&#x2019; (referred to as a first prior art, hereinafter) discloses a laser diode (LD) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This configuration is produced as follows: After growing up a GaN low-temperature buffer layer <b>2</b> and a GaN layer <b>3</b>, one by one, on a sapphire substrate <b>1</b> by an MO-VPE (organometallic vapor phase epitaxy) apparatus, a SiO<sub>2 </sub>mask <b>4</b> for selective growth is formed. This SiO<sub>2 </sub>mask <b>4</b> is formed through photo lithography and etching process, after depositing a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film by another CVD (chemistry vapor phase deposition) apparatus. Next, on this SiO<sub>2 </sub>mask <b>4</b>, again, a GaN film <b>3</b>&#x2032; is grown up to a thickness of 20 micrometers by the MO-VPE apparatus, and, thereby, GaN grows laterally selectively, and, as a result, the crystal defects are reduced as compared with the case where the selective lateral growth is not applied. Furthermore, prolonging of the crystal defect toward an activity layer <b>6</b> is prevented by provision of a modulation doped strained-layer superlattice layer (MD-SLS) <b>5</b> formed thereon. Consequently, as compared with the case where the selective lateral growth and modulation doped strained-layer superlattice layer are not used, it becomes possible to lengthen the device life.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the case of this first prior art, although it becomes possible to reduce the crystal defects as compared with the case where the selective lateral growth of a GaN film is not carried out on a sapphire substrate, the above-mentioned problems concerning the insulating property and cleavage by using a sapphire substrate still remain. Furthermore, as the SiO<sub>2 </sub>mask formation process is added, the crystal growth by the MO-VPE apparatus is applied twice, and, thereby, a problem that a process is complicated newly arises.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As another method, for example, a document &#x2018;Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 73, No. 6, pages 832-834 (1998)&#x2019; (referred to as a second prior art, hereinafter) discloses application of a GaN thick film substrate. By this second prior art, a GaN substrate is produced, by growing up a 200-micrometer GaN thick film by an H-VPE (hydride vapor phase growth) apparatus after 20-micrometer selective lateral growth according to the above-mentioned first prior art, and, then, grinding the GaN substrate thus having grown to be the thick film from the side of the sapphire substrate so that it may have the thickness of 150 micrometers. Then, the MO-VPE apparatus is used on this GaN substrate, crystal growth processes required for an LD device are performed, one by one, and, thus, the LD device is produced. Consequently, it becomes possible to solve the above-mentioned problems concerning the insulating property and cleavage by using the sapphire substrate in addition to solving the problem concerning the crystal defects.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A similar method is disclosed by Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 11-4048 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a device configuration according to this method.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, the process is more complicated in the second prior art, and, requires higher costs, in comparison to the first prior art. Moreover, in growing the no less than 200 micrometer GaN thick film by the method of the second prior art, a stress occurring due to a lattice constant difference and an expansivity difference from the sapphire of the substrate becomes larger, and a problem that the curvature and the crack of the substrate may newly occur. Moreover, even by performing such a complicated process, the crystal defect density can be reduced to only on the order of 10<sup>6</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, it is not possible to obtain a practical semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to avoid this problem, setting to 1 mm or more thickness of an original substrate (sapphire and spinel are the most desirable materials as the substrate) from which a thick film grows is proposed by Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 10-256662. According thereto, no curvature nor crack arise in the substrate even when the GaN film grows in 200 micrometers of thickness by applying this substrate having the thickness of 1 mm or more. However, a substrate thick in this way has a high cost of the substrate itself, and it is necessary to spend much time on polish thereof, and leads to the further cost rise of the polish process. That is, as compared with the case where a thin substrate is used, the cost becomes higher by using the thick substrate. Moreover, although no curvature nor crack arise in the substrate after growing up the thick GaN film in using the thick substrate, curvature and/or crack may occur as stress relief occurs during the process of polish. By this reason, even when the thick substrate is used, the GaN substrate having a high crystal quality and having such a large area that it can be practically used for an ordinary semiconductor device manufacturing process cannot be easily produced.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A document &#x2018;Journal of Crystal Growth, Vol. 189/190, pages. 153-158 (1998)&#x2019; (referred to as a third prior art, hereinafter) discloses that a bulk crystal of GaN is made grow up, and it is used as a homoepitaxial substrate. According to this technique, under the high temperature in the range between 1400 and 1700&#xb0; C., and under the very high nitrogen pressure of 10 kilobars, crystal growth of the GaN is performed from a Ga liquid. In this case, it becomes possible to grow up a group-III nitride semiconductor film required for a device by using this GaN substrate. Therefore, it is possible to provide the GaN substrate without needing a process complicate like in the above-described first and second prior arts.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, by this third prior art, crystal growth in high temperature and high pressure is needed, and, thus, there is a problem that a reaction vessel which can resist these conditions should be very expensive. In addition, even when such a growth method is employed, the size of the crystal obtained has the problem of being too small, i.e., at most on the order of 1 cm, and, thus, it is too small to put it in practical use of semiconductor device manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The GaN crystal growth method using Na which is an alkaline metal as a flux is proposed by a document &#x2018;Chemistry of Materials, Vol. 9 (1977), pages 413-416&#x2019; (referred to as a fourth prior art, hereinafter) as a technique of solving the problem of GaN crystal growth in the above-mentioned high temperature and high pressure. According to this technique, sealing sodium azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>) and Ga metal used as a flux and a material into a reaction vessel made from stainless steel (vessel inner dimension: diameter=7.5 mm and length=100 mm) in nitrogen atmosphere, and the reaction vessel is maintained in the temperature in the range between 600 and 800&#xb0; C. for 24 to 100 hours to grow up a GaN crystal. In the case of this fourth prior art, crystal growth at the comparatively low temperature in the range between 600 and 800&#xb0; C. can be achieved, and, also, the require pressure inside the vessel should be only on the order of 100 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is comparatively lower than the case of the third prior art. However, in this fourth prior art, the size of the crystal obtained is small as less than 1 mm which is too small to be put into practical use in semiconductor device manufacture, like in the case of the third prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Therefore, the applicant of the present application has proposed a method of enlarging a group-III nitride crystal. However, in the method, nucleus generation initiates of the crystal growth is natural nucleus generation, and, thus, a large number of nucleus are undesirably generated. In order to control this nucleus generation, the applicant has proposed to utilize a seed crystal in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/590,063, filed on Jun. 8, 2000, by Seiji Sarayama et al. (the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference). However, there is a problem that a required crystal growth apparatus becomes complicated. Therefore, it has been demanded to realize a method for effectively controlling nucleus generation, while achieving a simple apparatus configuration of a conventional flux method, in order to solve this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2000-327495 discloses a fifth prior art combining the above-mentioned fourth prior art and an epitaxial method utilizing a substrate. In this method, a substrate on which GaN or AlN is grown previously is used, and, thereon, a GaN film according to the fourth prior art is grown. However, in this method, as it is basically the epitaxial method, the problem of crystal defects occurring in the above-mentioned first and second prior arts cannot be solved. Further, as the GaN film or AlN film should be grown on the substrate previously, the process becomes complicated, and, thereby, the costs increase.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, recently, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications Nos. 2000-12900 and 2000-22212 disclose a sixth prior art in which a GaAs substrate is used and a GaN thick-film substrate is produced. In this method, a GaN film having a thickness in a range between 70 &#x3bc;m and 1 mm is selectively grown on a GaAs substrate by using an SiO<sub>2 </sub>film or SiN film as a mask as in the above-mentioned first prior art, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3C</figref>. The crystal growth there is performed by the H-VPE apparatus. Then, the GaAs substrate is etched and thus removed by using aqua regia. Thus, the GaN self-standing substrate is produced, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. By using this GaN-self standing substrate, a GaN crystal having a thickness of several tens of millimeters is grown by vapor phase epitaxy by the H-VPE apparatus again, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Then, this GaN crystal of several tens millimeters is cut into wafer shapes by a slicer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Thus, GaN wafers are produced, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">An object of the present invention is to achieve a group-III nitride crystal having a sufficient size, requiring low costs, and having a high quality, such that a semiconductor device, such as a high-efficient light emitting diode or LD can be produced therefrom, without complicating the process which is the problem in the above-mentioned first or second prior art, without using an expensive reaction vessel which is the problem in the third prior art, and without provision of insufficient size of the crystal which is the problem in the third and fourth prior arts, and, also, solving the above-mentioned problems in the fifth and sixth prior arts, and a crystal growth method and a crystal growth apparatus by which such a group-III nitride crystal can be manufactured, and a high-performance group-III nitride semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">A group-III nitride crystal growth method according to the present invention includes the steps of:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0027">a) preparing a mixed molten liquid of an alkaline material and a substance at least containing a group-III metal;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0028">b) causing growth of a group-III nitride crystal from the mixed molten liquid prepared in said step a) and a substance at least containing nitrogen; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0029">c) creating a state in which nitrogen can be easily introduced into the mixed molten liquid in said step b) prepared by said step a).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0030">In order to create the state in which nitrogen can be easily introduced into the mixed molten liquid, the surface of the mixed molten liquid should be avoided from being completely covered by a solid matter of polycrystalline or amorphous group-III nitride. For this purpose, the purities of the alkaline metal, the substance containing the group-III metal and the substance containing nitrogen applied are ensured sufficiently high. Further, for this purpose, it is also important to apply a material having a high purity as a portion of a mixed molten liquid container/reaction vessel contacting the mixed molten liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">According to another aspect of the present invention, a device enabling observation of the inside of the reacting vessel in which group-III nitride crystal growth occurs is provided. Thereby, it is possible to observe the state of crystal growth, and, thus, it is possible to finish the operation performed for the crystal growth in an appropriate timing after confirming completion of the crystal growth, and, then, take out the thus-yielded crystals at an appropriate timing. Accordingly, it is possible to perform crystal growth operation efficiently. In this regard, it is preferable to provide a device of avoiding a problem of transparency loss on the observation device by means of, for example, supplying a nitrogen gas onto the observation device so as to avoid the mist or the like of alkaline metal from staying calm in the vicinity of the observation device, or by means of previously coating onto the inner surface of the observation device the group-III nitride material.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0032">According to another aspect of the present invention, a plurality of crystal growth zones are prepared, alkaline metal is transported therebetween at appropriate timing, and, then, crystal growth is made to occur in each zone to which the alkaline metal is thus transported, in sequence. Accordingly, it is possible to efficiently use the alkaline metal material. Furthermore, as the alkaline metal is transported in gas phase, the purity thereof can be improved by the function of distillation. Thereby, it is possible to yield high-purity group-III nitride crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0033">According to another aspect of the present invention, a material container holding the group-III metal material is provided separate of the mixed molten liquid container, outside of the reaction vessel. Then, a device is provided to continuously and stably feed the group-III metal material to the mixed molten liquid container inside of the reaction vessel. Accordingly, it is possible to achieve crystal growth in a condition in which the ratio of the group-III metal material in the mixed molten liquid container is fixed by appropriately controlling the material feeding rate so that the group-III metal material consumed by the crystal growth reaction be properly supplemented. Thereby, it is possible to yield low-defect-density, i.e., high-quality, group-III nitride crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034">As the above-mentioned device for stably and continuously feeding the group-III metal material, a device of communication system for providing communication between the reaction vessel and material container may be provided such that the group-III metal material in liquid phase can be fed automatically by gravity. In this case, it is preferable to provide a device of enabling observation of the remaining amount of the material in the material container, and also, to provide a mechanism of controlling the height of the material container with respect to the mixed molten liquid container. Then, the height of the material container is appropriately controlled so that level difference between the surface of the mixed molten liquid in the mixed molten liquid container and the surface of the group-III metal material in the material container is appropriately controlled. Thereby, it is possible to control the material feeding rate to be constant.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">Alternatively, a pump device may be provided so as to forcibly feed the group-III metal material to the mixed molten liquid container constantly and stably. This device may employ a reciprocating rod member which performs reciprocation action together with check valves. Then, as a room pressure is increased and decreased alternately, the drawing check valve and feeding check valve accordingly operate alternately so that the material is fed properly through this room.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">Further alternatively, decomposing of group-III nitride is utilized. That is, first, group-III nitride fine crystals are yielded, then, these powder crystals are used as materials for producing group-III metal material and/or nitrogen material obtained through decomposition. Specifically, by appropriately controlling the temperatures of a first container preparing the material group-III nitride fine crystals and a second container yielding final-product large-sized group-III nitride crystals, the material fine crystals are first yielded in the first container, the material is then fed into the second container previously holding the alkaline metal, and, then, crystal growth of final-product large-sized crystals occurs in the second container. Thereby, material feeding can be made easily and positively, merely by appropriately controlling the temperatures of the two containers, and, thus, it is possible to yield high-quality group-III nitride crystals at low cost.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a group-III nitride growth apparatus in a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in a reaction vessel <b>101</b>, a mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> holding a mixed molten liquid containing an alkaline metal (for example, Na) and a substance at least containing group-III metal (for example, Ga) is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0070">The substance including the alkaline metal and group-III metal may be supplied from the outside, or may exist in the reaction vessel <b>101</b> from the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0071">The reaction vessel <b>101</b> is formed by stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0072">Moreover, a nitrogen supply pipe <b>104</b> for supplying substance at least containing nitrogen (for example, nitrogen gas, ammonia gas, or sodium azide) to a space <b>108</b> in the reaction vessel <b>101</b> is provided in the reaction vessel <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0073">In the present invention, the &#x2018;nitrogen&#x2019; means nitrogen molecules, nitrogen molecules or nitrogen atoms generated from a compound containing nitrogen, or atom groups or molecule groups containing nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0074">A pressure adjustment mechanism <b>105</b> is provided in order to adjust the pressure of nitrogen gas in the nitrogen supply pipe <b>104</b>. This pressure adjustment mechanism <b>105</b> includes a pressure sensor, a pressure adjustment valve, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0075">Moreover, a heating device <b>106</b> for controlling the temperature in the inside of the reaction vessel <b>101</b> to the temperature at which crystal growth of group-III nitride (for example GaN can occur is provided in the reaction vessel <b>101</b>. That is, by means of a temperature control function of the heating device <b>106</b>, control operation such as raising the temperature in the inside of reaction vessel <b>101</b> to the temperature at which the crystal growth can occur, lowering to the temperature at which the crystal growth stops, and keeping these states for arbitrary time intervals, respectively, can be achieved. For the details, please see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/981,848, filed on Oct. 16, 2001 by the same applicant of the present application. The entire contents of this application Ser. No. 09/981,848 are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0076">The crystal growth of group-III nitride can be started to occur as a result of the temperature and effective nitrogen partial pressure in the reaction vessel <b>101</b> being set into conditions such that the group-III nitride crystal can grow.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0077">By the above-described group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus and group-III nitride growth method, a mixed molten liquid of an alkaline metal and a substance at least containing a group-III metal is formed in a predetermined container, and, from the mixed molten liquid and a substance containing nitrogen, crystal growth of group-III nitride containing the group-III metal and nitrogen is made to occur. Accordingly, no complicated processes as in the above-mentioned first or second prior art are needed, but high-quality group-III nitride crystal can be obtained at low costs.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0078">Furthermore, as crystal growth can be made to occur by easy requirements such as the growth temperature as low as 1000 degrees C. or less, and also, the required pressure as low as less than 100 atmospheres, it is not necessary to employ a reaction vessel which should bear super high pressure and super high temperature and thus costing much as in the above-mentioned third prior art. Consequently, it is possible to produce group-III nitride crystals at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0079">In the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when there are many impurities in the substance containing the alkaline metal and/or the group-III metal, the substance containing nitrogen, or the predetermined container containing the mixed molten liquid, these impurities may become nucleuses or they may cause a catalyst-action, and thereby, a solid matter may be produced therefrom so as to cover the surface of the mixed molten liquid including the alkaline metal and substance at least containing the group-III metal. If the surface of the mixed molten liquid is much covered by this solid matter, dissolution of the nitrogen into the mixed molten liquid is obstructed after that, and, thus, the crystal growth of group-III nitride crystal may not progress well.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">The inventors of the present invention found out that the cause of generation of such a solid matter covering the surface of the mixed molten is mainly of the group-III nitride (the solid matter being of the group-III nitride polycrystalline or amorphous), which is generated from impurities contained in the alkaline metal, impurities contained in the substance at least containing group-III metal, impurities contained in the substance containing nitrogen, and/or impurities in the container containing the mixed molten (impurities on the surface of the container or those coming from the inside of the container).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">According to the present invention, based on the above-mentioned fact thus found out, growth of group-III nitrogen crystals is made to occur in a condition in which nitrogen can be positively introduced into the surface of the mixed molten liquid during a process of group-III nitride crystal growth made from the mixed molten liquid prepared from alkaline metal and a substance at least containing a group-III metal, and a substance containing nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0082">In detail, an object of the present invention is to effectively prevent the entire surface of the mixed molten liquid from being covered by a solid matter generated from impurities contained in the alkaline metal, impurities contained in the substance at least containing group-III metal, impurities contained in the substance containing nitrogen, and/or impurities in the container containing the mixed molten (impurities on the surface of the container or those coming from the inside of the container).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0083">For this purpose, according to the present invention, the purity of the alkaline metal, the purity of the substance at least containing group-III metal, and/or the purity of the substance containing nitrogen are made to be increased into those required for preventing the whole surface of the mixed molten liquid from being covered by polycrystalline or amorphous group-III nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0084">Specifically, according to an experiment made by the inventors of the present invention, when the purity of the alkaline metal is less than 99%, a solid matter covers the surface of the mixed molten liquid. On the other hand, an area of the surface of the mixed molten liquid covered by the solid matter can be effectively reduced when the purity of the alkaline metal is 99% or more.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0085">Furthermore, according to the experiment, when the purity of the alkaline metal is 99.9% or more, an area of the surface of the mixed molten liquid which the solid matter covers can be further effectively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0086">Furthermore, when the purity of the alkaline metal became 99.95% or more, there is almost no solid matter covering the surface of the mixed molten liquid. Generally speaking, the highest purity of generally available alkaline metal is 99.95%.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0087">Moreover, preferably, the purity of the substance containing group-III metal, and the purity of the substance containing nitrogen should also be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0088">Furthermore, preferably, the predetermined container containing the mixed molten liquid to be used should be made of a material having a higher purity.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0089">For example, the predetermined container may be made of BN (boron nitride). Alternatively, the predetermined container may be made of AlN (aluminum nitride). Alternatively, the predetermined container may be made of pyrolytic BN. Moreover, since the pyrolytic BN has impurities less than those of BN, the pyrolytic BN is further preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0090">The pyrolytic BN is also called &#x2018;PBN&#x2019; (Pyrolytic Boron Nitride), and is usually combined through CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) of boron chloride and ammonia. The PBN has fewer impurities as compared with BN produced by sintering (Hot Press) which has generally spread, and PBN has a high purity. That is, generally speaking, BN in form of sintered material contains some percentage of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CaO, SiO<sub>2 </sub>and so forth. In contrast thereto, the PBN contains a content of those impurities smaller than that of BN.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0091">According to the experiment, a tendency of the solid matter covering the surface of the mixed molten liquid can be reduced effectively more in a case of employing the PBN container than in a case of employing the BN container according to the same conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0092">Thus, according to the present invention, by reducing the impurities contained in the alkaline metal, the impurities contained in the substance which contains group-III metal at least, the impurities contained in the substance containing nitrogen and/or the impurities of the predetermined container (impurities which come out from the surface of the predetermined container, or the inside of the predetermined container) which contains the mixed molten liquid, it is possible to prevent the whole surface of the mixed molten liquid from being covered by the solid matter. Thereby, continuous dissolution of the nitrogen into the mixed molten liquid can be achieved, and thus, continuous crystal growth of group-III nitride crystal can be achieved. Furthermore, consumption in the mixed molten liquid on the surface of the mixed molten liquid can be lessened because the group-III metal which may be used to generate the solid matter decreases, and thus, it becomes possible to increase the amount of the group-III metal fed to grow the group-III nitride crystal in the mixed molten liquid. Thereby, it is possible to achieve crystal growth of the group-III nitride crystal in a desired sufficient size.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0093">A first embodiment of the present invention will now be described. According to the first embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> which contains Ga as the group-III metal and Na as the alkaline metal is held by the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0094">In the first embodiment, Ga as the group-III metal has 99.9999% of purity, and Na as the alkaline metal has 99% of purity.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0095">Moreover, in the first embodiment, the purity of a nitrogen gas supplied via a nitrogen supply pipe <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is 99.999%. The material of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> is BN (boron nitride) in a form of sintered material. When carrying out crystal growth of the group-III nitride in this group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus, the following process is executed: The pressure of the nitrogen gas in the reaction vessel <b>101</b> is made into 50 atmospheres, and the temperature in the reaction vessel <b>101</b> is increased into the temperature of 750 degrees C. by which the crystal growth starts. Then, these growth conditions are maintained, and, thereby, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the GaN crystal <b>109</b>, which is the group-III nitride grows in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0096">Although the surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> is covered by the solid matter <b>110</b>, holes <b>111</b> exist at some places of this solid matter <b>110</b>, at each of which the solid matter <b>110</b> does not cover the surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b>. Thereby, the nitrogen can dissolve into the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> through the holes <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0097">The degree of the solid matter <b>110</b> covering the surface of mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> depends on the purity of Na, the purity of Ga, the purity of nitrogen gas, and the quality of the material of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b>. Among those, the degree of the solid matter <b>110</b> covering the surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> depends on the purity of Na by the largest percentage according to the experiment. Moreover, according to an analysis, it has been found that the majority of the solid matter <b>110</b> covering the surface of mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> is polycrystalline GaN or amorphous GaN.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0098">As described above, according to the first embodiment, the purity of Na is 99%, the purity of Ga is 99.9999%, the purity of nitrogen gas is 99.999% and the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> is made of BN in a form of sintered material, and, thereby, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the solid matter <b>110</b> formed on the surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> has the holes <b>111</b> therein. Thus, the nitrogen dissolves into the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> through the holes <b>111</b>, the crystal growth of the single-crystal GaN <b>109</b> as the group-III nitride can be made well in the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0099">A second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As in the above-described first embodiment, the second embodiment uses the same group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, the purity of Ga as the group-III metal used is 99.9999%, the purity of nitrogen gas used is 99.9999%, and the quality of the material of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> used is BN in a form of sintered material. The growth conditions, such as the temperature, pressure and so forth are the same as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0100">Differently from the first embodiment, the purity of Na as the alkaline metal 99.9% according to the second embodiment of the present invention, while, according to the first embodiment, Na as the alkaline metal has 99% of purity. According to the second embodiment, the state in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> becomes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0101">That is, as the nitrogen gas pressure and temperature are set as in the first embodiment, and the growth conditions are maintained, crystal growth of the GaN single crystal <b>109</b> which is the group-III nitride is performed in the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b>, while, as to the surface of mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b>, approximately half the entire surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> is covered by the solid matter <b>110</b> according to the second embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Specifically, according to particular cases, the rates of the area covered by this solid matter <b>110</b> differ. However, in any case, a larger area is left on the surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> not having the solid matter <b>110</b> than in the case of the first embodiment in which merely holes are left not having the solid matter <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0102">The nitrogen dissolves into the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> through the area <b>111</b> having no solid matter <b>110</b> on the surface of this mixed molten liquid <b>103</b>, and crystal growth of the Ga&#x2014;N crystal <b>109</b> is made to proceed. According to the second embodiment, it becomes possible to grow up a larger GaN single crystal <b>109</b> as the area <b>111</b> having no solid matter <b>110</b> is wider on the surface of this mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> as compared with the first embodiment. Namely, as generation of the solid matter <b>110</b> produced mainly from polycrystalline or amorphous GaN is reduced, the GaN contained in the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> contributes to the growth of the desired GaN single crystal <b>109</b> more efficiently. Furthermore, generation of many nucleuses can be prevented from growing equally, but the nitrogen is preferentially taken in by a single larger nucleus, and growth of the large GaN single crystal is attained, as the dissolution rate of the nitrogen is thus higher.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0103">Thus, according to the second embodiment, the solid matter <b>110</b> which covers the surface of mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> decreases by raising the purity of Na rather into 99.9% in comparison to the first embodiment. Thereby, it becomes possible to carry out crystal growth for a larger GaN single crystal <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0104">A third embodiment of the present invention will now be described. According to the third embodiment, crystal growth is performed by the basically same method as in the first and second embodiments described above using the same group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0105">According to the third embodiment, the purity of Ga as the group-III metal is 99.9999%, the purity of nitrogen gas is 99.9999%, and the material of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> is BN in a form of sintered material. The growth conditions, such as the temperature and pressure, are the same as those in the first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0106">Differently from the first and second embodiments, the purity of Na as the alkaline metal is made 99.95% according to the third embodiment. In this case, the state in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> becomes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0107">That is, the nitrogen gas pressure and temperature are set as in the first and second embodiments, the growth conditions are maintained. Then, growth of the GaN single crystal <b>109</b> which is the group-III nitride is performed in the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b>. However, according to the third embodiment, it is only dotted parts of the solid matter <b>110</b> on the surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b>. There are many rates of total area of the solid matter <b>110</b> covering the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b>. However, it is maximum approximately 10%. Accordingly, the areas where the solid matter <b>110</b> covers according to the first embodiment approximately corresponds to the areas having no solid matter <b>110</b> according to the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0108">The nitrogen dissolves better into the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> through the areas <b>111</b> having no solid matter <b>110</b> on the surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b>, and crystal growth of the GaN crystal <b>109</b> is made to proceed better. According to the third embodiment, it becomes possible to grow up a further larger GaN single crystal <b>109</b> because there are still more areas <b>111</b> having no solid matter <b>110</b> on the surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> than in the first and second embodiments. Namely, generation of polycrystalline or amorphous GaN forming the solid matter <b>110</b> is effectively reduced, and thereby, Ga in the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> contributes to growth of the desired GaN single crystal <b>109</b> more efficiently. Furthermore, generation of many nucleuses having equal sizes is prevented, but the nitrogen is preferentially taken in by a single larger nucleus, and growth of the larger GaN single crystal is attained because the dissolution rate of the nitrogen is further larger.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0109">Thus, according to the third embodiment, the solid matter <b>110</b> which covers the surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> is reduced by raising the purity of Na into 99.95%, higher than in the first and second embodiments, and it becomes possible to carry out crystal growth for a further lager GaN single crystal <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0110">A fourth embodiment of the present invention will now be described. Also in the fourth embodiment, crystal growth is performed by basically the same method as in the first through third embodiments using the same group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0111">The purity of Ga as the group-III metal used is 99.9999%, and the purity of nitrogen gas used is 99.9999%, and also, the growth conditions such as the temperature, pressure, and so forth are the same as the first through third embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0112">Different from the first through third embodiments, the purity of Na as the alkaline metal is 99.95% or more, and also, different from the first through third embodiments, the material of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> is made by pyrolytic BN according to the fourth embodiment. In this case, the state in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> becomes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0113">That is, also in the fourth embodiment, the nitrogen gas pressure and temperature in the reaction vessel <b>101</b> are set as in the first through third embodiments, and the growth conditions are maintained. Then, growth of the GaN single crystal <b>109</b> which is the group-III nitride is performed in the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b>, the solid matter <b>110</b> which exists in the first through third embodiments does not exist on the surface of mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b>. That is, according to the fourth embodiment, there is nothing that interrupts dissolution of the nitride into the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b>. Therefore, it becomes possible to that crystal growth of the GaN crystal <b>109</b> proceeds more smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0114">Thus, according to the fourth embodiment, it becomes possible to grow up a larger GaN single crystal <b>109</b> because there is no solid matter <b>110</b>. That is, contribution of Ga in mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> to the growth of the desired GaN single crystal <b>109</b> can be made more efficiently because there is no generation of the solid matter <b>110</b> otherwise by which the polycrystalline or amorphous GaN would form the solid matter <b>110</b>. Furthermore, generation of many nucleuses having uniform sizes is prevented, but the nitrogen is preferentially taken in by a single larger nucleus, and growth of the larger GaN single crystal is attained, because the dissolution rate of nitrogen is larger.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0115">Thus, according to the fourth embodiment, occurrence of the solid matter <b>110</b> which covers the surface of the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> is avoided by raising the purity of Na into 99.95% or more, in comparison to the first through third embodiments, and, also, making the material of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> of pyrolytic BN different from the first through third embodiments. Thereby, it becomes possible to carry out crystal growth for a further lager GaN single crystal <b>109</b>. Moreover, as pyrolytic BN is used, and also, the Na purity is high, the impurities contained in mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> can be made effectively reduced, and thus, the crystal quality of the GaN single crystal <b>109</b> obtained also can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0116">Although Na is used as the alkaline metal in the above-descried embodiments, it is also possible to use another alkaline metal, such as K (potassium). Moreover, although Ga is used in the above-described embodiments as the substance which contains group-III metal at least, it is also possible to use a GaNa alloy or another group-III metal as Al or In. Moreover, in above-mentioned embodiments, as the substance which contains nitrogen at least, nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) is used. However, ammonia gas, sodium azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>), etc. can also be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0117">Moreover, although BN is used as the material of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> in the first through third embodiments, AlN can also be used for the same purpose instead of BN. However, as the material of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b>, BN is better than AlN. Moreover, as the material of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b>, pyrolytic BN is further better than BN as in the fourth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0118">In other words, the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus according to any of the first through fourth embodiments of the present invention has at least the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> holding the mixed molten liquid of an alkaline metal and a substance which contains a group-III metal at least, the reaction vessel <b>101</b> in which the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> is provided, and the nitrogen introduction mechanism (<b>104</b>,<b>105</b>) for introducing the substance which contains nitrogen at least into the reaction vessel <b>101</b>. In particular, a portion of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> where the above-mentioned mixed molten liquid touches the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> should have a sufficient purity with few impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0119">Thus, since the portion where the mixed molten liquid touches the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> has a sufficient purity with few impurities, as the rate of dissolution of impurities into the mixed molten liquid can be reduced thereby, it is possible to prevent the whole surface of mixed molten liquid from being covered by the solid matter, continuous dissolution of the nitrogen into the mixed molten liquid can be achieved thereby, and thus crystal growth of group-III nitride crystal can be made to continue, according to the first through fourth embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0120">Furthermore, in the mixed molten liquid surface, consumption of group-III metal can be lessened because the group-III metal which forms the solid matter decreases, and it becomes possible to supply a much amount of the group-III metal to the group-III nitride crystal in the mixed molten liquid. Thus, it becomes possible to cause the crystal growth greatly to produce a desired size of the group-III nitride crystal. Moreover, the impurities contained in the mixed molten liquid decrease and the crystal quality of the group-III nitride single crystal obtained also can be effectively improved.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0121">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the group-III nitride <b>115</b> (for example, GaN) the same in type as the group-III nitride (for example, GaN) for which crystal growth is carried out through the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus may be preferably beforehand applied (coated) to the inner wall of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b>. In this case, it becomes possible to grow up the group-III nitride crystal (for example, GaN) having high quality in which impurities are further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0122">Further, although the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> is formed separately from the reaction vessel <b>101</b> in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is also possible that the reaction vessel <b>101</b> and the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> are integrated into one body, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a variant example of a configuration of the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus according to the present invention, also to which each of the above-described first through fourth embodiments may be applied. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, same reference numerals are given to the same parts/components as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0123">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in this configuration, the reaction vessel and the mixed molten liquid holding container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are integrated into a single body in comparison with the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. That is, a reaction vessel <b>200</b> includes a vessel outer wall <b>201</b> and a vessel inner wall <b>202</b> for holding the mixed molten liquid substantially.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0124">There, the vessel outer wall <b>201</b> is formed by stainless steel corresponding to the reaction vessel <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0125">Moreover, the inner wall <b>202</b> is made by BN, AlN, or pyrolytic BN corresponding to the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, as the material of the inner wall <b>202</b>, BN is better than AlN, and further, pyrolytic BN is better than BN as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0126">Moreover, in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a nitrogen supply pipe <b>104</b> is introduced into the reaction vessel <b>200</b> from the top or from the side of the reaction vessel <b>200</b>. Further, as in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in order to adjust the pressure of nitrogen gas, a pressure adjustment mechanism <b>105</b> is provided in the nitrogen supply pipe <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0127">In the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a mixed molten liquid of an alkaline metal (for example, Na) and a substance at least containing a group-III metal (for example, Ga) is formed in the inner wall <b>202</b> of the reaction vessel <b>200</b>. Then, a substance (for example, nitrogen gas, ammonia gas, or sodium azide) which at least contains nitrogen is supplied into a space <b>208</b> in the reaction vessel <b>200</b> from the nitrogen supply pipe <b>104</b>. Thus, crystal growth of the group-III nitride (for example, GaN) which includes the group-III metal and nitrogen is made to be performed there.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0128">At this time, as described above, in order to avoid the surface of the mixed molten liquid from being completely covered by polycrystalline or amorphous nitride, the purity of the alkaline metal, the purity of the substance containing group-III metal, and/or the purity of the substance-containing nitrogen are made higher. Thereby, proper crystal growth of the group-III nitride (for example, GaN) can be achieved as in the above-mentioned first, second, third and fourth embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0129">In other words, the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> includes the reaction vessel <b>200</b> holding the mixed molten liquid of the alkaline metal and the substance which contains the group-III metal at least, and nitrogen introduction mechanism (<b>104</b>,<b>105</b>) for introducing the substance which contains nitrogen at least into the reaction vessel <b>200</b>, and the reaction vessel <b>200</b> has the outer wall <b>201</b> and inner wall <b>202</b> substantially holding the mixed molten liquid. In this configuration, a portion where the mixed molten liquid touches the inner wall <b>202</b> has a sufficient purity with few impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0130">Thus, in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the portion where the mixed molten liquid touches the inner wall <b>202</b> of the container <b>201</b> has a sufficient purity with few impurities, and, thus, it becomes possible to avoid the surface of the mixed molten liquid from being completely covered by a solid matter. Thereby, continuous dissolution of the nitrogen into the mixed molten liquid can be achieved. Furthermore, consumption of the group-III metal in the mixed molten liquid surface can be lessened because the group-III metal which forms the solid matter decreases, and it becomes possible to supply a more amount of the group-III metal to the group-III nitride crystal in the mixed molten liquid. Thus, it becomes possible to carry out crystal growth so as to yield a required large size of the group-III nitride crystal. Moreover, thereby, the impurities contained in the mixed molten liquid decrease and thus, the crystal quality of the group-III nitride single crystal obtained also improves.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0131">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the group-III nitride <b>215</b> (for example, GaN) the same in type as the group-III nitride (for example, GaN) for which crystal growth is carried out through the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus may be preferably beforehand applied (coated) onto the inner wall <b>202</b> of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>201</b>. In this case, it becomes possible to grow up the group-III nitride crystal (for example, GaN) having high quality in which impurities are further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0132">It is noted that the basic concept of the first through fourth embodiments of the present invention, i.e., special provision of a device for creating a state such that the surface the mixed molten liquid containing the alkaline metal and substance containing the group-III metal can be prevented from being covered by a solid matter such as polycrystalline/amorphous group-III nitride may also be applied to any other embodiment of the present invention which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0133">Thus, according to the first through fourth embodiments of the present invention, it is possible to produce a high-quality group-III nitride crystal having a large size sufficient such as to be practically used for producing a device such as a high-performance light-emitting diode, laser diode or the like, at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0134">Accordingly, a high-quality and high-performance group-III nitride semiconductor device can be produced using the thus-obtained high-quality group-III nitride crystal having a practical size. The high-performance device at this time means a device with a large output and a longer life. In case of an electronic device, the high-performance device at this time means a device of low power consumption, low noise, high-speed operation, a high-temperature operation range, while, in case of a photoelectric device, the high-performance device at this time means a device of low noise and long life.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0135">For example, a light-emission device which emits light having a wavelength shorter than 400 nm (light-emission device which has a satisfactory performance even in the ultraviolet zone) as the group-III nitride semiconductor device can be provided. That is, according to the prior art, the light-emission spectrum of a GaN film is such that most of the light-emission is made from a deep level. Accordingly, the device characteristic is not satisfactory for the wavelength shorter than 400 nm. In contrast thereto, according to the present invention, the light-emission device having the satisfactory characteristic also for the ultraviolet zone can be provided. In other words, by employing the high-quality group-III nitride crystal yielded according to the present invention as the substrate, it is possible to achieve a group-III nitride semiconductor device having few crystal defects and few impurities. As a result, it is possible to achieve high-efficiency light-emission characteristics in which light-emission from a deep level is effectively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an example of configuration of such a semiconductor device according to the present invention. The semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is in a form of a semiconductor laser. As shown in the figure, in this semiconductor device, on an n-type GaN substrate <b>501</b> using a group-III nitride crystal produced according to any of the crystal growth apparatuses/methods according to the present invention, an n-type AlGaN clad layer <b>502</b>, an n-type GaN guide layer <b>503</b>, an InGaN MQW (multiple quantum well) activity layer <b>504</b>, a p-type GaN guide layer <b>505</b>, a p-type AlGaN clad layer <b>506</b>, and a p-type GaN contact layer <b>507</b> are formed one by one through crystal growth processes. As a crystal growth method therefor, a thin film crystal growth method, such as an MO-VPE (organometallic vapor phase epitaxy) method, an MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) method, or the like may be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0137">Subsequently, a ridge structure is formed in the laminated films of GaN, AlGaN, and InGaN, SiO<sub>2 </sub>insulating layer <b>508</b> is formed only with a hole formed as a contact region, a p-side ohmic electrode Au/Ni <b>509</b>, and an n-side ohmic electrode Al/Ti <b>510</b> are respectively formed on top and bottom thereof, and thus, a semiconductor device (semiconductor laser) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0138">By injecting an electric current from the p-side ohmic electrode Au/Ni <b>509</b> and n-side ohmic electrode Al/Ti <b>510</b> of this semiconductor laser, it oscillates, and emits laser light in a direction of an arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0139">Since the group-III nitride crystal (GaN crystal) according to the present invention is used in this semiconductor laser as the substrate <b>501</b>, there are few crystal defects in the semiconductor laser device, and it provides a large power output and has a long life. Moreover, since the GaN substrate <b>501</b> is of n type, an electrode <b>510</b> can be formed directly onto the substrate <b>501</b>, thus does not need to draw two electrodes of p side and n side only from the obverse surface as in the prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and, thus, cost reduction can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0140">Furthermore, in the semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, it becomes possible to form a light emitting end surface by cleavage, also, chip separation can be performed by cleavage. Thus, it is possible to achieve a high-quality semiconductor device at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0141">In addition, although InGaN MQW is used as the activity layer <b>504</b> in the above-mentioned example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, it is also possible to shorten the wavelength of light emitted by using AlGaN MQW as the activity layer, instead. According to the present invention, light emission from a deep level is reduced as the GaN substrate <b>501</b> thus has few defects and few impurities. Accordingly, it is possible to thus provide a light-emission device having a high efficiency even when the wavelength of the light emitted is shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0142">Moreover, although each of the above-mentioned embodiments is an application of the present invention to an optical device, the present invention may also be applied to an electronic device. That is, by using a GaN substrate with few defects according to the present invention, a GaN-family thin film formed thereon by epitaxial growth also has few crystal defects. Consequently, the leak current can be well controlled, and a career confining effect when a quantum structure is made can be improved, for example. Thus, a high-performance device can be achieved according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0143">A fifth embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a side-elevational sectional view of a group-III nitride crystal growth device in the fifth embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0140" num="0146">The nitrogen gas is supplied near the window <b>1108</b> from the nitrogen supply pipe <b>1104</b>, as mentioned above. The nitrogen gas is exhausted through an exhaust pipe <b>1112</b> so that the nitrogen gas may not stay near the window <b>1108</b>, and also, the pressure in the reaction vessel <b>1101</b> can be kept to be a desired pressure. An exhaust flow adjustment mechanism <b>1113</b> is provided in the exhaust pipe <b>1112</b>. The exhaust flow adjustment mechanism <b>1113</b> and pressure adjustment mechanism <b>1105</b> are connected electrically together, and can be adjusted so that the desired pressure be kept inside of the reaction vessel <b>1101</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0148">At this time, the nitrogen gas is supplied from the nitrogen supply pipe <b>1104</b>, and as the gas does not stay inside of the reaction vessel <b>1101</b> near the window <b>11087</b>, so that a condition of growth of the group-III nitride crystal inside of the reacting vessel <b>1101</b> can be properly observed through the lens <b>1109</b>, CCD camera <b>1110</b>, and monitor <b>1111</b>. When there is no supply of the nitrogen gas near the window <b>1108</b> in the reaction vessel <b>1101</b>, or when the nitrogen gas stays calm there, the observation from the outside of the reaction vessel <b>1101</b> may become difficult because (mist of) Na coming from the mixed molten liquid <b>1103</b> may react with the sapphire of the material of the window <b>1108</b> and thus loses the transparency, or Na is deposited inside surface of the window <b>1108</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0146" num="0152">A sixth embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> shows a side-elevational sectional view of a group-III nitride crystal growth device in the sixth embodiment of the present invention. A mixed molten liquid holding container <b>1202</b> is provided in a reaction vessel <b>1201</b>. There is a mixed molten liquid which includes Na as the alkaline metal and Ga as the group-III metal held in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>1202</b>.

<p id="p-0147" num="0153">An upper part of the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> is provided with a group-III nitride crystal holding mechanism <b>1217</b>.

<p id="p-0148" num="0154">The upper part of the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>1202</b> has a lid <b>1218</b>, and the group-III nitride crystal holding mechanism <b>1217</b> and this lid <b>1218</b> are connected together. The mixed molten liquid holding container <b>1202</b> is supported by a support stand <b>1216</b>, and the support stand <b>1216</b> is movable along the vertical direction. Therefore, when the support stand <b>1216</b> moves along the vertical direction, the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>1202</b> and mixed molten liquid <b>1203</b> move together along the vertical direction accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0155">In the reaction vessel <b>1201</b>, a heating unit <b>1206</b> is provided by which the temperature there is controlled so that crystal growth may occur. A part of the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> projects through the heating unit <b>1206</b>, and forms a port <b>1215</b> for observation. A window <b>1208</b> through which observation into the inside of the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> is made is provided at the projection end of the port <b>1215</b> for observation. The material of this window <b>1208</b> is quartz. A lens <b>1209</b> is provided on the outside of the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> near the window <b>1208</b>, and a CCD camera <b>1210</b> is provided at a position such that an image in the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> can be pick up through the lens <b>1209</b> and window <b>1208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0156">The CCD camera <b>1210</b> is electrically connected to a monitor <b>1211</b> and a signal of the image in the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> pick up by the CCD camera <b>1210</b> can be observed via the monitor <b>1211</b>. This port <b>1215</b> for observation is located at a level approximately same as the level of the bottom end of the group-III nitride holding mechanism <b>1217</b>. Therefore, when the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>1202</b> is lowered along the vertical direction separately from the group-III nitride holding mechanism <b>1217</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the bottom end of the group-III nitride holding mechanism <b>1217</b> is exposed and thus can be observed from the outside via the port <b>1215</b> for observation.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0157">Also in this sixth embodiment, the nitrogen gas is used as the nitrogen material. The nitrogen gas can be introduced by a nitrogen supply pipe <b>1204</b>, and can be supplied into a space <b>1207</b> inside of the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> from the outside. The nitrogen supply pipe <b>1204</b> is provided so as to pass through a wall of the port <b>1215</b> for observation so that the gas can be supplied near the window <b>1208</b> inside of the reaction vessel <b>1201</b>. In order to adjust the nitrogen gas flow near the window <b>1208</b> and the nitrogen gas pressure in the reaction vessel <b>1201</b>, a pressure adjustment mechanism <b>1205</b> is provided. This nitrogen pressure adjustment mechanism <b>1205</b> includes a pressure sensor, a pressure adjustment valve, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0158">The nitrogen gas is supplied near the window <b>1208</b> from the nitrogen supply pipe <b>1204</b>, as mentioned above. Further, the nitrogen gas is exhausted through an exhaust pipe <b>1212</b> so that nitrogen gas is prevented from staying calm near the window <b>1208</b> and also, the pressure in the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> can be kept to be a desired pressure. An exhaust flow adjustment mechanism <b>1213</b> is provided in the exhaust pipe <b>1212</b>. The exhaust flow adjustment mechanism <b>1213</b> and pressure adjustment mechanism <b>1205</b> are electrically connected together so that it becomes possible to keep the desired pressure in the reaction vessel <b>1201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0159">Under such conditions, the nitrogen pressure in the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> is made into 50 atmospheres, and the temperature there is increased into 750&#xb0; C. at which the crystal growth may start. By keeping these growth conditions for a predetermined time interval, a GaN crystal which is the group-III nitride glows from the seed crystal attached to the projecting end of the group-III nitride crystal holding mechanism <b>1217</b> serving as a center of the growth.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0160">After the growth during a predetermined time interval, the temperature in the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> is lowered to 300&#xb0; C., and the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>1202</b> and support stand <b>1216</b> are lowered. As the nitrogen gas is supplied from the nitrogen supply pipe <b>1204</b> and thereby, the gas does not stay calm near the window <b>1208</b> inside of the reaction vessel <b>1201</b>, it is possible to observe and thus determine how large the group-III nitride crystal has grown at this time through the lens <b>1209</b>, CCD camera <b>1210</b>, and monitor <b>1211</b> via the window <b>1208</b>. The nitrogen gas would stay calm near the window <b>1208</b> if there were no supply of the nitrogen gas near the window inside of the reaction vessel <b>1201</b>, and, thus, (mist/steam of) Na coming from the mixed molten liquid <b>1203</b> would react with the quartz of the material of the window <b>1208</b>, or Na would be deposited on the window <b>1208</b>, so that the transparency of the window <b>1208</b> would be lost. Thus, the observation from the outside of the reaction vessel <b>1201</b> would become difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0161">As the situation of growth of the group-III nitride crystal can be checked as mentioned above, more efficient crystal growth is attained and it leads to cost reduction, as in the fifth embodiment.

<p id="p-0156" num="0162">Different from the above-mentioned fifth embodiment, evaporation of Na can be controlled and thus stable growth of GaN crystal is attained because the lid <b>1218</b> is provided on the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>1202</b> in the sixth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. Furthermore, even if the flow rate of nitrogen gas is reduced, adhesion of Na to the window <b>1208</b> for observation can be avoided, and it becomes easier to carry out observation, since the amount of evaporation of Na is thus controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0163">Furthermore, as in the above-mentioned fifth embodiment, it becomes possible to change the place at which the observation is made in the reaction vessel <b>2101</b> by providing the optical system, such as a lens, a mirror, a prism, etc., or any combination thereof, outside of the reaction vessel <b>2101</b>.

<p id="p-0158" num="0164">In each of the above-described fifth and sixth embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15A</figref>, it is preferable that at least the inner surface of the window <b>1108</b> or <b>1208</b> is covered by a film of the group-III nitride. Specifically, only the inner surface of the window should be covered by the group-III nitride, or, the entire window <b>1108</b> or <b>1208</b> is made of the group-III nitride, or some part of the window including the inner surface thereof is made of the group-III nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0165">Even in case only the inner surface of the window is coated by the group-III nitride, it is possible to avoid reaction of the window material with Na even when the window is made of sapphire or quartz, and, thereby, it is possible to avoid the transparency of the window from being lost. Accordingly, it is possible to observe the inside of the reaction vessel <b>1101</b> or <b>1201</b> merely by applying the nitrogen gas onto the window with a smaller gas amount such as to avoid deposition of Na onto the window. Accordingly, it is possible to achieve stable crystal growth of the group-III nitride at low cost as a result of application of high pressure being enabled in the reaction vessel.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0169">In the reaction vessel <b>1301</b>, a heating unit <b>1306</b> is provided by which the temperature there is controlled so that crystal growth may occur.

<p id="p-0189" num="0195">By keeping these growth conditions for a predetermined time interval, the GaN crystal <b>2109</b> which is the group-III nitride grows in the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>. In this time, no transportation of Na occurs between the two mixed molten liquid holding containers <b>2102</b> and <b>2112</b> as the temperature is uniform therebetween including the connection pipe <b>2108</b>. Accordingly, there is no Na as the alkaline metal in the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2112</b>, and, thus, GaN crystal does not grow there, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0196">The above-mentioned temperature and nitrogen pressure conditions are kept until the group-III nitride crystal (GaN crystal) grows sufficiently in the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2102</b>. At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, in the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2102</b>, all Ga is consumed to form the GaN crystal and this container <b>2102</b> enters a state where only the GaN crystal <b>2109</b> and Na <b>2111</b> exist. At this time, in the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2112</b>, the state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref> is kept as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0197">Next, the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2102</b> and connection pipe <b>2108</b> are increased in temperature into 900 degrees C., after the nitrogen pressure is lowered to the normal pressure. Also, the temperature of the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2112</b> is lowered to the room temperature. Then, by holding these conditions for a predetermined time interval, Na <b>2111</b> as the alkaline metal thus transformed into a gas state due to the increased temperature moves to the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2112</b> from the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2102</b> due to the temperature difference between the first and second containers <b>2102</b> and <b>2112</b>, and the connection pipe <b>2108</b>. That is, Na <b>2111</b> which exists in the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2102</b> evaporates, and Na <b>2111</b> moves into the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2112</b> having the lower temperature. At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, in the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2102</b>, only the GaN crystal remains.

<p id="p-0192" num="0198">Next, the temperature of the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2112</b> is increased to 750 degrees C., with the nitrogen pressure kept in the reaction vessel <b>2101</b> at 50 atmospheres, while the temperature of the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2102</b> and the connection pipe <b>2108</b> is kept at 750 degrees C. again.

<p id="p-0193" num="0199">Thus, according to the eighth embodiment, Na which is the alkaline metal is used for two times of growth of group-III nitride crystals (GaN crystal) in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus. Accordingly, it is possible to effectively reduce the consumption of the alkaline metal, for example, to be halved. Thereby, cost reduction and environmental load reduction can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0200">Moreover, a refining effect (due to distillation) of Na which reduces impurities can be obtained by returning Na which is the alkaline metal to liquid phase from gas phase. Therefore, it becomes possible to grow up a high-quality group-III nitride crystal (GaN crystal) with fewer impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0201">Thus, in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, and the group-III nitride crystal growth method described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A through 18H</figref>, after carrying out crystal growth of the group-III nitride crystal in the first temperature control zone, the alkaline metal (Na) conveyed to the second temperature control zone, and crystal growth of the group-III nitride crystal is carried out again in the second temperature control zone.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0202">That is, the group-III nitride crystal is first grown up in the first temperature control zone (first temperature control zone) in the reaction vessel <b>2101</b> of the plurality of temperature control zones which can be controlled in temperature independently. Next, the alkaline metal (Na) is moved to another temperature control zone (second temperature control zone). There, in order to convey the alkaline metal (Na), the temperature of the first temperature control zone is raised into more than the temperature at which the alkaline metal (Na) evaporates, and the temperature of the second temperature control zone is set lower than the temperature at which the alkaline metal (Na) does not evaporates evaporate or coagulates coagulate. By holding these states, it is possible to make the alkaline metal (Na) move to the second temperature control zone from the first temperature control zone.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Then, the group-III nitride crystal similarly grows up in the second temperature control zone.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0203">When transporting the alkaline metal (Na) from the first temperature control zone to the second temperature control zone, the temperature of the first temperature control zone and the temperature of the second temperature control zone are most important. However, preferably, the temperatures on the other places should be higher than the temperature at which the alkaline metal evaporates similarly to the first temperature control zone. Thereby, conveying the alkaline metal to the second temperature control zone can be made efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0204">The number of temperature control zones independently controllable is two in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> (two temperature control zones of the first temperature control zone of the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2102</b> and the first heating device <b>2106</b>; and the second temperature control zone of the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2112</b> and the second heating device <b>2116</b>). However, this number may be increased into more than two. That is, more than two mixed molten liquid holding containers together with their respective heating devices may be provided in one reaction vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0205"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a first variant embodiment of the eighth embodiment in which three or more temperature control zones (first, second, third, . . . , n-th, (n+1)-th temperature control zones) are provided in one reaction vessel <b>2101</b>. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, each pair of adjacent temperature control zones are connected by an alkaline metal transportation zone for conveying the alkaline metal to an adjacent temperature control zone therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0206">In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, first, after carrying out crystal growth of the group-III nitride in the first temperature control zone, the alkaline metal is conveyed to the second temperature control zone from the first temperature control zone, and crystal growth of the group-III nitride is carried out in the second temperature control zone, as in the process illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A through 18H</figref>. Next, the alkaline metal is conveyed to the third temperature control zone from the second temperature control zone, and crystal growth of the group-III nitride is carried out in the third temperature control zone. Thus, the alkaline metal can be conveyed to the first, second, third, . . . , n-th, (n+1)-th respective temperature control zones, one by one, in the stated order, and crystal growth of the group-III nitride can be carried out, one by one, in each of these temperature control zones, in sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0207">In case the alkaline metal is conveyed at this time, the temperature of the temperature control zone (n-th one) where the alkaline metal exists should be made more than the temperature at which the alkaline metal evaporates, while the temperature of the temperature control zone ((n+1)-th one) to which the alkaline metal is conveyed should be lower than the temperature at which the alkaline metal does not evaporate or coagulates. The temperature of the other temperature control zones is set as the temperature at which the alkaline metal evaporates or higher, and thus, the alkaline metal is not conveyed thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0208">Thus, in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, by performing crystal growth of the group-III nitride and Na transportation three times or more, the amount of consumption of the alkaline metal (Na) can be reduced further effectively, and cost reduction and environmental load reduction can be realized further effectively. Moreover, the refining effect of Na described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> becomes more effective by further increasing the number of times of Na transportation, and, thus, it becomes possible to attain much higher purity of Na by the repetitive distillation operation of Na, and, thus, it becomes possible to carry out crystal growth of quality group-III nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0209"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a second variant embodiment of the eighth embodiment of the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus. In comparison to the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a vacuum pump <b>2403</b> is added to a reaction vessel <b>2101</b> in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. That is, the vacuum pump <b>2403</b> is connected to the reaction vessel <b>2101</b> via an exhaust piping <b>2401</b>. And also, an exhaust valve <b>2402</b> is provided in the middle of the exhaust pipe <b>2401</b> between the reaction vessel <b>2101</b> and vacuum pump <b>2403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0210">In this configuration, the vacuum pump <b>2403</b> and the exhaust pipe <b>2401</b> reduce the pressure in the reaction vessel <b>2101</b>, and, further, the exhaust valve <b>2402</b> separates and integrates the atmosphere between the vacuum pump <b>2403</b> and reaction vessel <b>2101</b>. That is, it is possible to decompress the atmosphere in the reaction vessel <b>2101</b> by operating the vacuum pump <b>2403</b> and opening the exhaust valve <b>2402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0211">That is, the vacuum pump <b>2403</b>, the exhaust pipe <b>2401</b>, and exhaust valve <b>2402</b> act as a decompression unit for changing the alkaline metal transportation zone into a decompressed state, in case the alkaline metal is conveyed to another temperature control zone from one temperature control zone.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0212">According to the group-III nitride crystal growth device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, before conveying the alkaline metal from one temperature control zone to another temperature control zone as in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the inside of the reaction vessel <b>2101</b>, including the inside of the transportation zone <b>2108</b>, is decompressed by the vacuum pump <b>2403</b>. In this case, since the inside of the reaction vessel <b>2101</b> is decompressed, it becomes possible to convey Na at high speed compared with the case where Na is conveyed in the condition where the inside of the reaction vessel <b>2101</b> is in the normal pressure as in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Therefore, further cost reduction on the growth of a GaN crystal is attained.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0213">As mentioned above, according to the eighth embodiment, the plurality of temperature control zones which can be controlled in temperature independently are provided, and, the temperatures thereof are appropriately controlled so that the alkaline metal (Na or so) needed for crystal growth of group-III nitride (GaN or so) is transported among them in evaporated form. Thereby, the alkaline metal is used repetitively, and, thus, the alkaline metal can be efficiently used, and, also, the alkaline metal is purified by the repetitive distillation operation.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0214">The ninth embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a configuration of a group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus in the ninth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, in a reaction vessel <b>2201</b>, a first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b> and a second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b> are provided. Moreover, for the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b>, a first heating device <b>2206</b> is provided so that heating control to an arbitrary temperature may be made there, while, for the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b>, a second heating device <b>2216</b> is provided so that heating control may be made to an arbitrary temperature there. This first heating device <b>2206</b> and the second heating device <b>2216</b> can carry out temperature control of the mixed molten liquid holding containers <b>2202</b> and <b>2212</b>, independently, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0215">In other words, the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b> and the first heating device <b>2206</b> act as a first temperature control zone, while the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b> and the second heating device <b>2216</b> act as a second temperature control zone.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0216">Moreover, in order to control the temperature of the entire reaction vessel <b>2201</b> independently from the mixed molten liquid, a reaction vessel heating device <b>2207</b> is provided so that heating control may be made. This reaction vessel heating device <b>2207</b> is arranged on the outside of the reaction vessel <b>2201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0217">Moreover, in this group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a gate valve <b>2208</b> is provided for the purpose of separation such that control for separation and unification between the circumference atmosphere <b>2220</b> of the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b> and the circumference atmosphere <b>2221</b> of the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b> may be made. In other words, in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, this gate valve <b>2208</b> separates or unifies the atmospheres of the plurality of temperature control zones independently controllable in temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0218">Separating the atmospheres of the plurality of temperature control zones enables holding of the atmosphere of each temperature control zone independently, and, thus, makes it possible to prevent the atmospheres of those zones from being mixed together. On the other hand, unifying the atmospheres of the plurality of temperature control zones enables these zones to have the common atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0219">Specifically, the circumference atmosphere <b>2220</b> of the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b> and the circumference atmosphere <b>2221</b> of the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b> are integrated/unified by opening the gate valve <b>2208</b> in the group-III nitride crystal growth device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The gate valve <b>2208</b> is closed for separating the circumference atmosphere <b>2220</b> of the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b> from the circumference atmosphere <b>2221</b> of the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0220">Moreover, controlling independently the atmospheres of the plurality of temperature control zones can be achieved where the atmospheres of the plurality of temperature control zones are separated by the gate valve <b>2208</b> in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus according to the ninth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0221">That is, in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, in case an group-III nitride crystal is made grow up in either the first temperature control zone or the second temperature control zone, the atmosphere of the first temperature control zone and the second temperature control zone is divided by the gate valve <b>2208</b>. On the other hand, in case the alkaline metal (Na) is conveyed therebetween, the gate valve <b>2208</b> is widely opened and thus, the divided atmospheres of the first temperature control zone and the second temperature control zone are unified.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0222">The way of conveying of the alkaline metal (Na) is the same as that in the case of the above-described eighth embodiment. That is, in conveying the alkaline metal to the second temperature control zone from the first temperature control zone, the atmospheres of these two zones are unified, and, then, the first temperature control zone is heated into more than the temperature at which the alkaline metal evaporates, while the temperature of the second temperature control zone is made lower than the temperature at which an alkaline metal does not evaporate or coagulate. By doing so, the alkaline metal is conveyed to the second temperature control zone from the first temperature control zone as in the eighth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0223">Moreover, in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, in order to supply the substance (in this example, nitrogen gas) which contains nitrogen into the circumference atmosphere <b>2220</b> (referred to as a first atmosphere <b>2220</b>, hereafter) of the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b>, a first nitrogen supply pipe <b>2204</b> is provided. Moreover, in order to supply the substance (in this example, nitrogen gas) which contains nitrogen into the circumference atmosphere <b>2221</b> (referred to as a second atmosphere <b>2221</b>, hereafter) of the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b>, a second nitrogen supply pipe <b>224</b> is provided. Moreover, in order to adjust the nitrogen pressure supplied into the first atmosphere <b>2220</b>, a first pressure adjustment mechanism <b>2205</b> is provided, while, in order to adjust the nitrogen pressure supplied into the second atmosphere <b>2221</b>, a second pressure adjustment mechanism <b>2225</b> is provided. These pressure adjustment mechanisms <b>2205</b> and <b>2225</b> include pressure sensors, pressure adjustment valves etc.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0224">Moreover, the material of the reaction vessel <b>2201</b> is stainless steel, and the material of the mixed molten liquid holding containers <b>2202</b> and <b>2212</b> and the connection pipe <b>2108</b> is BN (boron nitride) or pyrolytic BN.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0225">A group-III nitride crystal growth process executed in the above-described group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A through 22H</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A through 22D</figref> show transition of the state of the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22E through 22H</figref> show corresponding transition of the state of the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0226">First, a mixed molten liquid <b>2203</b> of Ga as the group-III metal and Na as the alkaline metal is prepared in the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>. At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22E</figref>, only Ga <b>2114</b> as the group-III metal is provided in the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b>.

<p id="p-0221" num="0227">Under such conditions, the gate valve <b>2208</b> is closed.

<p id="p-0222" num="0228">By keeping these growth conditions for a predetermined time interval, the GaN crystal <b>2209</b> which is the group-III nitride grows in the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>. In this time, no transportation of Na occurs between the two mixed molten liquid holding containers <b>2202</b> and <b>2212</b> as the gate valve <b>2208</b> is closed. Accordingly, there is no Na as the alkaline metal in the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2112</b>, and, thus, GaN crystal does not grow there, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0229">The above-mentioned temperature and nitrogen pressure conditions are kept until the group-III nitride crystal (GaN crystal) grows sufficiently in the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b>.

<p id="p-0226" num="0232">Next, the gate valve <b>2208</b> is closed, thus, the first and second atmospheres are separated, and the nitrogen pressure in the second atmosphere <b>2221</b> is increased into 50 atmospheres.

At this time, Na <b>2215</b> exists in the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b>. Then, the gate valve <b>208</b> is closed, the GaN crystal <b>2209</b> is taken out from the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b> in the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22D</figref>, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, a metal Ga <b>2301</b> is newly put into the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b>.

That is, where the first atmosphere <b>2220</b> and second atmosphere <b>2221</b> are unified, the temperature of the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b> is raised to 900 degrees C. while the temperature of the first mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2202</b> is unchanged as the room temperature.

<p id="p-0237" num="0243">Subsequently, the temperature in the second mixed molten liquid holding container <b>2212</b> is raised to approximately 100 degrees C.

<p id="p-0238" num="0244">This state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23D and 23H</figref> is the same as the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22C and 22G</figref>, and, after that, the same processing may be repetitively repeated. Thereby, without newly supplying Na, growth of GaN crystal can be attained any number of times merely by supplying Ga. Therefore, the amount of consumption of Na which is the alkaline metal can be effectively saved, and, thus, cost reduction and environmental load reduction can also be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0245">Moreover, also in this ninth embodiment, by increasing the number of times of Na transportation with distillation operation, the refining effect of Na is acquired and it becomes possible to attain much more high purity on Na.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0246">In addition, in the example of process described above, extraction of the GaN crystal at the second time and subsequent thereto is made after the crystal growth in the other mixed molten liquid holding container is completed.

<p id="p-0241" num="0247">Thus, according to the ninth embodiment, different from the eighth embodiment, the gate valve <b>2208</b> is provided so as to completely separate the plurality of temperature control zones while crystal growth is performed.</p>

<p id="p-0243" num="0249"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows a variant embodiment of the ninth embodiment of the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus. In comparison to the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a vacuum pump <b>2413</b> is added for a reaction vessel <b>2201</b> in the group-III nitride crystal growth device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. That is, the vacuum pump <b>2413</b> is connected to the reaction vessel <b>2201</b> via an exhaust pipe <b>2411</b>. And also, an exhaust valve <b>2412</b> is provided in the middle of the exhaust pipe <b>2411</b> between the reaction vessel <b>2201</b> and vacuum pump <b>2413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0250">In this configuration, the vacuum pump <b>2413</b> and the exhaust pipe <b>2411</b> reduce the pressure in the reaction vessel <b>2201</b>, and, further, the exhaust valve <b>2412</b> separates and integrates the atmosphere between the vacuum pump <b>2413</b> and reaction vessel <b>2201</b>. That is, it is possible to decompress the atmosphere in the reaction vessel <b>2201</b> by operating the vacuum pump <b>2413</b> and opening the exhaust valve <b>2412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0251">That is, the vacuum pump <b>2413</b>, the exhaust pipe <b>2411</b>, and exhaust valve <b>2412</b> act as a decompression unit for changing the alkaline metal transportation zone into a decompressed state, in case the alkaline metal is conveyed to another temperature control zone from one temperature control zone.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0252">According to the group-III nitride crystal growth device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, before conveying the alkaline metal from one temperature control zone to another temperature control zones as in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the inside of the reaction vessel <b>2201</b> is decompressed by the vacuum pump <b>2413</b>. In this case, since the inside of the reaction vessel <b>2201</b> is decompressed in a state where the two temperature control zones <b>2220</b> and <b>2221</b> are unified by opening a gate value <b>2208</b>, it becomes possible to convey Na at high speed compared with the case where Na is conveyed in the condition where the inside of the reaction vessel <b>2201</b> is in the normal pressure as in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Therefore, further cost reduction on the growth of GaN crystal is attained.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0253">Also a group-III nitride crystal yielded according to each of these eighth and ninth embodiments of the present invention may be applied to a group-III nitride semiconductor device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> as in the cases of the first through seventh embodiments.

<p id="p-0250" num="0256">The alkaline metal (for example, Na) may be supplied from the outside, or may exist in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> from the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0257">The reaction vessel <b>3101</b> is made of stainless steel. The mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> is made of BN (boron nitride), AlN, or pyrolytic BN.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0258">A nitrogen supply pipe <b>3104</b> for supplying the substance (for example, nitrogen gas, ammonia gas, or sodium azide) which contains nitrogen at least, into the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> is provided in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0259">A pressure adjustment mechanism in order to adjust the pressure of the nitrogen gas is provided in the nitrogen supply pipe <b>3104</b>. This pressure adjustment mechanism <b>3105</b> includes a pressure sensor, a pressure adjustment valve, etc.</p>

That is, by the temperature control function of the first heating device <b>3106</b>, the inside temperature of the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> is raised to the temperature at which the crystal growth is possible, lowered to the temperature at which the crystal growth stops, and also, the temperature in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> is kept at each of these temperatures for an arbitrary time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0261">Moreover, at least, in order to supply the substance <b>3110</b> (referred to as a group-III material, hereafter) containing the group-III metal into the reaction vessel <b>101</b> from the exterior of the reaction vessel <b>3101</b>, a material holding container <b>3109</b> which holds the group-III material <b>3110</b> is provided in the exterior of the reaction vessel <b>3101</b>. Concretely, from this material holding container <b>3109</b>, the group-III material <b>3110</b> (for example, metal Ga) is supplied by an amount corresponding an amount consumed in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> (for example, consumed for the crystal growth of the GaN from Ga and N).</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0262">This material holding container <b>3109</b> and the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> are connected together by a supply pipe <b>3107</b> in order to supply the substance <b>3110</b> which contains the group-III metal at least into the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b>, and also, are connected together by a pressure adjustment pipe <b>3116</b> such that the pressure in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> and the pressure of the material holding container <b>3109</b> holding the substance <b>3110</b> containing the group-III metal at least may become equal.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0263">There, the fact that the pressure in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> and the pressure of the material holding container <b>3109</b> holding the substance <b>3110</b> containing group-III metal at least are equal means that the pressure of the gas in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b>, and the pressure of the gas in the material holding container <b>3109</b> holding the substance <b>3110</b> containing group-III metal are equal.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0264">Moreover, a mechanism which controls the relative height of the substance <b>3110</b> at least containing the group-III metal held by the material holding container <b>3109</b> with respect to the mixed molten liquid <b>3103</b> held by the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> is provided. Concretely, at least, the mechanism which controls the relative height of the substance <b>3110</b> containing group-III metal and the mixed molten liquid <b>103</b> held by the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> is such that the material holding container <b>3109</b> is supported by a support <b>3113</b> via a height adjustment unit <b>3112</b> for adjusting the height of the material holding container <b>3109</b>. By means of this mechanism, the material holding container <b>3109</b> which contains the substance <b>3110</b> containing group-III metal at least is positioned higher than the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> so that the substance <b>3110</b> containing group-III metal is automatically transported to the reaction vessel <b>101</b> due to the self gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0265">In this tenth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the two containers <b>3101</b> and <b>3109</b> are connected physically via the pipes <b>3116</b> and <b>3107</b>, thereby, the pressures of the gases in these containers <b>3101</b> and <b>3109</b> become equal to one another, so that the substance <b>3110</b> containing group-III metal may be conveyed therebetween merely by creating difference in height therebetween due to it's self gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0266">Moreover, a second heating device <b>3114</b> for carrying out heating control of the supply pipe <b>3107</b> and the material holding container <b>3109</b> is provided in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. By this second heating device <b>3114</b>, the temperature of the supply pipe <b>3107</b> and material holding container <b>3109</b> is raised to approximately 40 degrees C., and, thereby, the group-III material (substance which contains group-III metal at least) <b>3110</b> is heated so that this material may be held in a liquid state (for example, liquid metal Ga), while it is sent to the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> through the supply pipe <b>3107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0267">The crystal growth of a group-III nitride can be made to start in this group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus by setting the temperature in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> and effective nitrogen partial pressure as the conditions in which crystal growth of the group-III nitride can occur.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0268">Concretely, the nitrogen pressure in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> is made into 50 atmospheres, and the temperature in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> is increased to the temperature of 750 degrees C. at which the crystal growth starts. By keeping for a predetermined time interval this growth condition, the group-III nitride crystal (for example, GaN crystal) <b>3111</b> grows in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0269">At this time, the position of the material holding container <b>3109</b> which contains at least the substance <b>3110</b> containing group-III metal is made higher than the reaction vessel <b>3101</b>, and, thereby, the substance <b>3110</b> containing group-III metal is supplied to the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> automatically due to the self gravity of the substance <b>3110</b> containing group-III metal as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0270">Thus, in the tenth embodiment of the present invention, an amount of the group-III metal (for example, Ga) consumed as the group-III nitride crystal (for example, GaN) <b>3111</b> grows in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus can be appropriately supplemented in the liquid state through the supply pipe <b>3107</b> from the material holding container <b>3109</b>. Simultaneously, the nitrogen consumed can be supplemented through the nitrogen gas supply pipe <b>3104</b> in the gas state.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0271">Thus, after the growth of group-III nitride crystal begins, the group-III nitride crystal can be continuously made grow up through supply of the group-III material (substance which contains group-III metal at least) <b>3110</b> into the reaction vessel <b>3101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0272">Thus, by thus keeping stable supply of the group-III materials into the reaction vessel <b>3101</b>, the group-III nitride crystal (for example, GaN crystal) <b>3111</b> can be made grow up stably, and the group-III nitride crystal (GaN crystal) having a large size can be yielded.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0273">Thus, according to the present invention, no complicated process is needed, but it becomes possible to realize a quality group-III nitride crystal at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0274">Furthermore, according to the present invention, growth temperature required is low, i.e., 1000 degrees C. or less, and also growth pressure required is 100 atmospheres or less. Accordingly, it is not necessary to use an expensive reaction vessel which can bear super-high pressure and super-high temperature. Consequently, it becomes possible to realize a semiconductor device using the group-III nitride crystal at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0275">Furthermore, according to the tenth embodiment, especially, by continuously supplying the group-III material, it becomes possible to make the amount ratio of Ga in the mixed molten liquid <b>3103</b> constant, consequently to grow up the good group-III nitride crystal <b>3111</b> with a low defect density.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0276">Specifically, according to the tenth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the positional relationship between the mixed molten liquid <b>3103</b> contained in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> and the substance <b>3110</b> at least containing the group-III metal held by the material holding container <b>3109</b> is controlled at least according to the relationship between the mass of the substance <b>3110</b> at least containing the group-III metal and the friction amount of the portions through which the substance <b>3110</b> at least containing the group-III metal is fed from the material holding container <b>3109</b> to the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b>. Thereby, a desired amount of the substance <b>3110</b> at least containing the group-III metal is properly fed.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0277">In fact, the amount of the substance <b>3110</b> at least containing the group-III metal automatically fed from the group-III metal holding container <b>3109</b> to the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> is determined according to the mutual height relationship of the substance <b>3110</b> at least containing the group-III metal with respect to the mixed molten liquid <b>3103</b>, the friction amount (referred to as a feeding friction amount) of the portions through which the substance <b>3110</b> at least containing the group-III metal is fed, and the mass of this substance <b>3110</b>. Accordingly, the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention controls the amount of the substance containing group-III metal being fed by controlling the above-mentioned mutual height relationship (relative height) with respect to the feeding friction amount and the mass of the substance <b>3110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0278">Moreover, in this tenth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a mechanism by which the amount of the substance <b>3110</b> which contains the group-III metal at least exists in the material holding container <b>3109</b> can be observed is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0279">Specifically, for example, at least a part of the material of the material holding container <b>3109</b> is made of a material having transparency with respect to visible light.

<p id="p-0274" num="0280">The configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> will now be described in more detail.

<p id="p-0276" num="0282">The supply pipe <b>3107</b> connects between the container <b>3109</b> and the reaction vessel <b>3101</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, this supply pipe <b>3107</b> projects from the mixed molten liquid <b>3111</b> as the pipe <b>3107</b> extends from the bottom of the container <b>3109</b>, and passes through the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> and the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b>. Moreover, the pressure adjustment pipe <b>3116</b> connects between the top of the container <b>3109</b> and the reaction vessel <b>3101</b>. The pressure in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> and the pressure in the material holding container <b>3109</b> can be made equal by means of this pressure adjustment pipe <b>3116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0283">The material holding container <b>3109</b> is connected to the support <b>3113</b> through the height adjustment unit <b>3112</b>. A pulse motor, a gear, etc. are prepared in the height adjustment unit <b>3112</b>, and thus, it is possible to change continuously the vertical position thereof with respect to the support <b>3113</b>. Thus, the vertical position of the container <b>3109</b> can be freely controlled by operation of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0284">There, the supply pipe <b>3107</b> and the pressure adjustment pipe <b>3116</b> which connect between the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> and the material holding container <b>3109</b> have flexibility such that, no trouble/problem occur even when the positional relationship between the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> and material holding container <b>3109</b> changes as mentioned above. For example for this purpose, a stainless steel pipe whose outer diameter is 1/16 inch is used as these pipes <b>3107</b> and <b>3116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0285">Moreover, the supply pipe <b>3107</b> and the container <b>3109</b> have the second heating device <b>3114</b> which performs temperature control such that the supply pipe <b>3107</b> and the material holding container <b>3109</b> are heated as mentioned above. For example, a heater is wound on the supply pipe <b>3107</b> and container <b>3109</b> so as to heat them. The temperature thereof is set as approximately 40 degrees C., and thereby, the metal Ga keeps in liquid state.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0286">Under such a situation, as the substance which contains nitrogen at least (nitrogen gas is used, in this example), nitrogen pressure in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> is made into 50 atmospheres, and the temperature is increased to the temperature of 750 degrees C. at which the crystal growth starts. By keeping this growth condition for a predetermined time interval, the GaN crystal <b>3111</b> which is the group-III nitride grows in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b>. At this time, the GaN crystal grows and the thus-consumed metal Ga is supplied into the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> through the supply pipe <b>3107</b> from the material holding container <b>3109</b>. The consumed nitrogen is supplied through the nitrogen gas supply pipe <b>3104</b> in the state of gas.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0287">In order to cause automatic transportation of the metal Ga by its self gravity from the container <b>3109</b> to the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> via the supply pipe <b>3104</b>, the surface height of the liquid Ga <b>3110</b> in the container <b>3109</b> is made higher than the height of the top end <b>3115</b> of the supply pipe <b>3104</b> projecting from the mixed molten liquid <b>3110</b> in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b>. Thereby, the metal Ga is transported automatically by its self gravity from the container <b>3109</b> to the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> via the supply pipe <b>3104</b>. Namely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>,

where &#x394;h denotes a mutual height of the surface of Ga <b>3110</b> in the container <b>3109</b> with respect to the top end <b>3115</b> of the supply pipe <b>3104</b>. There, according to an experiment, the following requirement should be satisfied for causing automatic feeding of the liquid Ga:

in case, as the supply pipe <b>3107</b>, a stainless steel pipe having an outer diameter of 1/16 inch and a length of 500 mm is used.
</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0288">It becomes possible to control the amount of liquid Ga fed into the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b>, and the feeding rate thereof, by controlling the speed in lifting the container <b>3109</b> by the height adjustment unit <b>3112</b>, and by previously determining the content of the container <b>3109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0289">The feeding rate of liquid Ga is thus controlled as mentioned above, and thereby, a desired large size of GaN crystal is attained by growing up the GaN crystal <b>3111</b> continuously stably.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0290">According to an experiment, for causing the above-mentioned automatic feeding of liquid Ga, essential matters are such that the pressure should be made equal through the pressure adjustment pipe <b>3116</b> among the reaction vessel <b>3101</b>, supply pipe <b>3104</b> and material holding container <b>3109</b>; and, also, careful study should be made on relationship between the above-mentioned height difference &#x394;h and friction loss in the supply pipe <b>3104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0291"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows a first example of a device allowing observation of the amount of liquid Ga present in the material holding container <b>3109</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows a side elevational sectional view of the container <b>3109</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. There, the Ga <b>3110</b> is in liquid state by keeping the temperature of the container <b>3109</b> at approximately 40 degrees C.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0292">In this example, a window <b>3201</b> for Ga surface check is provided as a part of the side wall of the container <b>3109</b>. This window <b>3201</b> is made of a pressure-resist glass, and the container <b>3109</b> is formed by stainless steel. Thus, this window <b>3201</b> has a resistance against pressure, in a case of the crystal growth pressure mentioned above with reference to the tenth embodiment. This window <b>3201</b> is embedded in the side wall of the container <b>3109</b>, and it is located so that the surface of Ga <b>3110</b> can be observed therethrough, and the glass thereof may touch the Ga liquid <b>3110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0293">Moreover, preferably, coating of GaN thin film is made on the inside walls of the window <b>3201</b> and the container <b>3109</b>. When the inside walls of the window <b>3201</b> and container <b>3109</b> which the liquid Ga touches have the same material (GaN in this case), the container <b>3109</b> and window <b>3201</b> have the same wetting angle with respect to the liquid Ga, in the inside thereof, and thus, the container <b>3109</b> and window <b>3201</b> become wet uniformly with the liquid Ga. Consequently, it becomes possible to properly observe the remaining amount of liquid Ga in the container <b>3109</b> to be fed into the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0294">Since the stainless steel surface and the surface of glass have different wetting angles, proper observation of Ga residual amount would be difficult if there were no such a GaN thin film coating.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0295">Thus, according to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the amount of Ga liquid being fed to the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> can be checked because the Ga residual quantity in the container <b>3109</b> can be checked on real time, and the crystal growth control performance on the GaN crystal in the tenth embodiment improves further. That is, control on the ratio in amount of Ga in the mixed molten liquid <b>3103</b> improves, and thereby, the yielded crystal quality can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0296"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of a liquid Ga surface observation device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> also shows a side elevational sectional view of the container <b>3109</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, Ga <b>3110</b> is held by the container <b>3109</b>, and it is in liquid state as a result of the temperature of the container <b>3109</b> is kept approximately 40 degrees C. In addition, the container <b>3109</b> is made by stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0297">Moreover, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, an ultrasonic unit <b>3501</b> for Ga surface check is provided in a part of the outer side wall of the container <b>3109</b>. This ultrasonic unit <b>3501</b> includes a transmitter of an ultrasonic wave, a receiver thereof, and a control system, and thereby, it is possible to observe the position on the surface of liquid of Ga according to detected difference in ultrasonic propagation in the container <b>3109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0298">In this configuration, since it is not necessary to embed a special device such as a window in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> into the wall of the container <b>3109</b>, the pressure-resistant ability is higher, and thereby, high flexibility in crystal growth pressure is obtained which is the important item of crystal growth conditions. Further, the safety performance also increases. Furthermore, no special inside coating as in the above-mentioned example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is needed because the liquid Ga always touches the same the material of the original wall of the container <b>3109</b>. Consequently, cost reduction is attained.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0299">Moreover, the ultrasonic unit <b>3501</b> can be moved on the outer wall of the Ga container <b>3109</b> vertically to follow the current surface of the liquid Ga, and thereby, the position of the surface of liquid of Ga <b>3110</b> can be positively detected. Accordingly, the amount of Ga liquid being fed to the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> can be checked because the Ga residual quantity in the container <b>3109</b> can be checked on real time, and the crystal growth control performance on the GaN crystal in the tenth embodiment improves further.

<p id="p-0294" num="0300"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates a third example of a liquid Ga surface observation device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows a side elevational sectional view of the material holding container <b>3109</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. Also in this configuration, Ga <b>3110</b> is held by the container <b>3109</b>. There, Ga <b>3110</b> is in liquid state as the temperature of the Ga container <b>3109</b> is kept approximately 40 degrees C. In addition, the container <b>3109</b> is made by stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0301">Moreover, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, an electrode <b>3401</b> is held at a position near the surface of Ga <b>3110</b>. This electrode <b>3401</b> can be moved vertically according to the height change in the surface of Ga <b>3110</b>. Moreover, on the outside of the container <b>3109</b>, a power supply unit <b>3402</b> is provided. The power supply unit <b>3402</b> includes a power supply source, a resistor, an ammeter, etc. One terminal of the power supply unit <b>3402</b> is connected to the electrode <b>3401</b> positioned inside of the container <b>3109</b> by a first electric wiring <b>1403</b>. Moreover, the other terminal of the power supply unit <b>3402</b> is connected to the outer wall of the container <b>3109</b> by a second electric wiring <b>3404</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0302">In such a situation, when the electrode <b>3401</b> is in contact with Ga <b>3110</b>, an electric current is made to flow into the ammeter in the power supply unit <b>3402</b>. On the other hand, after Ga is fed into the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b>, the surface of Ga in the container <b>3109</b> thus falls, and the electrode <b>3401</b> is made apart from the Ga surface. Then, the electric current flow is terminated accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0303">By utilizing the above-descried principle, according to the example shows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the electrode <b>3401</b> is lowered until the electric current starts flowing into the ammeter in the power supply unit <b>3402</b>, and, thus, it is possible to detect/observe the current surface position of the Ga <b>3110</b> in the container <b>3109</b></p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0304">Also in this configuration, since it is not necessary to embed a special device such as a window in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> into the wall of the container <b>3109</b>, the pressure-resistant ability is high, and thereby, high flexibility in crystal growth pressure is obtained which is the important item of crystal growth conditions. Further, the safety performance also increases. Furthermore, no special inside coating as in the above-mentioned example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is needed because the liquid Ga always touches the same the material of the original wall of the container <b>3109</b>.

<p id="p-0299" num="0305">Moreover, the amount of Ga liquid being fed to the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> can be checked because the Ga residual quantity in the container <b>3109</b> can be checked on real time, and the crystal growth control performance on the GaN crystal in the tenth embodiment improves further.

<p id="p-0300" num="0306">Also a group-III nitride crystal yielded according to this tenth embodiment of the present invention, may be applied to a group-III nitride semiconductor device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> as in the cases of the first through ninth embodiments.

<p id="p-0302" num="0308">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, as in the above-mentioned other embodiments, a mixed molten liquid holding container <b>4102</b> holding a mixed molten liquid <b>4103</b> of an alkaline metal (for example, Na) and a substance which contains a group-III metal (for example, Ga) at least, is provided in a reaction vessel <b>4101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0309">In addition, the alkaline metal (for example, Na) may be supplied from the outside, or may exist in the reaction vessel <b>3101</b> from the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0310">Moreover, the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> is made by stainless steel. Moreover, the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>3102</b> is made by BN (boron nitride), AlN, or pyrolytic BN.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0311">Moreover, a nitrogen supply pipe <b>4104</b> for supplying a substance (for example, nitrogen gas, ammonia gas, or sodium azide) which contains nitrogen at least, is also provided in the reaction vessel <b>4101</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0307" num="0313">Moreover, a first heating device <b>4106</b> is provided for controlling the inside temperature of the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> to the temperature at which crystal growth of the group-III nitride (for example GaN) may occur in the reaction vessel <b>4101</b>. That is, as in each of the above-described embodiments, by the temperature control function of the first heating device <b>4106</b>, the temperature is raised so that the crystal growth may occur, is lowered so that the crystal growth stops, each of these temperatures is kept for a predetermined time interval, appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0314">Moreover, in order to supply the substance (referred to as a group-III material) which contains a group-III metal in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus, at least to the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> from the exterior of the reaction vessel <b>4101</b>, a container <b>4110</b> holding the group-III material is provided in the exterior of the reaction vessel <b>4101</b>. The amount of group-III material (for example, metal Ga) consumed in the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> (for example, Ga consumption made for causing crystal growth of GaN from Ga and N) is supplemented from this material holding container <b>4110</b> holding the group-III material (for example, metal Ga) in liquid state as a result of being heated by means of a second heating device <b>4112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0315">A first supply pipe <b>4107</b> and a second supply pipe <b>4109</b> connect this container <b>4110</b> to the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>4102</b> in the reaction vessel <b>4101</b>, and, thereby, the group-III material can be supplied to the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>4102</b> from the material holding container <b>4110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0316">Moreover, in order to cause stable continuous supply of the group-III material from the container <b>4110</b> to the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> through the supply pipes <b>4107</b> and <b>4109</b>, a pump (liquid-feeding pump) <b>4108</b> is provided between the first supply pipe <b>4107</b> and the second supply pipe <b>4109</b> in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, as this pump <b>4108</b>, such a type that, thereby, rotational movement of a motor is transformed into a linear reciprocating movement of a rod, may be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0317">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the container <b>4110</b> is located on the upstream side (right side in the figure) of the second supply pipe <b>4109</b>, and the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> is located on the downstream side (left side in the figure) of the first supply pipe <b>4107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0318">A motor <b>4201</b> rotates a rotational shaft <b>4202</b> according to a given electric signal. This rotational shaft <b>4202</b> is coupled with a cam <b>4203</b> at an eccentric position thereof. Also, the cam <b>4203</b> has an ellipse shape. Moreover, the rod <b>4204</b> always touches the side surface of the cam <b>4203</b>. By such a configuration, according to a well-known mechanism, the rod <b>4204</b> performs the reciprocating action along arrows A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> shown in the figure according to rotation of the cam <b>4203</b> caused by the rotation of the rotational shaft <b>4202</b> by the motor <b>4201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0319">This rod <b>4204</b> is inserted into one pipe portion <b>4205</b><i>a </i>of a T-shape third supply pipe <b>4205</b>. The other pipe portions <b>4205</b><i>b </i>and <b>4205</b><i>c </i>of the third supply pipe <b>4205</b> are connected with a first check valve (or non-return valve) <b>4206</b> and a second check valve (or non-return valve) <b>4207</b>, respectively. Also, the downstream end of the first check valve <b>4206</b> is connected with the first supply pipe <b>4107</b>, while the upstream end of the second check valve <b>4207</b> is connected with the second supply pipe <b>4109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0320">In each of the first and second check valves <b>4026</b> and <b>4207</b>, springs <b>4208</b> and <b>4209</b>, and balls <b>4210</b> and <b>4211</b> are provided, respectively. The internal structures of these check valves are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. As shown in the figure, the balls <b>4210</b> and <b>4211</b> are arranged at the upstream side, and the springs <b>4208</b> and <b>4209</b> press these balls <b>4210</b> and <b>4211</b> from the downstream side. There, the balls <b>4210</b> and <b>4211</b> stop at the upstream end of the valves <b>4206</b> and <b>4207</b>, respectively. When the balls <b>4210</b>, <b>4211</b> touch openings <b>4206</b><i>a </i>and <b>4207</b><i>a </i>of the valves <b>4206</b> and <b>4207</b>, the valves are closed, respectively, and thus no flow along the reverse direction (from the downstream side to the upstream side) is allowed there.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0321">In this configuration, when the rod <b>4204</b> moves by the pump <b>4108</b> along the arrow A<b>2</b>, the inside of the third supply pipe <b>4205</b> enters a decompressed state, and thereby, the group-III material in liquid state is drawn in from the container <b>4110</b>. At this time, the first check valve <b>4206</b> prevents the adverse flow because the ball <b>4210</b> moves to the upstream side, while the ball <b>4211</b> of the second check valve <b>4207</b> can be moved to the downstream side. Thereby, the group-III material in liquid state can be drawn in from the container <b>4110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0322">On the contrary, when the rod <b>4204</b> moves along the direction of arrow Al, the inside of the third supply pipe <b>4205</b> enters a compressed state, and the group-III material in liquid state drawn in from the container <b>4110</b> as mentioned above is then pushed out to the downstream side (toward the reaction vessel <b>4101</b>). At this time, the adverse flow of the group-III material in liquid state can be prevented as the ball <b>4211</b> of the second check value <b>4207</b> moves to the upstream side, while, as the ball <b>4210</b> moves to the down-stream side in the check valve <b>4026</b>, the group-III material in liquid state can be forwarded to the reaction vessel <b>4101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0323">In this configuration, the rate of feeding the group-III material in liquid state into the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> can be controlled by controlling the rotation speed of the motor <b>4201</b> so as to control the reciprocating movement speed of the rod <b>4204</b>. Thus, it becomes possible to control the feeding rate of the group-III material in liquid state into the reaction vessel <b>4101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0324">Thus, the liquid-sending speed of the group-III material in liquid state into the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> can be controlled, and thus, the group-III material can be stably supplied to the reaction vessel <b>4101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0325">According to an experiment, for the purpose of fine control of the material feeding rate of the group-III material by mean of the pump <b>4108</b>, the material of the balls <b>4210</b> and <b>4211</b> of the check values <b>4206</b> and <b>4207</b> is essential. Namely, the density of the balls <b>4210</b> and <b>4211</b> in the check valves <b>4206</b> and <b>4207</b> should be higher than the density of the group-III material to be fed. Experiments were conducted for cases of using stainless steel (density being 8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), sapphire, and glass (density being 4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) as the material of the balls <b>4210</b> and <b>4211</b>, while density (for example, density of metal Ga) of group-III material is approximately 6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. As a result, by using the stainless steel of higher density than the density of group-III material as the material of balls <b>4210</b> and <b>4211</b>, the check valves <b>4206</b> and <b>4207</b> performed satisfactory operation as mentioned above. On the other hand, when sapphire, glass, or the like, having the density lower than the density of group-III material was used as the material of the balls <b>4210</b> and <b>4211</b>, the check valves <b>4206</b> and <b>4207</b> did not operate properly and, rather, the group-III material in liquid state flowed backwards.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0326">In addition, in this embodiment, not only a spherical shape but also another shape such as an ellipse shape or a polygon shape may be applied as the balls of the check values.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0327">Moreover, a second heating device <b>4112</b> is provided for carrying out temperature control of the first supply pipe <b>4107</b>, second supply pipe <b>4109</b>, pump <b>4108</b>, and container <b>4110</b> in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The group-III material can be kept liquid state as the temperature of the first supply pipe <b>4107</b>, second supply pipe <b>4109</b>, pump <b>4108</b>, and container <b>4110</b> as approximately 40 degrees C. by the second heating device <b>4112</b>. Thereby, the group-III material held by the container <b>4110</b>, and, the same being fed therefrom into the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> through the second supply pipe <b>4109</b>, pump <b>4108</b>, and first supply pipe <b>4107</b> are kept liquid state.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0328">Crystal growth of the group-III nitride can be made to start in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> by setting the temperature in the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> and the effective nitrogen partial pressure there as the conditions at which the group-III nitride crystal starts crystal growth.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0329">Concretely, the nitrogen pressure in the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> is made into 50 atmospheres, and the temperature in the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> is raised to the temperature of 750 degrees C. at which crystal growth starts. By keeping this growth condition for a predetermined time interval, the group-III nitride crystal (for example, GaN crystal) <b>4111</b> grows in the mixed molten liquid holding container <b>4102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0330">At this time, the pump <b>4108</b> is used to supply the group-III material from the container <b>4110</b> for supplementing the amount of group-III material (for example, Ga) consumed in the group-III nitride crystal growth apparatus for yielding the group-III nitride crystal (for example, GaN) <b>4111</b> through crystal growth. The group-III material is supplied in liquid state to the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> through the second supply pipe <b>4109</b> and the first supply pipe <b>4107</b>. Moreover, the nitrogen is also supplied for supplementing the consumed nitrogen for the above-mentioned crystal growth through the nitrogen gas supply pipe <b>4104</b> in the state of nitrogen gas.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0331">Thus, after growth of the group-III nitride crystal begins, the group-III nitride crystal can be continuously grown up by having the group-III material (substance which contains group-III metal at least) fed in the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> (and to the container <b>4103</b>) from the container <b>4110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0332">Thus, by utilizing the pump <b>4108</b>, stable and continuous supply of the group-III material to the reaction vessel <b>4101</b> can be achieved. Accordingly, the group-III nitride crystal (for example, GaN crystal) <b>4111</b> can be grown up well, and the group-III nitride crystal (GaN crystal) having a large size can be yielded. Thus, without needing a complicated process. A quality group-III nitride crystal can be obtained at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0333">Furthermore, according to the eleventh embodiment, especially, by continuously supplying the group-III material, it becomes possible to make the amount ratio of Ga in the mixed molten liquid <b>4103</b>, consequently to grow up the good group-III nitride crystal <b>4111</b> with a low defect density.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0334">Also a group-III nitride crystal yielded according to this eleventh embodiment of the present invention may be applied to a group-III nitride semiconductor device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> as in the cases of the first through tenth embodiments. Also in this case, the same advantages can be obtained as in the case of applying the first through tenth embodiments described above.</p>

<p id="p-0351" num="0357">Moreover, in this fourteenth embodiment, the first container <b>5068</b> by which the group-III nitride (for example, GaN) is held is placed on the top of the second container <b>5069</b>, and thus, acts as a lid of the second container <b>5069</b>. Moreover, the first container <b>5068</b> has a cylindrical inner wall, and, the group-III nitride <b>5072</b> adheres to this inner wall. Then, the group-III metal molten liquid <b>5073</b> obtained from decomposition of the group-III nitride drops into the second container <b>5069</b> from the first container <b>5068</b> as it runs on the inner wall of the first container <b>5068</b>.

<p id="p-0352" num="0358">In addition, the material of the first container <b>5068</b> and second container <b>5069</b> is BN (boron nitride).</p>

<p id="p-0355" num="0361">Moreover, heaters <b>5065</b> and <b>5066</b> are provided in the outside of the cover <b>5067</b>.

<p id="p-0356" num="0362">Next, a method of growing GaN crystal employing the crystal growth apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> will now be described. First, synthesis of GaN is performed in the first container <b>5068</b>. In order to perform this synthesis, at first, the upper and lower sides of the first container <b>5068</b> are made upside-down from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. Then, Na, the alkaline metal, and the metal Ga are put into the first container <b>5068</b>. Then, this first container <b>5068</b> is put into a reaction vessel identical to the reaction vessel <b>5060</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. Then, the inside atmosphere of the reaction vessel is kept at 600 degrees C. with a pressure of nitrogen of 8 MPa for 100 hours. Thereby, fine crystals of GaN are synthesized inside of the first container <b>5068</b>. The fine crystals of GaN stick to the inner wall of the first container (decomposition container) <b>5068</b>, and, they do not fall even when the container <b>5068</b> is made upside-down as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0363">In addition, all Na used as the alkaline metal evaporates, and does not remain in the first container <b>5068</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0364">Next, crystal growth for GaN single crystals in the second container <b>5069</b> is performed as described below. First, Na is newly put into the second container <b>5069</b> as the alkaline metal. Then, on the second container <b>5069</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the first container <b>5068</b> is placed, and, in this state, they are set in the reaction vessel <b>5060</b>. Then, the cover <b>5067</b> made of stainless steel is put on the first and second containers <b>5068</b> and <b>5069</b>, and the heaters <b>5065</b> and <b>5066</b> are provided at predetermined positions. The series of above-mentioned steps are performed in a high-purity Ar gas atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0365">Subsequently, the reaction vessel <b>5060</b> is sealed, valve <b>5062</b> is closed, and thus, the inside of the reaction vessel <b>5060</b> is made separate from the external atmosphere. Subsequently, the temperatures of the heaters <b>5065</b> and <b>5066</b> are increased to predetermined temperatures, respectively. At this time, the temperature of the first container <b>5068</b> is made into 1000 degrees C., while a crystal growth zone in the second container <b>5069</b> is made into 700 degrees C.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0366">Subsequently, the valve <b>5062</b> is opened, the nitrogen gas is put into the reaction vessel <b>5060</b> from the nitrogen gas supply pipe <b>5061</b>, the pressure control device <b>5063</b> adjusts the pressure, and the total pressure in the reaction vessel <b>5060</b> is made to be 3 MPa. Subsequently, by controlling the temperature of the heater <b>5065</b> so as to fluctuate the temperature of the first container <b>5068</b> up and down on both sides with respect to the decomposition temperature of the group-III nitride. Then, after keeping this state for 200 hours, the temperatures of the heaters are lowered. During this period, the decomposed group-III metal and nitrogen coming from the first container <b>5068</b> are used as the materials, and, thereby, the group-III nitride crystal grows in the second container <b>5069</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0367">In an experiment, then, the pressure of the gas in the reaction vessel <b>5060</b> was lowered, then, when the reaction vessel <b>5060</b> was opened, in the second container <b>5069</b>, single crystals <b>5075</b> and <b>5076</b> of GaN with size of approximately 10 mm were yielded through the crystal growth there.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0368">Thus, according to the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth embodiments of the present invention, after decomposing the group-III nitride into group-III metal and nitrogen, group-III nitride crystal is made to re-grow up by utilizing at least one of the group-III metal and nitrogen thus obtained through the decomposition. For this purpose, in the first container, the group-III nitride is decomposed, and, then, at least one of the group-III nitride and nitrogen is supplied to the second container. Then, after that, in the second container, the group-III nitride crystals are made to re-grow. For this purpose, the temperatures of the first and second containers can be controlled independently. Thereby, it is possible to produce practical-large-sized and, high-quality group-III nitride crystals at low costs.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0369">As to the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth embodiments, a specific way of the step of decomposition is not limited to the heating process as described above, and, various methods, i.e., decomposition by lowering the pressure of nitrogen in a heat balance state with the group-III nitride, or the like may also be applied. Further, it is also possible that the decomposition step and re-growth step are performed not only in the separate containers as described above, but also may be performed in a common container.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0370">As the alkaline metal, not only sodium but also potassium may be used. The group-III nitride means a compound of the group-III metal such as gallium, aluminum or indium with nitrogen (not only a binary, but also, ternary, or quaternary compound may be applied therefor). Furthermore, the group-III nitride to be decomposed should not necessarily be a single crystalline one but may be a polycrystalline one, and, also, the size of particles may be various ones, i.e., powders, fine crystals, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0371">Further, in case where only the group-III metal obtained through the decomposition is used as the material for group-III nitride crystal growth, nitrogen may be supplied from another nitrogen material such as nitrogen gas, or another compound of nitrogen with any of various elements. The nitrogen material may be of gas phase, liquid phase, or solid phase. The nitrogen gas may be supplied from the outside of the reaction vessel or may be previously molten in the alkaline molten liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0372">In case where the nitrogen obtained from the decomposition is used as the material for re-growth of group-III nitride crystal, it is preferable to previously apply the nitrogen partial pressure by filling the reaction vessel with nitrogen gas so as to prevent the nitrogen from escaping from the molten liquid into a gas phase.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0373">By providing the material for the crystal growth from the previously prepared nitride inside of the reaction vessel, it is possible to omit a special provision to supply the same from the outside. Accordingly, it is possible to simplify the system, and, also, it is possible to prevent a problem of condensation of the material in a supply pipe or so if any.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0374">Furthermore, according to the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth embodiments, the group-III metal obtained by decomposition in the first container is supplied to the second container, and, then, is molten into the Na metal molten liquid. Then, through reaction between the nitrogen molten there and the group-III metal thus supplied, the group-III nitride crystal grows. In order to transport the group-III metal obtained through the decomposition from the first container to the second container, various methods may be applied. As in the embodiments, simply a supply pipe or a supply hole may be provided for this purpose between the two containers.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0375">In this configuration of preparing the two containers, it is possible to set suitable conditions (for example, temperatures) on the respective containers independently. Thereby, it is possible to perform the crystal growth at the optimum conditions, and, thus, to yield high-quality crystals. Furthermore, by providing the first container above the second container, the group-III metal obtained through the decomposition can be made to drop into the second container by its self gravity. Accordingly, it is possible to simplify the system.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0376">Further, according to the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>, as it is not necessary to apply a special pressure from the outside, it is possible to use an inexpensive materials as the containers. For example, as the first container, ceramic or the like which does not react with the group-III metal even at high temperature may be applied. In this case, as it is possible to make the crystal growth at high temperature, blockage of supply pipe or the like due to low-temperature condensation can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0377">Further, by fluctuating the temperature of the first container with respect to the group-III nitride decomposition temperature, it is possible to appropriately control the feeding rate of the group-III metal to the second container. That is, by raising the temperature above the decomposition temperature, the feeding is performed, and, thus, the crystal growth progresses. However, when the temperature is lowered below the decomposition temperature, the feeding is stopped, and, thus, the crystal growth is stopped. Accordingly, it is possible to arbitrarily control the crystal growth. Thereby, it is possible to proceed with crystal growth in the optimum conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0378">Furthermore, by previously causing the group-III metal obtained through the decomposition to adhere to the inner surface of the first container, it is possible to supply only the group-III metal obtained through the decomposition to the second container for the group-III nitride crystal growth from the first container. Accordingly, it is possible to avoid generation of extra crystal nucleuses, and to achieve yielding of a large sized single crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0379">Further, by previously causing reaction between a group-III metal and a nitride material in a molten alkaline metal in the first container, and, then, after that, decomposing the thus-obtained group-III nitride so as to supply the thus-obtained material to group-III nitride crystal growth, it is possible to omit operation of bringing the material from another container to the first container. Accordingly, it is possible to eliminate occasions of the material being contaminated by impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0380">Furthermore, as it is possible to set the temperatures of the first and second containers independently, it is possible to change only the temperature of the first container so as to control the amount of decomposition of the group-III nitride, and to control the feeding amount of the group-III metal for the crystal growth, as mentioned above.</p>
