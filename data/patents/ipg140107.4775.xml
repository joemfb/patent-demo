<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-212270, filed on Sep. 14, 2009, and Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-186578, filed on Aug. 23, 2010; the entire contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a radiation diagnostic apparatus and an image reconstructing method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a positron emission computed tomography (PET) apparatus and an X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) apparatus have been known as a radiation diagnostic apparatus that use radiation. Such a radiation diagnostic apparatus presents images created on the basis of its own characteristics, and thereby realizes image diagnosis essential to today's medical practice.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A PET apparatus is one of nuclear medicine diagnostic devices, which offers detailed functional information on human body tissue in the form of images. More specifically, when a drug labeled with positron emitting radionuclides are introduced to a subject and positrons emitted from the introduced drug are bound to electrons and annihilated, the PET apparatus conducts coincidence counting on a pair of 511-keV gamma rays that are emitted substantially in opposite directions, by use of a detector having photon-counting detector modules arranged around the subject in the form of a ring. Then, the PET apparatus performs computations on the coincidence counting data of the gamma rays, and thereby reconstructs an image (PET image) that shows the distribution of the human body tissue into which the drug is introduced.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The coincidence counting process performed by the PET apparatus is now explained. First, in the PET apparatus, multiple Anger-type detector modules that each include scintillators in which NaI, BGO and the like are two-dimensionally aligned to convert the incident gamma rays to visible light and multiple photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) densely arranged by way of a light guide are arranged in the form of a ring (for example, see &#x201c;Medical Image/Radiological Equipment Hand Book&#x201d; edited by Japan Industries Association of Radiological Systems, published by Nago Bijutsu Insatsu Kabushiki Kaisha, 2001, pp. 190-191). The light guide is made of a light transmissive plastic or the like and used to transfer the visible light output by the scintillators to the PMTs. The PMTs multiply the visible light output by the scintillators and convert it to electric signals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A coincidence circuit connected to the PMTs of each detector module generates coincidence counting information based on the results output by each detector module to determine the incident direction of a pair of gamma rays that are emitted from the positrons. More specifically, the coincidence circuit determines the incident position of the gamma rays in the detector module (i.e., the position of the scintillator) by calculating the position of the center of gravity from the positions of the PMTs that convert the visible light scattered from the scintillator to electric signals at the same timing and output the signals and the energy of the incident gamma rays corresponding to the intensity of the electric signals. In addition, the coincidence circuit integrates the intensity of the electric signal output by each PMT, and thereby calculates the energy value of the gamma ray that is incident on the detector module.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Then, the coincidence circuit performs a search (coincidence finding) for a combination of the results output by the detector modules, for example, in which the incident timing of the gamma ray falls within a specific time window width (e.g., 2 nanoseconds) and the energy values are within a specific energy window width (e.g., 350 keV to 550 keV). Then, the coincidence circuit generates coincidence counting information (coincidence list) as coincidentally counting information of two annihilation photons. Then, the PET apparatus uses the generated coincidence counting information as projection data (sinogram data), and reconstitutes a PET image by performing a back projection process on the projection data. In the coincidence circuit, random corrections can be made by use of a count ratio (count/sec) to eliminate the random coincidence that is included stochastically at a certain rate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, the X-ray CT apparatus is one of transmission CT apparatus, which offers detailed morphological information of human body tissue. More specifically, in the X-ray CT apparatus, the subject is irradiated with x rays from multiple directions by rotating the x-ray tube and the current-mode measuring detector in pair around the body axis of the subject, and the detector measures the intensity in different directions of the x rays that have been absorbed and attenuated when passing through the body. Then, by performing the back projection process on the projection data generated from the x-ray intensity distribution obtained by the detector, an X-ray CT image showing the morphological information of the human body tissue of the subject is reconstituted.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, recently, in the X-ray CT apparatus, a photon-counting CT that incorporates a photon-counting detector used in a PET apparatus or the like, in place of a conventional current-mode measuring detector, has been developed. In the photon-counting CT, each detection element of the photon-counting detector executes counting of the energy value of the X-rays that pass through the subject, and therefore a spectrum from which elements that constitute the body tissue of the X-rayed subject can be estimated can be prepared as projection data, and therefore an X-ray CT image describing differences in element level can be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With a conventional PET apparatus, however, coincidence counting information generated only by a coincidence circuit that is a piece of hardware can be stored, which means that no coincidence counting information with a modified time window width or energy window width can be regenerated. In other words, with the conventional PET apparatus, the results output by detector modules are abandoned if they are determined as not coincident. For this reason, if a PET image needs to be corrected in response to a request from a reader of the PET image, for example, that the PET image should be reconstituted with a modified time window width or energy window width, a PET image has to be newly taken.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, with the above photon-counting CT, only projection data is stored, but the counting result obtained by the photon-counting detector is not stored. Thus, image corrections such as scattered radiation corrections cannot be made by use of the counting results of the detector in response to a request from the reader of an x-ray CT image.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the above conventional technologies, a medical image that is reconstituted by use of radiation cannot be quickly corrected in response to a request from a reader.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The PET apparatus performs coincidence counting on a pair of gamma rays emitted from body tissue to which positron emitting radionuclides given to the subject are introduced, and thereby reconstitutes a PET image showing the distribution of the body tissue to which the positron emitting radionuclides are introduced. Then, the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment is configured to quickly correct the PET image in response to a request from the reader.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The configuration of the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment is now explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram for explaining a configuration of a PET apparatus according to a first embodiment. The PET apparatus according to the first embodiment includes a gantry apparatus <b>10</b> and a console device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The gantry apparatus <b>10</b> executes counting during a predetermined monitoring period onto pairs of gamma ray emitted from the positron emitting radionuclides that are introduced to a subject P and selectively taken into the living tissue of the subject P. The gantry apparatus <b>10</b> includes a top plate <b>11</b>, a couch <b>12</b>, a couch driving unit <b>13</b>, detector modules <b>14</b>, and a counting information collecting unit <b>15</b>. The gantry apparatus <b>10</b> has an opening, which serves as an imaging space as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The top plate <b>11</b> is a bed on which the subject P lies, and arranged on top of the couch <b>12</b>. The couch driving unit <b>13</b> moves the couch <b>12</b> under the control of a couch controlling unit <b>23</b>, which will be described later, and thereby carries the subject P into the imaging space of the gantry apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The detector modules <b>14</b> are photon-counting detectors that detect gamma rays emitted from the subject P. In the gantry apparatus <b>10</b>, multiple detector modules <b>14</b> are arranged in the form of a ring to surround the subject P.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">More specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a detector module <b>14</b> is an Anger-type detector that includes scintillators <b>141</b>, photomultiplier tubes <b>142</b> (PMTs), and a light guide <b>143</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are diagrams for explaining the detector module and the counting information collecting unit according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The scintillators <b>141</b> are, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, two-dimensionally aligned NaI, BGO, and the like that is to convert the incident gamma rays emitted from the subject P to visible light. Furthermore, the photomultiplier tubes <b>142</b> multiply the visible light output by the scintillators <b>141</b> and convert it to an electrical signal. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the multiple photomultiplier tubes <b>142</b> are densely arranged by way of the light guide <b>143</b>. The light guide <b>143</b> is used to transfer the visible light output by the scintillators <b>141</b> to the photomultiplier tubes <b>142</b>, and is formed of a plastic material or the like with excellent optical transmission characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The photomultiplier tubes <b>142</b> have a photocathode that receives scintillation light and generates photoelectrons, multistage dynodes that provide an electric field for accelerating the generated photoelectrons and an anode that is an outlet of the electrons. With the photoelectric effect, the electrons emitted from the photocathode are accelerated toward the dynodes and collide against the surface of the dynodes, throwing multiple electrons out. Because this phenomenon is repeated over the multistage dynodes, the number of electrons is multiplied in the form of avalanche, reaching approximately one million at the end of the anode. In this example, the gain ratio of the photomultiplier tubes <b>142</b> is one million-fold. Because of the amplification using the avalanche phenomenon, a voltage of 1000 volts or higher is usually applied between the dynodes and the anode.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other words, the detector modules <b>14</b> counts the number of gamma rays emitted from the subject P by converting the gamma rays into visible light at the scintillators <b>141</b> and converting the converted visible light to electric signals at the electronic photomultiplier tubes <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> collects the counting results obtained by each of the detector modules <b>14</b>, as counting information. More specifically, the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> collects, for each detector modules <b>14</b>, the detection position of the gamma ray detected by the detector module <b>14</b>, the energy value of the gamma ray at the incident time to the detector module <b>14</b>, and the detection time of the gamma ray at the detector module <b>14</b>, as counting information based on the counting results obtained by the detector module <b>14</b>, and transmits the collected counting information to the console device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">First, the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> performs an Anger-type position calculating process to collect the detection position from the counting results of the detector modules <b>14</b>. Alternatively, when the photomultiplier tubes <b>142</b> are position-detecting photomultiplier tubes, the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> performs collection of the detection position at the position-detecting photomultiplier tubes. In particular, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> calculates the position of the center of gravity from the positions of the photomultiplier tubes <b>142</b> that convert and output scintillation light of the scintillators <b>141</b> to electrical signals at the same timing and the gamma ray energy value corresponding to the intensities of the electrical signals, and thereby determines the scintillator number (P) designating the incident position of the gamma ray to the scintillator. Furthermore, the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> integrates the intensity of the electrical signal output by each photomultiplier tube <b>142</b>, and thereby determines the energy value (E) of the gamma ray incident to the detector module. The counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> also collects the detection time (T) at which the detector modules <b>14</b> detect the gamma ray.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The detection time (T) may be an absolute time (clock time) or a relative time with respect to the PET imaging start time. The counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> collects the detection time (T) with precision to 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>seconds (picoseconds). With such a process, the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> collects, as counting information, &#x201c;P: scintillator number&#x201d;, &#x201c;E: energy value&#x201d; and &#x201c;T: detection time&#x201d; that identify a detector module <b>14</b> in correspondence with a &#x201c;module ID&#x201d;, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The display unit <b>22</b> is a monitor that the operator checks.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> stores therein, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the counting information collected from the counting results by the detector modules <b>14</b> of &#x201c;module ID: D<b>2</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;module ID: D<b>3</b>&#x201d;, in the same manner as the above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> searches for a combination of counting information items in which a pair of gamma rays emitted from the positron emitting radionuclides are coincidentally counted, based on at least the detection times of the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b>. Then, the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> generates coincidence counting information from the detected combination of the counting information items that is to determine the incident direction of the pair of gamma rays emitted from positrons. The coincidence counting information generated by the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> is used as the projection data for the process performed by the image reconstituting unit <b>26</b>, which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In particular, the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> generates the coincidence counting information, based on coincidence counting information generating conditions contained in the reconstituting conditions input by the operator by way of the input unit <b>21</b>. Here, the coincidence counting information generating conditions designate, for example, the time window width and the energy window width. For example, the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> generates the coincidence counting information by use of the coincidence counting information generating conditions &#x201c;time window width: 600 picoseconds, energy window width: 350 keV to 550 keV&#x201d; designated by the operator, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are diagrams for explaining the coincidence counting information generating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In particular, the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> refers to &#x201c;detection times (T)&#x201d; and &#x201c;energy values (E)&#x201d; for each module ID illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and searches for a combination of counting information items among the modules, in which a difference in the detection times is within &#x201c;time window width: 600 picoseconds&#x201d; and the energy values are both within &#x201c;energy window width: 350 keV to 550 keV&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this manner, the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> generates coincidence counting information of two coincidentally counted annihilation photons, for example, from a combination of &#x201c;P: P<b>11</b>, E: E<b>11</b>, T: T<b>11</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;P: P<b>22</b>, E: E<b>22</b>, T: T<b>22</b>&#x201d;, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Then, the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> stores the generated coincidence counting information as the projection data (sinogram data) of the subject P in the data storage unit <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition to the time window width and the energy window width, the operator is allowed to incorporate, in the coincidence counting information generating conditions, parameters such as for random corrections for excluding a random coincidence, scattering corrections for excluding the counting information of the scattered gamma rays from the coincidence counting information, sensitivity corrections for correcting a difference in the sensitivities of the detector modules <b>14</b>, and attenuation corrections for correcting the energy value of the gamma rays that are attenuated in the subject P.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image reconstituting unit <b>26</b> reads the coincidence counting information generated by the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> as projection data from the data storage unit <b>27</b>, and performs a back projection process on the read-out projection data to reconstitute a PET image.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The system controlling unit <b>28</b> controls the operations of the gantry apparatus <b>10</b> and the console device <b>20</b>, and thereby performs control of the entire PET apparatus.

Further, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> controls the process of generating the coincidence counting information at the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> and the process of reconstituting the PET image at the image reconstituting unit <b>26</b>, based on the setting information input by the operator by way of the input unit <b>21</b>. In addition, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> performs control so that the PET image stored in the data storage unit <b>27</b> is displayed on the display unit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, after the reconstitution of the PET image, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> performs control so that all or part of the counting information is stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b>. For example, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> performs control so that all the counting information including the counting information that is not adopted as coincidence counting information is maintained in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> performs control so that the counting information except for the counting information instructed by the operator by way of the input unit <b>21</b> to abandon is maintained in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Moreover, when receiving a request of changing the coincidence counting information generating conditions for generating the coincidence counting information after the reconstitution of the PET image, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> performs the following control. That is, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> controls the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> based on the changed coincidence counting information generating conditions so that the coincidence counting information is regenerated from the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b>. Then, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> controls the image reconstituting unit <b>26</b> so that the PET image is reconstituted again by use of the coincidence counting information regenerated by the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> displays a GUI for inputting coincidence counting information generating conditions on the display unit <b>22</b>, in response to an instruction from the operator. Then, the operator changes the coincidence counting information generating conditions, for example, indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, by referring to the inputting GUI. The operator may change the time window width from &#x201c;600 picoseconds&#x201d; to &#x201c;400 picoseconds&#x201d;. The changed coincidence counting information generating conditions are notified to the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> by way of the system controlling unit <b>28</b>. Thus, the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> re-searches through the counting information illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for a combination of counting information items that agree with the changed coincidence counting information generating conditions, and generates the coincidence counting information. Then, the image reconstituting unit <b>26</b> reconstitutes, under the control of the system controlling unit <b>28</b>, a new PET image by using the coincidence counting information regenerated by the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> as projection data. Thereafter, the PET image newly reconstituted by the image reconstituting unit <b>26</b> is displayed on the display unit <b>22</b> under the control of the system controlling unit <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When receiving a request to transfer the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> to a storage medium, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> performs control so that the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> is put into the storage medium. For example, at the time of maintenance of the like of the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment, the operator inputs by way of the input unit <b>21</b> a request to transfer the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> in a detachable external storage medium such as a flexible disk drive (FD), a compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM), a magneto optical disk (MO), and a digital versatile disk (DVD). The system controlling unit <b>28</b> that receives the transfer request performs control so that the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> is put into the storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, the process performed by the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are flowcharts for explaining the process of the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment receives an imaging request for a PET image from the operator by way of the input unit <b>21</b> after carrying the subject P into the imaging space of the gantry apparatus <b>10</b> (yes at step S<b>101</b>), the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> collects the counting information based on the counting results obtained by each detector module <b>14</b> during a predetermined monitoring period (step S<b>102</b>). In other words, the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> collects, as counting information for each detector module <b>14</b>, the detection position of the gamma ray detected by the detector modules <b>14</b>, the energy value of the gamma ray at the incident time on the detector module <b>14</b>, and the detection time of the gamma ray detected by the detector module <b>14</b>, based on the counting results of the detector module <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> stores the collected counting information in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> of the console device <b>20</b> (step S<b>103</b>). The coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> searches, by referring to the detection times and the energy values of the counting information, for a combination of counting information items in which a difference in the detection times is within the time window width and each of the energy values is within the energy window width, and thereby generates the coincidence counting information (step S<b>104</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thereafter, the image reconstituting unit <b>26</b> performs a back projection process on the coincidence counting information generated by the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> as projection data and thereby reconstitutes a PET image (step S<b>105</b>), and the process is terminated. The system controlling unit <b>28</b> performs control so that all the counting information is put into the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> after the reconstitution of the PET image.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, when the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment receives a request of changing the coincidence counting information generating conditions from the operator (yes at step S<b>201</b>), the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> generates the coincidence counting information again under the control of the system controlling unit <b>28</b>, in accordance with the changed coincidence counting information generating conditions (step S<b>202</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thereafter, under the control of the system controlling unit <b>28</b>, the image reconstituting unit <b>26</b> reconstitutes a new PET image by use of the regenerated coincidence counting information (step S<b>203</b>), and the process is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When receiving a transfer request from the operator, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> performs control so that the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> is put into a storage medium designated by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As explained above, according to the first embodiment, the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> collects, as the counting information based on the counting results obtained by each photon-counting detector module <b>14</b> during the predetermined monitoring period, the detection position of the gamma ray detected by the detector module <b>14</b>, the energy value of the gamma ray at the incident time on the detector modules <b>14</b>, and the detection time of the gamma ray detected by the detector modules <b>14</b>, and stores the collected counting information in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> of the console device <b>20</b>. The coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> searches, by referring to, for example, the detection times and the energy values of the counting information, for a combination of counting information items in which a difference between the detection times falls within the time window width and each of the energy values is within the energy window width, and thereby generates the coincidence counting information. The image reconstituting unit <b>26</b> performs a back projection process on the coincidence counting information generated by the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> as projection data, and thereby reconstitutes a PET image. Then, after the reconstitution of the PET image, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> performs control so that all or part of the counting information is put into the counting information storage unit <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, a conventional PET apparatus stores coincidence counting information that is generated only by the coincidence circuit provided as a hardware piece in the gantry apparatus <b>10</b>, but the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment can store all the counting information of every detector module <b>14</b> in the console device <b>20</b>, and generate coincidence counting information inside the console device <b>20</b> in accordance with a software program. In addition, the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment can hold the counting information collected during the time of taking a PET image even after the image is reconstituted.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Hence, according to the first embodiment, when the operator wishes to see a PET image that is reconstituted in accordance with different coincidence counting information generating conditions, the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> can immediately generate coincidence counting information based on the new coincidence counting information generating conditions, and quickly correct the PET image in accordance with the reader's request. Furthermore, a time-of-flight (TOF) PET apparatus that can accurately identify the emission position of gamma rays by use of a difference between the detection times of a pair of annihilation gamma rays has been developed. However, the time window width required for the TOF-PET is on the order of several hundred picoseconds. Because in a conventional PET apparatus, the signal transfer from the detector modules <b>14</b> to the coincidence circuit cannot exceed the speed of light, it is difficult to reconstitute a PET image on the TOF-PET.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">However, with the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment, a detection time can be collected on the order of picoseconds as the counting information, and the coincidence counting information can be generated inside the console device <b>20</b>. Thus, a PET image can be reconstituted by using a difference in detection times.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In addition, according to the first embodiment, when receiving a request to change the coincidence counting information generating conditions for generating the coincidence counting information after the reconstitution of the PET image, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> controls the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b> so that the coincidence counting information is regenerated from the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> in accordance with the changed coincidence counting information generating conditions. Then, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> controls the image reconstituting unit <b>26</b> so that a PET image is newly reconstituted by use of the coincidence counting information regenerated by the coincidence counting information generating unit <b>25</b>. In other words, the PET apparatus according to the first embodiment is configured to automatically implement afresh the generation of the coincidence counting information and the reconstitution of the PET image when a request to change the coincidence counting information generating conditions is received. Thus, according to the first embodiment, the PET image can be quickly corrected in response to a reader's request.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the first embodiment, when receiving a request to transmit the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> to a storage medium, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> performs control so that the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> is put into the storage medium. Hence, even if, for example, the free space of the counting information storage unit <b>24</b> becomes short because of a high counting rate, the counting information is prevented from being abandoned according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the second embodiment, the storage of counting information in an X-ray CT apparatus that includes a photon-counting detector similar to the one adopted in the first embodiment is discussed.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The rotation frame <b>150</b> is a ring-shaped frame that supports the X-ray tube <b>120</b> and the detector <b>130</b> in such a manner that they oppose each other across the subject P, and is rotated by the gantry driving unit <b>160</b> at a high speed on a circular path around the subject P.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The detector <b>130</b> is a photon-counting detector that conducts counting on the light derived from the X rays that pass through the subject P and thereby discriminates the energy value of the transmission X rays. For example, the detector <b>130</b> may have the same configuration as the detector modules <b>14</b> explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The counting information collecting unit <b>140</b> collects the detection position of X rays detected by the detector <b>130</b> and the energy value at the incident time of the X rays onto the detector <b>130</b>, as counting information, for each phase of the X-ray tube <b>120</b> (tube phase) from the counting results obtained by the detector <b>130</b>, and sends the collected counting information to the console device <b>30</b> that is described later. For example, the counting information collecting unit <b>140</b> determines the detection position and the energy value with the same process as the one performed by the counting information collecting unit <b>15</b> according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The couch <b>200</b> is a device on which the subject P lies, and has a top plate <b>220</b> and a couch driving device <b>210</b>.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The console device <b>30</b> receives a manipulation of the X-ray CT apparatus by the operator, and also reconstitutes the X-ray CT image by use of the counting information collected by the gantry apparatus <b>100</b>, and includes an input device <b>31</b>, a display device <b>32</b>, a scan controlling unit <b>33</b>, a counting information storage unit <b>34</b>, a preprocessing unit <b>35</b>, an image reconstituting unit <b>36</b>, an image storage unit <b>37</b>, and a system controlling unit <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The input device <b>31</b> includes a mouse and a keyboard that the operator of the X-ray CT apparatus uses to input various instructions and settings, and sends the instructions and settings received from the operator to the system controlling unit <b>38</b>. For example, the input device <b>31</b> receives from the operator the reconstituting conditions for reconstituting the X-ray CT image and the correction conditions for correcting the image.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The display device <b>32</b> is a monitor that the operator checks. Under the control of the system controlling unit <b>38</b>, the display device <b>32</b> presents the X-ray CT image to the operator, and displays a graphical user interface (GUI) for receiving various instructions and settings from the operator by way of the input device <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The scan controlling unit <b>33</b> controls, under the control of the system controlling unit <b>38</b>, the operations of the high voltage generating unit <b>110</b>, the gantry driving unit <b>160</b>, the counting information collecting unit <b>140</b>, and the couch driving device <b>210</b>, and thereby controls the process of collecting the counting information at the gantry apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The counting information storage unit <b>34</b> stores therein the counting information collected by the counting information collecting unit <b>140</b> for each tube phase. For example, the counting information storage unit <b>34</b> stores therein &#x201c;P: P<b>11</b>, E: E<b>11</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;P: P<b>12</b>, E: E<b>12</b>&#x201d; and the like as the counting information that is collected from the counting results obtained by the detector <b>130</b> in &#x201c;tube phase: X<b>1</b>&#x201d;, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram for explaining the counting information storage unit according to the second embodiment, where &#x201c;P&#x201d; and &#x201c;E&#x201d; represent &#x201c;scintillator number&#x201d; and &#x201c;energy value&#x201d;, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In a similar manner, the counting information storage unit <b>34</b> also stores therein, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the counting information collected from the counting results obtained the detector <b>130</b> in &#x201c;tube phase: X<b>2</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;tube phase: X<b>3</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>34</b>, the energy values for different positions of the scintillator include the count number information for different energy values. In other words, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the count number for each energy value is expressed in a histogram so that an energy spectrum can be reconstructed from which elements that constitute the human body tissue of the subject through which the X rays pass can be estimated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram for explaining the characteristics of the counting information according to the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the preprocessing unit <b>35</b> performs a correction process, such as a logarithmic conversion process, an offset correction, a sensitivity correction, a beam hardening correction onto the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>34</b>, and thereby generates the projection data. The correction conditions for the correction process can be arbitrarily changed by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The image reconstituting unit <b>36</b> reconstitutes the X-ray CT image by performing a back projection process on the projection data generated by the preprocessing unit <b>35</b> from the counting information, and stores the reconstituted X-ray CT image in the image storage unit <b>37</b>. In other words, the image reconstituting unit <b>36</b> reconstitutes the X-ray CT image that describes differences in element level in detail, by use of the projection data generated from the counting information that reproduces the spectrum of elements.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The system controlling unit <b>38</b> controls the operations of the gantry apparatus <b>100</b>, the couch <b>200</b> and the console device <b>30</b>, and thereby performs control of the entire X-ray CT apparatus. More specifically, the system controlling unit <b>38</b> controls the scan controlling unit <b>33</b> to collect the counting information from the gantry apparatus <b>100</b>. In addition, the system controlling unit <b>38</b> controls the preprocessing unit <b>35</b> and the image reconstituting unit <b>36</b> to control the image reconstituting process of the console device <b>30</b>. Moreover, the system controlling unit <b>38</b> performs control so that an X-ray CT image stored in the image storage unit <b>37</b> is displayed on the display device <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Then, the system controlling unit <b>38</b> performs control so that all or part of the counting information is maintained in the counting information storage unit <b>34</b> after the reconstitution of the X-ray CT image.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Furthermore, when receiving a request of changing the image reconstituting conditions after the reconstitution of the X-ray CT image, the system controlling unit <b>38</b> performs the following controlling process. The reconstituting conditions are, for example, correction conditions for the correction process performed by the preprocessing unit <b>35</b>. In other words, when receiving a request to change the correction conditions after the reconstitution of the X-ray CT image, the system controlling unit <b>38</b> controls the preprocessing unit <b>35</b> in accordance with the changed correction conditions so that projection data is regenerated from the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>34</b>. Then, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> controls the image reconstituting unit <b>36</b> by use of the projection data regenerated by the preprocessing unit <b>35</b> to newly reconstitute the X-ray CT image. Then, the X-ray CT image newly reconstituted by the image reconstituting unit <b>36</b> is displayed on the display device <b>32</b> under the control of the system controlling unit <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When receiving a request to transmit the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>34</b> to a storage medium, the system controlling unit <b>38</b> performs control so that the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>34</b> is stored in the storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, the process procedure followed by the X-ray CT apparatus according to the second embodiment is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart for explaining the process performed by the X-ray CT apparatus according to the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the X-ray CT apparatus according to the second embodiment carries the subject P into the rotation frame <b>150</b> of the gantry apparatus <b>100</b> and then receives a request to take an X-ray CT image from the operator by way of the input device <b>31</b> (yes at step S<b>301</b>), the counting information collecting unit <b>140</b> collects the counting information, based on the counting results obtained by the detector <b>130</b> (step S<b>302</b>). In other words, the counting information collecting unit <b>140</b> collects, as the counting information, the detection position of the transmitted x rays detected by the detector <b>130</b> and the energy value of the transmitted x rays at the incident time onto the detector <b>130</b>, for each tube phase of the x-ray tube <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Thereafter, the counting information collecting unit <b>140</b> stores the collected counting information into the counting information storage unit <b>34</b> of the console device <b>30</b> (step S<b>303</b>), the image reconstituting unit <b>26</b> reconstitutes the X-ray CT image by performing the back projection process onto the projection data generated by the preprocessing unit <b>35</b> from the counting information (step S<b>304</b>), and the process is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As discussed above, the counting information collecting unit <b>140</b> according to the second embodiment collects, as counting information prepared from the counting results obtained by the photon-counting detector <b>130</b>, the detection position of the transmitted X rays detected by the detector <b>130</b> and the energy value of the transmitted X rays at the incident time onto the detector <b>130</b>, for each tube phase of the x-ray tube <b>120</b>, and stores the collected counting information into the counting information storage unit <b>34</b> of the console device <b>30</b>. The preprocessing unit <b>35</b> generates projection data by performing various correction processes onto the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>34</b>, and the image reconstituting unit <b>36</b> reconstitutes the X-ray CT image by performing a back projection process onto the projection data generated by the preprocessing unit <b>35</b>. Then, after the reconstitution of the X-ray CT image, the system controlling unit <b>38</b> performs control so that all or part of the counting information is put into the counting information storage unit <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Hence, according to the second embodiment, the counting information is stored inside the console device <b>30</b>, and even after the X-ray CT image is reconstituted, the counting information that is collected during the X-ray CT imaging time period can be maintained. Thus, according to the second embodiment, when the operator wishes to consult an X-ray CT image reconstituted in accordance with different correction conditions, the projection data can be immediately regenerated at the preprocessing unit <b>35</b> based on the new correction conditions, and the X-ray CT image can be quickly corrected in response to the reader's request.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition, according to the second embodiment, when a request to change the image reconstituting conditions (correction conditions) is received after the reconstitution of the X-ray CT image, the system controlling unit <b>38</b> controls the preprocessing unit <b>35</b> so that projection data is regenerated from the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>34</b> in accordance with the changed correction conditions. Then, the system controlling unit <b>28</b> controls the image reconstituting unit <b>36</b> to newly reconstitute the X-ray CT image by use of the projection data regenerated by the preprocessing unit <b>35</b>. In other words, the system of the X-ray CT apparatus according to the second embodiment is configured to automatically re-execute the generation of the projection data and the reconstitution of the X-ray CT image when a request to change the correction conditions that are image reconstituting conditions is received. Thus, according to the second embodiment, the X-ray CT image can be further quickly corrected in response to the reader's request.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In addition, according to the second embodiment, when a request to transmit the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>34</b> to a storage medium is received, the system controlling unit <b>38</b> performs control so that the counting information stored in the counting information storage unit <b>34</b> is put into the storage medium. Hence, according to the second embodiment, the counting information is prevented from being abandoned due to free space that becomes short in the counting information storage unit <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As explained above, according to the first and second embodiments, medical images reconstituted by use of radiation can be quickly corrected in response to the reader's request.</p>
