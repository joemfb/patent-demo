<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to electro-optical devices and electronic apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a typical electro-optical device, a liquid crystal device is known. The liquid crystal device includes, for example, a liquid crystal panel and a backlight disposed opposite the liquid crystal panel to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The liquid crystal panel includes a pair of substrates and a liquid crystal disposed therebetween. The liquid crystal panel is provided with a pair of electrodes. The pair of electrodes applies a drive voltage to the liquid crystal to change the alignment and order of liquid crystal molecules. Then, light emitted from a backlight and passing through the liquid crystal is changed so that images can be displayed with grayscale levels.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The visibility of display of the liquid crystal device changes depending on the brightness around the liquid crystal device due to external light, such as sunlight. That is, as the brightness around the liquid crystal device increases, the difference between the brightness around the liquid crystal device and the brightness of the display area of the liquid crystal device decreases. Accordingly, the visibility of the display of the liquid crystal device deteriorates.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To overcome this drawback, a liquid crystal device including an optical sensor for detecting the illuminance of external light has been proposed (see, for example, JP-A-2005-121997).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this liquid crystal device, the illuminance of external light is detected by the optical sensor, and the amount of light emitted from a backlight is controlled in accordance with the detected illuminance of the external light. Thus, the amount of light emitted from the backlight and supplied to a liquid crystal panel can be adjusted in accordance with the brightness around the liquid crystal device. As a result, the visibility of the display of the liquid crystal device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above-described optical sensor includes a first PIN diode for receiving external light and a second PIN diode which is shielded from external light. The first PIN diode outputs an electric signal in accordance with, not only the illuminance of external light, but also the temperature of the PIN diode. On the other hand, the second PIN diode, which is shielded from external light, outputs an electric signal in accordance with factors, such as the temperature of the PIN diode, other than the illuminance of external light.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The optical sensor determines the difference between the electric signal output from the first PIN diode and the electric signal output from the second PIN diode. Accordingly, the optical sensor eliminates factors, such as the temperature of the PIN diode, other than the illuminance of external light, from the electric signal output from the first PIN diode, and then outputs the electric signal reflecting only the illuminance of the external light. By determining the amount of received external light on the basis of the level of the electric signal, the illuminance of the external light can be detected with high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, in order to detect the illuminance of the external light with high precision, it is necessary that the second PIN diode output an electric signal with high precision in accordance with factors, such as the temperature of the PIN diode, other than the illuminance of the external light. Accordingly, the degree to which the second PIN diode is shielded from light should be increased to eliminate the influence of the illuminance of external light from the electric signal output from the second PIN diode. Thus, between a pair of substrates of the liquid crystal panel, a light-shielding film for shielding the second PIN diode from external light is formed on the substrate on which the external light is incident. This light-shielding film can stop the external light incident on the liquid crystal panel from directly reaching the second PIN diode.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The external light incident on the liquid crystal panel is sometimes diffused between the pair of substrates of the liquid crystal panel. The above-described light-shielding film, however, cannot stop the diffused external light from reaching the second PIN diode, which serves as a light-shielded sensor. This decreases the degree to which the second PIN diode is shielded from light. Accordingly, the precision of the illuminance of the external light to be detected is decreased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An advantage of some aspects of the invention is that it provides an electro-optical device and an electronic apparatus that can detect the illuminance of external light with high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided an electro-optical device including an electro-optical panel, a display area of the electro-optical panel being surrounded by a peripheral member. The electro-optical device also includes a light-receiving sensor that receives external light and a light-shielded sensor that is connected to the light-receiving sensor and that is shielded from the external light received by the light-receiving sensor. The light-shielded sensor is located at a position at which it is overlapped with the peripheral member. The light-receiving sensor and the light-shielded sensor form an optical sensor to detect the illuminance of external light.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the above-described electro-optical device, the light-shielded sensor is located such that it is overlapped with the peripheral member that surrounds the display area of the electro-optical panel. The peripheral member, which reflects or absorbs external light, can stop the external light from reaching the light-shielded sensor. Thus, the influence of the illuminance of external light on the electric signal output from the light-shielded sensor becomes smaller so that the illuminance of external light can be detected with high precision. Preferably, the light-shielded sensor is located such that it is wholly covered with the peripheral member. However, the light-shielded sensor may be located such that it is partially covered with the peripheral member. In either of the case, advantages achieved by an embodiment of the invention can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is preferable that the above-described electro-optical device includes an illumination unit that emits light to the electro-optical panel and that a first light-shielding film is disposed between the illumination unit and the light-receiving sensor and between the illumination unit and the light-shielded sensor. The illumination unit is located opposite the electro-optical panel. The first light-shielding film is disposed on the electro-optical panel in an area opposing the illumination unit and corresponding to the area in which the light-receiving sensor and the light-shielded sensor are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the above-described electro-optical device, light emitted from the illumination unit can be stopped from reaching the light-receiving sensor and the light-shielded sensor. Thus, the influence of the illuminance of light emitted from the illumination unit on the electric signal output from the light-receiving sensor and the electric signal output from the light-shielded sensor becomes smaller so that the illuminance of external light can be detected with high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is preferable that the electro-optical panel is a liquid crystal panel including a pair of substrates between which a liquid crystal is disposed and the peripheral member is a sealing member that seals the liquid crystal. It is also preferable that a material having a low transmittance ratio is contained in the peripheral member. More specifically, it is preferable that the sealing member includes an adhesive material that bonds the pair of substrates to each other and a material having a transmittance ratio lower than the adhesive material. For example, particles having a high light absorption ratio or a pigment having a high light absorption ratio may be mixed into the adhesive material, which is the main component of the sealing member. With this arrangement, the absorption ratio of the material itself can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the above-described electro-optical device, a material having a low transmittance ratio is mixed into the peripheral member. Thus, the amount of external light passing through the peripheral member is decreased so that external light can further be blocked from reaching the light-shielded sensor. Thus, the influence of the illuminance of external light on the electric signal output from the light-shielded sensor becomes smaller. As a result, highly precise detection of the illuminance of external light can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the above-described electro-optical device, it is preferable that a light detection circuit is connected to the light-receiving sensor and the light-shielded sensor so that the light detection circuit outputs a light detection signal on the basis of an electric signal output from the light-receiving sensor and an electric signal output from the light-shielded sensor. More specifically, the light-receiving sensor and the light-shielded sensor are connected in series with each other, and the light detection circuit is connected to the node between the light-receiving sensor and the light-shielded sensor. The light detection circuit outputs a light detection signal if the difference between the electric signal output from the light-receiving sensor and the electric signal output from the light-shielded sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the above-described electro-optical device, the light-receiving sensor and the light-shielded sensor are connected in series with each other, and the light detection circuit is connected to the node between the two sensors. At this node, the voltage corresponding to the difference between the electric signal output from the light-receiving sensor and the electric signal output from the light-shielded sensor is generated. Based on this voltage, the time until the light detection circuit outputs a light detection signal is counted. As a result, the illuminance of external light can be detected. Additionally, the peripheral member is formed to be larger than the light detection circuit. With this arrangement, the light detection circuit, as well as the light-shielded sensor, can be located such that it is overlapped with the peripheral member. As a result, erroneous operations of the light detection circuit can be prevented and highly precisely light detection can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the above-described electro-optical device, it is preferable that the light detection circuit includes a first detection circuit that outputs a first detection signal if the electric signal output from the light-receiving sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold and a second detection circuit that outputs a second detection signal if the electric signal output from the light-shielded sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold. It is also preferable that the light detection signal is output if one of the first detection signal and the second detection signal is output.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the above-described electro-optical device, the first detection circuit is connected to the light-receiving sensor, and the second detection circuit is connected to the light-shielded sensor. Accordingly, the first detection circuit outputs the first detection signal on the basis of the electric signal output from the light-receiving sensor. The second detection circuit outputs the second detection signal on the basis of the electric signal output from the light-shielded sensor. Then, if one of the first detection signal and the second detection signal is output, the light detection circuit outputs the light detection signal. The light detection circuit counts the time for which the light detection signal is output. As a result, the illuminance of external light can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the above-described electro-optical device, it is preferable that a second light-shielding film that shields the light-shielded sensor from the external light is disposed and that the light-receiving sensor is located at a position at which the light-receiving sensor is exposed through the second light-shielding film. With this configuration, the light-receiving sensor is exposed through the second light-shielding film so that it can receive external light. In contrast, the light-shielded sensor is shielded from external light by the provision of the second light-shielding film. It is preferable that the second light-shielding film is located at a position at which it is overlapped with the peripheral member and is formed to be larger than the peripheral member. That is, since the second light-shielding film is formed such that it covers the peripheral member, the entry of external light coming from right above the peripheral member can be completely blocked, and the high light-shielding effect can be implemented. Additionally, the circuits forming the optical sensor other than the light-shielded sensor, for example, the light detection circuit, may also be located such that it is overlapped with the second light-shielding film. That is, among the circuits forming the optical sensor, only the light-receiving sensor is exposed to external light. With this configuration, erroneous operations of the optical sensor can be prevented so that more highly precise light detection can be implemented. It is also preferable that the second light-shielding film is disposed in a frame-like shape to surround the display area of the display panel. With this arrangement, the second light-shielding film may be used as a frame that defines the display area, i.e., the &#x201c;display frame&#x201d;.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments of the invention are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following descriptions of the embodiments and modifications, the same components are designated with like reference numerals, and an explanation thereof is thus omitted or simplified.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an electro-optical device <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The electro-optical device <b>1</b> includes a liquid crystal panel AA, which serves as an electro-optical panel, a backlight <b>41</b>, which serves as an illumination unit disposed opposite the liquid crystal panel AA to emit light, and a backlight control circuit <b>42</b> that controls the backlight <b>41</b>. The electro-optical device <b>1</b> performs transmissive-mode display by utilizing light emitted from the backlight <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The liquid crystal panel AA includes a display area A having a plurality of pixels <b>50</b>, an optical sensor <b>5</b> that detects the illuminance of external light, and a scanning line drive circuit <b>10</b> and a data line drive circuit <b>20</b> disposed around the display area A to drive the pixels <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The optical sensor <b>5</b> detects the illuminance of external light and outputs an illuminance signal indicating the illuminance of the external light.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The backlight <b>41</b> is disposed on the back surface of the liquid crystal panel AA. The backlight <b>41</b> is formed of, for example, a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL), a light-emitting diode (LED), or an electroluminescence (EL), and supplies light to the pixels <b>50</b> of the liquid crystal panel AA.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The backlight control circuit <b>42</b> outputs a backlight control signal to the backlight <b>41</b> on the basis of the illuminance signal output from the optical sensor <b>5</b> to control the amount of light emitted from the backlight <b>41</b>. More specifically, if the illuminance signal output from the optical sensor <b>5</b> exceeds a predetermined threshold, the backlight control circuit <b>42</b> determines that the brightness around the electro-optical device <b>1</b> is large and thus increases the amount of light emitted from the backlight <b>41</b>. In contrast, if the illuminance signal output from the optical sensor <b>5</b> is less than the predetermined threshold, the backlight control circuit <b>42</b> determines that the brightness around the electro-optical device <b>1</b> is small and thus decreases the amount of light emitted from the backlight <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Details of the configuration of the liquid crystal panel AA are given below. The liquid crystal panel AA includes 320 scanning lines Y<b>1</b> through Y<b>320</b> and <b>320</b> capacitance lines Z<b>1</b> through Z<b>320</b>, which are alternately disposed at regular intervals, and 240 data lines X<b>1</b> through X<b>240</b> disposed such that they intersect with the scanning lines Y<b>1</b> through Y<b>320</b> and the capacitance lines Z<b>1</b> through Z<b>320</b>. The pixels <b>50</b> are disposed at the corresponding intersections between the scanning lines Y and the data lines X.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each pixel <b>50</b> includes a thin-film transistor (TFT) <b>51</b>, a pixel electrode <b>55</b>, a common electrode <b>56</b> disposed opposite the pixel electrode <b>55</b>, and a storage capacitor <b>53</b>. One electrode of the storage capacitor <b>53</b> is connected to the corresponding capacitance line Z and the other electrode thereof is connected to the pixel electrode <b>55</b>. The pixel electrode <b>55</b> and the common electrode <b>56</b> sandwich a liquid crystal (not shown) therebetween, which serves as a dielectric as an electro-optical material, to form a pixel capacitor <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The gate of the TFT <b>51</b> is connected to the corresponding scanning line Y, the source thereof is connected to the corresponding data line X, and the drain thereof is connected to the other electrodes of the pixel electrode <b>55</b> and the storage capacitor <b>53</b>. Accordingly, when a selection voltage is applied from the scanning line Y, the TFT <b>51</b> is turned ON, and electrically connects the data line X and the other electrodes of the pixel electrode <b>55</b> and the storage capacitor <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The scanning line drive circuit <b>10</b> sequentially supplies selection voltages for turning ON the TFTs <b>51</b> to the plurality of scanning lines Y. For example, if the scanning line drive circuit <b>10</b> supplies a selection voltage to a certain scanning line Y, all the TFTs <b>51</b> connected to the scanning line Y are turned ON so that all the pixels <b>50</b> including the TFTs <b>51</b> in the ON state are selected.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The data line drive circuit <b>20</b> supplies an image signal to the corresponding data line X to write an image voltage associated with the image signal into the pixel electrode <b>55</b> via the TFT <b>51</b> which in the ON state.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The above-configured electro-optical device <b>1</b> is operated as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Selection voltages are sequentially supplied from the scanning line drive circuit <b>10</b> to the 320 scanning lines Y<b>1</b> through Y<b>320</b>. Then, all the TFTs <b>51</b> connected to the corresponding scanning lines Y are sequentially turned ON so that the all the pixels <b>50</b> connected to the corresponding scanning lines Y are sequentially selected. In synchronization with the selection of the pixels <b>50</b>, image signals are supplied from the data line drive circuit <b>20</b> to the data lines X. Then, the image signals are supplied to all the pixels <b>50</b> selected by the scanning line drive circuit <b>10</b> via the corresponding data lines X and TFTs <b>51</b> which are in the ON state. The image voltages associated with the image signals are then written into the pixel electrodes <b>55</b>. As a result, a potential difference is generated between the pixel electrode <b>55</b> and the common electrode <b>56</b> so that a drive voltage is applied to the liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Applying a drive voltage to the liquid crystal changes the alignment and order of the liquid crystal molecules. Then, light emitted from the backlight <b>41</b> and passing through the liquid crystal is changed so that images are displayed with grayscale levels. Because of the storage capacitor <b>53</b>, the drive voltage applied to the liquid crystal can be held for a time longer than a time for which the image voltage is written into the pixel electrode <b>55</b> by the three orders of magnitudes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating the optical sensor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The optical sensor <b>5</b> includes a first PIN diode <b>81</b>, which serves as a light-receiving unit for receiving external light, a second PIN diode <b>82</b>, which serves as a light-shielded sensor which is shielded external light, and an illuminance detection circuit <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The cathode of the first PIN diode <b>81</b> is connected to a high potential power supply source VHH, while the anode of the first PIN diode <b>81</b> is connected to the cathode of the second PIN diode <b>82</b> via a terminal M. The anode of the second PIN diode <b>82</b> is connected to a low potential power supply source VLL. That is, the first PIN diode <b>81</b> and the second PIN diode <b>82</b> are connected in series with each other via the terminal M, and a reverse bias voltage is applied to the first PIN diode <b>81</b> and the second PIN diode <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first PIN diode <b>81</b> outputs a current from the cathode to the anode in accordance with factors, such as the temperature of the PIN diode in addition to the illuminance of external light. In contrast, the second PIN diode <b>82</b>, which is shielded from external light, outputs a current from the cathode to the anode in accordance with factors, such as the temperature of the PIN diode, other than the illuminance of external light.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, the current reflecting the difference between the current output from the first PIN diode <b>81</b> and the current output from the second PIN diode <b>82</b> can be extracted from the terminal M. In this current, factors, such as the temperature of the PIN diode, other than the illuminance of the external light, are removed from the current output from the first PIN diode <b>81</b>. That is, the current difference reflects only the illuminance of the external light.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The illuminance detection circuit <b>90</b> includes an optical detector circuit <b>91</b>, a counter <b>92</b>, and a look-up table (LUT) <b>93</b>. The illuminance detection circuit <b>90</b> outputs an illuminance signal indicating the illuminance of external light on the basis of a current flowing in the terminal M.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The optical detector circuit <b>91</b> includes a capacitor <b>911</b>, a switching element <b>912</b>, and an inverter <b>913</b>. The optical detector circuit <b>91</b> outputs a light detection signal on the basis of a current flowing in the terminal M.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The capacitor <b>911</b> is charged on the basis of the current flowing in the terminal M. More specifically, one electrode of the capacitor <b>911</b> is connected to the terminal M, and the other electrode thereof is connected to a voltage GND of a reference potential power supply source. When the current flowing in the terminal M is supplied to the one electrode of the capacitor <b>911</b>, electric charge is gradually stored in the capacitor <b>911</b> on the basis of the supplied current. Then, the voltage corresponding to the stored electric charge is output from the one electrode of the capacitor <b>911</b>. Thus, the voltage of the terminal M connected to the one electrode of the capacitor <b>911</b> becomes equal to the voltage corresponding, to the electric charge stored in the capacitor <b>911</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The switching element <b>912</b> discharges electric charge stored in the capacitor <b>911</b>. More specifically, one terminal of the switching element <b>912</b> is connected to the one electrode of the capacitor <b>911</b>, while the other terminal of the switching element <b>912</b> is connected to a voltage GND of a reference potential power supply source. When the switching element <b>912</b> is turned ON, the electric charge stored in the capacitor <b>911</b> migrates to the voltage GND of the reference potential power supply source. Then, the electric charge stored in the capacitor <b>911</b> is discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The inverter <b>913</b> inverts the voltage of the terminal M and outputs the inverted voltage. More specifically, the input terminal of the inverter <b>913</b> is connected to the terminal M, and the output terminal thereof is connected to a terminal N. If the voltage of the terminal M is lower than a predetermined voltage, the inverter <b>913</b> outputs the voltage VDD as the light detection signal. If the voltage of the terminal M is higher than the predetermined voltage, the inverter <b>913</b> outputs the voltage GND as the light detection signal. Accordingly, the voltage of the terminal N connected to the output terminal of the inverter <b>913</b> becomes equal to the voltage output from the inverter <b>913</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The counter <b>92</b> counts the time from when the switching element <b>912</b> is turned OFF until when a light detection signal is output from the inverter <b>913</b>. More specifically, the input terminal of the counter <b>912</b> is connected to the terminal N, and the output terminal thereof is connected to the input terminal of the LUT <b>93</b>. The counter <b>92</b> starts counting the time when the switching element <b>912</b> is turned OFF, and finishes counting the time when the voltage of the terminal N reaches the voltage GND.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The LUT <b>93</b> outputs an illuminance signal indicating the illuminance of external light on the basis of the time counted by the counter <b>92</b>. More specifically, the input terminal of the LUT <b>93</b> is connected to the output terminal of the counter <b>92</b>. The LUT <b>93</b> determines the amount of light on the basis of the time counted by the counter <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, as the time counted by the counter <b>92</b> is longer, it means that the current, which reflects only the illuminance of the external light, flowing in the terminal M is smaller, and thus, it is determined that the amount of external light is smaller. In contrast, as the time counted by the counter <b>92</b> is shorter, it means that the current, which reflects only the illuminance of the external light, flowing in the terminal M is larger, and thus, it is determined that the amount of external light is larger.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Then, on the basis of the determined amount of external light, the illuminance of the external light is determined, and the illuminance signal indicating the illuminance of the external light is output from the output terminal of the LUT <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a timing chart of the optical sensor <b>5</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, Vth represents the above-described predetermined voltage used in the inverter <b>913</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At time t<b>1</b>, the switching element <b>912</b> is turned ON. Then, the electric charge stored in the capacitor <b>911</b> migrates to the voltage GND of the reference potential power supply source and is discharged. Accordingly, the voltage of the terminal M connected to the one electrode of the capacitor <b>911</b> becomes equal to the voltage GND, and the voltage of the terminal N connected to the output terminal of the inverter <b>913</b>, which inverts the voltage of the terminal M and outputs the inverted voltage, becomes equal to the voltage VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Then, at time t<b>2</b>, the switching element <b>912</b> is turned OFF. Then, on the basis of the current, which reflects only the illuminance of the external light, flowing in the terminal M, electric charge is gradually stored in the capacitor <b>911</b>. Accordingly, the voltage of the terminal M gradually increases to the voltage Vth at time t<b>3</b>. At time t<b>2</b>, the counter <b>92</b> starts counting the time.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the voltage of the terminal M reaches the voltage Vth at time <b>3</b>, the voltage of the terminal N becomes equal to the voltage GND. Simultaneously, the counter <b>92</b> finishes counting the time. Then, the LUT <b>93</b> determines the amount of external light on the basis of the time from time t<b>1</b> to time t<b>3</b> counted by the counter <b>92</b>, and outputs an illuminance signal.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Then, time t<b>4</b>, as in time t<b>1</b>, the switching element <b>912</b> is turned ON. Then, the voltage of the terminal M becomes equal to the voltage GND, and the voltage of the terminal N becomes equal to the voltage VDD.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A predetermined gap is formed between the element substrate <b>60</b> and the counter substrate <b>70</b>. In this gap, the liquid crystal is sealed by a sealing member <b>35</b>, which serves as a peripheral member disposed surrounding the display area A of the liquid crystal panel AA, so that a liquid crystal layer can be formed.</p>
