<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This present invention relates generally to computer memory, and more specifically to phase change memories (PCMs).</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A PCM is a form of resistive non-volatile computer random-access memory (RAM) that stores data by altering the state of the matter from which the device is fabricated. Phase change materials can be manipulated into two or more different phases or states, with each phase representing a different data value. Generally, each phase exhibits different electrical properties (or different resistance values). The amorphous and crystalline (or polycrystalline) phases are typically two phases used for binary data storage (1's and 0's) since they have detectable differences in electrical resistance. Specifically, the amorphous phase has a higher resistance than the crystalline phase.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Chalcogenides are a group of materials commonly utilized as phase change material. This group of materials contains a chalcogen (Periodic Table Group 16/VIA) and another element. Selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) are the two most common elements in the group used to produce a chalcogenide semiconductor when creating a PCM memory cell. An example of this would be Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>s </sub>(germanium-antimony-tellurium or &#x201c;GST&#x201d;), SbTe<sub>3</sub>, and In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Altering the phase change material's state can be achieved by heating the material to a melting point and then cooling the material to one of the possible states, or by heating an amorphous region to, or near, a crystallization temperature to convert some or all of the amorphous material to crystalline form. A current passed through the phase change material creates heat and causes the phase change material to melt. Melting and gradually cooling down the phase change material allows time for the phase change material to form the crystalline state. Melting and abruptly cooling the phase change material quenches the phase change material into the amorphous state. Heating to below the melting temperature can also be used to crystallize amorphous material without melting.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed to a parallel-path memory cell structure that includes two electrodes contacting the same side of a deposited germanium-antimony-tellurium (GST) layer. In an exemplary embodiment, one electrode is a micro-trench (thus, having an exposed surface with a sublithographic dimension) and the second electrode (e.g., the bit line) is orthogonal to the first electrode and lays at a sublithographic distance, or gap, from the first electrode (the spacing is obtained by a deposition of an insulator). This structure allows energy-efficient operation with a very thin deposition of GST since the heating is concentrated near the sublithographic gap between the two electrodes, and because there is no need for a top electrode, which may act as a heat sink. A memory cell in this structure thus requires a very small current to start melting the phase-change material. In an exemplary embodiment, the cell also exhibits greatly reduced threshold voltage when the GST material is amorphous since the separation of the two electrodes is sublithographic and thus extremely small. In an exemplary embodiment, where the GST layer covering the electrodes is large (large patterning on top of the electrodes), the resistance grows gradually for a wide range of currents, thus allowing for efficient multi-bit operation. The resistance variation is primarily due to the amorphous material occluding the current path out of the first electrode and through the crystalline material, therefore drift or other variation in the resistance of the amorphous material will affect the cell resistance only minimally. In an exemplary embodiment, the amount of amorphous material for all levels is sufficient to ensure good retention (as opposed to the extremely thin amorphous regions required to generate low to intermediate cell resistance with a micro-trench or mushroom cell).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention makes improvements in at least three aspects of contemporary phase change memory (PCM) technology. The first improvement is a reduction in required programming power (and peak current); the second improvement is a reduction in resistance drift; and the third improvement is improved data retention with multi-bit operation of the PCM.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reduction of the programming power and peak current are important in PCM technology because these two parameters have an impact on the design of the circuitry required to program the memory cell. In an exemplary embodiment, the circuitry required to program the memory cell includes: (i) an access device (e.g., a diode or a transistor); (ii) a bit line to support the programming current; (iii) peripheral circuitry that drives the bit line; and (iv) charge pumps whenever present.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Current techniques for the reduction of the programming current and power include: reducing the surface of the contact between one electrode (the so called heater) and the phase change material (e.g., GST), as for example in the micro-trench cells and in the mushroom cells; and reducing the cross section of the GST, thus obtaining a current crowding, such as in the bridge cell or in the pore cell. Typically these reductions are achieved by obtaining key geometrical features of the cell with sublithographic techniques. For example, in the micro-trench cell, the heater has a sublithographic dimension. In the mushroom cell, the bottom contact can be obtained with a sublithographic diameter. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides two important sublithographic dimensions, namely the thickness of the first electrode (which is similar to a micro-trench) and the lateral separation distance between the first electrode and the second electrode (defined by a deposited insulator thickness). The combination of these two sublithograhic dimensions enables heating of a smaller area than can be achieved with contemporary PCM technology, thus reducing the programming current necessary to initiate melting. Furthermore, the lateral current flow between the electrodes results in an asymmetric melt region that grows from one end of the first electrode towards the opposite end of that electrode as the current is increased. This is in contrast to mushroom-style and microtrench-style cells where the current flows vertically out of an electrode and generates a melt region which typically has two planes of symmetry, and is also in contrast to bridge-type cells which utilize lateral current flow but typically have constant cross-section of phase-change material which also yields a temperature profile typically having two planes of symmetry.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Resistance drift has an impact on multi-bit operation of PCM. The random nature of resistance drift may have a large impact on the reliability of PCM cells programmed with a large number of levels. Data retention with multi-bit operation is will become an issue with PCM since the common way of obtaining medium to low resistance values is to create very small quantities of amorphous material which can exhibit higher sensitivity to both trap relaxation (which is thought to determine short-term upwards resistance drift), and recrystallization (which causes long-term downward resistance drift).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Current proposals for dealing with drift are based on signal processing techniques, such as estimating and then compensating the component of drift common to a group of PCM cells, for example by means of known estimation techniques such as a maximum likelihood estimation. A drawback of this solution is that it relies on post-processing techniques at data retrieval time and it cannot compensate for the random component of drift, which has a major impact on data retention in multi-bit PCM. Other techniques that are applied at retrieval time include: reinstating the drift as perceived at programming time by means of an electrical pulse; and multiple-voltage reading of the cells. A variety of programming techniques resilient to drift have been proposed in the literature including: the use of short pulses to induce selective crystallization of small regions of the amorphous material (thus creating conductive paths through the amorphous material); and the use of drift acceleration pulses. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention creates amorphous regions of varying size between the electrodes, but with a parallel electrical path through the crystalline material around the amorphous region. In this structure, the resistance of the cell is primarily determined by the cross-sectional size of the crystalline path, which decreases as the size of the amorphous region increases. As long as the resistivity of the amorphous material is far higher (e.g., at least 100 times higher) than that of the crystalline material, the overall cell resistance determined by the parallel electrical paths through both the crystalline and amorphous regions is only very slightly affected by variations in the amorphous resistivity such as those associated with short-term drift. Exemplary embodiments are also relatively insensitive to long-term recrystallization (downward) drift because the amorphous region has to shrink by relatively large amounts to cause a large change in resistance. By contrast, intermediate resistance values in mushroom or micro-trench cells are sometimes obtained by having the amorphous region almost, but not quite, completely cover the electrode. This is sometimes referred to as the pinch-off regime, and when a cell operates near pinch-off, it only takes the recrystallization of an extremely small region to substantially change the cell resistance.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In exemplary embodiments, normal operation of the cell may comprise the steps of creating an amorphous or a crystalline region by melting a region and then rapidly quenching (to create amorphous material) or reducing the current so that the region crystallizes while cooling (to create crystalline material). Another typical operation is to convert some or all of an amorphous region without melting, by heating enough, and for long enough time, for crystallization to occur. In exemplary embodiments, the memory cell can be programmed to a specific resistance value by applying an electrical signal large enough to cause the melting of a region that will create an amount of amorphous material sufficient for creating the desired resistance value. The peak value of the electrical signal can be estimated using finite element analysis of the cell. Alternatively, the cell can be programmed with a pulse that melts a sufficiently large region, slowly decreases to the above described peak value and is abruptly removed to quench the molten phase-change material. In exemplary embodiments, the modes of operation of the cell are preceded by an initialization process that confines the crystalline region into a sub-lithographic area.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For some manufacturing processes an embodiments, it may be desirable to perform an initialization process before the cell is used to store data (e.g., after fabrication) and then periodically during the device lifetime. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an exemplary flow chart for such an initializing process. In an exemplary embodiment, at the end of the manufacturing process, a crystalline phase change material is covering the first conductive electrode region <b>404</b> (e.g., a substantial portion) and the second conductive electrode region <b>406</b> (e.g., at least a portion or at least partially covers) in a memory cell. To initialize the cell, at block <b>702</b>, a first amorphous material region covering a portion of the first conductive electrode region <b>404</b> is created. In an embodiment, the first amorphous region covers a substantial area of the phase change material including a portion of the first conductive electrode region <b>404</b>. In some cases, a portion of the second conductive electrode region <b>406</b> may also be covered by the amorphous region, but this is not required for operation or initialization according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In an exemplary embodiment, the first amorphous material region is created by initially applying a maximal electrical pulse that is of a larger magnitude than will be used for normal write processes. The electrical pulse is applied via at least one of the first conductive electrode region <b>404</b> and the second conductive electrode region <b>406</b>. At block <b>704</b>, an active crystalline material region is created inside the first amorphous material region by crystallizing a portion of the first amorphous material region. In an exemplary embodiment, the active crystalline material region is created by applying an electrical pulse smaller than the initial maximal electrical pulse. The electrical pulse is applied via at least one of the first conductive electrode region <b>404</b> and the second conductive electrode region <b>406</b>. The cell is now initialized and ready for use storing data. At block <b>706</b>, data is stored in the memory cell by creating a second, smaller amorphous material region inside the active crystalline material region. In an exemplary embodiment, the second amorphous material region is created by applying a pulse that is smaller than the first maximal pulse which created the first amorphous region, and of shorter duration than the second pulse which created the active crystalline material region.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is advantageous for several reasons. First, it can take advantage of the fact that drive transistors can typically drive much more current for a small number of cycles than they can for a large number of cycles. Thus, a single very large current pulse can be generated and used to amorphize as much as possible of the crystalline film over the electrodes before the system is used for data storage. This minimizes the amount of undesirable current which flows between the two electrodes in the regions far from the peak temperature region near the narrow insulated gap between the electrodes. Secondly, the process allows a smaller active crystalline region to be generated by annealing a &#x201c;working region&#x201d; inside the larger amorphous region. The size of the active crystalline region can be controlled to precisely create a desired minimum cell resistance, which will be the result of the parallel combination of an outer path through any crystalline material outside of the amorphous region plus an inner path through the active crystalline region. Controlling (e.g., being able to adjust or adjusting) the size of the active crystalline region provides precise control of the minimum cell resistance and enables data storage through the creation of a fixed or variable-sized amorphous region inside of the active crystalline region. In an embodiment, the volume of the amorphous phase change material is increased by applying an electrical pulse having an amplitude larger than a previously applied electrical pulse and/or a duration shorter than a previously applied electrical pulse, the applying via one or both of the electrodes. In an embodiment, the volume of the amorphous phase change material is decreased by applying an electrical pulse having an amplitude lower than a previously applied electrical pulse and/or a duration longer than a previously applied electrical pulse, the applying</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the manufacturing process is designed such that all of the phase change material is initially in the amorphous state. In this embodiment, block <b>702</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is not needed since everything is already amorphous, and preparing a memory cell for use will only require block <b>704</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to be performed. Once a crystalline region is created inside the amorphous film, data can be stored by selectively creating a second amorphous region of the desired size inside the active crystalline region.</p>

Design process <b>1010</b> may further include, for example, standard mechanical design processes such as stress analysis, thermal analysis, mechanical event simulation, process simulation for operations such as casting, molding, and die press forming, etc. One of ordinary skill in the art of mechanical design can appreciate the extent of possible mechanical design tools and applications used in design process <b>1010</b> without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention. Design process <b>1010</b> may also include modules for performing standard circuit design processes such as timing analysis, verification, design rule checking, place and route operations, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Design process <b>1010</b> employs and incorporates logic and physical design tools such as HDL compilers and simulation model build tools to process design structure <b>1020</b> together with some or all of the depicted supporting data structures along with any additional mechanical design or data (if applicable), to generate a second design structure <b>1090</b>. Design structure <b>1090</b> resides on a storage medium or programmable gate array in a data format used for the exchange of data of mechanical devices and structures (e.g. information stored in a IGES, DXF, Parasolid XT, JT, DRG, or any other suitable format for storing or rendering such mechanical design structures).
