<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is related to an automotive interior lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, there is known an automotive interior lamp described in Patent Document 1 which is used to attach an interior lamp to a ceiling of a passenger compartment (refer to Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an attaching construction of a lamp unit described in Patent Document 1, a fixing device for fixing an interior lamp and a reinforcement together is provided on an reinforcement side of a holder so as to hang therefrom. In addition, flexible arms and flexible arm restricting portions are provided. The flexible arms are each bent into an inverted U-shape, and a distal end portion of the flexible arm is locked on an attachment portion of the reinforcement. The flexible arm restricting portions are provided at a side of the corresponding flexible arms so as to be brought into engagement with supporting pieces of the corresponding flexible arms to thereby restrict the distal end portions of the flexible arms from being displaced along an attachment/detachment direction of the interior lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the attaching construction of Patent Document 1, a module can be installed in the vehicle body panel in an ensured fashion by the distal end portions of the flexible arms. In addition, the distal end portions of the flexible arms are not displaced towards the interior of the passenger compartment along the attachment/detachment direction of the interior lamp to/from the vehicle body panel when the module is installed on the vehicle body panel. Therefore, an excessive clearance is unnecessary between an attachment portion on the vehicle body panel and the module in consideration of the displacement of the distal end portions of the flexible arms. Additionally, even when a strong external force is exerted on the fixed module which directs the module towards the interior of the passenger compartment with respect to the vehicle body panel, the flexible arms are advantageously prevented from being disengaged from the fixed state to the attachment portions of the reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, since a slide construction is needed in a mold for forming the flexible arms in the attaching construction of Patent Document 1, costs for the mold is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A resin clips <b>200</b>C in a related art are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 7B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> show one of the resin clips <b>200</b>C provided in a four corners of a housing <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a perspective view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a vertical sectional view of the clip <b>200</b>C. As is shown in the sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the resin clip <b>200</b>C includes a base portion <b>200</b>B connected to the housing <b>20</b>, an inverted U-shape portion <b>200</b>U connected to the base portion <b>200</b>B, a lock <b>200</b>L connected to the inverted U-shape portion <b>200</b>U and forming a hook portion <b>200</b>K and a projecting piece <b>200</b>T formed at a lower portion of the lock <b>200</b>L to thereby be configured as a spring formed into an inverted U-shape in whole and exhibiting an elastic force resulting from the elasticity of the resin material of which the resin clip <b>200</b>C is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The resin clips <b>200</b>C having elasticity are formed in the four corners (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the housing <b>20</b>. Therefore, when the respective locks <b>200</b>L of the four resin clips <b>200</b>C are pushed up towards the circumferential edge <b>61</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of an opening in a reinforcement <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) from below, the locks <b>200</b>L ride over the circumferential edge <b>61</b> of the opening in the reinforcement <b>60</b> due to their inclined portions and the elastic force exhibited by the resin clips <b>200</b>C, and the hooks <b>200</b>K of the locks <b>200</b>L lock on the circumferential edge <b>61</b> of the opening in the reinforcement <b>60</b>, whereby a lamp assembly <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) including the housing <b>20</b> is installed on the reinforcement <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in such a state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the automotive interior lamp <b>100</b> including the resin clips <b>200</b>C of the related art, when a force acts in a downward direction F<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) due to the weight of the lamp assembly <b>40</b>, lower end portions of the locks <b>200</b>L of the resin clips <b>200</b>C move in a direction F<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, as a result of which the housing <b>20</b> hangs by a distance t<b>1</b> as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, resulting in a fear that the exact attached state cannot be maintained.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore one advantageous aspect of the present invention to provide an automotive interior lamp having a shape for which a mold with a slide construction is needed, to thereby reduce costs.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, it is therefore another advantageous aspect of the present invention to provide an automotive interior lamp which prevents a housing from hanging by preventing lower end portions of resin clips from opening even when the lower end portions of the resin clips attempt to open by the own weight of a lamp assembly after attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a lamp assembly configured to be attached with a reinforcement through an opening formed in a roof panel, the lamp assembly comprising:</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLIFIED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, an automotive interior lamp according to an embodiment of the present invention is described.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an automotive interior lamp <b>100</b> which is installed in a vehicle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a lamp assembly <b>40</b> which is made up of residual parts resulting after a connector <b>11</b>, a roof panel <b>50</b> and a reinforcement <b>60</b> are removed from the automotive interior lamp <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the automotive interior lamp <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which is depicted as being installed in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the lamp assembly <b>40</b> is integrally built up by installing switch knobs <b>12</b>, contacts <b>13</b> and bulbs <b>14</b> in a housing <b>20</b>, fitting a busbar <b>30</b> from above in the housing <b>20</b> for electrically connecting electric parts in the housing to make up a lamp function portion, fitting a lens <b>10</b> which constitutes a design portion on the housing <b>20</b> from below, and causing locking pieces <b>10</b>K which are provided at four locations on a circumferential edge of the lens <b>10</b> to be locked on corresponding locking portions on the housing <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an automotive interior lamp <b>100</b> installed in the vehicle, a lamp assembly <b>40</b> is installed on the roof panel <b>50</b> by use of resin clips <b>20</b>C provided on the lamp assembly <b>40</b> so as to assemble a roof module. In addition, a connector <b>11</b> is fitted in a connecting portion of the housing <b>20</b>, and the roof module is installed on the reinforcement <b>60</b> which is a vehicle body side part by use of the resin clips <b>20</b>C, whereby the automotive interior lamp <b>100</b> installed in the vehicle is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">First, to install the automotive interior lamp <b>100</b> in the vehicle, a primary locking is performed. In the primary locking, the lamp assembly <b>40</b> is moved to approach the roof panel <b>50</b> from below, so that the resin clips <b>20</b>C of the housing <b>20</b> which makes up the lamp assembly <b>40</b> are locked on a circumferential edge <b>51</b> of the opening in the roof panel <b>50</b>, to assemble the roof module. Following this, a secondary locking is performed. In the secondary locking, the roof module is moved to approach the reinforcement <b>60</b> from below, so that the resin clips <b>20</b>C of the housing <b>20</b> which makes up the lamp assembly <b>40</b> are locked on a circumferential edge <b>61</b> of the opening in the reinforcement <b>60</b>. Locking arms <b>20</b>D are locked on the circumferential edge <b>51</b> of the opening in the roof panel <b>50</b> when the resin clips <b>20</b>C are locked on the circumferential edge <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the resin clips <b>20</b>C are formed in four corners of the housing <b>20</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one of the resin clips <b>20</b>C which is disposed at a left front of the housing <b>20</b> is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the resin clip <b>20</b>C includes a base portion <b>20</b>B connected to the housing <b>20</b>, an inverted U-shape portion <b>20</b>U connected to the base portion <b>20</b>B, a lock <b>20</b>L connected to the inverted U-shape portion <b>20</b>U and in which a hook <b>20</b>K is formed, a projecting piece <b>20</b>T formed at a lower portion of the lock <b>20</b>L and an extension portion <b>20</b>E connected to the projecting piece <b>20</b>T and extending further downwards, and a side projecting piece <b>20</b>S is formed on each of side surfaces of the extension portion <b>20</b>E. The side projecting piece <b>20</b>S is projected from each of the side surfaces in a direction crossing an extending direction of the extension portion <b>20</b>E.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The resin clip <b>20</b>C of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> differs from the resin clip <b>200</b>C of the invention of the related art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in that (1) the extension portion <b>20</b>E is provided which is connected to the projecting piece <b>20</b>T formed at the lower portion of the lock <b>20</b>L so as to extend further downwards and that (2) the side projecting pieces <b>20</b>S are formed at lower ends of the side surfaces of the extension portion <b>20</b>E so as to be brought into contact with front projecting pieces <b>20</b>F formed on the housing <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a circumferential edge <b>51</b> is formed in an opening in a roof panel <b>50</b> according to the invention for primary locking of the resin clips <b>20</b>C before the resin clips <b>20</b>C are locked on the circumferential edge <b>61</b> of an opening in the reinforcement <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The resin clip <b>20</b>C of the housing <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is formed so that no restriction member is formed on outer sides thereof. On the other hand, in the housing <b>20</b> according to the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the front projecting pieces <b>20</b>F are formed on a surface of the housing <b>20</b> which the side projecting pieces <b>20</b>S formed on both the side surfaces of the extension portion <b>20</b>E at the lowermost end of the resin clip <b>20</b>C face with a space defined therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Consequently, the front projecting pieces <b>20</b>F prevent the corresponding side projecting pieces <b>20</b>S from being opened outwards, thereby making it possible to prevent the deformation of the resin clip.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, cutouts K are provided in the housing <b>20</b>, and the front projecting pieces <b>20</b>F are formed in the positions which face the side projecting pieces <b>20</b>S.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A dimension A between the cutouts K is larger than a width dimension B of the side projecting piece <b>20</b>S. The width dimension B of the side projecting piece <b>20</b>S is larger than a dimension C between the front projecting pieces <b>20</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Consequently, the resin clip is formed integrally between the cutouts K within the dimension A, whereby the housing <b>20</b> can be molded only by upper and lower molds without using a slide.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5D</figref> show vertical sectional views explaining steps of installing the resin clip <b>20</b>C on the roof panel <b>50</b> and the reinforcement <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a sectional view showing a state before a primary locking. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a sectional view showing a state of the primary locking. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> is a sectional view showing a state of a secondary locking. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> is a sectional view explaining the reason that the housing <b>20</b> is prevented from hanging. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the circumferential edge <b>51</b> of the opening in the roof panel <b>50</b> rises upwards from a base portion of the roof panel <b>50</b> to approach the reinforcement <b>60</b> and extends slightly further leftwards (closer to a center of the opening) than the circumferential edge <b>61</b> of the opening in the reinforcement <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the lock <b>20</b>L of the resin clip <b>20</b>C is moved to approach the roof panel <b>50</b> in a direction indicated by an arrow P from below the roof panel <b>50</b> as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the lock <b>20</b>L rides over the circumferential edge <b>51</b> of the opening in the roof panel <b>50</b> due to its elasticity (the primary locking). A roof module is obtained by this primary locking. Following this, when the roof module is raised further, the lock <b>20</b>L rides over the circumferential edge <b>61</b> of the opening in the reinforcement <b>60</b> due to its elasticity, and the hook <b>20</b>K of the resin clip <b>20</b>C is locked on the circumferential edge <b>61</b> of the opening in the reinforcement <b>60</b> as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> (the secondary locking). As this occurs, the side projecting pieces <b>20</b>S provided at the lower ends of both the sides of the lower portion of the extension portion <b>20</b>E come into contact with the corresponding front projecting pieces <b>20</b>F of the housing as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, so as to prevent the outward opening of the resin clip <b>20</b>C, whereby the lamp assembly <b>40</b> including the housing <b>20</b> is installed firmly on the reinforcement <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the automotive interior lamp <b>100</b> obtained in the way described above, even when a downward force is exerted on the lamp due to the own weight of the lamp assembly <b>40</b>, the side projecting pieces <b>20</b>S on the extension portion <b>20</b>E provided according to the invention come into abutment with the corresponding front projecting pieces <b>20</b>F, so as to prevent the outward opening of the resin clip <b>20</b>C. As a result of this, the housing <b>20</b> is prevented from hanging.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, a space between the front projecting pieces <b>20</b>F of the housing <b>20</b> and the reinforcement <b>60</b> is equal to a length from the hook <b>20</b>K of the resin clip <b>20</b>C to a distal end of the extension portion <b>20</b>E in such a state that the resin clip <b>20</b>C is locked on the reinforcement <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>). Therefore, even when the downward force is exerted on the lamp due to the own weight of the lamp assembly <b>40</b>, only a small force is exerted on the front projecting pieces <b>20</b>F of the housing <b>20</b>, and therefore, the strength of the front projecting pieces <b>20</b>F does not have to be high.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, according to the invention, the use of a mold with a slide construction, which constitutes the problem inherent in the conventional automotive interior lamp, does not have to be used, and the excessive deformation due to the hanging of the housing, which also constitutes the problem inherent in the conventional automotive interior lamp, can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although the present invention has been shown and described with reference to specific preferred embodiments, various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings herein. Such changes and modifications as are obvious are deemed to come within the spirit, scope and contemplation of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
