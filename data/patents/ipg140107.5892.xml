No. 7,500,000, which issued on Mar. 3, 2009, which patent applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to management and control of resources in a computing system. More particularly, the invention concerns assigning or creating a resource, such as storage, for a device, such as a host computer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Modern computing systems frequently utilize a large number of computing devices, storage devices, and other components. In a common implementation, a Storage Area Network (SAN) is used to connect computing devices with a large number of storage devices. Management and modeling programs may be used to manage these complex computing environments.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Storage Management Initiative Specification (SMI-S)/Bluefin, and Common Information Model (CIM) technologies, are widely used for managing storage devices and storage environments. The SMI-S is a standard management interface that allows different classes of hardware and software products to interoperate for monitoring and controlling resources. For example, the SMI-S permits storage management systems to identify, classify, monitor, and control physical and logical resources in a SAN. The SMI-S is based on CIM, and Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) architecture. CIM is a model for describing management information, and WBEM is an architecture for using Internet technologies to manage systems and networks. The SMI-S uses CIM to define objects that represent storage entities such as Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs), Disks, Storage Subsystems, Switches, and host Computer Systems. (In many, but not all cases, the term &#x201c;volume&#x201d; is interchangeable with the term &#x201c;LUN&#x201d;.) CIM also defines the associations that may or may not exist between these objects, such as a Disk being associated to a Storage Subsystem because it physically resides in the Storage Subsystem.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The CIM Objects mentioned above may be managed by a CIM Object Manager (CIMOM). A storage management software application, such as IBM Tivoli Storage Resource Manager (ITSRM), can use a CIM Client to connect to a CIMOM, to retrieve information about the storage entities that the CIMOM manages, and also to perform active configuration of the storage entities. Storage management software that uses a CIM Client may be called a CIM Client Application.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The SMI-S/Bluefin describes how a current storage LUN is mapped. However, the Logical Unit Number (LUN) Masking and Mapping Profile evolved rapidly from the time that the Bluefin Specification was developed to the present version, which is defined in the SMI-S Public Review Draft SMI-S Version 1.0. As a consequence of the rapid evolution, ITSRM 1.2 and the IBM ESS CIM Server for the IBM Enterprise Storage Server (ESS) support a version of the LUN Masking and Mapping Profile that was &#x201c;captured&#x201d; between the Profile's Bluefin definition and the Profile's SMI-S definition. (A CIM Server is a CIMOM and a set of CIM Providers.) Consequently, the IBM ESS CIM Server uses a different masking algorithm than described in the latest SMI-S/Bluefin specification, and different associations are made to map a storage LUN to a particular host. These differences can result in complexity and difficulties.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although the SMI-S/Bluefin describes several methods for assigning a LUN from a disk storage system to a host or HardwareAccount, or for adding a LUN to a disk storage system, the complexity of the CIM object model makes it difficult for a CIM Client application to simply request storage space in a disk storage system.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, the SMI-S/Bluefin describes how to add a LUN to a disk storage system, wherein the method CreateOrModifyElementFromStoragePool( ) in the StorageConfigurationService object is used to create a LUN (or storage volume) given the LUN type, the size of the LUN, a storage pool CIM object path and the StorageConfigurationService. The resulting LUN can then be assigned to a host or several hosts available to the disk storage system. Details of the CreateOrModifyElementFromStoragePool( ) method are as follows:</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0018">Generally, there is substantial complexity when using the CIM object model to create a LUN. For example, the StoragePool object does not have a direct association to the ComputerSystem's StorageConfigurationService, so the StoragePool object has to be first associated to the ComputerSystem, and the ComputerSystem then has to be associated to the StorageConfigurationService to associate a StoragePool to a StorageConfigurationService. Also, because the ComputerSystem can represent more than just a disk storage system, the correct ComputerSystem must be located before making the association to the StorageConfigurationService.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">In summary, known techniques for assigning a LUN from a disk storage system to a host or HardwareAccount, and for adding a LUN to a disk storage system, are difficult and overly complex.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">One aspect of the invention is a method for assigning a resource (for example, storage). An example of the method includes receiving a request for a resource (for example, storage), wherein the request includes a list of paths. This example also includes retrieving a HardwareAccount, Controller, and an AccessAuthorization object for a first path in the list of paths. This example further includes making an attach device request to a CIMOM for a first available resource, using the Controller and the AccessAuthorization object. This example also includes determining if the first available resource was successfully attached, and if so, recording the assignment as successful, and if not, rolling back all assignments for the first available resource that were previously recorded as successful.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">Another aspect of the invention is a method for creating at least one LUN. An example of the method includes receiving a request to create storage, wherein the request specifies a LUN size and a requested number of LUNs. This example additionally includes selecting a StoragePool object with available space to create the requested number of LUNs. This example further includes retrieving a StorageConfigurationService of a disk storage system using the association of all ComputerSystem objects to the selected StoragePool object, and associating a ComputerSystem object representing the disk storage system with the StorageConfigurationService. This example also includes setting the LUN size equal to a calculated size, and setting the storage pool to be the selected StoragePool object. This example further includes invoking a CreateOrModifyElementFromStoragePool( ) method through the retrieved StorageConfigurationService.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">Other aspects of the invention are described in the sections below, and include, for example, a computing system, and a signal bearing medium tangibly embodying a program of machine-readable instructions executable by a digital processing apparatus to perform a method for assigning a resource or for creating at least one LUN.</p>

In other examples, the host <b>102</b>, host <b>104</b>, ITSRM server <b>106</b>, and the CIM server <b>107</b> could be an IBM xSeries server, or an IBM zSeries Parallel Sysplex server, such as a zSeries 900, running the z Operating System (z/OS), or an IBM S/390 server running OS/390. Host <b>102</b>, host <b>104</b>, ITSRM server <b>106</b>, and/or CIM server <b>107</b> could also run Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM), which is available from IBM Corporation.

<p id="p-0034" num="0046">In addition to the hardware embodiments described above, other aspects of the invention concern methods for assigning a resource (for example, storage) to a requesting device, and for creating at least one LUN.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">A. Signal-Bearing Media</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0047">In the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the method aspects of the invention may be implemented, for example, by having the host <b>102</b>, the host <b>104</b>, the ITSRM Server <b>106</b>, and/or the CIM server <b>107</b> (or the CIM Server <b>220</b>) execute a sequence of machine-readable instructions, which can also be referred to as code. These instructions may reside in various types of signal-bearing media. In this respect, some aspects of the present invention concern a programmed product, comprising a signal-bearing medium or signal-bearing media tangibly embodying a program of machine-readable instructions executable by a digital processing apparatus to perform a method for assigning a resource (for example, storage) to a requesting device, or for creating at least one LUN.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0048">This signal-bearing medium may comprise, for example, primary memory <b>112</b> and/or non-volatile memory <b>114</b>, primary memory <b>122</b> and/or non-volatile memory <b>124</b>, primary memory <b>132</b> and/or non-volatile memory <b>134</b>, primary memory <b>142</b> and/or non-volatile memory <b>144</b>, and/or primary memory <b>252</b> and/or non-volatile memory <b>254</b>.

The optical disc can be any type of signal bearing disc or disk, for example, a CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, WORM, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, or DVD+RW. Additionally, whether contained in the computing system <b>100</b> or <b>200</b>, or elsewhere, the instructions may be stored on any of a variety of machine-readable data storage mediums or media, which may include, for example, a &#x201c;hard drive&#x201d;, a RAID array, a RAMAC, a magnetic data storage diskette (such as a floppy disk), magnetic tape, digital optical tape, RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory, magneto-optical storage, paper punch cards, or any other suitable signal-bearing media including transmission media such as digital and/or analog communications links, which may be electrical, optical, and/or wireless.

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">B. Overall Sequence of Operation</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0049">For ease of explanation, but without any intended limitation, the method aspects of the invention are described with reference to the computing system <b>100</b> described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">First Example of Method Aspect of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0050">A first example of the method aspect of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, which show a sequence <b>400</b> for a method for assigning a resource, which may be, for example, storage. The resource may generally be any resource in a computing system. Assigning a resource (or storage) may also be called mapping a resource (or storage). Some examples of the method may also be described as a method for provisioning a resource, by providing a new resource that meets the requirements of a caller and mapping the new resource (such as storage) to a desired entity (such as a host) in the SAN <b>118</b>. The sequence <b>400</b> could be performed by host <b>102</b>, host <b>104</b>, ITSRM server <b>106</b>, CIM server <b>107</b>, or by some other computing device. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the sequence <b>400</b> may include, and begin with, operation <b>402</b> which comprises receiving a request for a resource (for example, storage), wherein the request includes a list of paths. The request may also include a requested number of LUNs. The request may also include a requested amount of storage space. The request may also specify a storage pool or storage pools from which it is desired that the storage be assigned from.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0051">As an example, the request may be made by a CIM Client Application. The CIM Client Application may make the request, for example, in response to a requesting device (such as host <b>102</b> or host <b>104</b>), asking for a file system extension, which is a request for additional storage to make a file system larger. Alternatively, the CIM Client Application could make the request in response to a manual submission from a user, or in response to an automated process associated with an external tool, asking for storage, for example, based on a report.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0052">Connectivity information may be used to generate the list of paths. Connectivity information is the information needed to connect a model LUN, to the requesting device. A model LUN is a LUN anywhere in the SAN <b>118</b> that can be connected to the requesting device. Thus, an existing LUN connected to the SAN <b>118</b> can be used to map an available LUN. This may be accomplished by retrieving the host paths to the model LUN. For example, a path to a model LUN may include the target Fibre Channel Port of the path on a disk storage system, and the World Wide Name (WWN) of the host port adapter or HardwareAccount. This eliminates the need to create a cloned controller and a new HardwareAccount. Consequently, only the AttachDevice method in the AuthorizationService object need be used to map a storage volume (or LUN) to all of the host paths from the model LUN. As described below, the AttachDevice method may then be called using the controller, the LUN, and the AuthorizationService. A successful attachment then allows the host to use the LUN.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0053">Sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>404</b>, which comprises determining if connectivity information is good, and if it is determined that the connectivity information is not good, then the sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>406</b> which comprises failing the request. If the connectivity information is good, sequence <b>400</b> may include operation <b>408</b>, which comprises selecting a first available LUN from all LUNs in a SAN that are accessible by a requesting device (such as host <b>102</b> or host <b>104</b>). Alternatively, the first available LUN may be selected from all LUNs in a storage pool that are accessible by the requesting device. A best fit algorithm may be used for selecting the first available LUN.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0054">Sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>410</b>, which comprises retrieving a HardwareAccount, Controller, and an AccessAuthorization object for a first path in the list of paths. Sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>412</b>, which comprises making an attach device request to a CIMOM for a first available resource (for example, a first available LUN), using the Controller and the AccessAuthorization object.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0055">Sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>414</b>, which comprises determining if the first available resource (for example, the first available LUN) was successfully attached, and if not, the sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>416</b>, which comprises rolling back all assignments for the first available resource (for example, the first available LUN) that were previously recorded as successful. If the first available resource (for example, the first available LUN) was successfully attached, the sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>418</b> which comprises recording the assignment as successful.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0056">Sequence <b>400</b> may further include operation <b>420</b>, which comprises determining if there is an additional path in the list of paths, and if so, the sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>422</b> which comprises retrieving a HardwareAccount, Controller, and an AccessAuthorization object for an additional path in the list of paths, and may also include repeating operations <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> for the first available LUN using the additional path (which may be called a second path). The operations discussed in this paragraph may be repeated until there are no additional paths.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0057">If in operation <b>420</b> it is determined that there is no additional path in the list of paths, then sequence <b>400</b> may include operation <b>424</b>, which comprises sending assignment information to a requesting device (for example host <b>102</b> or host <b>104</b>). Thus, assignment information is sent to the requesting device for the first available LUN after the first available LUN is successfully attached using each path in the list of paths. Sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>426</b>, which comprises determining if an additional resource (for example an additional LUN) is requested. If in operation <b>426</b> it is determined that no additional LUN is requested then the sequence <b>400</b> may end.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0058">If in operation <b>426</b> it is determined that an additional LUN is requested, then sequence <b>400</b> may include operation <b>428</b>, which comprises selecting an additional available LUN (which may be called a second available LUN). A best fit algorithm may be used for selecting the additional available LUN. After selecting the second available LUN, sequence <b>400</b> may also include repeating operation <b>410</b> (retrieving a HardwareAccount, Controller, and AccessAuthorization object for the first path for the second available LUN), and may include repeating operation <b>412</b> (making an attach device request to a CIMON) and operation <b>414</b> (determining if the second LUN was successfully attached for the second available LUN). If in operation <b>414</b> it is determined that the second available LUN was not successfully attached, then the sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>416</b> (which comprises rolling back all assignments for the second LUN that were previously recorded as successful).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0059">Operation <b>420</b> (determining if there is an additional path in the list of paths) may also be performed, and if in operation <b>420</b> it is determined that there is an additional path in the list of paths, the sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>422</b> which comprises retrieving a HardwareAccount, Controller, and an AccessAuthorization object for an additional path in the list of paths. If there is an additional path, operations <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> may be performed for the second available LUN using the additional path (which may be called a second path). The operations discussed in this paragraph may be repeated until there are no additional paths.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0060">If in operation <b>420</b> it is determined that there is no additional path in the list of paths, then operation <b>424</b>, which comprises sending assignment information to a requesting device (for example host <b>102</b> or host <b>104</b>) may be performed for the second available LUN. Thus, assignment information is sent to the requesting device for the second available LUN after the second available LUN is successfully attached using each path in the list of paths. Sequence <b>400</b> may also include operation <b>426</b>, which comprises determining if an additional resource (for example an additional LUN) is requested. If another additional LUN is requested (a third LUN), then operations may be repeated as described above for the second LUN. If in operation <b>426</b> it is determined that no additional LUN is requested then the sequence <b>400</b> may end.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0061">The preceding method may be called a method for assignment of LUNS through abstraction of CIM Objects. The complexity of CIM object model makes it difficult for a CIM Client application to simply request storage space in a disk storage system, so the mid-level abstraction of the steps to create a LUN on a disk storage system, described herein, was created to make it easier to request storage space for one to many LUNS on different disk storage systems. This makes it possible for the caller of the mid-level abstraction to know little or nothing of the CIM object model. Thus, a CIM Client application that requests a number of available LUNs to be assigned through the CIMOM server does not require knowledge of the CIM objects and their associations in the CIMOM. Using this mid level abstraction of LUN assignment in the CIMOM, a caller need only supply the assignment parameters for the LUN(s). Thus, a CIM Client Application is able to assign available LUNs with little or no knowledge of the CIM objects, by interfacing with the mid-level abstraction of CIM LUN assignment. For example, the CIM Client Application passes a list of paths to a model LUN, and the mid-level abstraction then assigns the available LUN using the attach device method for each path that was passed. If a failure occurs, all paths that were successfully assigned will be masked or &#x201c;detached&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0062">Examples of the invention may include one or more of the following operations: A request to assign an amount of available LUNs on a supported disk storage system is passed to a CIM Client Application. A list of paths to a model LUN is abstracted from a model LUN that is passed to a CIM Client Application. For each available LUN, the paths and the available LUN is passed to the mid-level abstraction for LUN assignment. For each path, the HardwareAccount, Controller, and AccessAuthorization object is retrieved. Given the Controller, the available LUN, and the AccessAuthorization object, an attach device request is made to the CIMOM. If the attach device fails, all prior successful assignments for the available LUN are rolled back and the assignment fails. The successful assignments are recorded until all assignments are successful. The newly assigned LUN is then returned with its assignment complete and the next available LUN is assigned in the same way. If any of the assignments of available LUNs fail, all successful assignments may be rolled back, resulting in an overall assignment failure.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0063">The following are examples of some higher level method calls that may be used to implement some examples of the invention:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0064">assign( )&#x2014;Given a volume from a disk storage system and the corresponding PathsToLun of a model Lun on the same disk storage system, assign the volumes exactly as the model Lun.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0065">unassign( )&#x2014;Given a volume from a disk storage system that had been successfully assigned and the corresponding PathsToLun of a model Lun on the same disk storage system, unassign the volumes from all Paths ToLun. Unassigning may also be called masking.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0066">Some examples of the invention provide one or more of the following benefits: A CIM Client Application's code for assignment of available LUNs in a CIMOM is simplified. Knowledge of CIM may be limited to assign parameters. No knowledge of the PathToLun attributes and the way in which a LUN is assigned using the many PathToLun objects is required. A CIM Client Application is permitted to request the assignment of available LUNs given a single list of paths to a model LUN. Rather than attempting assignment on all possible paths, the list of paths limits where the assignment may occur. Lower-level CIM Client API calls can be modified to use different versions of the Bluefin/SMI-S LUN Masking and Mapping Model, and the CIM Client Application can code to the abstraction layer with no knowledge of the changes.</p>

The sequence <b>500</b> may also include operation <b>504</b>, which comprises calculating LUN size based on a size constraint passed by the caller. The size may also be based on a constraint of a disk storage system.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0068">Sequence <b>500</b> may also include operation <b>506</b>, which comprises selecting a StoragePool object with available space to create the requested number of LUNs. Sequence <b>500</b> may also include operation <b>508</b>, which comprises converting the calculated size from megabytes to million bytes. Sequence <b>500</b> may also include operation <b>510</b>, which comprises retrieving a StorageConfigurationService of a disk storage system using the association of all ComputerSystem objects to the selected StoragePool object. The sequence <b>500</b> may also include operation <b>512</b>, which comprises associating a ComputerSystem object representing the disk storage system with the StorageConfigurationService.

The sequence <b>500</b> may also include operation <b>520</b>, which comprises setting the storage pool to be the selected StoragePool object. The sequence <b>500</b> may also include operation <b>522</b>, which comprises invoking a CreateOrModifyElementFromStoragePool( ) method through the retrieved StorageConfigurationService for each LUN in the requested number of LUNs.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0069">The sequence <b>500</b> may further include operation <b>524</b>, which comprises determining if an error has occurred. If an error has occurred, the sequence <b>500</b> may further include operation <b>526</b>, which comprises recording the error, and may also include operation <b>528</b>, which comprises selecting an additional StoragePool object with available space to create the at least one LUNs, if an additional StoragePool object with available space is available.

One or more of operations <b>508</b>-<b>522</b> may also be repeated, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0070">If in operation <b>524</b> it is determined that no error has occurred, then the sequence <b>500</b> may also include operation <b>530</b>, which comprises returning a list of LUNs. Sequence <b>500</b> may also include operation <b>532</b>, which comprises assigning the LUNs on the list of LUNs to a requesting host. Sequence <b>500</b> may further include operation <b>534</b>, which comprises sending LUN assignment information to the requesting host.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0071">The preceding method may be called a method for provisioning new LUNs through the abstraction of CIM objects. The complexity of the CIM object model makes it difficult for a CIM Client application to simply request storage space in a disk storage system, so a mid-level abstraction of the steps to create a LUN on a disk storage system as described herein, was created to make it easier to request storage space, for one or many LUNs on different disk storage systems. This makes it possible for the caller of the mid-level abstraction to know little or nothing of the CIM object model. A CIM Client Application that requests a desired size and number of LUNs to be created through the CIMOM server does not need to have knowledge of the CIM objects and their associations in the CIMOM. Due to the mid level abstraction of LUN creation in the CIMOM, the caller can supply only the creation parameters for the LUN(s). Thus, a CIM Client application may create LUNs with little or no knowledge of the CIM objects, by interfacing with the mid-level abstraction of CIM LUN creation. For example, the application may send only the amount of LUNs to create, the desired size of each LUN, a list of storage pools in which to create the LUNs. The mid level abstraction may then take further steps to calculate the amount of space needed to create the LUN based on constraints of the specific disk storage system. Furthermore, the mid level abstraction may then take the total amount of space desired and select a suitable storage pool from the storage pool list. Once a storage pool list is selected, the amount of LUNs may be created one at a time using an interface to a CIM Client utility that invokes the CreateOrModifyElementFromStoragePool( ) method.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0072">Thus, a higher level client does not need to understand all CIM objects required for LUN creation; parameters used by the higher level client to create LUNs are simplified; retryable errors do not have to be handled by the higher level client; and the higher level client may make multiple creation requests. Additionally, many examples of the invention will benefit developers working on a CIM Client Application because these examples reduce development time and improve code maintainability, facilitating faster time to market for a CIM Client Application product.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0073">Examples of the invention may include one or more of the following operations: A request to create a certain amount of LUNs on a supported disk storage system for a certain specified size is passed to a CIM Client Application. A list of storage pools in which to attempt creation of the LUNs is then generated. A mid level layer is then called to create a certain amount of LUNs for a specified size given a list of storage pools. The size may be calculated based on an optional constraint that may be passed by the caller, and based on a constraint of the disk storage system. For example, an IBM Enterprise Storage Server (ESS) has an incremental constraint of creating LUNs at a size of 100 million bytes. A storage pool with available space may then be selected to create the LUNs. If necessary, the size to create each LUN is converted from megabytes to million bytes. For example, the IBM ESS creates LUNs in terms where 1 Mb is actually 1,000,000 bytes and not 1,048,576 bytes. Using the selected storage pool, the StorageConfigurationService of the disk storage system is retrieved using the association of all ComputerSystem objects to the selected StoragePool object, and the ComputerSystem object representing the disk storage system is then associated with the StorageConfigurationService. The ElementType may be set to either a StorageVolume or StorageExtent, depending on what is allowed by the disk storage system vendor. For example, the IBM ESS supports the ElementType of &#x201c;2&#x201d; or StorageVolume. The size is set to the calculated size in the units supported by the disk storage system vendor. For example, the IBM ESS supports the size to be passed in terms of million byte increments. The storage setting may be selected based on the desired redundancy level, but may be ignored in favor of what the selected storage pool has set. The storage pool is set to the selected storage pool. The CreateOrModifyElementFromStoragePool( ) method may then invoked with these parameters through the retrieved StorageConfigurationService object. If an error occurs, and if there are storage pools wherein the storage creation has not been attempted, the remainder of the storage pool list may be exhausted until the LUNs are created or until no more storage pools are left to attempt a creation request. Each error may be recorded for future referral. If the request is not satisfied, no storage volume objects are returned, which indicates that the create request failed. If the request was satisfied, a list of storage volume objects filled with information obtained from a storage object retrieval tool may be returned. This information can then be used to make the necessary assignments from the LUNs to the host.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0074">The following is an example of a higher level method call that may be used to implement some examples of the invention:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0075">createWithinPoolList( )&#x2014;Given a list of storage pools, the number of LUNs to create, the desired LUN size to create, return newly allocated LUNs from the given storage pools.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0076">Some examples of the invention provide one or more of the following benefits: Code for CIM Client Applications for creating LUNs in a CIMOM is simplified. A CIM Client Application's knowledge may be limited to access parameters. A request to create LUNs does not require an understanding of disk storage system constraints. Tracking errors for each failure on each storage pool is not necessary. A CIM Client Application is permitted to request the creation of LUNs given a list of storage pools. A single list can be passed to create the desired amount and size of LUNs, rather than attempting creation on each available storage pool. Errors that do occur will not necessarily fail a request, but all errors may be recorded if debugging is required. Generally many examples of the invention permit creating LUNs faster, simpler, and with fewer resources, than would otherwise be required.</p>
