<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national phase application based on PCT/IB2011/002313, filed Sep. 28, 2011, which claims the benefit of priority of Italian Patent Application No. MI2010A001789, flied Sep. 30, 2010, and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/388,797, filed Oct. 1, 2010, the content of all of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a method and system for determining the potential friction between a tyre for vehicles and a rolling surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The incorporation of electronic devices inside the tyres is becoming increasingly important in order to increase the vehicle safety. Such devices may, for example, include sensors and other components suitable for obtaining information about various quantities of a tyre such as, temperature, pressure, acceleration, number of tyre revolutions, vehicle speed. Such devices may further include a transmitter (typically wireless) for sending out of the tyre (typically to a control unit on board of the vehicle) the information obtained by the sensors and a microprocessor suitable for gathering and processing signals coming from the sensors, prior to the transmission thereof. Optionally, such devices may also include a receiver (typically wireless) for receiving any information from the outside (for example, from a control unit on board of the vehicle).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this context, analysing and monitoring the interaction between the tyres of a vehicle and the rolling surface whereon the same operate during the use thereof may provide useful information to the driver of a vehicle as a driving aid and/or provide useful information to automatic control systems the same vehicle may be provided with and/or provide useful information to other vehicles or infrastructures other than the vehicle itself in order to enable, for example, traffic control and monitoring systems. For example, such information may be used by a traffic control and monitoring system for providing warning signals and/or adjusting the speed limits in adaptive speed limit systems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, the estimate of the potential friction may be important for allowing the development of technologies for active control systems of a vehicle dynamics or for driver assistance systems (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The potential friction is defined as the ordinate of the absolute maximum point in a kinetic friction/slip curve. The kinetic friction is defined as the ratio between the force exchanged in the plane of contact between the tyre and the rolling surface and the vertical load acting on the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows two exemplary patterns of the kinetic friction coefficient &#x3bc;<sub>k </sub>as a function of the slip &#x3c3; for two different conditions of tyre-rolling surface system.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the conditions of the tyre-rolling surface system vary, that is, the operating conditions of the tyre (such as vertical load acting on the tyre, tyre inflation pressure, speed, wear, temperature, etc.), the features of the tyre itself (structure, mixture, etc.), and/or the features and conditions of the rolling surface (presence of slippery elements such as snow, ice, leaves, roughness, etc.), the relationship between slip and kinetic friction is described by a different curve (&#x3bc;pot<b>1</b>, &#x3bc;pot<b>2</b>) and the potential friction &#x3bc;pot is correspondingly different.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the practice, the potential friction fixes a limit condition beyond which the tyre grip conditions begin to degrade up to reaching an asymptotic condition in which, even with increasing slip, the friction coefficient remains substantially constant and lower than the maximum friction (i.e. than the potential friction itself).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Systems capable of estimating the potential friction in a tyre-rolling surface system are known in the art such as, for example, the same Bracking Antilock Systems (ABS). Such systems, however, determine the potential friction in braking conditions, when the forces exchanged at the tyre-rolling surface interface are close to the maximum value, that is, at high slips.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The Applicant is instead directing its development activities towards systems capable of determining the potential friction in a tyre-rolling surface system under conditions of &#x201c;free rolling&#x201d; or &#x201c;steady state&#x201d; of the system, that is, under stationary rolling conditions (for example, at a constant speed, substantially in the absence of braking and steering).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, considering that the condition of &#x201c;free rolling&#x201d; or &#x201c;steady state&#x201d; corresponds to small slip values (e.g. less than 1%) and that the friction/slip curves relating to different conditions of the tyre-rolling surface system (which correspond to different potential frictions) are concentrated in the proximity of the origin, almost overlapped (see the region highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the determination of the potential friction in conditions of &#x201c;free rolling&#x201d; is extremely difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The international patent application no. WO 2010/073272 in the name of the same Applicant describes a technique for determining the potential friction without the need of achieving high slips.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Bert Breuer et al. (&#x201c;Methods and Instruments for On-Board Measurement of Tyre/Road Friction&#x201d;, SAE Conference, Dearborn. USA 1994) and U. Eichhorn et al. (&#x201c;Prediction and monitoring of tyre/road friction&#x201d;, in Proc. FISITA 24th Congress: Safety, the Vehicle and the Road Tech. Paper, London, UK, 1992, vol. 2, pp. 67-74) describe a technique for determining the friction between a tyre and the road from the deformation of elements of the tyre tread.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the development of systems capable of determining the potential friction in a tyre-rolling surface system under conditions of &#x201c;free rolling&#x201d; or &#x201c;steady state&#x201d; of the system, the Applicant has carried out activities of acquisition and analysis of curves related to the longitudinal and lateral acceleration component measured, revolution after revolution, by an accelerometer placed on the inner liner of a tyre. This based on the observation that friction is a force that opposes the relative motion between tyre and rolling surface along the longitudinal and lateral direction of the tyre.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">During these activities of acquisition and analysis, having also available curves related to the acceleration radial component measured, revolution after revolution, by an accelerometer placed on the inner liner of a tyre, the Applicant has accidentally observed that two curves of acceleration radial component obtained with two different rolling surfaces (dry asphalt and wet granite) exhibited differences at a very circumscribed transition region wherein&#x2014;due to the exit of the accelerometer from the footprint of the tyre&#x2014;the acceleration radial component passed from a nearly zero value to a maximum value thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Starting from such totally accidental initial observation (afterwards verified also by analysing curves obtained by rolling on different surfaces), the Applicant has surprisingly found that the steepness of transition of the curves of the acceleration radial component, at two transition regions at the entry and exit from the footprint, depends on the interaction between the tyre and the rolling surface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The Applicant has further found that the aforementioned steepness of transition may be correlated with the potential friction.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In particular, the Applicant has found that at said transition regions, the steepness of transition is even higher, the lower the potential friction between the tyre and the rolling surface.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a first aspect thereof, the present invention relates to a method for determining the potential friction between a tyre and a rolling surface, a footprint being defined between said tyre and said rolling surface, said method comprising:

</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0038">The present invention, in at least one of the above aspects thereof, can exhibit at least one of the following preferred features.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0039">In one embodiment, said at least one transition region also comprises at least one portion of R<sub>in </sub>contiguous to said at least one portion of region R<sub>drop</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0040">Preferably, the selected data are representative of the transition region at the exit of said crown portion from the footprint of the tyre. In particular, said at least one portion of region R<sub>drop</sub>, which is comprised in said at least one transition region, is a portion of the region R<sub>drop </sub>in which&#x2014;due to the exit of the crown portion from the footprint&#x2014;the acceleration radial component undergoes, in absolute value, an abrupt increase from a value about zero to a maximum value. The Applicant has, in fact, verified that the difference in the transition steepness between two curves of the acceleration radial component corresponding to two different tyre-rolling surface systems, (and, therefore, to two different potential values of friction) is more visible in the transition region at the exit from the footprint than in the transition region at the entrance into the footprint.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0041">In one embodiment, data are selected which are also representative of another transition region which comprises at least one portion of the other of said two regions R<sub>drop</sub>, contiguous to said region R<sub>in</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0042">In one embodiment, the tyre is rotated under conditions of free rolling.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0043">Advantageously, the data representative of the acceleration radial component are obtained at each tyre revolution.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0044">In a preferred embodiment, prior to obtaining the information correlated with the steepness of transition of said at least one transition region, the selected data are processed through a normalization procedure. Preferably, according to the normalization procedure, the data value is divided by at least one reference value corresponding to the (average) value of the acceleration radial component in a region R<sub>out</sub>, the region R<sub>out </sub>representing a region away from the footprint of the tyre, wherein the value of the acceleration radial component is about equal to the centrifugal acceleration of the tyre. As shown in more detail below, the Applicant has found, in fact, that such a normalization procedure allows making the estimate of the potential friction almost independent of the angular velocity of the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0045">Advantageously, the estimate of the potential friction is made at each revolution of the tyre. Alternatively, an average may be performed on a certain number of revolutions of tyre (e.g. five revolutions maximum in order to make real time estimates).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0046">Advantageously, the processing is carried out starting from data representative of at least 5 points of said at least one transition region. Preferably, the processing is carried out from data representative of at least 8 points of said at least one transition region; even more preferably, the processing is carried out from data representative of at least 10 points of said at least one transition region.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0047">In one embodiment, the information correlated with the steepness of transition of said at least one transition region comprises the value of at least one transition steepness parameter, said parameter being a parameter of a parametric function adapted to approximate the data representative of said at least one transition region and being indicative of the steepness of transition of said at least one transition region. Advantageously, the value of said at least one transition steepness parameter is obtained by determining the value of said parameter that allows the parametric function to best approximate said data representative of said at least one transition region.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0048">In another embodiment, the information correlated with the steepness of transition of said at least one transition region comprises a curve representative of a value or class of known potential friction values. Said curve representative of a value or class of known potential friction values is advantageously obtained by identifying, among a plurality of pre-stored reference curves corresponding to values or classes of known potential friction values, a curve that best approximates said data representative of said at least one transition region.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0049">Advantageously, the system also comprises a monitoring device operatively associated with the tyre, said monitoring device comprising an accelerometer, operatively associated with said crown portion, suitable for measuring the acceleration radial component to which said crown portion is subjected during the rolling of the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0050">Advantageously, said at least one processing unit is operatively connected to said monitoring device so as to receive a signal representative of the acceleration radial component measured by the accelerometer or data representative of said signal.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0111">In particular, based on the Applicant's observation that the transition regions of the acceleration radial component have a much more rounded shape the higher the potential friction between the tyre and the rolling surface, and a much more step-wise shape the lower the potential friction between the tyre and the rolling surface, the fitting function advantageously is a parametric function that has at least one parameter p<sub>i </sub>correlated with the steepness of transition (i.e. with the step-wise shape or roundness) of such transition regions.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0113">In such examples, the parameter correlated with the steepness of transition (step shape) of the transition regions is p<sub>2</sub>.

<p id="p-0103" num="0115">In the various examples of fitting functions, once the values of parameters p<sub>i</sub>, which allow to better approximate the data representative of at least one transition region of the acceleration radial component measured by the accelerometer, have been determined, the potential friction may then be estimated based on the value determined for the parameter(s) (e.g., p<sub>2</sub>) correlated with the steepness of transition of the transition region.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0116">For example, the potential friction may be determined by comparing the value of said parameter(s) with predetermined known reference values, corresponding to predetermined potential friction values.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0117">Alternatively, the potential friction may be obtained from said parameter(s) by applying a specific analytical function that correlates such parameter(s) with the potential friction. For example, such function may be of the type:

<br/>
where &#x3b8;<sub>p </sub>represents the potential friction, p<sub>2 </sub>the parameter correlated therewith, and c<sub>1 </sub>. . . c<sub>m </sub>are coefficients that are selected so as to better reproduce the known reference values.
</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0118">When the fitting procedure is to be applied to both transition regions, the fitting procedure may advantageously be applied separately for the two transition regions so as to take into account any asymmetries of the curve of the acceleration radial component.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0119">According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the estimate of the potential friction may be performed through a similarity procedure which is based on the identification of a curve that best approximates the data representative of at least one transition region of the acceleration radial component measured by the accelerometer, among a plurality of pre-stored curves representative of different values or classes of potential friction values.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0120">For example, the similarity procedure may comprise the following steps:</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">1) constructing a set of reference curves representative of different values or classes of potential friction values (for example by averaging out experimental data relating to known conditions of tyre-road interaction);</p>

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">4) identifying the value or class of potential friction values associated with the selected reference curve.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0121">In step 2), as a criterion of similarity it is possible to use, for example, the operation of correlation between real time acquired experimental data a<sub>r</sub>(t<sub>i</sub>) and the reference curves sampled at instants t<sub>i</sub>, with i=1 . . . n relating to a given tyre revolution.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0122">In step 1), besides from averages of experimental data, the reference curves may be obtained with different mathematical models, such as exponential functions or power laws, suitably parameterized.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0124">In a preferred embodiment, before applying the fitting or similarity procedure, the data representative of at least one transition region of the acceleration radial component measured by accelerometer <b>1</b> may be normalized according to a normalization procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0125">Considering that the acceleration radial component a<sub>r </sub>is typically linked to the electrical signal provided by accelerometer <b>1</b> (for example, voltage V) by means of a relation of the type:

where G is the gain and V<sub>offset </sub>the offset, the normalization may advantageously be carried out so as to make the values of the acceleration radial component independent of the offset (by a subtraction operation) and of the gain (by a division operation) of the accelerometer <b>1</b>.

</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of curve of the acceleration radial component measured by an accelerometer placed on the inner liner of a tyre, normalized by this relation. As may be seen, with this normalization scheme the value of the normalized acceleration radial component is substantially equal to 0 in region R<sub>out </sub>and substantially equal to 1 in region R<sub>in</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0137">It is noted that also the normalization scheme II provides a division operation for an acceleration radial component value in region R<sub>out </sub>that is substantially equal to the centrifugal acceleration &#x3c9;<sup>2</sup><sub>0</sub>r<sub>0 </sub>of the tyre (where &#x3c9;<sub>0 </sub>is the angular velocity of the tyre). Therefore, besides being advantageous in terms of saving calibration time and cost, also this normalization scheme allows making the normalized acceleration value &#xe3;<sub>r</sub>(&#x3b8;) almost independent of the angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>0 </sub>of the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0138">This is extremely advantageous as it allows making also parameters p<sub>i </sub>of the fitting function f(&#x3b8;|p<sub>1 </sub>. . . p<sub>n</sub>) used in the fitting procedure and the (normalized) curves used in the similarity procedure independent of the angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>0 </sub>of the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0139">In a preferred embodiment, the normalization procedure (e.g. according to one of the two schemes I and II mentioned above) may also be performed using variable &#x3b8; normalized relative to a reference value &#x3b8;<sub>0</sub>, that is with a variable {tilde over (&#x3b8;)}=&#x3b8;/&#x3b8;<sub>0</sub>. For example, &#x3b8;<sub>0 </sub>may be set equal to &#x3b8;<sub>IN1 </sub>or &#x3b8;<sub>OUT1</sub>. The Applicant has, in fact, observed that the extension of region R<sub>in </sub>(and thus also the absolute value of &#x3b8;<sub>IN1</sub>, &#x3b8;<sub>OUT1</sub>) increases as the vertical load on the tyre increases and the inflation pressure of the tyre decreases. This type of normalization therefore has the advantage of making the normalized acceleration value &#xe3;<sub>r</sub>(&#x3b8;/&#x3b8;<sub>0</sub>) in a first approximation independent of the vertical load and approximately also of the inflation pressure of the tyre. This is extremely advantageous as it allows making also parameters p<sub>i </sub>of the fitting function f(&#x3b8;/&#x3b8;<sub>0</sub>|p<sub>1 </sub>. . . p<sub>n</sub>) used in the fitting procedure and the (normalized) curves used in the similarity procedure in a first approximation independent of the vertical load and approximately also of the inflation pressure of the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0140">In view of the above, in a practical embodiment of the invention, the voltage signal provided in output from accelerometer <b>1</b> mounted on the inner liner <b>1</b> of tyre <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may be converted in the monitoring device <b>28</b> in digital format and the digital data may be sent to an external processing unit comprised in the receiver on board of the vehicle, through the radio-frequency transmitter of the monitoring device <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0141">For example, revolution after revolution, such processing unit shall be adapted to process data representative of the acceleration radial component measured by accelerometer <b>1</b> at discrete values of angles &#x3b8;i, for &#x2212;180&#xb0;&#x2266;&#x3b8;i&#x2266;180&#xb0; (or for a lower angular portion, for example between &#x2212;120&#xb0; and 120&#xb0;).

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0147">It is noted that if no normalization procedure is carried out (which requires processing of the data representative of regions R<sub>in </sub>and R<sub>out</sub>), the analysis may be restricted to only data representative of the considered transition region. This may, for example, be advantageous because it allows using accelerometers with a limited output dynamic and/or reducing the data flow transmitted by the monitoring device <b>28</b> to the external processing unit, and thus the power consumption of the monitoring device <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0148">It is further noted that the processing unit located outside the tyre allows limiting overall dimensions, weight, complexity, power consumption and cost of the monitoring device <b>28</b> positioned directly on the tyre. As described above, however, the invention also comprises the case of processing unit positioned (at least partially) within the monitoring device <b>28</b> mounted on the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0149">The invention, enabling to make a potential friction real time estimate of a tyre-rolling surface system, may be important for enabling the development of systems for the active control of a vehicle dynamics or for driver assistance systems (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS). Examples of such applications are: Antilock Braking System&#x2014;Braking distance improvement on slippery road; Electronic Stability Program&#x2014;stability performance improvement while turning on critical manoeuvres; systems for controlling the speed and the distance from the preceding vehicle relative to the potential friction, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0150">As already mentioned above, the method and the system according to the invention are advantageously capable of estimating the potential friction in free rolling conditions. The method and the system according to the invention in any case also operate in different conditions, as in normal driving conditions wherein the rolling of the tyre under the vehicle may be subject to slowing down, acceleration and/or bends.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0151">In order to evaluate the performance of the invention, the Applicant has carried out experimental tests wherein potential friction values were estimated according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0152">In particular, the Applicant has used the normalization scheme II described above and the following fitting function in order to approximate the normalized data:

</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0153">The fitting procedure was applied in a transition region at the exit from the footprint with &#x3b8;<sub>OUT2</sub>=0 and &#x3b8;<sub>OUT1</sub>={&#xe3;<sub>r</sub><sup>fit</sup>(&#x3b8;<sub>OUT1</sub>)}=0.5.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0154">Once identified (by implementing a least squares algorithm) values of p<sub>1 </sub>and p<sub>2 </sub>that allowed to best approximate the data representative of such a transition region of the acceleration radial component measured in real time by the accelerometer, the Applicant has found that the potential friction could be obtained from parameter p<sub>2 </sub>using a simple linear function of the type:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3bc;<sub>p</sub><i>=f</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>p</i><sub>2</sub><i>|c</i><sub>1</sub><i>,c</i><sub>2</sub>)=<i>c</i><sub>1</sub><i>+c</i><sub>2</sub><i>p</i><sub>2 </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where coefficients c<sub>1 </sub>and c<sub>2 </sub>were selected to best reproduce known reference values. Considering that increasing values of parameter p<sub>2 </sub>correspond to decreasing values of the potential friction &#x3bc;<sub>p</sub>, coefficient c<sub>2 </sub>has a negative value.
</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the values of potential friction &#x3bc;<sub>P </sub>obtained with a tyre, or more specifically a PIRELLI P6 CINTURATO&#x2122; 205/55 R16 tyre, mounted on the front right wheel of a FIAT STILO&#x2122; automobile travelling in a straight line at a speed of 60 km/h in conditions of free rollowing, on different rolling surfaces (diamonds in the case of wet granite, triangles in the case of dry granite, circles in the case of wet asphalt round and squares in the case of dry asphalt). In particular, each point represented in the figure represents a potential friction value estimated by averaging the data obtained over four revolutions of the tyre.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0156">The solid line and dotted lines at the data obtained for each type of rolling surface respectively represent the mean value and the standard deviation of reference potential friction values. Such reference values were obtained by means of repeated braking tests with a dynamometric trailer (with measurement of the longitudinal force and of the vertical load) and measurement of the reference potential friction as the maximum of the ratio between longitudinal force and vertical load, as defined.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0157">As may be noted, the potential friction values estimated according to the method of the invention well approximate the reference values.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0158">As regards the few points outside the reference lines, they may be due to the fact that the estimated values according to the invention are punctual values obtained in different points of the rolling surface, while the reference ones are average values assumed as valid for the entire rolling surface. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the points shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> outside the reference lines correspond to portions of the rolling surface wherein the real and actual potential friction differs from the average one, thereby matching that estimated according to the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0144" num="0161">In particular, each point represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> represents a potential friction value estimated by averaging the data obtained over four revolutions of the tyre.</p>
