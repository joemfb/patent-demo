<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0031">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a target <b>1</b> for playing cards with projectiles like a dart or an arrow. The target <b>1</b> is disk-shaped as is usual for a target for such projectiles. According to an embodiment, the target is a modified dart board or a specially-made board having the same size and materials as a regular dart board. In a right lower circle there is shown a side view of the target <b>1</b>. At left side is an operating face <b>3</b> for receiving the projectiles. The operating face <b>3</b> is made of a material like sisal fibers and adapted for receiving the projectiles. A thickness <b>102</b> of the target <b>1</b> is such that the target <b>1</b> is rigid enough so that the projectile enters the operating face <b>3</b> sufficiently to be held in place without passing through the target <b>1</b>. A height represents the diameter <b>104</b> of the target <b>1</b>. Optionally, a target can have two operating faces, a front one for playing a game and a back one for playing another game.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0032">Two sets of 52 cards each are printed on the operating face <b>3</b> of the target <b>1</b>. Each set comprises cards Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King in each of the four suits (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs). Card images <b>106</b> are contiguously packed on the operating face <b>3</b> forming a pack, not numbered. When a projectile reaches the target <b>1</b> in the pack, the projectile reaches inevitably at least one card image <b>106</b>. Each card image <b>106</b> has the same dimensions as the others. Optionally, card image dimensions and placement vary depending on the value given to each associated card. The number of card images <b>106</b> is chosen in order to fill most of the area of the operating face <b>3</b> and to do that each card image <b>106</b> has a size which offers to a player a likelihood of not reaching a chosen card image <b>106</b> with a projectile.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0033">This target <b>1</b> allows playing of Poker, Black-Jack or other card games according to new rules. These new rules can be based on regular rules except that instead of drawing a card at random from a set, the player throws a projectile toward the operating face and gets, virtually, the card in which the projectile is driven.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0034">In a left lower circle there is shown a portion of a grid <b>2</b>. The grid <b>2</b> surrounds each card image <b>106</b> so that when a projectile reach a border area between two card images <b>106</b> or between the pack and a rest <b>108</b> of the target <b>1</b>, the projectile is clearly deflected toward only one card image <b>106</b> or outside the pack. The grid <b>2</b> is made of a triangular shaped wire.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0035">Although not shown the Figures are meant to include other types of given playing cards such as, but not limited to, tarot playing cards or other types of games such as dominoes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown an operating face <b>110</b> of a disk-shaped target <b>4</b> according to another embodiment. A realistic billiard table is printed on the operating face <b>110</b> comprising rails <b>112</b>, cushions <b>114</b>, pockets <b>116</b> and balls <b>118</b> on the bed <b>120</b>. In a left lower circle <b>122</b> there is shown a wire circle <b>124</b> with spikes <b>126</b>. The spikes <b>126</b> are to be driven in the operating face <b>110</b>. The wire circle <b>124</b> is to delimit the balls <b>118</b> and to clearly deflect a projectile inside the ball <b>118</b> or outside the ball <b>118</b>.
