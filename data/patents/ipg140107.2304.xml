<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a multiple vacuum evaporation coating device and a method for controlling the same, and more particularly to, a device and a method having a cooling device blocking the spread of heat while being able to control the rotation angle of the evaporation devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display device has an indium tin oxide (ITO) anode, a metal cathode and an organic thin film multi-layer between the anode and the cathode. The organic thin film multi-layer can also have an ETL (Electron Transport Layer), an HTL (Hole Transport Layer) and an EML (Emitting Layer). The organic thin film multi-layer can also have an EIL (Electron Injecting Layer), an HIL (Hole Injecting Layer) or an HBL (Hole Blocking Layer) additionally inserted for the improvement of features of elements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A typical OLED vacuum evaporation coating device used for forming organic thin film multi-layers generally performs the processes as follows. The first process is an ITO thin film evaporation coating process by vacuum evaporating several ITO thin film patterns on the surface of the glass substrate by sputtering. Then, as the prior process of ITO thin film, it is discharged so that the hole from ITO used for the positive pole can easily move to the emitting layer, and the surface is oxidized by using ultraviolet rays or a plasma. After that, in the organic thin film evaporation coating process, for example, by using the vacuum evaporation coating method in a high-degree vacuum state, the organic films are formed on the surface of the glass substrate. The structure of the vacuum chamber where these thin films are coated includes an evaporation source of materials, a sensor controlling the thickness of the film, a device aligning a glass substrate to the metal shadow masks, and a power source for evaporating materials. After the evaporation coating of these organic thin films is complete, the evaporation coating of metal electrodes, the evaporation coating of protective films, and the pack process are performed in order.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this process, the evaporation coating device used in evaporation coating thin films is formed so that by heating organic and inorganic material, the material can be coated on a board installed inside the vacuum chamber. Various kinds of evaporation coating devices have been developed. The multiple vacuum evaporation coating device is used so that several evaporation sources can be rotated, and when the evaporation source is positioned at a location for heating, the melting pot is heated by a heating device. In this arrangement, the evaporation source is formed so that the melting pot having the evaporation materials can be heated by the heating device. The location for heating the melting pot includes a main heating position for evaporation coating and the preliminary heating position for heating the melting pot before being moved to the main heating position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One drawback with this multiple evaporation coating device arrangement is that heat radiated from the melting pot was often transferred to the nearby melting pots, causing evaporation coating materials in the nearby the melting pots to discharge. Further, because the position of the main heating and the position of the preliminary heating were located far from each other, efficiency of preliminary heating was low. What is therefore needed is a multiple evaporation coating device that overcomes both these problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved multiple evaporation coating device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a multiple evaporation coating device where heat generated in one of the devices does not warm up the other devices.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The evaporation sources <b>110</b> are arranged so that they can rotate 360&#xb0; and so each evaporation source <b>110</b> forms the same angle with each other. In the rotating part <b>120</b> are several bearings <b>122</b> used for rotation, and a vacuum sealing should be present to prevent damage to the vacuum state of the rotating part <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An evaporation coating blocking plate <b>132</b> is installed on the upper part of the fixed housing <b>130</b> so that evaporation coating materials discharged from non main heating evaporation sources <b>110</b> can be blocked. The evaporation coating blocking plate <b>132</b> forms an opening having a certain angle so that only the one evaporation source currently being subject to the main heating can discharge material into the vacuum chamber <b>10</b>. The evaporation coating blocking plate is fixed at the fixed housing <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged sectional view illustrating one of the evaporation sources <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an evaporation source <b>110</b> includes a melting pot <b>111</b>, a heating device <b>112</b> located at the outer side of the melting pot <b>111</b> for heating the melting pot <b>111</b>, a power terminal <b>113</b> for connecting the heating device <b>112</b> to the power source part <b>140</b>, a case <b>114</b> where the power terminal <b>113</b> is installed, and a cooling device preventing heat generated by the melting pot <b>111</b> and the heating device <b>112</b> from being transferred to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The cooling device includes a reflector <b>150</b> covering the heating device <b>112</b> in order to block the heat from the heating device <b>112</b> and the melting pot <b>111</b> from escaping. The cooling device also includes a closed space <b>160</b> having an inflow and an outflow for the cooling water <b>162</b>, the closed space <b>160</b> and the cooling water <b>162</b> being within case <b>114</b> between inner wall <b>114</b><i>a </i>and outer wall <b>114</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The reflector <b>150</b> is preferably made up of several units, including first reflector <b>150</b><i>a </i>that reflects the high-temperature heat emanating from the heating device <b>112</b> and from the melting pot <b>111</b>. First reflector <b>150</b><i>a </i>is located near the heating device <b>112</b>. Reflector <b>150</b> also includes second reflector <b>150</b> that also reflects high-temperature heat that transmits through the first reflector <b>150</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first and second reflectors <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>are preferably formed to having some space between each other. Further, the first and second reflectors <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>are preferably located in a space between the heating device <b>112</b> and the inner wall <b>114</b><i>a </i>of case <b>114</b>. Reflector <b>150</b> serves to prevent the unwanted transfer of heat to an outside of the evaporation source.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Closed space <b>160</b> is preferably sealed by installing blocking materials <b>114</b><i>c </i>on the upper and the lower parts of the inner wall <b>114</b><i>a </i>and the outer wall <b>114</b><i>b</i>. Blocking materials <b>114</b><i>c </i>can be sealed to the inner wall <b>114</b><i>a </i>and the outer wall <b>114</b><i>b </i>of the case <b>114</b>. Case <b>114</b> has the dual wall structure, and within this dual structure is the closed space <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A supply pipe <b>164</b> and a discharge pipe <b>166</b> are installed at the lower part and the upper part respectively of the outer wall <b>114</b><i>b</i>. Supply pipe <b>164</b> and discharge pipe <b>166</b> are connected to the closed space <b>160</b> so that the cooling water <b>162</b> can be supplied to and removed from the closed space <b>160</b>. It is preferable that the supply pipe <b>164</b> is connected to the supply water tank (not shown) located outside, and a separate pump (not shown) is arranged for supplying the cooling water <b>162</b> to the closed space <b>160</b> via the supply pipe <b>164</b>.

Another pump (not shown) can be installed to remove cooling water <b>162</b> from closed space <b>160</b> to the tank via the discharge pipe <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A cooling cover <b>170</b> is also included to block heat escaping from the upper end of the evaporating source <b>110</b> at the opening between the upper side of the melting pot <b>111</b> and the inner wall <b>114</b><i>a</i>. The cooling cover <b>170</b> is preferably extended to the end part of the melting pot <b>111</b> and is supported by the upper blocking materials <b>114</b><i>c</i>. The cooling cover <b>170</b> can be made of the same material as the reflector <b>150</b>, or can be made of some other insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref> illustrate variations of the cooling device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a bulkhead <b>180</b> is arranged within closed space <b>160</b> so that the supply pipe <b>164</b> and the discharge pipe <b>166</b> can be further separated from each other. The supply pipe <b>164</b> and the discharge pipe <b>166</b> are preferably located on opposite sides of the bulkhead <b>180</b>. This structure allows water supplied by supply pipe <b>164</b> to become heated before being discharged from the closed space <b>160</b> by discharge pipe <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the supply pipe <b>164</b> and the discharge pipe <b>166</b> are located at opposite sides of case <b>114</b> diametrically opposite from each other. The purpose of this arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is to discharge the cooling water <b>162</b> via discharge pipe <b>166</b> only after the cooling water <b>162</b> has had a chance to sufficiently move throughout the closed space <b>160</b> after being supplied by the supply pipe <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the cooling device further includes one or more inductive pipes <b>190</b> arranged within the closed space <b>160</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is preferable that more than one inductive pipe <b>190</b> is used so that the range of the heat absorption can be reduced. Preferably, the inductive pipes <b>190</b> are arranged so that one end is located at an upper end of closed space <b>160</b> and is attached to a discharge pipe <b>166</b> while the other end of each inductive pipe <b>190</b> is located at a lower end of the closed space <b>160</b> and is attached to a supply pipe <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the control method of the vacuum evaporation coating device having multiple evaporation sources vis a vis the evaporation coating blocking plate <b>132</b> and the main and the preliminary heaters is illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is the plane figure of the evaporation coating device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is the plane figure illustrating the state in which the evaporation source of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> moved to the next process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the initial position and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the position of the evaporation sources after being rotated one position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, several evaporation sources <b>110</b> with cooling devices within are arranged so that they can rotate 360&#xb0; by rotating part <b>120</b>. The rotating part <b>120</b> is attached to the evaporation sources <b>110</b> and to the power source part <b>140</b> that provides rotating power to the rotating part <b>120</b>. A control part measures and controls the rotation angle of the rotating part <b>120</b> by the rotating power of the power source part <b>140</b>. The rotating part <b>120</b> is a device generally installed in the rotation-type evaporation coating device <b>100</b>, and the detailed explanations are omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An evaporation coating blocking plate <b>132</b> allows for the discharge of only the evaporation source <b>110</b><i>a </i>being heated by the main heating, and blocks the discharge of the other remaining evaporation coating sources <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c</i>, . . . ,. Thus it is only the evaporation coating materials of the evaporation source <b>110</b><i>a </i>heated by the main heating device <b>200</b> that is allowed to coat the board <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The location where the evaporation source <b>110</b><i>a </i>is heated by the first (main) heating device <b>200</b> and the location where the evaporation source <b>110</b><i>b </i>is heated by the second (preliminary) source <b>210</b> are set. The first and second heating devices <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> are arranged close each other as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first evaporation source <b>110</b><i>a </i>is heated by the first (main) heating device <b>200</b> to allow for evaporation coating. At a location near the evaporation source heated by the main heating <b>110</b><i>a </i>is the second evaporation source <b>110</b><i>b </i>that is heated by the second (preliminary) heating device <b>210</b>. In this way, one process completed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other words, the n<sup>th </sup>evaporation source <b>110</b><i>a </i>among several evaporation sources having cooling devices is heated by the first (main) heating device <b>200</b>, and the (n&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>evaporation source <b>110</b><i>b </i>waits for the main heating while being heated by the second (preliminary) heating device <b>210</b>. When the evaporation coating of n<sup>th </sup>evaporation source <b>110</b><i>a </i>heated by the main heating device <b>200</b> is completed, the (n&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>evaporation source <b>110</b><i>b </i>heated by the preliminary heating device <b>210</b> is moved to the main heating location so that it can be heated by the first (main) heating device <b>200</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As this occurs, the (n&#x2212;2)<sup>th </sup>evaporation source <b>110</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is moved to the location of the preliminary heating device <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the result of one incremental rotation of rotating part <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When one process of the evaporation source <b>110</b> is completed, if the rotation of the evaporation source <b>110</b> is expressed by Equation 1, the rotation angle &#x3b8; rotated by the rotating device for one process can be expressed as follows where s is the total number of evaporation sources, and 360&#xb0; is the angle when n<sup>th </sup>evaporation source is rotated one time:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b8;=360&#xb0;&#xd7;((<i>t&#x2212;</i>1)/<i>s</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;[Equation 1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, the equation 1 should satisfy 0&#x3c;(t&#x2212;1)/s&#x2266;1.0.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Where s, the total number of evaporation sources should satisfy s&#x2267;2.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">And t, a natural number should satisfy 1&#x3c;t&#x2266;s.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Likewise, the reason why the location of the main heating and the location of the preliminary heating should be close each other is because the high-temperature heat discharged from the evaporation sources <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>can be blocked and cooled off by installing a cooling device for each evaporation source <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According the present invention described above, because the high-temperature heat generated from the evaporation sources heated by the main and the preliminary heating is prevented from being transferred to nearby evaporation sources, the discharge of the evaporation coating materials by heating evaporation sources except at the evaporation source heated by the main heating is significantly reduced. Also, since the location of the main heating and the location of the preliminary heating are close to each other, there is an increase in the efficiency in the utilization of the preliminary heating device according to its original purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes might be made in this embodiment without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.</p>
