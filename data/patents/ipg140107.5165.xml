<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A brain imaging system can be operated to obtain brain image signals indicating activity at brain locations, and information can be extracted from the brain image signals. For example, for each of a set of living human brain regions that can have two or more possible activity features such as qualia features, feature values can be obtained indicating activity features of the region. The feature values can be more explicit than brain image data indicating activity at brain locations. A data structure can be produced that includes data indicating extracted information, such as qualia value data for a quale activity feature that can occur in a region. Such a data structure can be stored on a storage medium and used in diagnosis and/or treatment of detrimental conditions of consciousness.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the following detailed description, numeric values and ranges are provided for various aspects of the implementations described. These values and ranges are to be treated as examples only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Implementations described below involve signal processing and brain imaging. As used herein, the term &#x201c;signal&#x201d; includes any physical phenomenon that can carry information through space and/or time, whether the information is carried in analog, digital, or other form. The term &#x201c;electrical/magnetic signal&#x201d; is used herein to encompass all types of signals that can transfer, store, or otherwise carry information through electricity, magnetism, and or electromagnetism; electrical/magnetic signals thus include but are not limited to voltage- and current-based electrical signals, propagating electromagnetic signals including light in any range of photon energies, flux- or orientation-based magnetic signals, capacitively stored charge, magnetic domain orientations, optically readable and/or recordable features of storage media, states of an electronic bistable or multistable device such as a flip-flop, and signals of various others kinds in which information can be transferred and/or stored.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term &#x201c;brain image signals&#x201d; refers to signals that include information about a brain that can be mapped into an image. As described in Orrison, W. W., Jr., Lewine, J. D., Sanders, J. A., and Hartshorne, M. F., Functional Brain Imaging, St. Louis: Mosby, 1995, incorporated herein by reference, several techniques have been developed for obtaining electrical/magnetic brain image signals, including tomographic techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET); magnetic resonance techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); techniques based on electrical potential sensing such as electroencephalography (EEG); techniques based on sensing magnetic signals from a brain such as magnetoencephalography (MEG); and combinations of two or more such techniques, such as fMRI and MEG.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Implementations described below involve operations that extract information from brain image signals. As used herein, an operation &#x201c;extracts&#x201d; information from signals if it uses the signals to obtain other signals in which the information is more explicitly indicated. For example, raw, unprocessed analog brain image signals from one of the techniques described above can implicitly indicate differences between brain regions; the raw signals can be used to obtain position value data that indicate respective values for positions in the brain regions, and that therefore indicate differences between brain regions less implicitly, i.e. more explicitly, than the raw signals; the position value data can in turn be used to present a visual signal such as an image in which a human can more explicitly see differences between regions. Increasing explicitness can be shown by ease of human perception, but other indices of increasing explicitness include, for example, greater conciseness and a greater ratio of relevant to non-relevant information, such as signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Difficulties arise in extracting information from brain image signals. For example, brain imaging techniques like those described above can produce huge amounts of information about a brain, and the volume of data can make it difficult to extract desired information; techniques described by Friston, K. J., Ashburner, J. T., Kiebel, S. J., Nichols, T. E., and Penny, W. D., Eds., <i>Statistical Parametric Mapping&#x2014;The Analysis of Functional Brain Images</i>, London: Academic Press, 2007, for example, illustrate the exquisite mathematical complexity that can be achieved in this effort. Also, desired information may require higher levels of space and/or time resolution than are available with any one of the currently available brain imaging techniques. This may be especially true when the desired information is about brain operations relating to consciousness. Nevertheless, there is hope that information about such brain operations will help in diagnosing and treating various detrimental conditions of consciousness, as described in Dickerson, B. C., &#x201c;Advances in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Technology and Clinical Applications&#x201d;, <i>Neurotherapeutics</i>, Vol. 4, Issue 3, July 2007, pp. 360-370.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms &#x201c;circuitry&#x201d; and &#x201c;circuit&#x201d; are used herein to refer to structures in which one or more electronic components have sufficient electrical connections to operate together or in a related manner. In some instances, an item of circuitry can include more than one circuit. An item of circuitry that includes a &#x201c;processor&#x201d; may sometimes be analyzed into &#x201c;hardware&#x201d; and &#x201c;software&#x201d; components; in this context, &#x201c;software&#x201d; refers to stored or transmitted data that controls operation of the processor or that is accessed by the processor while operating, and &#x201c;hardware&#x201d; refers to components that store, transmit, and operate on the data. The distinction between &#x201c;software&#x201d; and &#x201c;hardware&#x201d; is not always clearcut, however, because some components share characteristics of both; also, a given software component can often be replaced by an equivalent hardware component without significantly changing operation of circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Some implementations described below involve a &#x201c;system&#x201d;, used herein to mean a combination of two or more parts or components, such as processors and other circuitry components, that can perform a function together. A system may be characterized by its function: for example, an &#x201c;imaging system&#x201d; is a system that performs imaging operations, such as on bodies or body parts; and so forth. For example, in implementations described below, imaging systems perform imaging of brains, typically based on &#x201c;activity&#x201d;, meaning a measurable feature that correlates with activity levels in brain locations, such as blood flow, oxygen concentration, metabolic rate, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The technique in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes an operation in box <b>10</b> that obtains brain image signals, as suggested by the schematic profile of brain <b>12</b>. In general, the operation in box <b>10</b> could be performed by any system or circuitry capable of obtaining brain image signals indicating activity within a brain.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An operation in box <b>14</b> uses brain image signals from the operation in box <b>10</b> to extract information from them about features of a brain's activity. The operation in box <b>14</b> can, for example, obtain values indicating information about activity features of a brain. As used herein, an &#x201c;activity feature&#x201d; is a feature about which information is present in activity levels of locations in a brain, and a value indicating information about an activity feature is referred to as a &#x201c;feature value&#x201d;; a feature value could, for example, be an identifier of an activity feature, a value indicating its presence or absence, a value indicating a measure of the feature such as its intensity, a value indicating a relationship of a feature to one or more other features, and so forth. Because of the rapid advance of brain imaging technology, it is not possible to provide a complete, up-to-date list of activity features&#x2014;discoveries of new activity features are being published with increasing frequency in recent years. A few examples include understanding sarcasm, emotions such as feelings of disgust and delight, the smell of chocolate, musical hallucinations, and religious feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Some implementations described below are based on the premise that a &#x201c;quale&#x201d; can correspond to an activity feature, where the term &#x201c;quale&#x201d; refers to the way it feels to have a particular simple experience, such as feeling a pain, seeing a color, smelling an odor, and so forth. In some contexts, the term &#x201c;qualia&#x201d;, the plural of &#x201c;quale&#x201d;, is used herein to refer collectively to the singular and to the plural, such as in the expression &#x201c;one or more qualia&#x201d;. An activity feature that corresponds to a quale is referred to herein as a &#x201c;qualia activity feature&#x201d;; accordingly, a &#x201c;qualia value&#x201d; is a feature value that indicates information about one or more qualia activity features. Also, the brain of a living organism is referred to herein as a &#x201c;living brain&#x201d; and, if the organism is experiencing qualia, as a &#x201c;conscious brain&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An operation in box <b>16</b> provides one or more feature values from the operation in box <b>14</b>. Such an operation can be performed, for example, to make feature values available for use by a human, for performance of data processing operations that require the feature values, or, conceivably, as input data for other applications such as in process or machine control.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Boxes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrate graphically an example of a technique that the operation in box <b>14</b> can perform to extract information. In addition to being &#x201c;activity-based&#x201d; in the sense that it depends on brain image signals that indicate activity levels, the technique in boxes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> is &#x201c;region-based&#x201d; in the sense that it depends on finding one or more regions that satisfy a suitable criterion. An &#x201c;active region criterion&#x201d;, for example, is a criterion that can be used to find an active region of a brain, and some examples of active region criteria are described below in relation to implementations. Once an active region is found, it may be possible to extract information about active features within it.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">More specifically, the operation in box <b>20</b> finds a set of regions of brain <b>12</b>, each of which satisfies an active region criterion or other suitable criterion for region-based information extraction. Two regions in the set are illustratively labeled &#x201c;A&#x201d; and &#x201c;B&#x201d;, and their shapes and sizes are suggested by isoactive contours, i.e. lines of equal activity level at a certain resolution, with line <b>30</b> being the innermost isoactive contour of region A and line <b>32</b> being the innermost isoactive contour of region B. Within each region, the innermost isoactive contour indicates the highest activity level, and the number of isoactive lines that must be crossed between each of lines <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> and the lowest level between regions A and B provides a rough measure of how the highest activity levels in the two regions are related&#x2014;in the illustrated example, three lines separate line <b>30</b> from the lowest level while only two lines separate line <b>32</b> from the lowest level; therefore, the highest activity level in region A is greater than that in region B.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The operation in box <b>22</b> extracts information from a portion of the brain image signals that includes information about one of the regions found in box <b>20</b>, illustratively region A. A few possible examples of activity features are shown graphically, including locations <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> at which maxima of activity occur and area <b>44</b> in which activity contrast is high. As suggested below, mathematical models can be used to extract information about these and other types of activity features that occur in active regions. As suggested by locations <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> and area <b>44</b>, some techniques can extract information about highly localized activity features, while other techniques can extract information about less localized activity features. Although the illustrated technique relates to activity features that are sufficiently localized to be found within an active region, other techniques might be developed to extract information about activity features that involve more than one active region.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The operation in box <b>24</b> uses information extracted in box <b>22</b> to obtain a set of N feature values, where N is greater than zero for the illustrated example of region A. This operation can include not only obtaining values but also associating the values with activity feature identifiers. For qualia activity features, for example, a name, number, or other alphanumeric identifier of a quale could be associated with a feature value with information about the quale's corresponding qualia activity feature.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The operations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> could be implemented in numerous ways: For example, they could be implemented with parallel operations, with serial operations, or with any suitable combination of parallel and serial operations. Similarly, the operations could be implemented with analog signal processing, digital signal processing, or any suitable combination of analog and digital techniques. They could be implemented in a wide variety of signal processing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart illustrating general operations that could be performed in a data processing implementation of operations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term &#x201c;data&#x201d; is used herein to refer to signals in digital form, such as binary data. The term &#x201c;data structure&#x201d; refers to a combination of items of data that are ordered, linked, associated such as in a table, or otherwise related such that some items in the combination can be accessed based on other items; although exemplary data structures are described below as stored in memory, a data structure can take other forms, such as during transmission through a data communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The operation in box <b>60</b> begins by obtaining brain image data, an implementation of the operation in box <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The operation in box <b>60</b> can include known techniques for converting analog brain image signals into digital form in a suitable format for digital data processing. It is foreseeable, however, that additional types of brain image signals will be developed and that further techniques for converting analog brain image signals to digital form will also be developed, all within the scope of the operation in box <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The operation in box <b>62</b> begins an iterative loop that performs information extraction, implementing the operation in box <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Unless a test in box <b>62</b> determines that information extraction is complete, another iteration is performed. The test could, for example, determine that sufficient information has been obtained or that a resolution limit has been reached so that further useful information cannot be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each iteration of the loop extracts information, in box <b>64</b>. As shown, one example of information extraction is to obtain one or more feature values for activity features in an active brain region, such as by implementing operations in boxes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each iteration can branch based on whether such features values have been obtained, as indicated in box <b>70</b>. If so, the operation in box <b>72</b> can include data indicating feature values obtained in box <b>64</b> in a data structure that also includes data indicating previously obtained feature values. Other suitable operations (not shown) could be performed for other information extraction results, before returning to box <b>62</b> to begin the next iteration.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Finally, when information extraction is complete, the operation in box <b>74</b> can provide the data structure that includes feature values, implementing the operation in box <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The data structure could, for example, be provided for human use, such as through a printed version or an interactive user interface allowing a user to see representations of feature values or in any other way a user can understand. Also, the data structure could be provided through any appropriate communication link to another system for use in further data processing operations or it could be provided by providing a link or other handle to the data structure to another process on a system that can access the data structure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The general data processing operations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> could be implemented in many ways on a variety of data processing systems. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates general features of an implementation with a single central processing unit CPU connected to other components through a bus, but features as described herein could be implemented in many other architectures.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">System <b>100</b> includes CPU <b>102</b>, connected to other components through bus <b>104</b>. Any suitable CPU and bus architecture could be used to implement system <b>100</b>. In the illustrated example, bus <b>104</b> also connects to memory <b>110</b> as well as several input/output (I/O) devices. The I/O devices include user interface devices such as display <b>112</b> and user input device <b>114</b>, which could, for example, include a keyboard and a mouse. Bus <b>104</b> could also connect to various other I/O devices, with imager I/O <b>120</b> and network I/O <b>122</b> being illustratively shown. Imager I/O <b>120</b> provides a suitable interface for exchange of signals with imaging system <b>124</b>, which could perform any suitable combination of imaging techniques, e.g. PET, fMRI, EEG, MEG, and so forth. System <b>100</b> could include several imager I/O devices for exchange of signals with respective imaging systems.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Memory <b>110</b> could be implemented with any suitable combination of memory devices, including drives for storage and retrieval of information from storage media, such as magnetic or optical media. CPU <b>102</b> or another processor could perform memory management using any suitable technique. For example, in an implementation for medical purposes, such as for diagnosis or treatment of detrimental conditions of consciousness, a CD-ROM or other optical storage medium with a suitable format could store information about a given patient in a portable form that could be removed from system <b>100</b> and used in another system.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Memory <b>110</b> illustratively includes program memory <b>130</b> and data memory <b>132</b>, implemented in any suitable way. In addition to various other software, program memory <b>130</b> illustratively includes main routine <b>140</b>, extraction routine <b>142</b>, and data structure routine <b>144</b> and data memory <b>132</b> illustratively includes brain image data <b>146</b> and data structure <b>148</b>. Main routine <b>140</b> could, for example, implement the overall technique of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, calling extraction routine <b>142</b> to perform the operation in box <b>64</b> and calling data structure routine <b>144</b> to perform data structure update in box <b>72</b> and to provide data structure <b>148</b> in box <b>74</b>. The division of operations into routines and items of data is somewhat arbitrary, however, and various additional routines and subroutines could be implemented, some of which are suggested in relation to exemplary implementations described below. Also, various additional items of data could be implemented, some of which are suggested in relation to exemplary implementations described below. Further, some software components could alternatively be implemented as hardware components or with a combination of software and hardware, and some hardware components could similarly be implemented in software.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates one of many ways that main routine <b>140</b> could be implemented, illustratively to obtain a data structure indicating qualia values. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, main routine <b>140</b> continues to extract qualia information until either sufficient information has been obtained or a resolution limit is reached, which is one way to implement box <b>62</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The operation in box <b>160</b> begins by obtaining initial parameters for brain imaging. Initial parameters could be retrieved from data memory <b>132</b>, could be interactively obtained through user input device <b>114</b>, or could be received through network I/O <b>122</b>, for example. Like other parameters described below, CPU <b>102</b> can use the initial parameters to provide signals to imaging system <b>124</b> through imager I/O <b>120</b> to obtain a desired type of brain image data. Imaging system <b>124</b> may have its own operator interface, and an alternative approach would be for an operator of imaging system <b>124</b> to provide initial parameters and take other steps needed for system <b>124</b> to obtain a desired type of brain image data which it would then provide to system <b>100</b> through imager I/O <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As a result of operation of system <b>124</b> in accordance with parameters from box <b>160</b> or elsewhere as described below, the operation in box <b>162</b> receives brain image data from system <b>124</b>. The operation in box <b>162</b> can also include storing brain image data <b>146</b> in data memory <b>132</b>, which is useful in the usual case in which brain image data cannot be adequately processed in real time. The operation in box <b>164</b> can then perform an initial evaluation of brain image data received in box <b>162</b> to determine whether it provides information with sufficient resolution for information extraction, which could require some minimum space and/or time resolution. The operation in box <b>164</b> could also be implemented to detect malfunctions or other problems with operation of system <b>124</b> that result in inadequate resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If resolution is not adequate, the operation in box <b>166</b> determines whether better resolution is possible, such as by operating system <b>124</b> (or another imaging system, not shown) with different parameters or by again operating system <b>124</b> with the same parameters but without malfunction or other problems that occurred. If so, the operation in box <b>168</b> obtains parameters for higher resolution brain imaging, and brain image data is again received in box <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When brain image data <b>146</b> has adequate resolution, the operation in box <b>170</b> can use brain image data <b>146</b> to identify active brain regions, and the operation in box <b>172</b> can then extract qualia information for the active brain regions identified in box <b>170</b>. The qualia information can include qualia values, and the operation in box <b>174</b> can combine the qualia values with a data structure that includes previously obtained qualia values. Although shown as a sequence of separate boxes, the operations in boxes <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>, and <b>174</b> can be implemented in numerous ways, in some of which they do not occur entirely in sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The operation in box <b>176</b> determines whether sufficient information has been obtained. For example, if the information will be used in diagnosis or treatment of a detrimental condition of consciousness, the operation in box <b>176</b> could include an interactive test allowing a doctor or other user to determine and indicate whether the information is sufficient. It may also be possible to implement an automated sufficiency criterion, allowing an automatic determination whether the information is sufficient. If not, the operation in box <b>180</b> determines whether it is possible to obtain more information by further brain imaging; this operation could also be performed interactively or automatically. If more information is possible, the operation in box <b>182</b> obtains parameters for further brain imaging to obtain more information, in a manner similar to box <b>168</b>, as described above, and brain image data is again received in box <b>162</b>. It would be possible for the further brain imaging to be performed with a different modality that provides additional information, such as because it has different resolution characteristics. In a coarse/fine approach, one modality, e.g. fMRI, could be used initially to identify active brain regions in box <b>170</b>, then another, e.g. MEG, could be used to extract qualia information in box <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When sufficient information has been obtained, or if better resolution and more information are both impossible, the operation in box <b>184</b> provides the data structure indicating qualia values and/or provides status information. Status information could, for example, include one or more error messages or other explanation of results. As suggested by the dashed lines to box <b>190</b>, another optional step before providing the data structure is to further combine qualia values in the data structure. This could be desirable where the operation in box <b>174</b> leads to a suboptimal data structure that can be improved by the operation in box <b>184</b>, such as to make it more compact. It would even be possible for box <b>174</b> to simply concatenate qualia values somehow, and for the operation in box <b>190</b> to then make the data structure optimal in other ways, such as to permit rapid access to a desired qualia value.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> illustrate in greater detail features of an exemplary implementation that could be used for boxes <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>, and <b>174</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an overall flow chart, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> features of a data structure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> a detailed flow chart.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the operation in box <b>220</b> begins an outer, part-level iterative loop after the operation in box <b>164</b> determines that resolution of brain image data <b>146</b> is adequate. Each outer iteration uses a portion of brain image data <b>146</b> with information about a respective brain part, e.g. in a human brain, a hemisphere or other part of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus or other part of the limbic system, the cerebellum, etc. The outer iterative loop identifies active regions of the next brain part, in box <b>222</b>, and then the operation in box <b>224</b> begins an inner, region-level iterative loop, each iteration of which uses a portion of brain image data <b>146</b> with information about a respective one of the active regions from box <b>222</b>. The operation in box <b>222</b> could be implemented by comparing activity levels at positions or groups of positions in the brain part with an appropriate threshold activity level. Different thresholds could be appropriate for different parts or even for different positions within a part or to differently sized groups of positions. Rather than thresholds, contrasts could be used; for example, an active region criterion could require that the region have at least a certain contrast in relation to neighboring activity level minima on all sides or on a certain number of sides. Because parts of the brain generally have complex shapes, a brain part's activity pattern could also, for example, be projected onto a suitable surface such as a plane before applying an active region criterion such as a threshold-based or contrast-based criterion. Various other active region criteria could be developed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each inner iteration branches based on whether the next active region is a qualia map. The term &#x201c;map&#x201d; is used herein to refer broadly to a brain part that can respond to neural inputs with one of two or more activity level patterns. Some relatively complex maps are described in Blakeslee, S. and Blakeslee, M., <i>The Body has a Mind of Its Own&#x2014;How Body Maps in Your Brain Help You Do </i>(<i>Almost</i>) <i>Everything Better</i>, New York: Random House, 2007, but the term &#x201c;map&#x201d; is used herein to include, in addition to complex maps, even very simple maps that have only two activity level patterns, analogous to ON and OFF. A &#x201c;qualia map&#x201d;, then, is a map that has at least one activity level pattern that corresponds to a quale. In the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the determination whether a region is a qualia map can be based on previously confirmed qualia map regions or, as appropriate, can be interactively or automatically determined in another appropriate way, such as through input from a human expert.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If the region is not a qualia map, the operation in box <b>232</b> can handle it in a way appropriate for non-qualia regions. Information about non-qualia regions can be useful for many different purposes, and could also be included in a data structure that indicates qualia values.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If the region is a qualia map, the operation in box <b>234</b> can extract qualia information for the region from the relevant portion of brain image data <b>146</b>. The extracted qualia information can include, for example, qualia values for one or more qualia that correspond to activity level patterns of the region. Up to this point, the operations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be seen to be an implementation of extraction routine <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and the operation in box <b>234</b> completes extraction operations for a given region.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">After qualia values are obtained in box <b>234</b>, the operation in box <b>236</b> can include the qualia values in the data structure with previously obtained values. If a set of one or more qualia values corresponds to a quale that has already been defined in the data structure, the operation in box <b>236</b> can link the qualia values to that quale; otherwise, an additional quale or additional qualia can be defined in the data structure, and qualia values can be linked to the additional quale/qualia. The operation in box <b>236</b> can thus include qualia values from box <b>234</b> in the data structure, and can therefore be seen as an implementation of data structure routine <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Inner iterations are performed until the operation in box <b>224</b> determines that all active regions of the current brain part have been handled. Similarly, outer iterations are performed until the operation in box <b>220</b> determines that all brain parts have been handled. If so, the operation in box <b>220</b> branches to box <b>176</b>, to test whether sufficient information has been obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows data structure <b>260</b>, which includes a part illustrated as a node-link structure and a part illustrated as table <b>262</b>. Table <b>262</b> illustratively holds items that are pairs, with each pair including a quale identifier and a descriptor of the corresponding quale. In order to add a new quale, an item for the quale can be added to table <b>262</b>, including a quale ID and a descriptor. In the illustrated example, quale IDs 0, q1, and q2 have been assigned respectively to color x, smell y, and sound z.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The node link structure has four levels, with root <b>270</b> being the only node at the root level, and linked to M nodes at the brain part level, including nodes <b>272</b>, <b>274</b>, <b>276</b>, and <b>278</b>. Node <b>274</b> illustratively represents the hippocampus, while node <b>276</b> illustratively represents the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Each node at the brain part level can be linked to one or more nodes at the region level, with node <b>276</b> for the cortex illustratively linked to N region nodes, including nodes <b>280</b>, <b>282</b>, <b>284</b>, and <b>286</b>. Nodes <b>282</b> and <b>284</b> are illustratively qualia map regions, labeled qualia map n1 and qualia map n2.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Nodes at the region level that represent qualia map regions can in turn be linked to one or more nodes at the qualia combination level. Node <b>282</b> for qualia map n1 is illustratively linked to P qualia combination nodes, including nodes <b>290</b>, <b>292</b>, and <b>294</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Nodes at the qualia combination level can be linked to items in table <b>262</b> for quale that are included in the corresponding qualia combination. Node <b>292</b> for qualia combination p is linked to the items with quale IDs 0, q1, and q2 as described above, and therefore corresponds to a qualia combination that includes color x, smell y, and sound z. Note that more than one qualia combination can link to a given item in table <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As can be seen, the basic framework of data structure <b>260</b> might be the same for many conscious brains, with specific details being different and with the particular regions that are active qualia map regions and with their specific qualia combinations both changing over time. Therefore, data structure <b>260</b> may be implemented as a partially completed data structure, with operations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> filling in additional parts.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Data structure <b>260</b> could be implemented in a wide variety of ways. For example, each node could be encoded as an item of data including information about the brain part or qualia combination it represents, while links between nodes could be pointers to nodes. Table <b>262</b> could be implemented as a sequence of descriptors, with each descriptor's position in the sequence corresponding to its quale ID. Many other ways of implementing such a data structure are available.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows in greater detail one way in which boxes <b>234</b> and <b>236</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> could be implemented for data structure <b>260</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As indicated below, the technique of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can extract information about qualia based on a mathematical model of consciousness.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown, the operation in box <b>320</b> can follow a determination in box <b>230</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that an active region of a brain part is a qualia map. The operation in box <b>320</b> uses the qualia map region's portion of brain image data <b>146</b> to obtain qualia values. Although this operation could be implemented in many ways, a mathematical model of consciousness may provide a useful starting point.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">One type of model, referred to herein as &#x201c;neural clique models&#x201d;, relates to Tsien, J. Z., &#x201c;The Memory Code&#x201d;, <i>Scientific American</i>, July 2007, pp. 52-59, which describes how small groups of neurons in the hippocampus perform as a unit. An exemplary equation for a neural clique model of consciousness can be expressed as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Quale <i>M</i>(<i>T</i>)=(ON iff Activity(Neural Clique <i>M,T</i>)&#x3e;Threshold <i>M</i>;else OFF)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
In words, this means that the respective Quale M for Neural Clique M will be ON (i.e. consciously experienced) at time T if and only if an Activity level of Neural Clique M at time T is greater than the value of its respective Threshold M; when the Activity level does not exceed the value of Threshold M, Quale M will be OFF. An operation in box <b>320</b> could apply this equation by applying suitable thresholds to activity levels at brain positions that are within a qualia map region and whose activity levels correspond with qualia. The combination of resulting values, such as a vector or other data item, is an example of a qualia value that could be included in a data structure as described herein.
</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Another type of model, referred to herein as &#x201c;conscious cavity models&#x201d;, was proposed by Beran, J. T., &#x201c;Disambiguation in Conscious Cavities&#x201d;, <i>Quantum Mind </i>2007 <i>Conference Abstracts</i>, Salzburg, Austria, July 2007, p. 30. A conscious cavity can be thought of as a neural structure that can produce any of a set of conscious experiences. Structures that might operate as conscious cavities could occur, for example, in the cerebral cortex and in the limbic system in brains of humans and in similar brains. The following inner product equation has been proposed for conscious cavity models:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3c;Qualia <i>N</i>(<i>T</i>)|Neural Input(Cavity,<i>T</i>)&#x3e;=Activity(Cavity,<i>T</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
In words, this means that a projection of a Cavity's Neural Input vector onto Qualia N (a vector for one of the conscious experiences the Cavity can produce) at time T is equal to an Activity value of the Cavity at time T, where the Activity value is, e.g., a real or complex scalar. For a purely probabilistic case, for example, the probability of Qualia N in response to a given Neural Input to the Cavity could be equal to a suitably normalized (between zero and one) Activity value for the Cavity, which could be expressed as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Pr</i>(Qualia <i>N</i>(<i>T</i>)|Neural Input(Cavity,<i>T</i>))=Activity(Cavity,<i>T</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
As can be seen, this equation yields the same result as the above neural clique equation if Activity has a transition at Threshold between two of Cavity's possible qualia, one with Quale M ON (i.e. Probability=1) and the other with Quale M OFF, (i.e. Probability=0).
</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The conscious cavity inner product equation is therefore consistent with thresholding, but also is consistent with other ways of obtaining qualia values, such as by taking multiple activity level measurements to obtain probabilities or by analyzing time varying activity levels that can be analyzed into frequency spectra, and so forth. The inner product equation is very robust, and it probably can be simplified in many other ways with suitable simplifying assumptions to develop additional techniques for extracting qualia values.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The operation in box <b>322</b> tests whether the values obtained in box <b>320</b> correspond to an existing qualia combination node in data structure <b>260</b>. For this purpose, each qualia combination node can have a respective criterion for determining whether a set of values correspond to it. If there is no corresponding existing node, the operation in box <b>324</b> sets up a new qualia combination node linked to the current qualia map region.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In either case, the operation in box <b>326</b> tests whether the qualia values from box <b>320</b> completely match the links to table <b>262</b> from the qualia combination node. If not, appropriate modifications in the links can be made. For example, if a qualia combination node does not link to a quale that is defined in table <b>262</b> but the qualia values indicate presence of that quale, an additional link can be added from the qualia combination node to the quale's item in table <b>262</b>, provided this would not result in violations of the qualia combination's criterion for determining whether values correspond to it. Or, if the qualia combination node is newly added, new links must be created to existing quale items in table <b>262</b>; also, new quale items must also be set up in table <b>262</b> for any qualia in the combination that are not already defined, and then new links to the new quale items must be added. For some such situations, table <b>262</b> could contain a default quale item that can always be automatically linked to in default of an existing quale item in table <b>262</b>; at a later time, interactive operations could be performed to define new quale items to which links can be made rather than to the default quale item.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When links have been modified in box <b>328</b> or when box <b>326</b> determines that all links correspond, it would be possible to again perform the operation in box <b>322</b> if additional qualia combinations correspond to qualia values from box <b>320</b>, but, as suggested by the dashed line back to box <b>322</b>, this is not expected to be a typical case. More typically, the operation in box <b>224</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) can again be performed to begin the next inner iteration.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Techniques as described above offer the possibility of more effectively extracting information about activity features of brain regions, especially of qualia map regions. The resulting information could assist in diagnosis and/or treatment of detrimental conditions of consciousness. It could be included in data structures that can be stored on a suitable storage medium for convenient access and transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">While the invention has been described in conjunction with specific exemplary implementations, it is evident to those skilled in the art that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, the invention is intended to embrace all other such alternatives, modifications, and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the claims now or hereafter appended.</p>
