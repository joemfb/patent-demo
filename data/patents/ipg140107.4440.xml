<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to a mobile terminal, and more particularly, to methods and apparatus for improving the terminal performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Forthcoming releases of the 3GPP LTE (3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution) and HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) standard facilitate dual-carrier operation. In dual carrier operation, the user equipment (UE) can transmit and receive on multiple system carriers simultaneously. A dual carrier system <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A dual carrier capable UE <b>112</b> can transmit to, and receive from, serving cell <b>110</b> on multiple system carriers (f<b>1</b> and f<b>2</b>) simultaneously. A dual carrier system can increase the maximal throughput. Throughput is roughly proportional to N where N is the number of carriers. Therefore, the throughput in a dual carrier system can increase by a factor of two (from 100 Mb/s to 200 Mb/s for example). A dual-carrier (or dual-cell) mobile terminal (or UE) for use in the dual carrier system needs the ability to process two downlinks (and/or two uplinks) at the same time. Typically, this means that baseband processing capability of a dual-carrier mobile terminal (such as channel estimation/decoding, etc.) is double that of a single-carrier mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The co-ordination of transmission from antennas positioned in different sites have also evolved in these standards such as advanced Inter-Cell Interference Co-ordination (ICIC), Co-ordinated MultiPoint (CoMP) transmission and the introduction of Remote Radio Units (RRU). These techniques enable fast co-ordinated transmissions from several antenna positions including beam forming and nulling. With nulling, interference can be strongly reduced to a specific UE. In coherent CoMP transmissions, the nulling gain is included in the algorithm of selecting co-scheduled mobiles and antenna pre-coding weights.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to increase capacity, MU-MIMO (Multi User Multiple Input Multiple Output) is used. In MU-MIMO, the radio resources are reused by transmitting on the same time and frequency to multiple UEs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Dual-carrier (dual-cell) LTE/HSPA will probably be applied only in hot spot regions and also is only needed for very high throughput scenarios such as when single carrier transmission is insufficient. Therefore, in many use cases, where a single carrier is used, the baseband processing is not fully utilized in the mobile terminal. According to a common scenario in cellular systems, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a terminal <b>212</b> is at the cell border between two cells. One of these cells is the serving cell (SC) <b>210</b> and the other cell is a neighboring cell (NC) (or multiple neighboring cells) <b>220</b>. A signal S that is being communicated between serving cell <b>210</b> and UE <b>212</b> is being subjected to interference I from neighboring cell <b>220</b>. In such a scenario, the signal-interference-ratio (SI or SIR or carrier-to-interference ratio, C/I) is approximately 0 dB (SI&#x2248;0). As a result, full downlink (DL) throughput cannot be achieved. However, in these scenarios, the extra processing power can be used for detecting and cancelling the interfering signals, I.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A terminal connected to a cell receives control information on the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). This information can be utilized by the terminal to determine whether it (i.e. the terminal) is scheduled to receive data packets on the PDSCH (physical downlink shared channel) in the downlink of its serving cell in the current subframe.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, a significant problem is the decoding of the control channels (i.e. PDCCH) of the neighboring cells since the terminal (that is trying to decode PDCCHs) is unaware of the terminals that are connected to the neighboring cells. This makes the cancelling process of neighboring cells' physical channels (such as, for example, PDSCH) significantly more complex.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There exists a need therefore for a method and apparatus for improving the blind decoding of control channels from neighboring cells in order to make practical interference cancelling receivers capable of cancelling interference from neighboring cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It should be emphasized that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, when used in this specification, are taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps or components; but the use of these terms does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In exemplary embodiments, the foregoing and other objects are achieved in methods, systems, and apparatuses for utilizing information received by a user equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an embodiment, a method of determining a radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) is disclosed. The method includes determining a radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) includes descrambling a control channel, decoding control messages included in the control channel wherein the decoded control messages include control bits and received cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits, generating a CRC from the decoded control bits, determining the RNTI from the generated CRC and received CRC and utilizing the RNTI for decoding subsequent subframes.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another embodiment, a user equipment for determining an RNTI is disclosed. The user equipment includes a receiver for down converting a received radio signal to a baseband signal, an analog to digital converter for transforming the baseband signal to a digital signal, a cell search and measuring unit for detecting neighboring cells and for measuring signals on a serving cell and on the detected cells, a decoder for decoding the digital signal wherein the decoded signal includes control bits and received cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits and a control unit. The control unit generates a CRC from the decoded control bits and determines a radio network temporary identifier candidate (RNTI) from the generated CRC and received CRC.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a further embodiment, a computer program including computer readable program modules is disclosed. The computer program, when run on a user terminal causes the user terminal to: descramble a control channel, decode control messages included in the control channel wherein the decoded control messages include control bits and received cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits, generate a CRC from the decoded control bits, determine the RNTI from the generated CRC and received CRC and utilize the RNTI for decoding subsequent subframes.</p>

To facilitate an understanding of the invention, many aspects of the invention are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by elements of a computer system or other hardware capable of executing programmed instructions. It will be recognized that in each of the embodiments, the various actions could be performed by specialized circuits (e.g., analog and/or discrete logic gates interconnected to perform a specialized function), by one or more processors programmed with a suitable set of instructions, or by a combination of both. The term &#x201c;circuitry configured to&#x201d; perform one or more described actions is used herein to refer to any such embodiment (i.e., one or more specialized circuits and/or one or more programmed processors).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, the invention can additionally be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable carrier, such as solid-state memory, magnetic disk, or optical disk containing an appropriate set of computer instructions that would cause a processor to carry out the techniques described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in many different forms, and all such forms are contemplated to be within the scope of the invention. For each of the various aspects of the invention, any such form of embodiments as described above may be referred to herein as &#x201c;logic configured to&#x201d; perform a described action, or alternatively as &#x201c;logic that&#x201d; performs a described action.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In exemplary embodiments, a method for determining radio network temporary identifiers (RNTIs) used in neighboring cells is described. Once a first terminal determines a reliable RNTI (i.e. a second terminal identity) in a neighboring cell, the first terminal can decode the control channel (the PDCCH in LTE for example) and data packet(s) transmitted on a physical data channel (PDSCH in LTE) for that particular second terminal and utilize that information in the processing of the packets to the first terminal. Improved receiver performance, especially at the cell border, may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As the first terminal detects a neighboring cell in a cell search step, the cell ID and cell specific scrambling applied to the cell's control channels can also be determined. The control channel may be de-scrambled, and an RNTI candidate may be determined by comparing received cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits associated to a first decoded control channel message with the CRC generated based on the decoded first control message. All RNTI candidates may be stored in a RNTI candidate list. A RNTI that is used may be the RNTI that has been determined (or occurs) a pre-specified number of times during a pre-specified time period.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to 3GPP TS 36.212, chapter 5.3.3.2, a PDCCH is scrambled with an RNTI defined by higher layers. The scrambling is performed as a modulo-2 operation on the CRC part, which is needed to reliably declare a decoding attempt as being (or not being) successful. This part constitutes the rightmost 16 bits of the bits b<sub>k </sub>for k=0, . . . , A+15 to be encoded, c<sub>k</sub>=(b<sub>k</sub>+x<sub>rnti,k-A</sub>) mod 2 for k=A, A+1, A+2, . . . , A+15 where x<sub>mti </sub>denotes the bit representation of the RNTI. A UE looks in pre-defined search spaces for possible PDCCH assignments, see 3GPP TS 36.213, chapter 9.1.1. This search is performed, depending on the downlink control information (DCI) format, using different types of RNTIs, e.g. C-RNTI, RA-RNTI, P-RNTI, SI-RNTI (see 3GPP TS 36.321, chapter 7.1). In general, a DCI format is linked to information about whether the PDCCH is related to UL transmission, one- or two-codeword DL reception (including resource allocation, precoders, MCS, . . . ), or a power control message, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">While the description of exemplary embodiments is based on RNTI detection in control messages transmitted from neighboring cells, the invention is not limited to that case. For instance, the same technique can be used for determination of RNTI for other terminals connected to the serving cell.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A method in accordance with an embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A measurement and cell search unit (CS) may determine the presence of (one or more) neighboring cells at <b>305</b>. Signal strength measurements on the serving cell and on the detected neighboring cell(s) may be made on a regular basis at <b>310</b>. This may occur typically every 10 to 60 milliseconds (ms) for example. A detector may descramble every sub frame of the PDCCHs originating from the neighboring cell at <b>315</b>. The PDCCHs (control channel messages) may be decoded at <b>320</b>. The decoded message includes control bits and scrambled CRC bits. These bits are scrambled by the radio network temporary identifier (RNTI). The scrambled CRC bits may be referred to as received CRC bits and designated as CRC<sub>R</sub>. It is assumed that the PDCCH payload is in a certain, known downlink control information (DCI) format.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The UE now has an estimate of the combination of a hypothetical (hypothetical in the sense that it is based on the assumption that the unmasked CRC anticipating a specific RNTI might check) PDCCH payload and its corresponding CRC (CRC<sub>R</sub>). For each decoded CCH message (i.e. payload), the control bits may be used to generate a CRC at <b>325</b> (i.e., generation of a check bit sequence from an information bit sequence). The generated CRC may be designated as CRC<sub>G</sub>. CRC<sub>G </sub>may be compared to CRC<sub>R </sub>to determine or estimate a RNTI candidate at <b>330</b>. A suitable distance measure such as, for example, a soft correlation metric may be applied based on the real values of CRC<sub>R </sub>and CRC<sub>G</sub>. An XOR function may alternatively be applied to CRC<sub>G </sub>and CRC<sub>R</sub>. The RNTI candidate may be stored in a first RNTI list (designated as L<b>1</b>) at <b>335</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each RNTI in the list may have a timestamp associated with it to indicate the time at which the RNTI was determined for example. RNTI candidates may be removed from the list if the time lapse from when they were determined/generated exceeds a first pre-specified time period T<b>1</b> (i.e. if a particular RNTI candidate has not been generated during T<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A counter may also be associated with each RNTI in the list. The counter may be incremented by one (1) each subsequent time a particular RNTI is determined. If a particular RNTI is removed from L<b>1</b> due to non-occurrence within T<b>1</b>, then the counter associated with the particular RNTI may be reset (and may be associated with another RNTI for example).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reliability of each RNTI may be evaluated at <b>340</b>. The evaluation may be based on whether (the counter associated with) a RNTI is more than or equal to a pre-specified number of times F (within T<b>1</b>). If a RNTI has occurred less than F number of times (i.e. RNTI is deemed unreliable), descrambling of additional control channels may continue at <b>315</b>. If the RNTI has occurred more than or equal to F number of times (i.e. RNTI is deemed reliable), it may be placed in a second RNTI list that may be referred to as reliable RNTI list and designated as L<b>2</b> at <b>345</b>. Upon placement of a RNTI in list L<b>2</b>, it (i.e. the RNTI) may be removed from L<b>1</b>. RNTI candidates from this list (i.e. L<b>2</b>) may be utilized in decoding of subsequent sub frames at <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The subsequent sub frames may be from the neighboring cell(s) or from the serving cell. Each RNTI in L<b>2</b> may also have a timestamp associated therewith. If a particular RNTI is already in L<b>2</b>, its timestamp may be updated (in L<b>2</b>). If the time lapse from the timestamp exceeds a second pre-specified time period T<b>2</b>, the RNTI may be removed from L<b>2</b>. In this manner, RNTIs that are not likely to occur or be used any more (even if they were used at an earlier point in time) can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Since the RNTI candidate is determined assuming that the message is correctly decoded, the CRC could be used for determination of RNTI (as the CRC is scrambled with a scrambling code associated with the RNTI). In case the message was erroneously decoded, the determined RNTI candidate can be a &#x201c;ghost RNTI&#x201d;. However, by collecting statistics over a time period (designated as T<b>2</b> that is different from T<b>1</b>), true (i.e. used) RNTIs are likely to occur much more frequently than non-applicable, &#x201c;erroneous&#x201d; RNTIs which may be randomly distributed over all possible RNTIs. The reason for determining true used RNTIs by checking the number of occurrences is that the total number of RNTIs is in the order of 2<sup>16 </sup>(65536 or &#x2248;64K) while the number of active terminals at a certain time interval is much smaller (i.e. between 10-100). Therefore, an erroneous RNTI will be evenly distributed among the 64K RNTIs while true RNTIs will be distributed among the 10-100 RNTIs.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Depending on the used RNTIs that are declared to be reliable, different conclusions can be drawn about interference towards the UE's reception in its serving cell. For example, decoding a neighboring cell's PDCCH scrambled with SI-RNTI tells the UE where the system information is located in subframe #5. This value is static (see 3GPP TS 36.321, chapter 7.1) and can hence always be detected in subframe #5. The information may then be used for decoding the PDSCH, for interference cancelling, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Another example could involve the decoding of another UE in the serving cell that is co-scheduled in a multi-user fashion (i.e. sharing the same time and frequency resources). Based on information about MCS, precoding can then be utilized for advanced inter-layer interference suppression. The first UE, once a reliable RNTI has been determined for a second terminal (or UE) in a neighboring cell, can decode PDCCH and check whether the control messages match with the currently determined RNTIs.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Then, the first UE can determine which MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) and resource block allocation is used to allocate data on PDSCH for the second terminal in the neighboring cell. Other parameters (such as precoders for example) can be found in the definition of the respective DCI message. These parameters may assist or help in the cancellation process. By comparing the resource block allocation for data to the first UE, the first UE can identify whether its own data is interfered and thereby selectively start IC (interference cancellation) process for suppressing the interference.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A user equipment (UE) or mobile terminal in accordance with an embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In user equipment <b>400</b>, analog front end receiver <b>420</b> may down convert a radio signal received via antenna <b>410</b> to a baseband signal. Analog-to-digital converter <b>430</b> may transform the analog baseband signal to a digital signal. The digital signal may then be provided (or fed) to decoder <b>440</b> for decoding the signal. The digital signal may also be fed to cell search/measuring unit <b>450</b> and to channel estimation unit <b>460</b>. Cell search/measuring unit <b>450</b> may perform the cell search and signal measurements on serving and detected neighboring cells. The channel estimation unit <b>460</b> may estimate the channel information needed by decoder <b>440</b> based on the digital signal and on the cell search and measurement information from cell search/measuring unit <b>450</b>. Information from channel estimation unit <b>460</b> may be utilized by decoder <b>440</b> to decode the control messages.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A decoded PDCCH may be sent from decoder <b>440</b> to control unit (CU) <b>470</b> for determining the RNTI according to embodiments of the present invention. CU can also, from the history list, provide the RNTI candidates (of neighboring channels, NC) needed for the interference cancellation (IC) functionality in the decoder. This information may be utilized for further processing. The history list and RNTI information may be stored in a memory <b>480</b>. The detected cell identification and RSRP on serving and neighboring cells (SC, NC) may also be provided by cell search and measuring unit <b>450</b> to control unit <b>470</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, one or more of modules <b>420</b>-<b>470</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be implemented within one or more processors. In order for these (one or more) processors to be able to perform the steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, memory <b>480</b> comprises a computer program (CP) <b>485</b> with computer program modules which when run by the (one or more) processors causes user equipment <b>400</b> to perform all or some of the steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.
