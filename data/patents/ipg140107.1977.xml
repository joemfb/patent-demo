<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As an article having a fine concavo-convex structure on its surface, an optical element such as an antireflection member or a wire-grid polarizer has been known.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a process for producing an article having a fine concavo-convex structure on its structure, for example, a method (so-called nanoimprinting technology) of applying a photocurable composition to the surface of a substrate, applying light to the photocurable composition in a state where a mold having a reverse structure of the fine concavo-convex structure on its surface is pressed against the photocurable composition to cure the photocurable composition thereby to obtain an article having a concavo-convex layer having a fine concavo-convex structure on its surface formed on the substrate has been known.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Depending on the application of an article having a fine concavo-convex structure on its surface, the substrate is required to be a transparent substrate such as a glass plate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a process for producing a wire-grid polarizer employing a glass plate as the substrate, the following process has been known.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">(1) A process comprising a step of coating the surface of a glass plate (quartz) with a photocurable composition, a step of pressing a mold having a plurality of grooves on its surface against the photocurable composition, a step of applying light to the photocurable composition in a state where a mold is pressed against the photocurable composition to cure the photocurable composition, to form a concavo-convex layer having a plurality of ridges corresponding to the grooves of the mold on its surface on the glass plate, a step of separating the mold from the concavo-convex layer, and a step of forming a metal layer on the ridges of the concavo-convex layer (Patent Document 1).</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the process (1) has the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(i) In a case where a wire-grid polarizer has a large area, it is required that the glass plate and the mold also have a large area. In the case of a large area, the force when the mold is pressed against the photocurable composition on the surface of the glass plate is required to be increased. However, as the glass plate and the mold are both rigid, when they are strongly pressed, the surface accuracy of the surface of the glass plate tends to be reduced, and the mold is likely to be broken.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">(ii) Since the glass plate as the substrate is rigid, a method (roll to roll method) of pressing a mold in the roll form against the substrate so as to wind the substrate on the mold cannot be employed. Accordingly, the productivity of the wire-grid polarizer tends to be low.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">(iii) In order to selectively form a metal layer on the ridges of the concavo-convex layer, usually oblique vapor deposition is carried out. In a case where oblique vapor deposition is carried out, it is required to tilt the substrate having the concavo-convex layer formed on its surface relative to the flow of a substance to be deposited from a deposition source. In principle, such can be achieved by attaching a rotating mechanism to a fixing jig of the substrate. However, considering the productivity, continuous or intermittent transport of the substrate is required. In such a case, if the substrate is transported in a horizontal direction, a film of the evaporating substance evaporating from the deposition source in an oblique direction is formed, and as the amount of the evaporating substance in an oblique direction is small as compared with the amount of the evaporating substance in the vertical direction, the film deposition efficiency will be decreased. Further, although there is a method of transporting the substrate in an oblique direction to improve the efficiency for utilization of the evaporating substance, a device will be required for the substrate fixing and transporting system, and the apparatus tends to be complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The problems (i) to (iii) are problems which have arisen due to the substrate being rigid. Accordingly, to solve the problems, a method of forming the concavo-convex layer on the surface of a flexible substrate, i.e. the following method can be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">(2) A process for forming a concavo-convex layer on the surface of a substrate film made of a resin by nanoimprinting technology, further forming a metal layer on ridges of the concavo-convex layer, and then laminating a laminate comprising the substrate film, the concavo-convex layer and the metal layer to the surface of a glass plate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, the process (2) is considered to have the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">(iv) Due to a difference in the coefficient of linear expansion between the substrate film and the concavo-convex layer, the temperature properties tend to be low, and the quality will be decreased with a change in the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">(v) Due to a low flatness of the substrate film, optical properties of the wire-grid polarizer will be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">(vi) As the wire-grid polarizer becomes thick corresponding to the thickness of the substrate film, such a wire-grid polarizer is hardly applicable to an application for which thickness is required (e.g. a liquid crystal display).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing an article having a fine concavo-convex structure on the surface of a transparent substrate with high quality with high productivity, with which it is easy to make a concavo-convex layer have a large area.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing a wire-grid polarizer having a fine concavo-convex structure on the surface of a transparent substrate with high quality with high productivity, with which a concavo-convex layer having a large area can easily be achieved.</p>

<p id="h-0012" num="0000">&#x3c;Process for Producing Article Having Fine Concavo-Convex Structure on its Surface&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The process for producing an article having a fine concavo-convex structure on its surface of the present invention comprises the following steps (I), (II), (IV) and (V):</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">(I) a step of forming an interlayer (A) on the surface of a substrate film;</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">(II) a step of forming a concavo-convex layer (B) having a fine concavo-convex structure on its surface, on the surface of the interlayer (A) by imprinting technology;</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">(IV) a step of laminating a protective film to the surface of the concavo-convex layer (B) as the case requires; and</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">(V) a step of separating a laminate comprising the interlayer (A) and the concavo-convex layer (B) from the substrate film and laminating the laminate to the surface of a transparent substrate so that the interlayer (A) faces the transparent substrate side.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As the process for producing an article having a fine concavo-convex structure on its surface of the present invention, the following processes (&#x3b1;) and (&#x3b2;) may be mentioned depending on the type of the interlayer (A).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Process (&#x3b1;): A case where the interlayer (A) is a layer comprising a curable material which has pressure-sensitive adhesion to the substrate film in an uncured or partially cured state, and the pressure-sensitive adhesion of which to the substrate film is reduced as the curing proceeds.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Process (&#x3b2;): A case where the interlayer (A) is a layer formed by applying a pressure-sensitive adhesive to the surface of a release layer of the substrate film.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The interlayer (A) in the process (&#x3b1;) comprises a curable material in an uncured state in the step (I) and has pressure-sensitive adhesion to the substrate film. Further, the interlayer (A) comprises, at a point where the concavo-convex layer (B) is formed by imprinting technology in the step (II), the curable material in a partially cured state, maintains the shape of the layer against the impact when the mold is separated and has pressure-sensitive adhesion to the substrate film. Further, the interlayer (A) comprises, when the laminate is separated from the substrate film in the step (V), the curable material in a state where the curing proceeds, has reduced pressure-sensitive adhesion to the substrate film so that it can readily be separated.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described above, in the process (&#x3b1;), the interlayer (A) is in different states, i.e. in a state where the curable material is uncured, a state where it is partially cured and a state where the curing proceeds.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, as the process (&#x3b1;), the following processes (&#x3b1;1), (&#x3b1;2) and (&#x3b1;3) may be mentioned depending on the type of imprinting technology.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Process (&#x3b1;1): A process of forming the concavo-convex layer (B) having a fine concavo-convex structure on its surface by photoimprinting technology, wherein as the curable material, the curable material (a<b>1</b>) containing a photocurable compound and a thermosetting compound is used.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Process (&#x3b1;2): A process of forming the concavo-convex layer (B) having a fine concavo-convex structure on its surface by photoimprinting technology, wherein as the curable material, a curable material (a<b>2</b>) containing a thermoplastic resin and a thermosetting compound is used.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Process (&#x3b1;3): A process of forming the concavo-convex layer (B) having a fine concavo-convex structure on its surface by thermal-imprinting technology, wherein as the curable material, a curable material (a<b>3</b>) containing a thermoplastic resin and a photocurable compound is used.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Now, the processes (&#x3b1;1) to (&#x3b1;3) and (&#x3b2;) will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(Process (&#x3b1;1))</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Step (I):</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">To a surface <b>11</b><i>a </i>of a substrate film <b>11</b>, a curable material (a<b>1</b>)) containing a photocurable compound and a thermosetting compound is applied to form an interlayer (A) <b>12</b> on the surface <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the substrate film <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In a case where the photocurable compound contained in the curable material (a<b>1</b>)) is not cured in the step (I), a compatible layer is formed between the interlayer (A) <b>12</b> and a concavo-convex layer (B) <b>13</b>, and the adhesion of these two layers will be improved. In such a case, in the step (II), when light is applied to form a concavo-convex layer (B) <b>13</b>, the photocurable compound in the interlayer (A) <b>12</b> is cured at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, in the step (I), after the curable material (a<b>1</b>)) is applied, as the case requires, light is applied to cure the photocurable compound contained in the curable material (a<b>1</b>) so that the interlayer (A) <b>12</b> is in a partially cured state. In a case where the photocurable compound contained in the curable material (a<b>1</b>)) is cured in the step (I), the shape-folding properties of the interlayer (A) <b>12</b> will be improved. When the production process of the present invention is applied to a roll to roll method, by curing the photocurable compound contained in the curable material (a<b>1</b>)) in the step (I), the substrate film <b>11</b> having the interlayer (A) <b>12</b> formed thereon can be once wound before carrying out the step (II).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In both cases where the photocurable compound is cured by the steps (I) and (II), as the photocurable compound is cured at a point where a mold is separated in the after-mentioned step (II), the interlayer (A) can maintain its shape against the impact when the mold is separated. On the other hand, as the thermosetting compound contained in the curable material (a<b>1</b>)) is not cured at a point where the mold is separated, the interlayer (A) has pressure-sensitive adhesion to the substrate film <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The application method may, for example, be potting, spin coating, roll coating, die coating, spray coating, casting, dip coating, screen printing or a transcription method.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Application of light may be carried out from the substrate film <b>11</b> side or may be carried out from above the applied curable material (a<b>1</b>)) when the substrate film <b>11</b> is light-transmitting. In a case where the substrate film <b>11</b> is not light-transmitting, application is carried out from above the applied curable material (a<b>1</b>). Light-transmitting in the present invention means light is transmitted. The wavelength range of the light is specifically within a range of from 400 nm to 800 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As a light source of light application, a high pressure mercury lamp may, for example, be used.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As the light application, it is preferred to apply from 250 to 1,200 mJ of light having a wavelength of 365 nm, whereby both deep part curing properties and surface curing properties are favorable, and the organic material will not be deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As the substrate film <b>11</b>, for example, a film made of a resin may be used.</p>

In such a case, the process of curing the photocurable compound by light and the process of crosslinking hydroxy groups in the photocurable compound are preferably carried out separately as far as possible. By carrying out these two processes separately, development of the shape holding properties and the pressure-sensitive adhesion of the interlayer (A) <b>12</b> and the decrease in the pressure-sensitive properties i.e. development of releasability can definitely be separated. In order to achieve such processes, it is preferred to use a curing agent having the functional group reactive with a hydroxy group preliminarily protected by a protective group capable of leaving by heat.
