<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/CN2009/074084, filed on Sep. 22, 2009, which claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 200810161548.9, filed on Sep. 24, 2008, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of optical communications, and more particularly to a method and a device for adjusting transmission of transport network data.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optical Transport Network (OTN), as a core technology of the next generation transport network, has abundant Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) capabilities, enables the flexible scheduling and management of high-capacity services, and thus becomes a mainstream technology of the backbone transport network.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In signal transmission, an Ethernet needs to use an OTN to bear Ethernet signals, so as to achieve the high-capacity and long-distance transport of information. Considering the technology maturity and cost, the bearer capability of an OTN line is limited. When the bandwidth of a single OTN line is inadequate to bear Ethernet data traffic, virtual concatenation may be used to combine multiple OTN lines, so as to provide a higher bandwidth, and complete the data transport. For example, in an OTN with a bandwidth of 10 Gbps, a container of Optical Channel Payload Unit-2 (OPU2) grade may contain at most 10 Gbps of data information. If 40 Gbps of data needs to be transported, 4 containers of OPU2 grade are combined by using the virtual concatenation technology to form a 4 virtually concatenated OPU2s (OPU2-4V) container to bear the 40 Gbps bandwidth. The Ethernet data is encapsulated into 4 OPU2 containers which are individually added with corresponding virtual concatenation indication information, and then is carried in 4 independent Optical Channel Transport Unit-2 (OTU2) frames, so as to transport the data through 4 independent OTN lines. At a receiving end, the received 4 independent frames are de-framed to provide 4 OPU2 containers, and the 4 OPU2 containers are assembled to form an OPU2-4V container by identifying the virtual concatenation indication information, which is decapsulated to provide correct data.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, the scheme that the OTN uses the virtual concatenation technology to bear Ethernet signals has the following requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">1. When partial line failure occurs to the OTN, the Ethernet needs to adjust the traffic correspondingly. For example, if a certain OTN line fails, the corresponding channel cannot correctly transmit data. In this case, an Ethernet equipment must decrease the data traffic to ensure the normal transmission of data. As the Ethernet data is transmitted though multiple channels in parallel, and the data among the channels is correlated to each other, after a part of the channels fail, other channels cannot combine and obtain the correct data, resulting in failure of the Ethernet data transmission. Accordingly, the Ethernet is required to decrease the traffic, so as to enable the signal to be transmitted on available channels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">2. When the data traffic of the Ethernet equipment is adjusted, the OTN needs to perform line adjustment correspondingly, so as to save OTN line resources.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a solution of the prior art, and is a schematic view of the framework supporting OTN line capacity adjustment according to the prior art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, Ethernet data is processed by a receiving unit, and transferred to an encapsulation unit, which encapsulates Ethernet signals into a virtually concatenated container based on the rate grade, for example, encapsulates the signals into a virtually concatenated container according to the rate grade of OPU2. Then, the encapsulated data is framed to generate OTU format signals capable of being transmitted in an OTN line, optical signal conversion is performed on the OTU signals by an OTN line sending unit, and the signals are then transmitted in an optical fiber. In the prior art, through the interaction between a Link Capacity Adjust Scheme (LCAS) module and an encapsulation unit, a decapsulation unit, a virtual concatenation framing/de-framing unit, and an Ethernet line transceiver unit, the dynamic line adjustment and the partial line failure protection of the OTN may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">After the research on the prior art, the inventors find that in the prior art, the dynamic line adjustment and the partial line failure protection functions only become effective in the OTN, and cannot interact with an Ethernet equipment. When a part of the OTN line fails such that a corresponding channel becomes unavailable, the Ethernet equipment cannot be informed of the change in time to decrease data traffic, so that the multi-channel data cannot be combined to obtain correct data, resulting in the Ethernet data transmission failure. Moreover, when the Ethernet equipment traffic is adjusted, the OTN cannot carry out corresponding adjustment, for example, when Ethernet data traffic is decreased, the OTN still provides a large bandwidth, thereby causing resource waste.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to achieve efficient utilization of OTN resources and ensure effectiveness of data transmission, the present invention is directed to a method and a device for adjusting transmission of transport network data. The present invention provides the following technical solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A method for adjusting transmission of transport network data is provided, which includes the following steps.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Information of adjusting a designated OTN line sent from an OTN is received.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The OTN line corresponding to the information of adjusting the designated OTN line is adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Changed data traffic of the adjusted OTN line is calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An Ethernet channel to be adjusted according to the changed data traffic is designated, and the Ethernet channel to be adjusted is adjusted correspondingly.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention is further directed to a device for adjusting transmission of transport network data, which includes an LCAS module and a channel processing module.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The LCAS module is configured to receive information of adjusting a designated OTN line sent from an OTN, adjust the OTN line corresponding to the information of adjusting the designated OTN line, and calculate changed data traffic of the adjusted OTN line and send information of the changed data traffic to the channel processing module.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The channel processing module is configured to receive the information of the changed data traffic sent from the LCAS module, designate an Ethernet channel to be adjusted according to the changed data traffic, and adjust the Ethernet channel to be adjusted correspondingly.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the embodiments of the present invention, a channel processing module is added so that the Ethernet equipment can interact with the OTN. Thus, when the OTN performs OTN line adjustment, the Ethernet equipment can also correspondingly adjust the data traffic and channel, thereby ensuring the correct transmission of data, and improving the overall performance of a network.</p>

When four virtually concatenated containers fail, the total bearer capacity of the OTN line is decreased to 60 Gbps, such that the Ethernet equipment is also required to correspondingly decrease data traffic. When the data traffic of the Ethernet equipment is correspondingly decreased, and the data is transmitted on Channel 1 to Channel 6, the LCAS module <b>301</b> sends information indicating that the capacity of the virtually concatenated containers is 60 Gbps and control information of encapsulating the data in Channel 1 to Channel 6 to the encapsulation unit.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the method includes the following specific steps.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <b>501</b>, information of adjusting a designated OTN line sent from an OTN is received.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <b>502</b>, the OTN line corresponding to the information of adjusting the designated OTN line is adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Specifically, the designated OTN line is closed when information of closing the designated OTN line sent from the OTN is received, that is, a virtually concatenated container in the OTN line is deleted. Correspondingly, the designated OTN line is opened when information of opening the designated OTN line sent from the OTN is received, that is, a virtually concatenated container is added in the OTN line.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, when the Ethernet channel to be closed is designated, it should be ensured that the data traffic decreased after closing the Ethernet channel is higher than the data traffic decreased in the OTN. For example, it is assumed that the data traffic decreased in the OTN is 40 Gbps; when the data traffic of a single Ethernet channel is 10 Gbps, four Ethernet channels are closed; when the data traffic of the data in a single Ethernet channel is 25 Gbps, two Ethernet channels must to be closed to ensure the normal transmission of the data.
