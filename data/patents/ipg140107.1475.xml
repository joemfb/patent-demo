<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A pile and method for driving a pile includes a pile having a structural outer tube, and an inner member disposed generally concentrically with the outer tube. The outer tube and inner member are fixed to a driving shoe. The pile is constructed and driven such that the pile driver impacts only the inner member. The impact loads are transmitted to the driving shoe to drive the pile into the sediment, such that the outer tube is thereby pulled into the sediment. In a particular embodiment the outer tube is formed of steel, and the inner member also comprises a steel tube. In an alternative embodiment one or both of the inner member and the outer tube are formed of an alternative material, for example, concrete. In an embodiment, the outer tube has a recess that captures a flange on the inner member. In an embodiment the outer tube is attached to the inner member with an elastic spring.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 61/296,413, filed Jan. 19, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Pile driving in water produces extremely high sound levels in the surrounding environment in air and underwater. For example, underwater sound levels as high as 220 dB re 1 &#x3bc;Pa are not uncommon ten meters away from a steel pile as it is driven into the sediment with an impact hammer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Reported impacts on wildlife around a construction site include fish mortality associated with barotrauma, hearing impacts in both fish and marine mammals, and bird habitat disturbance. Pile driving in water is therefore a highly regulated construction process and can only be undertaken at certain time periods during the year. The regulations are now strict enough that they can severely delay or prevent major construction projects.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is thus significant interest in reducing underwater noise from pile driving either by attenuating the radiated noise or by decreasing noise radiation from the pile. As a first step in this process it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the pile and the coupling with the water as the pile is driven into sediment. The process is a highly transient one in that every strike of the pile driving hammer on the pile causes the propagation of deformation waves down the pile. To gain an understanding of the sound generating mechanism the present inventors have conducted a detailed transient wave propagation analysis of a submerged pile using finite element techniques. The conclusions drawn from the simulation are largely verified by a comparison with measured data obtained during a full scale pile driving test carried out by the University of Washington, the Washington State Dept. of Transportation, and Washington State Ferries at the Vashon Island ferry terminal in November 2009. Prior art efforts to mitigate the propagation of dangerous sound pressure levels in water from pile driving have included the installation of sound abatement structures in the water surrounding the piles. For example, in <i>Underwater Sound Levels Associated With Pile Driving During the Anacortes Ferry Terminal Dolphin Replacement Project</i>, Tim Sexton, Underwater Noise Technical Report, Apr. 9, 2007 (&#x201c;Sexton&#x201d;), a test of sound abatement using bubble curtains to surround the pile during installation is discussed. A bubble curtain is a system that produced bubbles in a deliberate arrangement in water. For example, a hoop-shaped perforated tube may be provided on the seabed surrounding the pile, and provided with a pressurized air source, to release air bubbles near or at the sediment surface to produce a rising sheet of bubbles that act as a barrier in the water. Although significant sound level reductions were achieved, the pile driving operation still produced high sound levels.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another method for mitigating noise levels from pile driving is described in a master's thesis by D. Zhou titled <i>Investigation of the Performance of a Method to Reduce Pile Driving Generated Underwater Noise </i>(University of Washington, 2009). Zhou describes and models a noise mitigation apparatus dubbed Temporary Noise Attenuation Pile (TNAP) wherein a steel pipe is placed about a pile before driving the pile into place. The TNAP is hollow-walled and extends from the seabed to above the water surface. In a particular apparatus disclosed in Zhou the TNAP pipe is placed about a pile having a 36-inch outside diameter. The TNAP pipe has an inner wall with a 48-inch O.D., and an outer wall with a 54-inch O.D. A 2-inch annular air gap separates the inner wall from the outer wall.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although the TNAP did reduce the sound levels transmitted through the water, not all criteria for noise reduction were achieved.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A pile is disclosed that includes an inner member, for example, a steel tube or a concrete rod, and an outer tube, for example, a steel tube. A driving shoe, which may be formed integrally with the inner member and outer tube, connects proximal end portions of the inner member and outer tube. The pile is configured to be driven into the ground or sediment by impacting the inner member, without impacting the outer tube, and such that the entire pile is driven into the sediment. For example, the inner member may extend upwardly away from the upper end of the outer tube. The radial expansion wave generated by the impact of the pile driver on the inner tube is therefore substantially shielded from the water.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, a compliant annular material, for example, a polymeric foam, is disposed in an annular space between the inner member and the outer tube and located near the upper end of the outer tube.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, the inner member further has an outer flange and the outer tube has an annular recess on its inside diameter that is configured to capture the outer flange of the inner member.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment the inner member is attached to the outer tube with an annular elastic spring member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A method for driving piles into a seabed is also disclosed, including: providing a pile having a driving shoe, an inner member attached to the driving shoe and extending upwardly from the driving shoe, and an outer tube attached to the driving shoe and extending upwardly from the driving shoe; positioning the pile at a desired position with the driving shoe contacting the seabed; and driving the pile with a pile driver such that the pile driver impacts the inner member without impacting the outer tube such that the outer tube is pulled into the sediment by the driving shoe.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To investigate the acoustic radiation due to a pile strike we created an axisymmetric finite element model of a 30-inch radius, 32 m long hollow steel pile with a wall thickness of one inch submerged in 12.5 m of water and driven 14 m into the sediment. The radius of the water and sediment domain was 10 m. Perfectly matched boundary conditions were used to prevent reflections from the boundaries that truncate the water and sediment domains. The pile was fluid loaded via interaction between the water/sediment. All domains were meshed using quadratic Lagrange elements.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The pile was impacted with a pile hammer with a mass of 6,200 kg that was raised to a height of 2.9 m above the top of the pile. The velocity at impact was 7.5 m/s, and the impact pressure as a function of time after impact was examined using finite element analysis and approximated as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i>(<i>t</i>)=2.7*10<sup>8</sup>exp(&#x2212;<i>t/</i>0.004)Pa&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The acoustic medium was modeled as a fluid using measured water sound speed at the test site, c<sub>w</sub>, and estimated sediment sound speed, c<sub>s</sub>, of 1485 m/s and 1625 m/s, respectfully. The sediment speed was estimated using coring data metrics obtained at the site, which is characterized by fine sand, and applied to empirical equations.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present inventors conducted experiments to measure underwater noise from pile driving at the Washington State Ferries terminal at Vashon Island, Wash., during a regular construction project. The piles were approximately 32 m long and were set in 10.5 to 12.5 m of water depending on tidal range. The underwater sound was monitored using a vertical line array consisting of nine hydrophones with vertical spacing of 0.7 m, and the lowest hydrophone placed 2 m from the bottom. The array was set such that the distance from the piles ranged from 8 to 12 m.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Pressure time series recorded by two hydrophones located about 8 m from the pile showed the following key features:</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">1. The first and highest amplitude arrival is a negative pressure wave of order 10&#x2212;100 kPa;</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">2. The main pulse duration is &#x2dc;20 ms over which there are fluctuations of 10 dB; during the next 40 ms the level is reduced by 20 dB; and</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">3. There are clearly observable time lags between measurements made at different heights off the bottom. These time lags can be associated with the vertical arrival angle.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The finite element analysis shows that the generation of underwater noise during pile driving is due to a radial expansion wave that propagates along the pile after impact. This structural wave produces a Mach cone in the water and the sediment. An upward moving Mach cone produced in the sediment after the first reflection of the structural wave results in a wave front that is transmitted into the water. The repeated reflections of the structural wave cause upward and downward moving Mach cones in the water. The corresponding acoustic field consists of wave fronts with alternating positive and negative angles. Good agreement was obtained between a finite element wave propagation model and measurements taken during full scale pile driving in terms of angle of arrival. Furthermore, this angle appears insensitive to range for the 8 to 12 m ranges measured, which is consistent with the wave front being akin to a plane wave.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The primary source of underwater sound originating from pile driving is associated with compression of the pile. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, which illustrate schematically the transient behavior of the reactions associated with an impact of a pile driver (not shown) with a pile <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the compression wave in the pile due to the hammer strike produces an associated radial displacement motion due to the effect of Poisson's ratio of steel (0.33). This radial displacement in the pile propagates downwards (indicated by downward arrow) with the longitudinal wave with wave speed of c<sub>p</sub>=4,840 m/s when the pile <b>100</b> is surrounded by water <b>94</b>. Since the wave speed of this radial displacement wave is higher than the speed of sound in the water <b>94</b> the rapidly downward propagating wave produces an acoustic field in the water <b>94</b> in the shape of an axisymmetric cone with apex traveling along with the pile deformation wave front. This Mach cone is formed with cone angle of &#x3c6;<sub>w</sub>=sin<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>(c<sub>w</sub>/c<sub>p</sub>)=17.9&#xb0;. Note that this is the angle formed between the vertically oriented pile <b>100</b> and the wave front associated with the Mach cone; it is measured with a vertical line array, and here it will be manifested as a vertical arrival angle with reference to horizontal. This angle only depends on the two wave speeds and is independent of the distance from the pile. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the Mach cone angle changes from &#x3c6;<sub>w </sub>to &#x3c6;<sub>s</sub>=sin<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>(c<sub>w</sub>/c<sub>p</sub>)=19.7&#xb0; as the pile bulge wave enters sediment <b>92</b>. Note that the pile bulge wave speed in the sediment <b>92</b> is slightly lower due to the higher mass loading of the sediment <b>92</b> and is equal to c<sub>p</sub>=4,815 m/s.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the wave in the pile reaches the pile <b>100</b> terminal end it is reflected upwards (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). This upward traveling wave in turn produces a Mach cone of angle &#x3c6;<sub>s </sub>(defined as negative with respect to horizontal) that is traveling up instead of down. The sound field associated with this cone propagates up through the sediment <b>92</b> and penetrates into the water <b>94</b>. Due to the change in the speed of sound going from sediment <b>92</b> to water <b>94</b> the angle of the wave front that originates in the sediment <b>92</b> changes from &#x3c6;<sub>s </sub>to &#x3c6;<sub>sw</sub>=30.6&#xb0; following Snell's law. Ultimately, two upward moving wave fronts occur as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> and more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. One wave front is oriented with angle &#x3c6;<sub>sw </sub>and the other wave front with angle &#x3c6;<sub>ws</sub>. The latter is produced directly by the upward moving pile wave front in the water <b>94</b>. (Other features of propagation such as diffraction and multiple reflections are not depicted in these schematic illustrations, for clarity.)</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Based on finite element analyses performed to model the transient wave behavior generated from impacts generated when driving a steel pile, the generation of underwater noise during pile driving is believed to be due to a radial expansion wave that propagates along the pile after impact. This structural wave produces a Mach cone in the water and the sediment. An upwardly moving Mach cone produced in the sediment after the first reflection of the structural wave results in a wave front that is transmitted into the water. Repeated reflections of the structural wave causes upward and downward moving Mach cones in the water.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is believed that prior art noise attenuation devices, such at bubble curtains and the TNAP discussed above, have limited effectiveness in attenuating sound levels transmitted into the water because these prior art devices do not address sound transmission through the sediment. As illustrated most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an upwardly traveling wave front propagates through the sediment <b>92</b> with a sound speed c<sub>w</sub>. This wave front may enter the water outside of the enclosure defined by any temporary barrier, such as a bubble curtain or TNAP system, for example, such that the temporary barrier will have little effect on this component of the sound.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a pair of noise-attenuating piles <b>100</b> in accordance with the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the noise-attenuating pile <b>100</b> on the left is shown in position to be driven into the desired position with a pile driver <b>90</b>, which is schematically indicated in phantom at the top of the pile <b>100</b>. The identical noise-attenuating pile <b>100</b> on the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown in cross section, and installed in the sediment <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The noise-attenuating pile <b>100</b> includes a structural outer tube <b>102</b>, a generally concentric inner tube <b>104</b>, and a tapered driving shoe <b>106</b>. In a current embodiment the outer tube <b>102</b> is sized and configured to accommodate the particular structural application for the pile <b>100</b>, e.g., to correspond to a conventional pile. In one exemplary embodiment the outer tube <b>102</b> is a steel pipe approximately 89 feet long and having an outside diameter of 36 inches and a one-inch thick wall. Of course, other dimensions and/or materials may be used and are contemplated by the present invention. The optimal size, material, and shape of the outer tube <b>102</b> will depend on the particular application. For example, hollow concrete piles are known in the art, and piles having non-circular cross-sectional shapes are known. As discussed in more detail below, the outer tube <b>102</b> is not impacted directly by the driving hammer <b>90</b>, and is pulled into the sediment <b>92</b> rather than being driven directly into the sediment. This aspect of the noise-attenuating pile <b>100</b> will facilitate the use of non-steel structural materials for the outer tube <b>102</b> such as reinforced concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The inner tube <b>104</b> is generally concentric with the outer tube <b>102</b> and is sized to provide an annular space <b>103</b> between the outer tube <b>102</b> and the inner tube <b>104</b>. The inner tube <b>104</b> may be formed from a material similar to the inner tube <b>104</b>, for example, steel, or may be made of another material such as concrete. For example, the inner tube <b>104</b> may be concrete. It is also contemplated that the inner tube <b>104</b> may be formed as a solid elongate rod rather than tubular. In a particular embodiment, the inner tube <b>104</b> comprises a steel pipe having an outside diameter of 24 inches and a &#x215c;-inch wall thickness, and the annular space <b>103</b> is about six inches thick.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a particular embodiment the outer tube <b>102</b> and the inner tube <b>104</b> are both formed of steel. The outer tube <b>102</b> is the primary structural element for the pile <b>100</b>, and therefore the outer tube <b>102</b> is thicker than the inner tube. The inner tube is structurally designed to transmit the impact loads from the driving hammer <b>90</b> to the driving shoe <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The driving shoe <b>106</b> in this embodiment is a tapered annular member having a center aperture <b>114</b>. The driving shoe <b>106</b> has a wedge-shaped cross section, tapering to a distal end defining a circular edge, to facilitate driving the pile <b>100</b> into the sediment <b>92</b>. In a current embodiment the driving shoe <b>106</b> is steel. The outer tube <b>102</b> and inner tube <b>104</b> are fixed to the proximal end of the driving shoe <b>106</b>, for example, by welding <b>118</b> or the like. Other attachment mechanisms may alternatively be used; for example, the driving shoe <b>106</b> may be provided with a tubular post portion that extends into the inner tube <b>104</b> to provide a friction fit. The driving shoe <b>106</b> maximum outside diameter is approximately equal to the outside diameter of the outer tube <b>102</b>, and the center aperture <b>114</b> is preferably slightly smaller than the diameter of the axial channel <b>110</b> defined by the inner tube <b>104</b>. It will be appreciated that the center aperture <b>114</b> permits sediment to enter into the inner tube <b>104</b> when the pile <b>100</b> is driven into the sediment <b>92</b>. The slightly smaller diameter of the driving shoe center aperture <b>114</b> will facilitate sediment entering the inner tube <b>104</b> by reducing wall friction effects within the inner tube <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that the inner tube <b>104</b> is longer than the outer tube <b>102</b>, such that a portion <b>112</b> of the inner tube <b>104</b> extends upwardly beyond the outer tube <b>102</b>. This configuration facilitates the pile driver <b>90</b> engaging and impacting only the inner tube <b>104</b>. It is contemplated that other means may be used to enable the driver to impact the inner tube <b>104</b> without impacting the outer tube <b>102</b>. For example, the pile driver <b>90</b> may be formed with an engagement end or an adaptor that fits within the outer tube <b>102</b>. The important aspect is that the pile <b>100</b> is configured such that the pile driver <b>90</b> does not impact the outer tube <b>102</b>, but rather impacts only the inner tube <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At or near the upper end of the pile <b>100</b>, a compliant member <b>116</b>, for example, an epoxy or elastomeric annular sleeve may optionally be provided in the annular space <b>103</b> between the inner tube <b>104</b> and the outer tube <b>102</b>. The compliant member <b>116</b> helps to maintain alignment between the tubes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and may also provide an upper seal to the annular space <b>103</b>. Although it is currently contemplated that the annular space <b>103</b> will be substantially air-filled, it is contemplated that a filler material may be provided in the annular space <b>103</b>, for example, a spray-in foam or the like. The filler material may be desirable to prevent significant water from accumulating in the annular space <b>103</b>, and/or may facilitate dampening the compression waves that travel through the inner tube <b>104</b> during installation of the pile <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The advantages of the construction of the pile <b>100</b> can now be appreciated with reference to the preceding analysis. As the inner tube <b>104</b> is impacted by the driver <b>90</b>, a deformation wave propagates down the length of the inner tube <b>104</b>, and is reflected when it reaches the driving shoe <b>106</b>, to propagate back up the inner tube <b>104</b>, as discussed above. The outer tube <b>102</b> portion of the pile <b>100</b> substantially isolates both the surrounding water <b>94</b> and the surrounding sediment <b>92</b> from the traveling Mach wave, thereby mitigating sound propagation into the environment. The outer tube <b>102</b>, which in this embodiment is the primary structural member for the pile <b>100</b>, is therefore pulled into the sediment by the driving shoe <b>106</b>, rather than being driven into the sediment through driving hammer impacts on its upper end.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A second embodiment of a noise-attenuating pile <b>200</b> in accordance with the present invention is shown in cross-sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this embodiment the pile <b>200</b> includes an outer tube <b>202</b>, which may be substantially the same as the outer tube <b>102</b> discussed above. A solid inner member <b>204</b> extends generally concentrically with the outer tube <b>202</b>, and is formed from concrete. The inner member <b>204</b> may have a hexagonal horizontal cross section, for example. A tapered driving shoe <b>206</b> is disposed at the distal end of the pile <b>200</b>, and is conical or frustoconical in shape, and may include a recess <b>207</b> that receives the inner member <b>204</b>. In a currently preferred embodiment the driving shoe <b>206</b> is made of steel. The outer tube <b>202</b> is attached to the driving shoe <b>206</b>, for example, by welding or the like. A center recess may be provided in the driving shoe <b>206</b> that is shaped and sized to receive the concrete inner member <b>204</b>. The inner member <b>204</b> in this embodiment extends above the proximal end of the outer tube <b>204</b>. Although not a part of the pile <b>200</b>, a wooden panel <b>205</b> is illustrated at the top of the inner member <b>204</b>, which spreads the impact loads from the pile driver, to protect the concrete inner member <b>204</b> from crumbling during the driving process. Optionally, in this embodiment a filler <b>216</b> such as a polymeric foam substantially fills the annular volume between the outer tube <b>202</b> and the inner member <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is contemplated that in an alternate similar embodiment, an outer tube may be formed of concrete, and an inner tube or solid member may be formed from steel or a similarly suitable material.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an alternative embodiment of a pile <b>250</b> having an inner tube <b>254</b> and an outer tube <b>252</b>. The pile <b>250</b> is similar to the pile <b>100</b> disclosed above, but wherein the driver shoe <b>256</b> is formed integrally with the inner and outer tubes <b>254</b>, <b>252</b>. In this embodiment, the distal end portion of the inner tube <b>254</b> includes an outer projection or flange <b>251</b>. For example, the flange <b>255</b> may be formed separately and welded or otherwise affixed to the distal end portion of the inner tube <b>254</b>. The outer tube <b>252</b> is configured with a corresponding annular recess <b>253</b> on an inner surface, which is sized and positioned to retain or engage the flange <b>255</b>. In an exemplary construction method the outer tube <b>252</b> is formed from two pieces, an elongate upper piece <b>251</b> having an inner circumferential groove on its bottom end, and a distal piece <b>251</b>&#x2032; having a corresponding inner circumferential groove on its upper end. The distal piece <b>251</b>&#x2032; may further be formed in two segments to facilitate placement about the inner tube <b>254</b>. The upper piece <b>251</b> and distal piece <b>251</b>&#x2032; may then be positioned about the inner tube <b>254</b> such that the flange <b>255</b> is captured in the annular recess <b>253</b>, and the upper piece <b>251</b> and distal piece <b>251</b>&#x2032; welded <b>257</b> or otherwise fixed together. The inner tube <b>254</b> and outer tube <b>252</b> are therefore interlocked by the engagement of the inner tube flange <b>255</b> and the outer tube annular recess <b>253</b>. One or two low-friction members <b>258</b> (two shown), for example nylon washers, may optionally be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flange <b>255</b> is sized such that a gap <b>260</b> is formed between an outer surface of the flange <b>255</b> and an inner surface of the annular recess <b>253</b>. Also, the length of the outer tube <b>252</b> is configured to provide a gap <b>262</b> between the bottom of the outer tube <b>253</b>, and the horizontal surface of the shoe <b>256</b> near the distal end of the inner tube <b>254</b>. It will now be appreciated that as the radial displacement waves induced by the pile driver travel along the inner tube <b>254</b> the outer tube <b>252</b> will be further isolated from the radial displacement waves due to these gaps <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although a flange and recess connection is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is also contemplated, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, that a pile <b>280</b> in accordance with the present invention may include an elastic or compliant connector <b>285</b> may alternatively be provided between the inner tube <b>284</b> and the outer tube <b>282</b> of the pile <b>280</b>. It is contemplated, for example, that the elastic connector <b>285</b> connecting the inner tube and outer tube may be an annular linear elastic spring member with an inner edge fixed to the inner tube <b>284</b>, and an outer edge fixed to the outer tube <b>282</b>. In this embodiment the driving shoe <b>286</b> is formed integrally with the inner and outer tubes <b>284</b>, <b>282</b>, and the elastic connector <b>285</b> substantially isolates the outer tube <b>282</b> from the radial compression waves induced in the inner tube <b>284</b> by the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Although the piles <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are shown in a vertical orientation, it will be apparent to persons of skill in the art, and is contemplated by the present invention, that the piles <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> may alternatively be driven into sediment at an angle.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">While illustrative embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
