<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-219244 filed on Sep. 24, 2009, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an endoscope apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an endoscope apparatus for obtaining an endoscope image of the inside of a body cavity by emitting illumination light thereto, an electronic endoscope is used which includes an image capturing means for capturing an image of an object by using returning light (including fluorescence or the like) obtained after emitting illumination light from a light source device and guiding the light to the inside of the body cavity. Then, the endoscope image is displayed on an observation monitor by performing a signal process on an imaging signal obtained from the image capturing means by using a processor, and an observation position such as an affected portion is observed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the diagnosis and operation using the endoscope apparatus are performed on the basis of the observation image displayed on the observation monitor, it is necessary to faithfully reproduce the color of the observation image in order to perform the accurate diagnosis and operation. Accordingly, in this kind of endoscope apparatus, in order to correct a variation in tone caused by an individual difference such as a difference in sensitivity of a solid-state imaging element, an individual characteristic information is stored in the endoscope or the processor, and the individual characteristic information is read out at an appropriate timing so as to adjust a color (JP-A-2000-342533).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, although original parameters of the apparatus are measured and stored in advance, the values of the parameters may not be equal to the actual characteristics of the apparatus due to a variation in the passage of time, and the appropriate color adjustment is not necessarily performed in some cases.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the invention is to provide an endoscope apparatus capable of obtaining a captured image having a satisfactory color balance at all times without storing individual characteristic information.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has the following configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(1) An endoscope apparatus including: an endoscope which includes an imaging optical system having an imaging element and an illumination optical system having an illumination window, the optical systems being provided at a front end of an endoscope insertion unit inserted into a body cavity; and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a control unit which includes a light source unit connected to the endoscope and supplying at least excitation light to the illumination optical system so as to emit light from a fluorescent substance, and an image processing section correcting an image signal output from the imaging element on a basis of a predetermined color correction table and outputting a result thereof,</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">wherein the control unit performs a calibration process that an image of a color chart having a plurality of color patches with known chromaticity values is captured by the imaging element, chromaticity for each of the plurality of color patches is obtained from an imaging signal of the color chart so as to be used as a measured chromaticity value, and contents of the color correction table are changed so that the measured chromaticity value of each of the color patches is equal to the known chromaticity value.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the endoscope apparatus of the invention, it is possible to obtain a captured image having a satisfactory color balance at all times.</p>

In addition, although not shown in the drawings, the inside of the operation unit <b>23</b> and the endoscope insertion unit <b>19</b> is provided with various channels such as a clamp channel used for inserting a tissue pickup treatment tool or the like therethrough or an air/water feeding channel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The endoscope insertion unit <b>19</b> includes a flexible portion <b>31</b> which has flexibility, a curved portion <b>33</b>, and a front end portion (hereinafter, referred to as an endoscope front end portion) <b>35</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> is provided with illumination ports <b>37</b>A and <b>37</b>B which are used to emit a light to the observation area, and an imaging sensor <b>21</b> such as a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) image sensor or a CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) image sensor which is used to acquire image information of the observation area. The light receiving surface of the imaging element <b>21</b> is provided with an object lens unit <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The curved portion <b>33</b> is provided between the flexible portion <b>31</b> and the front end portion <b>35</b>, and is adapted to be curved by a rotation operation of an angle knob <b>22</b> disposed in the operation unit <b>23</b>. The curved portion <b>33</b> may be curved to an arbitrary direction and an arbitrary angle in accordance with a portion of the test object examined by the endoscope <b>11</b>. The observation direction of the illumination ports <b>37</b>A and <b>37</b>B and the imaging element <b>21</b> of the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> may be directed to a desired observation portion. In addition, although not shown in the drawings, the illumination ports <b>37</b>A and <b>37</b>B of the endoscope insertion unit <b>19</b> are provided with a cover glass or a lens.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The control device <b>13</b> includes a light source device <b>41</b> which generates an illumination light supplied to the illumination ports <b>37</b>A and <b>37</b>B of the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b>, and a processor <b>43</b> which performs an image process on an image signal from the imaging element <b>21</b>, and is connected to the endoscope <b>11</b> via the connectors <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B. In addition, the processor <b>43</b> is connected to the display unit <b>15</b> and the input unit <b>17</b> which are described above. The processor <b>43</b> performs an image process on an imaging signal transmitted from the endoscope <b>11</b> on the basis of the command from the operation unit <b>23</b> of the endoscope <b>11</b> or the input unit <b>17</b> thereof, and generates and supplies a display image to the display unit <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The light source device <b>41</b> includes a blue laser light source (white illumination light source) <b>45</b> having a central wavelength of 445 nm, and a violet laser light source (particular light source) <b>47</b> having a central wavelength of 405 nm. The light emission from each of the semiconductor light emitting elements of the light sources <b>45</b> and <b>47</b> is individually controlled by the light source control section <b>49</b>, and the light amount ratio between the light emitted from the blue laser light source <b>45</b> and the light emitted from the violet laser light source <b>47</b> is changeable.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The blue laser light source <b>45</b> and the violet laser light source <b>47</b> may use an InGaN-based laser diode of a broad area type, and also may use an InGaNAs-based laser diode or a GaNAs-based laser diode. In addition, as the above-described light source, a light emitting member such as a light emitting diode may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The laser lights emitted from the light sources <b>45</b> and <b>47</b> are respectively input to optical fibers by a condensing lens (not shown), and are propagated to the connector <b>25</b>A via a combiner <b>51</b> as a multiplexer and a coupler <b>53</b> as a demultiplexer. In addition, the invention is not limited thereto, but has a configuration in which the laser lights emitted from the light sources <b>45</b> and <b>47</b> are directly supplied to the connector <b>25</b>A without using the combiner <b>51</b> and the coupler <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The blue laser light having a central wavelength of 445 nm and the violet laser light having a central wavelength of 405 nm are multiplexed, and the laser light propagated to the connector <b>25</b>A is propagated to the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> of the endoscope <b>11</b> by the optical fibers <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B. Then, the blue laser light excites a fluorescent substance <b>57</b> which is a wavelength changing member disposed in the light emitting ends of the optical fibers <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B of the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> so as to emit fluorescence therefrom. Further, a part of the blue laser light directly transmits the fluorescent substance <b>57</b>. The violet laser light transmits the fluorescent substance <b>57</b> without excitation thereof, and becomes illumination light of a narrow band of wavelength. The fluorescent substances <b>57</b> are disposed at each of both sides of the observation window of the imaging element <b>21</b>, so that it is difficult for a shade to be formed in an object illuminated by the illumination light.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The optical fibers <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B are multi-mode fibers. As an example, a thin fiber cable may be used which has a core diameter of 105 &#x3bc;m, a cladding diameter of 125 &#x3bc;m, and a diameter of &#x3a6;0.3 to 0.5 mm including a protection layer as an outer surface.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The fluorescent substance <b>57</b> includes plural types of fluorescent substances (for example, a YAG-based fluorescent substance or a fluorescent substance such as BAM(BaMgAl<sub>10</sub>O<sub>17</sub>)) which absorbs a part of the blue laser light and is excited to emit light as green to yellow. Accordingly, the blue laser light is changed to white (color similar to white) illumination light by mixing green to yellow excitation light as excitation light with the blue laser light not absorbed and transmitted by the fluorescent substance <b>57</b>. Like the example of the configuration, when the semiconductor light emitting elements are used as an excitation light source, it is possible to obtain white light having high light emission efficiency and high intensity. Also, it is possible to easily control the intensity of the white light, and to minimally suppress a variation in the color temperature and chromaticity value of the white light.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The fluorescent substance <b>57</b> may prevent an occurrence of flickering when performing a video display or overlapping of noise as a barrier in the image capturing operation due to a speckle generated by coherence of laser light. In addition, in the fluorescent substance <b>57</b>, in consideration of a difference in the refractive index between the fluorescent material forming the fluorescent substance and a fixing/solidifying resin as a filling agent, it is desirable that the particles of the filling agents and the fluorescent material are formed of a material having large scattering and small absorption with respect to the infrared light. Accordingly, it is possible to improve the scattering effect without reducing the light intensity with respect to the light of red or infrared region, and to reduce the optical loss.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an external view of the endoscope apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The light source unit <b>41</b>, the processor <b>43</b>, the display unit <b>15</b>, and the input unit <b>17</b> are accommodated in a cart unit <b>77</b> having a caster <b>75</b> at the lower portion thereof. Likewise, the cart unit <b>77</b> mounted with the peripheral devices of the endoscope <b>11</b> is provided with an endoscope support port <b>79</b> which is used to suspend the operation unit <b>23</b> of the endoscope thereon. In the endoscope <b>11</b> supported by the endoscope support unit <b>79</b>, the endoscope insertion unit <b>19</b> is drooped at the same position at all times. A base portion <b>81</b> of the cart unit <b>77</b> is disposed at the lower position extended from of the front end portion <b>35</b> of the drooped endoscope insertion unit <b>19</b>, and a bottomed cylindrical body <b>83</b> is fixed to the base portion <b>81</b>. In the endoscope insertion unit <b>19</b> supported by the endoscope support unit <b>79</b>, the front end portion <b>35</b> is inserted into the bottomed cylindrical body <b>83</b>. In addition, the bottom portion of the bottomed cylindrical body <b>83</b> is provided with a color chart <b>85</b> which includes a plurality of color patches to be described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image signal of the captured image output from the imaging element <b>21</b> after the image capturing operation is transmitted to an A/D converter <b>89</b> via a signal cable <b>87</b>, and is converted into a digital signal. The image signal converted into the digital signal is input to an image processing section <b>91</b> of the processor <b>43</b> via the connector <b>25</b>B. The image processing section <b>91</b> performs various pre-stage processes such as contour emphasis on the captured image signal obtained from the imaging element <b>21</b> and converted into the digital signal by the A/D converter <b>89</b>. Then, the captured image signal subjected to the pre-stage process is divided into the respective captured image signals such as an R signal, a G signal, and a B signal, and is subjected to a color correction process on the basis of the information of the color correction lookup table (color correction LUT) <b>99</b> to be described later. The captured image signal subjected to the color correction is then converted into video signals such as a video composite signal and a Y/C division signal, and is output to the control section <b>93</b> in the form of desired output image information.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The output image information input to the control section <b>93</b> is displayed on the display unit <b>15</b> in the form of an endoscope observation image, and is stored in a storage section <b>95</b> including a memory or a storage device, if necessary. In addition, the endoscope <b>11</b> is provided with a power switch <b>97</b>, and a start signal is input from the power switch <b>97</b> to the control section <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b> with the above-described configuration, a calibration process is performed in such a manner that the image of the color chart <b>85</b> is captured, and the contents of the above-described color correction table <b>99</b> are changed on the basis of the color detection result. Hereinafter, the calibration process will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing an example of an excitation spectrum and a light emission spectrum of the fluorescent substance. In the fluorescent substance of this case, the excitation spectrum depicted by the dotted line absorbs the light within the wavelength bandwidth of 420 to 470 nm, and is allowed to highly efficiently absorb the light of the wavelength of particularly 445 nm. The fluorescent substance <b>57</b> is excited by the absorbed excitation light, and emits fluorescence of the spectrum shown as the light emission spectrum depicted by the solid line.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The light emission intensity of the fluorescent substance <b>57</b> is changed in accordance with the magnitude of the absorbed energy. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, if it is assumed that the light emission wavelength of the blue laser light source is deviated by the individual difference or the like, in the case of the laser light LB-A of the stipulated wavelength of 445 nm, the highly efficient absorption occurs at the wavelength at which the excitation spectrum substantially becomes a peak. However, in the case of the laser light LB-B, since the light emission wavelength is deviated, the magnitude of the excitation spectrum is reduced by &#x394;P. Then, in the LB-B, the light intensity is the same as that of the LB-A, and the light emission spectrum of the fluorescent substance is reduced from CA to CB, thereby causing a relative difference in the light emission intensity of the fluorescent substance.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Then, in the white light formed by the light emission of the fluorescent substance and the blue laser light, the tone of the white light is changed due to a variation in the intensity balance and the light emission (a variation caused by the wavelength) of the fluorescent substance and the blue laser light (constant intensity). That is, in the case where the light wavelength is deviated as in the above-described LB-B, the intensity ratio of the blue laser light relatively increases due to a decrease in the light emission intensity of the fluorescent substance, thereby forming the bluish white light.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Accordingly, in the endoscope apparatus with this configuration, a plurality of laser light sources is used, and the laser lights emitted from them are multiplexed, thereby reducing an influence caused by an individual difference in the wavelength of the light emitted from each of the laser light sources. By multiplexing the lights emitted from the plurality of laser light sources, it is possible to set the central wavelength of the multiplexed laser light to be close to the average wavelength of the respective laser light sources, that is, the stipulated wavelength (445 nm). However, in the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>, even when a color is adjusted on the particular endoscope <b>11</b> by the combination of the wavelength of the laser light source and the fluorescent substance, if there is a difference in the characteristic of the fluorescent substance when another endoscope is connected, the tone of the illumination light formed by the laser light is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, a variation occurs in the tone of the captured image even by an individual difference of the spectral sensitivity characteristic of the imaging element <b>21</b> mounted to the endoscope <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph showing a relationship between the spectral sensitivity characteristic and the wavelength of the imaging element.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The imaging element <b>21</b> has the spectral sensitivity characteristics of B, G, and R with respect to the reflection light from the object. The laser light emitted from the blue laser light source <b>45</b> having a wavelength of 445 nm excites the fluorescent substance, and a part of the laser light transmits the fluorescent substance so as to be supplied as the blue component of the white illumination light. When the reflection light of the blue light is received by the imaging element <b>21</b>, the spectral sensitivity characteristic of the imaging element <b>21</b> with respect to the B light has an area where a profile is steeply changed around the wavelength of 445 nm. Accordingly, when the spectral sensitivity characteristic of the imaging element <b>21</b> is slightly changed, the light receiving amount of the imaging element <b>21</b> with respect to the B light is changed. In addition, even when the light emission wavelength of the blue laser light source <b>45</b> is changed due to an individual difference or the like, the light receiving amount with respect to the B light is changed due to the same reason. For this reason, the tone of the captured image is changed due to the individual difference of the imaging element <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, in the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>, the color is normally corrected on the captured image at all times by performing the calibration process as below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>, the endoscope <b>11</b> supported by the endoscope support unit <b>79</b> captures the image of the color chart <b>85</b> including a plurality of color patches having known chromaticity value by using the imaging element <b>21</b>. The control section <b>93</b> obtains the chromaticity value of each of the plurality of color patches from the imaging signal of the color chart <b>85</b>, and sets the chromaticity value as the measured chromaticity value. The control section <b>93</b> performs a calibration process which changes the contents of the color correction table <b>99</b> so that the measured chromaticity value of each of the color patches is equal to the known chromaticity value.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Therefore, according to the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>, the contents of the color correction table <b>99</b> are corrected so that the measured chromaticity value for each of the color patches obtained by the imaging element <b>21</b> is equal to the known chromaticity value, and the imaging signal of the captured image are close to the imaging signal of the original color.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the color chart <b>85</b> is disposed at a bottom surface <b>83</b><i>a </i>of the bottomed cylindrical body <b>83</b> which accommodates the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> in the inside of the inner peripheral surface at the lower portion of the front end portion <b>35</b> of the endoscope insertion unit <b>19</b> supported by the endoscope support unit <b>79</b>. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a perspective view of the bottomed cylindrical body which has the color chart provided at the bottom portion thereof and to which the endoscope front end portion is inserted. The calibration process is performed in the state where the drooped endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> is surrounded by the center portion of the bottomed cylindrical body <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">That is, in the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>, the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> takes a posture of facing downward at all times by suspending the endoscope <b>11</b> on the endoscope support unit <b>79</b>. The color chart <b>85</b> is disposed so as to face the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> taking a posture of facing downward. Accordingly, when a user just suspends the endoscope <b>11</b> on the endoscope support unit <b>79</b> without any intentional purpose, the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> is disposed at a position facing the color chart <b>85</b>. Accordingly, the preparation of the calibration process is completed just by an operation which is the quite the same as the operation in normal use, without any particular preparation for the calibration process. Then, when the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> is inserted into the bottomed cylindrical body <b>83</b>, it becomes a state where an influence caused by the disturbance of the external light hardly occurs during the calibration process. Likewise, in this configuration, without the help of a particular experiment environment, it is possible to perform the simple and highly precise calibration process by using the support state of the endoscope <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>, various types of the color charts may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a plan view of the color chart having a lattice shape and formed by a plurality of color patches, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is a plan view of the color chart having a circular shape and formed by a plurality of radial color patches.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, as the color chart, a color chart <b>85</b>A formed by arranging a plurality of color patches (color tables) <b>85</b><i>a </i>in a lattice shape or a color chart <b>85</b>B formed by arranging a plurality of circularly concentric divided color patches <b>85</b><i>b </i>in a radial shape may be used. When the image of the lattice-shaped color chart <b>85</b>A is captured, for example, the color patches <b>85</b><i>a </i>at the corner portions may be omitted from the imaging screen. Regarding the concentrically divided color chart <b>85</b>B, the color detection is stably performed at all times regardless of the imaging direction of the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the color correction procedure of the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the flowchart of the color correction procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">First, the power switch <b>97</b> of the endoscope <b>11</b> is turned on (S<b>1</b>). The control section <b>93</b> starts to capture the image of the color chart <b>85</b> at a start point as the timing of detecting the on state of the power switch <b>97</b> (S<b>2</b>). The calibration process is performed at the same time when the power switch <b>97</b> is turned on, thereby performing the simple and efficient calibration process.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the image of the color chart <b>85</b> is captured, the chromaticity value of each of the plurality of color patches <b>85</b><i>a </i>is obtained from the imaging signal of the color chart <b>85</b>, and is set as the measured chromaticity value (S<b>3</b>). The control section <b>93</b> performs the calibration process which changes the contents of the color correction table <b>99</b> so that the measured chromaticity value of each of the color patches <b>85</b><i>a </i>is equal to the existing chromaticity value (S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the color correction process, generally, the color conversion matrix is used. The color conversion matrix is used to optimize the desired stimulus color value (target stimulus color value) when a plurality of reference colors R, G, and B in the input color space captured by the imaging element <b>21</b> are converted into the stimulus color spaces X, Y, and Z, and the like. The color conversion matrix is calculated at the final stage of the manufacture process of the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>, and the information on the calculated color conversion matrix is stored in the color correction LUT <b>99</b> mounted to the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>. In addition, after the conversion to the stimulus value spaces X, Y, and Z, the conversion to the Lab color space as the uniform color space may be performed, and the desired chromaticity value matching may be performed in the Lab color space.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the calibration process of calculating the color conversion matrix, each matrix value ij is determined so that the stimulus value in accordance with the value of the RGB signal of the input color space obtained by photographing the reference color (color chart <b>85</b>) by using the imaging element <b>21</b> is close to the stimulus value in accordance with the predetermined target color RGB signal value.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Then, after the calibration process, the calculation process is performed on the RGB signal input from the imaging element <b>21</b> by using the above-described color conversion matrix, so that the RGB signal obtained from the imaging element <b>21</b> is corrected to be close to the target color stimulus value. As a result, it is possible to perform the faithful color reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the contents of the color correction table <b>99</b> are changed on the basis of the above-described contents, the image capturing operation is performed by the actual endoscope examination (S<b>5</b>). Then, the imaging signal obtained by the examination image capturing operation is subjected to the color correction by the color correction table <b>99</b> (S<b>6</b>), and the observation image based on the image signal subjected to the color correction is output to the display unit <b>15</b> (S<b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, the target value (target color) set upon calculating the above-described color conversion matrix is mainly the colorimetric signal of the reference color, but may be set as the particular color actually observed by the endoscope <b>11</b>, where the particular color may be the color of the surface layer of the mucous membrane of the biological tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, in the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b> for performing the observation or the examination of the inside of the body cavity, a PDD (Photodynamic Diagnosis) for tumor diagnosis may be performed in such a manner that a light sensitive material having tumor affinity and sensitive to a particular excitation light is injected into a living body in advance, laser light as the excitation light having a comparative weak output is emitted to a surface of a biological tissue, and fluoresce from a portion having an increased concentration of the light sensitive material in the involved site of a tumor such as a cancer is observed. In addition, in the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>, a PDT (Photodynamic Therapy) for tumor therapy of a tumor such as a cancer may be performed in such a manner that laser light having a comparatively strong output is emitted to a surface of a biological tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the laser light of 405 nm in the PDD, a medicine emits red fluorescence, and an affected site may be clearly observed. In addition, in the self-fluorescence, green fluorescence is emitted from the living body, and the light emission thereof is reduced in the affected site. When an unexpected color different from that of the normal observation image is displayed in order to easily detect such a variation, it is easy to determine the area or the existing location of the affected site.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As the purpose of the particular endoscope, it is possible to obtain image information which may be easily observed by performing a color correction while the color correction table <b>99</b> is set to a desired arbitrary value. For example, when a correction increases the luminance of the portion having green fluorescence and the portion having red fluorescence, the portions observed as vague green and red in the normal observation image are displayed as strong green and red. Such observation may be freely set of the color correction table <b>99</b> through the emphasis process in accordance with the purpose of the observation. In the color chart <b>85</b> which is suitable for the above-described color conversion and is used as a particular color chart, for example, a plurality of color patches <b>85</b><i>a </i>exists between red and green, and a difference of delicate color is stipulated. On the contrary, the blue color patch <b>85</b><i>a </i>does not exist.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As described above, various types may be selectively used as the color chart <b>85</b> used in the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b> in accordance with the observation purpose. The respective color charts may be the arrangement patterns of different colors. In order to identify each of the plurality of types of color charts, for example, the type information of the color chart shown in Table 1 may be stored in advance in the storage section <b>95</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and may be appropriately used for reference.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">That is, according to the type information of the color chart shown in Table 1, the color chart having a code number of 1 is used to examine an upper digestive tract, and a plurality of types of color patches having delicate colors is prepared for the mucous membrane of the biological tissue. In the upper digestive tract, a throat, a stomach, and a duodenum correspond to an examination target. Since there is a case where it is important to identify the color of infection or tumor, in order to accurately identify the color, many color samples (color patches) around the color are included in the color chart.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In these color charts, it is possible to further improve the convenience thereof when identification information is provided on a display surface of the color chart.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a plan view of a color chart having identification information added thereto. In the color chart <b>85</b>, identification information <b>101</b> is provided at a certain position within the chart. As the identification information, a general identification means such as a one-dimensional barcode and a two-dimensional QR code may be used. In addition, in addition to the barcode, various signs, arrangement of signs, a character string such as a numeral string, or the type or characteristic of the treatment tool for the endoscope may be used. If the extraction and recognition (analysis) may be performed by using the image capturing process, various types may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the color chart <b>85</b>, first, the image of the color chart <b>85</b> is captured by the imaging element <b>21</b>, the identification information <b>101</b> is recognized from the captured image, and the type (code) of the color chart <b>85</b> is determined. In accordance with the determined code, the calibration process is performed by using an algorithm corresponding to the determined color chart on the basis of the type information shown in Table 1. The calibration program of the algorithm corresponding to each color chart is stored in advance in the storage section <b>95</b>, and several programs are selectively read out so as to be executed by the control section <b>93</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to automatically perform the calibration process by using the different algorithms in accordance with the types of the light sources for PDD and PDT.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, an example will be described which has a configuration in which the imaging environment is hardly influenced by the external light by shielding light to the portion provided with the color chart.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> is a perspective view of a bottomed cylindrical body of which the upper portion is closed by a cover having an insertion hole, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is a cross-sectional view thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The bottomed cylindrical body <b>83</b> includes a cover <b>103</b> which covers the upper portion thereof and has a light shielding property. The cover <b>103</b> is provided with an insertion hole <b>105</b> which allows the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> to be inserted into the insertion hole <b>105</b>. With such a configuration, the drooped endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> is supported to the endoscope support unit <b>79</b>, and is inserted into the insertion hole <b>105</b> of the cover <b>103</b> provided in the bottomed cylindrical body <b>83</b> so as to be positioned and supported at the center portion of the diameter of the bottomed cylindrical body <b>83</b>. In addition, since the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> may be stored into the light shielding space by the cover <b>103</b>, it is possible to perform the calibration process which is hardly influenced by the disturbance caused by the external light.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, since the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> is supported by the cover <b>103</b>, it is possible to reliably prevent the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> from being shaken during the movement or the like of the cart unit <b>77</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and to protect the endoscope front end portion <b>35</b> mounted with a precise electronic device such as an imaging element.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, in the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b> with the above-described configuration <b>100</b>, the timing upon turning on the power switch <b>97</b> is used as the start point, but for example, the calibration process may be performed by setting the timing upon detecting the exchange of the fluorescent substance <b>57</b> as the start point. According to such a configuration, it is possible to perform the calibration process corresponding to the spectrum for each product of the newly exchanged fluorescent substance <b>57</b>, and to obtain a captured image having a satisfactory color balance at all times.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Furthermore, in the case where the light source unit <b>47</b> supplies laser light (light having a narrow bandwidth of a wavelength of 405 nm) having a wavelength shorter than that of the blue laser light for forming the white light in order to observe the image of the blood vessel of the surface layer of the tissue, the illumination light synthesized with the white light has a bluish tone due to the existence of the particular light. Even in this case, by creating the color correction table <b>99</b> used to perform the color correction for suppressing the bluish color, the color correction suitable for the tone of the illumination light is performed, and the captured image having appropriate chromaticity value may be obtained at all times.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Moreover, whenever the calibration for the color adjustment is performed, the timing of performing the calibration is different for each user of the endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>. In addition, at the time of actual operation, when the calibration is performed, a mechanism for performing the calibration needs to be prepared, which is troublesome work. On the contrary, according to the present endoscope apparatus <b>100</b>, even when an operation almost the same as that of the normal case is performed, the calibration process is automatically performed, and the imaging signal having a satisfactory color balance may be obtained at all times. For this reason, it is possible to prevent the calibration process from being used and continued in the state where the color balance of the endoscope <b>11</b> is collapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Likewise, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, but corrections and applications thereof may be made by the person skilled in the art on the basis of the description of the specification and the known technology, and those are included in the scope required to be protected.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As described above, the present specification discloses the following items.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">(1) An endoscope apparatus including: an endoscope which includes an imaging optical system having an imaging element and an illumination optical system having an illumination window, the optical systems being provided at a front end of an endoscope insertion unit inserted into a body cavity; and a control means which includes a light source unit connected to the endoscope and supplying at least excitation light to the illumination optical system so as to emit light from a fluorescent substance, and an image processing section correcting an image signal output from the imaging element on the basis of a predetermined color correction table and outputting the result thereof, wherein the control means performs a calibration process in such a manner that an image of a color chart having a plurality of color patches with known chromaticity values is captured by the imaging element, chromaticity for each of the plurality of color patches is obtained from an imaging signal of the color chart so as to be used as a measured chromaticity value, and the contents of the color correction table are changed so that the measured chromaticity value of each of the color patches is equal to the known chromaticity value.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to the endoscope apparatus, the calibration process of the contents of the color correction table is performed so that the measured chromaticity value for the color patch obtained by the imaging element is equal to the known chromaticity value, and the imaging signal of the captured image may be close to the imaging signal value of the original color.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">(2) The endoscope apparatus according to (1), wherein the control means performs the calibration process at a start point as the timing of detecting an on state of a power switch.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">According to the endoscope apparatus, for example, the calibration process is performed at the same time when the power switch is turned on immediately before the use of the endoscope apparatus, and hence the calibration process may be performed simply and efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">(3) The endoscope apparatus according to (1), wherein the control means performs the calibration process at a start point as the timing of detecting an exchange of the fluorescent substance.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to the endoscope apparatus, since the white light is formed by the fluorescent substance and the blue laser light, it is possible to obtain the white light which has high efficiency and high intensity. It is easy to correct the white light even when the spectral characteristic of the illumination light is changed due to a variation in time of the fluorescent substance or a difference in the wavelength of the laser light.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">(6) The endoscope apparatus according to (5), wherein the light source unit supplies laser light, which has a property of passing through the fluorescent substance and has a wavelength shorter than that of the blue laser light, to the illumination optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to the endoscope apparatus, even in the case where laser light having a wavelength shorter than that of the blue laser light for forming the white light in order to observe the image of the blood vessel of the surface layer of the tissue (the case where the captured image is bluish), it is possible to obtain the captured image having appropriate chromaticity at all times by creating the color correction table for each laser light.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">According to the endoscope apparatus, since the endoscope is supported by the endoscope support unit, the front end of the endoscope insertion unit takes a posture of facing downward at all times. Since the color chart is disposed to face the front end, it is possible to perform the simple and highly precise calibration process by using the support state of the endoscope, without the help of a particular experiment environment.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">(8) The endoscope apparatus according to (7), wherein the endoscope support unit is installed in a cart unit which is mounted with a peripheral device of the endoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">According to the endoscope apparatus, the peripheral devices such as the processor, the light source device, the display unit, and the input unit necessary for the image capturing operation of the endoscope are all accommodated in the cart unit. Since the endoscope support unit is installed in the cart unit, it is possible to perform the image capturing operation with the calibration process while the endoscope is supported.</p>
