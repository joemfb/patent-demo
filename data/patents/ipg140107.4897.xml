<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the optical networking and optical communication fields. More specifically, the present invention relates to a wavelength-switched reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (R-OADM) with wavelength broadcasting capability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Optical networks are starting to utilize reconfigurable optical-add drop multiplexers (R-OADMs) to switch wavelengths in a wavelength division multiplexed system (WDM). R-OADMs provide the ability to switch any wavelength without the need to perform an electrical conversion. Additionally, R-OADMs provide network operators advantages with regards to reconfigurations, network routing, power balancing, and the like. As such, network operators are deploying R-OADM devices in metropolitan and long-haul optical networks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">R-OADMs typically utilize either a wavelength-switched architecture or a broadcast-and-select architecture. The wavelength-switched architecture consolidates the wavelength switching and multiplex/de-multiplex (MUX/DEMUX) functions within the same functional block (i.e. a wavelength selective switch (WSS)), making the wavelength-switched architecture relatively less complex and less expensive (requiring N switches for N node degrees). The broadcast-and-select architecture, on the other hand, requires MUX/DEMUX functions that are independent from the wavelength switching function, making the broadcast-and-select architecture relatively more complex and expensive (requiring N&#xd7;(N&#x2212;1) wavelength blockers for N node degrees). These architectures are inherently contradictory. In the wavelength-switched architecture, an inbound (or added) wavelength is switched to either an output port or a drop port. If switched to a drop port, the inbound (or added) wavelength cannot reach additional subscribers, as required by the broadcast-and-select architecture. Users may re-generate and transmit the received broadcast signal, but this requires the use of additional transceivers, increasing the number of components utilized and compromising overall system reliability. Thus, wavelength-switched R-OADMs do not support a wavelength broadcasting function, as broadcast-and-select R-OADMs do.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In modern networks, bandwidth growth is being driven in metropolitan and long-haul optical networks by video transport as high-definition television (HDTV), video on-demand (VOD), and other video-related services proliferate. Broadcast video signal distribution is inherently asymmetric. A small number of video signals are received by a large number of subscribers, the subscribers typically transmitting no signals. For example, SONET/SDH systems can utilize a drop-and-continue architecture allowing a single signal, such as an OC-12/STM-4, OC-48/STM-64, etc., to drop at multiple locations and continue. With regard to optical equipment supporting video signal distribution, WDM networks typically utilize the broadcast-and-select architecture for R-OADMs, sacrificing with respect to component complexity and expense.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, what is needed in the art is a wavelength-switched R-OADM with wavelength broadcasting capability, such that unidirectional video signal distribution and the like can be performed without sacrificing component complexity and expense.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In various exemplary embodiments, the present invention provides a wavelength-switched reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (R-OADM) with wavelength broadcasting capability, such that asymmetric video signal distribution and the like can be performed without sacrificing with respect to component complexity and expense. The present invention utilizes an optical splitting and combining device with the wavelength-switched R-OADM to allow the R-OADM to support network-wide wavelength broadcasts without requiring regeneration and extra optical transceiver equipment.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In various exemplary embodiments, the present invention provides a wavelength-switched reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (R-OADM) with wavelength broadcasting capability, such that unidirectional video signal distribution and the like can be performed without sacrificing with respect to component complexity and expense. The present invention utilizes an optical splitting and combining device with the wavelength-switched R-OADM to allow the R-OADM to support network-wide wavelength broadcasts without requiring external regeneration and extra optical transceiver equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating one exemplary embodiment of a conventional micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based wavelength selective switch (WSS) <b>10</b>, such as that used in conjunction with the systems and methods of the present invention. A fiber input <b>11</b> including optical signals of a plurality of wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3bb;<sub>2</sub>, . . . &#x3bb;<sub>n </sub><b>12</b> is input into a de-multiplexer (DEMUX) <b>13</b>, such as a diffraction grating or the like. The DEMUX <b>13</b> separates each wavelength <b>12</b> of the fiber input <b>11</b>. Optionally, a plurality of variable optical attenuators (VOAs) <b>14</b> are provided following the DEMUX <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The VOAs <b>14</b> are configured to provide variable optical attenuation to each wavelength <b>12</b>, and the VOAs <b>14</b> can be remotely and dynamically set to a range of values. The WSS <b>10</b> also includes a MEMS mirror <b>15</b> associated with each wavelength <b>12</b>. These MEMS mirrors <b>15</b> are micro-mirrors that deflect each optical signal to an appropriate output port <b>16</b>. Advantageously, the WSS <b>10</b> is fully reconfigurable for adding, dropping, and expressing through optical signals. Because there is a MEMS mirror <b>15</b> for each optical signal, any optical signal can be dropped to any output port <b>16</b>. Additionally, multiple wavelengths, including all wavelengths, can be dropped to a single output port <b>16</b>, such as an express port <b>17</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a series of schematic diagrams illustrating exemplary embodiments of conventional 1&#xd7;9 WSSs <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, such as those used in conjunction with the systems and methods of the present invention. The WSSs <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> are each configured to direct each wavelength from a common input port <b>20</b> to any one of N output ports <b>21</b>. To indicate this device fan out, these devices are typically classified as &#x201c;1&#xd7;N&#x201d; devices, with a &#x201c;1&#xd7;9&#x201d; WSS referring to a 10-port device, with 1 common input port and 9 output ports. For example, WSS <b>18</b> is a 1&#xd7;9 WSS with a common input port <b>20</b>, eight drop ports <b>22</b>, and one express port <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">WSS <b>18</b> can be utilized at a node where up to eight optical signals need to be dropped, with the remaining optical signals passing through as express signals. Alternatively, WSS <b>19</b> utilizes the same hardware configured for a common input port <b>20</b>, four drop ports <b>24</b>, and four express ports <b>25</b>, such as where a node has multiple-degree interconnection. Advantageously, the WSSs <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, as well as other configurations, provide nodal flexibility to add, drop, and express optical signals with the same MEMS-based hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating one exemplary embodiment of a conventional reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (R-OADM) <b>30</b> that utilizes a wavelength-switched architecture and supports wavelength broadcasting, albeit inefficiently by splitting and subsequently regenerating the broadcast wavelength at each instance of broadcast wavelength drop. In the west-to-east direction, the R-OADM <b>30</b> includes a WSS <b>32</b> having an input port <b>34</b> and a plurality of output ports, including output ports <b>1</b>-<b>8</b> <b>36</b> and express port <b>9</b> <b>38</b> in the example illustrated. It will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other configurations could be utilized. Wavelengths associated with a west input <b>40</b> are switched to one or more of output ports <b>1</b>-<b>8</b> <b>36</b> and/or express port <b>9</b> <b>38</b>. Wavelengths can also be switched to a wavelength termination point (i.e. a &#x201c;drop&#x201d; port). Wavelengths switched to express port <b>9</b> <b>38</b> essentially bypass the node and are multiplexed with locally added wavelengths, by combiner L<b>2</b> <b>44</b> for transmission via an east output <b>46</b> to another node, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Wavelengths switched to output ports <b>1</b>-<b>8</b> <b>36</b> are received by one or more subscribers (not shown for output ports <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> <b>36</b>). With regard to broadcast wavelengths, if it is desired to further broadcast these wavelengths to the remaining nodes, the wavelengths are received by corresponding transceiver <b>48</b>, each consisting of a paired receiver <b>50</b> and transmitter <b>52</b>. The wavelengths dropped from output port <b>8</b> <b>36</b> are received by receiver <b>50</b>, and retransmitted by transmitter <b>52</b>. To enable drop and continue of broadcast wavelengths, a splitter <b>53</b> is included to split the optical output of the transmitted <b>52</b> to a local receiver <b>55</b> and a broadcast regenerator consisting of a transceiver <b>48</b> with a receiver <b>50</b> and a transmitter <b>52</b>. The output of the transmitter <b>52</b> is added back through combiner <b>54</b> and subsequently combined with express wavelengths through combiner <b>44</b>. Disadvantageously, this wavelength broadcasting method requires N&#x2212;1 electrical transceivers <b>48</b> to support subscribers at N nodes. This presents monetary expense, space constraints, power consumption problems, and management burdens for the network operator.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The wavelength-switched R-OADM with wavelength broadcasting capability of the present invention incorporates an optical splitting and combining apparatus within its structure such that broadcasting can be carried out without the need for regeneration. Advantageously, the present invention eliminates the need for electrical regenerators <b>48</b> for providing wavelength broadcasting with the wavelength-switched R-OADM.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating one exemplary embodiment of the wavelength-switched R-OADM configuration <b>60</b> with wavelength broadcasting capability of the present invention. The R-OADM configuration <b>60</b> is a degree 2 configuration with a west input/output <b>40</b>,<b>56</b> and an east input/output <b>46</b>,<b>42</b>. In the west-to-east direction, the R-OADM configuration <b>60</b> again includes a WSS <b>32</b> having an input port <b>34</b> and a plurality of output ports, including output ports <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> <b>62</b> and express port <b>9</b> <b>38</b> in the example illustrated. It will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other configurations could be utilized. At each degree, an output port (output port <b>8</b> <b>64</b> in the example illustrated) is designated as a broadcast port. Wavelengths associated with a west input <b>40</b> are switched to one or more of output ports <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> <b>62</b> for locally dropped traffic, express port <b>9</b> <b>38</b> for bypass traffic, and/or broadcast port <b>8</b> <b>64</b> for broadcast traffic. Of course, wavelengths to be received and broadcast are switched to broadcast port <b>8</b> <b>64</b>. The broadcast port <b>8</b> output is then divided by a wavelength-independent power splitter, such as a 1:2 wavelength-independent power splitter <b>66</b>. Additionally, for multi-degree configurations, the wavelength-independent power splitter can utilize a 1:N wavelength splitter where N is the number of degrees in which broadcast is required.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Output A of the 1:2 wavelength-independent power splitter <b>66</b> is applied to demultiplexer L<b>1</b> (DEMUX L<b>1</b>) <b>68</b> to which receivers <b>70</b> are connected for each of the received wavelengths. Output B of the 1:2 wavelength-independent power splitter <b>66</b> is applied to input A of a 2:1 wavelength independent combiner <b>72</b> and are combined with wavelengths associated with the east input <b>42</b>. Wavelengths switched to express port <b>9</b> <b>38</b> essentially bypass the node and are multiplexed with broadcast wavelengths and locally added wavelengths, as appropriate, by MUX L<b>2</b> <b>44</b> for transmission via the east output <b>46</b> to another node, for example. Thus, broadcast wavelengths coming from the west are locally dropped and forwarded to the east with no electrical regeneration and no blocking. The east side of the R-OADM configuration <b>60</b> works in a substantially similar manner to the west side of the R-OADM <b>60</b>. Advantageously, this allows the transponders/regenerators <b>48</b> to be utilized for local add/drop traffic at the R-OADM configuration <b>60</b> or eliminated if not required.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating another exemplary embodiment of the wavelength-switched R-OADM configuration <b>80</b> with wavelength broadcasting capability of the present invention, this exemplary embodiment extending the concepts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to a multi-degree node. In a multi-degree node, there are N fibers (for N degrees) entering the node, and N fibers leaving the node. The broadcast channels in a fiber can potentially be inserted in any or all of the fibers exiting the node in N&#x2212;1 directions as network requirements demand. For illustration purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a single fiber <b>0</b> input <b>82</b> and output <b>84</b> from the R-OADM configuration <b>80</b>. Those of ordinary skill will recognize that the R-OADM configuration <b>80</b> can include additional fibers propagating in other directions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At the fiber <b>0</b> input <b>82</b>, the R-OADM configuration <b>80</b> again includes a WSS <b>32</b> having an input port <b>34</b> and a plurality of output ports, including output ports <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> <b>62</b> and express port <b>9</b> <b>38</b> in the example illustrated. It will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other configurations could be utilized. At each degree requiring broadcast, an output port (output port <b>8</b> <b>64</b> in the example illustrated) is designated as a broadcast port. Wavelengths associated with a fiber <b>0</b> input <b>82</b> are switched to one or more of output ports <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> <b>62</b> for locally dropped non-broadcast channels, express port <b>9</b> <b>38</b> for express non-dropped channels, and/or broadcast port <b>8</b> <b>64</b> for broadcast channels. Of course, wavelengths to be received and broadcast are switched to broadcast port <b>8</b> <b>64</b>. The broadcast port <b>8</b> output is then input to a 1:2 combiner <b>72</b>. The 1:2 combiner <b>72</b> can also receive locally added broadcast traffic on a port from a multiplexer <b>94</b> which receives the locally added broadcast traffic from transmitters <b>96</b>. This allows the addition of locally generated broadcast traffic. The output of the 1:2 combiner <b>72</b> is connected to a 1:N splitter <b>98</b>. One output of the 1:N splitter <b>98</b> is connected to a wavelength selective combiner (WSC) <b>86</b> (input port <b>1</b> <b>88</b> in the example illustrated). Another output of the 1:N splitter <b>98</b> can be utilized for locally dropped broadcast traffic to a demultiplexer <b>100</b> which connects to receivers <b>102</b>. Other outputs from the 1:N splitter <b>98</b> are connected to WSC <b>86</b> ports (not shown) for other degrees in the multi-degree R-OADM configuration <b>80</b>. Note, the 1:2 combiner <b>72</b> may be omitted with the broadcast port <b>8</b> <b>64</b> directly connected to the 1:N splitter <b>98</b> if there are no requirements for locally added broadcast traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is desirable to have the ability to control which broadcast wavelengths get introduced in each fiber direction or degree. This function is implemented using the WSC <b>86</b>. The WSC <b>86</b> utilizes similar hardware as the WSS <b>32</b>, but is configured to perform the inverse function. The WSC <b>86</b> includes a plurality of input ports <b>86</b>,<b>88</b> (illustrated in this example as input port <b>9</b> <b>87</b> and input ports <b>1</b>-<b>8</b> <b>88</b>). The inputs to the plurality of input ports <b>87</b>,<b>88</b> are selectively combined into a common output port <b>90</b>. The WSC <b>86</b> can have one port reserved for local add-drop and express point-to-point traffic (input port <b>9</b> <b>87</b> in the example illustrated receiving the output of express port <b>9</b> <b>38</b> and a combination with locally added non-broadcast channels from a multiplexer/combiner <b>92</b>). The multiplexer/combiner <b>92</b> provides similar functionality as the MUX <b>54</b> and 1:2 combiner <b>72</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and can include similar hardware. Another port on the WSC <b>86</b> can be used to add locally generated broadcast traffic and broadcast traffic from the same fiber (input port <b>1</b> <b>88</b> in the example illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The broadcast traffic from other fiber inputs can be coupled to the plurality of input ports <b>88</b> (input ports <b>2</b>-<b>8</b> <b>88</b> in the example illustrated) of the WSC <b>86</b>. The WSC <b>86</b> is configured to selectively couple all the express traffic and the broadcast traffic from the other degrees to the output <b>90</b> from transport on the fiber <b>0</b> output <b>84</b>. The local broadcast add/drop (through multiplexer <b>94</b> and demultiplexer <b>100</b>) allows the addition of add/drop traffic generated locally. Each fiber pair can have its own local add/drop multiplexers/demultiplexers <b>94</b>,<b>100</b>. This arrangement can preserve the ability to do selective broadcasts and also to regenerate broadcast channels at the node.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating one exemplary embodiment of a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based wavelength selective combiner (WSC) <b>86</b>, such as that used in conjunction with the systems and methods of the present invention. A plurality of input ports <b>87</b>,<b>88</b> are each configured to receive a fiber input including a plurality of wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3bb;<sub>2</sub>, . . . &#x3bb;<sub>n</sub>. Each of the input ports <b>87</b>,<b>88</b> includes a de-multiplexer (DEMUX) <b>110</b>, such as a diffraction grating or the like. The DEMUX <b>110</b> separates each of the plurality of wavelengths for each of the input ports <b>87</b>,<b>88</b>. Optionally, a plurality of variable optical attenuators (VOAs) (not shown) can be provided following the DEMUX <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The WSC <b>86</b> also includes a MEMS mirror <b>15</b> associated with each of the plurality of wavelengths. These MEMS mirrors <b>15</b> are micro-mirrors that deflect each optical signal to a common output port <b>1112</b>. Advantageously, the WSC <b>86</b> is fully reconfigurable for combining optical signals. Because there is a MEMS mirror <b>15</b> for each optical signal, any optical signal can be combined from the input ports <b>87</b>,<b>88</b> to the output port <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The R-OADM configurations <b>60</b>,<b>80</b> presented herein can be implemented in a variety of mechanisms. For example, the combiner and splitter elements described herein can include passive modules located external to a R-OADM circuit pack. Here, the broadcast port of the R-OADM is connected through a fiber connection and the broadcast outputs are connected through a fiber connection to a DEMUX or a receiver as required. Alternatively, the combiner and splitter elements can be integrated into existing R-OADM circuit packs to provide an integrated solution.</p>
