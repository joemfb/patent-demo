<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An embodiment is to include an inverted staggered (bottom gate structure) thin film transistor in which an oxide semiconductor film containing In, Ga, and Zn is used as a semiconductor layer and a buffer layer is provided between the semiconductor layer and a source and drain electrode layers. The buffer layer having higher carrier concentration than the semiconductor layer is provided intentionally between the source and drain electrode layers and the semiconductor layer, whereby an ohmic contact is formed.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device which has a circuit including a thin film transistor (hereinafter, referred to as a TFT) in which a channel formation region is formed using an oxide semiconductor film and a manufacturing method thereof. For example, the present invention relates to an electronic appliance in which an electro-optical device typified by a liquid crystal display panel or a light-emitting display device including an organic light-emitting element is mounted as its component.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Note that the semiconductor device in this specification indicates all the devices which can operate by using semiconductor characteristics, and an electro-optical device, a semiconductor circuit, and an electronic appliance are all included in the semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, active matrix display devices (such as liquid crystal display devices, light-emitting display devices, or electrophoretic display devices) in which a switching element formed of a TFT is provided for each of display pixels arranged in a matrix have been actively developed. In the active matrix display devices, a switching element is provided for each of pixels (or each of dots), and thus, there is such an advantage that the active matrix display devices can be driven at lower voltage than passive matrix display devices in the case where the pixel density is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, a technique has attracted attention, where a thin film transistor (TFT) in which a channel formation region is formed using an oxide semiconductor film, or the like is manufactured and such a TFT or the like is applied to electronic devices or optical devices. For example, a TFT in which zinc oxide (ZnO) is used as an oxide semiconductor film or a TFT in which InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>is used as an oxide semiconductor film can be given. A technique in which a TFT including such an oxide semiconductor film is formed over a light-transmitting substrate and used as a switching element or the like of an image display device, is disclosed in Reference 1 and Reference 2.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">For a thin film transistor in which a channel formation region is formed using an oxide semiconductor film, high speed operation, a comparatively-easy manufacturing process, and sufficient reliability are required.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">In formation of a thin film transistor, a low resistance metal material is used for a source and drain electrodes. In particular, when a display device with a large-area display is manufactured, a problem of signal delay due to resistance of a wiring significantly arises. Accordingly, it is preferable that a metal material with a low electric resistance value be used for a material of a wiring and an electrode. In a thin film transistor having a structure in which an oxide semiconductor film and a source and drain electrodes formed using a metal material with a low electric resistance value are in direct contact with each other, there is a concern that contact resistance increases. One of conceivable reasons for increase of contact resistance is to form Schottky junction in a contact surface between the source and drain electrodes and the oxide semiconductor film.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">In addition, capacitance is formed in a portion where the source and drain electrodes and the oxide semiconductor film have a direct contact with each other, and there are risks that frequency characteristics (called &#x201c;f characteristics&#x201d;) decrease and high speed operation of the thin film transistor is hindered.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">An object is to provide a thin film transistor and a manufacturing method thereof, in which an oxide semiconductor film containing indium (In), gallium (Ga), and zinc (Zn) is used and the contact resistance of a source or drain electrode is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">Another object is to improve operation characteristics and reliability of the thin film transistor in which an oxide semiconductor film containing In, Ga, and Zn is used.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">Further, another object is to reduce variation in electric properties of the thin film transistor in which an oxide semiconductor film containing In, Ga, and Zn is used. In particular, in a liquid crystal display device where variation between elements is large, there is a risk that display unevenness due to variation in the TFT characteristics is caused.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">Further, in a display device including a light-emitting element, in the case where there is large variation in ON current (I on) of TFTs (TFTs provided in a driver circuit or TFTs supplying current to light-emitting elements arranged in pixels) arranged so as to make constant current flow in a pixel electrode, a display screen has a risk of generation of variation in luminance therein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">The present invention aims to achieve at least one of the above-described objects.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">An embodiment of the present invention is an inverted staggered (bottom gate structure) thin film transistor in which an oxide semiconductor film containing In, Ga, and Zn is used as a semiconductor layer and a buffer layer is provided between the semiconductor layer and a source and drain electrode layers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">In this specification, a semiconductor layer formed using an oxide semiconductor film containing In, Ga, and Zn is also referred to as an &#x201c;IGZO semiconductor layer&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">Ohmic contact is needed between the source electrode layer and the IGZO semiconductor layer and moreover, its contact resistance is preferably reduced as much as possible. Similarly, ohmic contact is needed between the drain electrode layer and the IGZO semiconductor layer, and its contact resistance is preferably reduced as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">Thus, a buffer layer with higher carrier concentration than the IGZO semiconductor layer is intentionally provided between the source and drain electrode layers and the IGZO semiconductor layer, so that ohmic contact is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">As the buffer layer, an oxide semiconductor film containing In, Ga, and Zn, which has n-type conductivity (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;n-type oxide semiconductor film&#x201d;) is used. An impurity element imparting n-type conductivity may be contained in the buffer layer. As the impurity element, for example, magnesium, aluminum, titanium, iron, tin, calcium, germanium, scandium, yttrium, zirconium, hafnium, boron, thallium, lead, or the like can be used. When magnesium, aluminum, titanium, or the like is contained in the buffer layer, a blocking effect against oxygen is generated, and oxygen concentration of the semiconductor layer can be kept within an optimal range by heat treatment or the like after film formation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">The buffer layer functions as an n<sup>+</sup> layer and can also be referred to as a source and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">In order to reduce variation in electric properties of the thin film transistor, it is preferable that the IGZO semiconductor layer have an amorphous state.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">An embodiment of a semiconductor device of the present invention includes a thin film transistor which includes a gate electrode layer, a gate insulating layer over the gate electrode layer, a semiconductor layer over the gate insulating layer, a first n-type buffer layer and a second n-type buffer layer over the semiconductor layer, and a source electrode layer over the first n-type buffer layer and a drain electrode layer over the second n-type buffer layer. Each of the semiconductor layer, the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer comprises oxide semiconductor containing indium, gallium, and zinc. Each carrier concentration of the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer is higher than that of the semiconductor layer. The semiconductor layer and the source electrode layer are electrically connected to each other with the first n-type buffer layer interposed therebetween, and the semiconductor layer and the drain electrode layers are electrically connected to each other with the second n-type buffer layer interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">Another embodiment of a semiconductor device of the present invention includes a thin film transistor which includes a gate electrode layer, a gate insulating layer over the gate electrode layer, a semiconductor layer over the gate insulating layer, a first n-type buffer layer and a second n-type buffer layer over the semiconductor layer, and a source electrode layer over the first n-type buffer layer and a drain electrode layer over the second n-type buffer layer. Each of the semiconductor layer, the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer comprises oxide semiconductor layer containing indium, gallium, and zinc. A region of the semiconductor layer between the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer is thinner than a region of the semiconductor layer under the first n-type buffer layer and a region of the semiconductor layer under the second n-type buffer layer. Each carrier concentration of the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer is higher than that of the semiconductor layer. The semiconductor layer and the source electrode layer are electrically connected to each other with the first n-type buffer layer interposed therebetween, and the semiconductor layer and the drain electrode layers are electrically connected to each other with the second n-type buffer layer interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">In the above structure, the thin film transistor further includes a third buffer layer and a fourth buffer layer each having the carrier concentration which is higher than the semiconductor layer but lower than each of the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer may be provided. The third buffer layer is provided between the semiconductor layer and the first n-type buffer layer, and the fourth buffer layer is provided between the semiconductor layer and the second n-type buffer layer. Each of the third buffer layer and the fourth buffer layer functions as an n<sup>&#x2212;</sup> layer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">The oxide semiconductor film (IGZO film) containing In, Ga, and Zn has such a characteristic that the hole mobility becomes higher as the carrier concentration becomes higher. Thus, the carrier concentration and the hole mobility in the oxide semiconductor film containing In, Ga, and Zn have a relation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. It is preferable that an IGZO film appropriate for a channel of a semiconductor layer have a carrier concentration (a concentration range <b>1</b> of a channel) lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>(more preferably, 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or higher) and an IGZO film appropriate for a buffer layer have a carrier concentration (a concentration range <b>2</b> of a buffer layer) of 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or higher (1&#xd7;10<sup>22 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower). In the case of a semiconductor layer, the carrier concentration of the above IGZO film is a value in a condition at room temperature where source, drain, and gate voltages are not applied.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">If the carrier concentration range of the IGZO film for a channel exceeds the above range, a thin film transistor has a risk of being normally on. Thus, with use of the IGZO film within a carrier concentration range disclosed in this specification as a channel of a semiconductor layer, a highly reliable thin film transistor can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">In addition, a titanium film is preferably used as a source and drain electrode layers. For example, a stacked layer of a titanium film, an aluminum film, and a titanium film has low resistance, and hillock is hardly generated in the aluminum film.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">According to an embodiment of a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, a gate electrode layer is formed over a substrate, a gate insulating layer is formed over the gate electrode layer, a semiconductor layer is formed over the gate insulating layer, a first n-type buffer layer and a second n-type buffer layer are formed over the semiconductor layer, and a source electrode layer is formed over the first n-type buffer layer and a drain electrode layer is formed over the second n-type buffer layer. Each of the semiconductor layer, the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer is formed using oxide semiconductor containing indium, gallium, and zinc. Each carrier concentration of the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer is higher than that of the semiconductor layer. The semiconductor layer and the source electrode layer are electrically connected to each other with the first n-type buffer layer interposed therebetween, and the semiconductor layer and the drain electrode layers are electrically connected to each other with the second n-type buffer layer interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">The gate insulating layer, the semiconductor layer, the first n-type buffer layer, the second n-type buffer layer, and the source and drain electrode layers can be successively formed without exposure to air. Successive formation contributes to reduction of defects caused by entry of impurities to be dust into an interface from air.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">The gate insulating layer, the semiconductor layer, the first n-type buffer layer, the second n-type buffer layer, and the source and drain electrode layers may be formed by a sputtering method. It is preferable that the gate insulating layer and the semiconductor layer be formed in an oxygen atmosphere (or an atmosphere which contains oxygen of 90% or higher and a rare gas (argon) of 10% or lower) and that the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer be formed in a rare gas (argon) atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">Successive formation by a sputtering method as described above makes productivity improve and reliability of a thin film interface stable. Further, by forming the gate insulating layer and the semiconductor layer in an oxygen atmosphere so that a large amount of oxygen is contained, it is possible to suppress reduction in reliability due to deterioration, shift of the thin film transistor characteristics toward the normally on side, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">According to an embodiment of a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, a gate electrode layer is formed over a substrate, a gate insulating layer is formed over the gate electrode layer, a semiconductor layer is formed over the gate insulating layer, a first n-type buffer layer and a second n-type buffer layer are formed over the semiconductor layer, and a source electrode layer is formed over the first n-type buffer layer and a drain electrode layer is formed over the second n-type buffer layer. Each of the semiconductor layer, the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer is formed using oxide semiconductor containing indium, gallium, and zinc. Each carrier concentration of the first n-type buffer layer and the second n-type buffer layer is higher than that of the semiconductor layer. The semiconductor layer and the source electrode layer are electrically connected to each other with the first n-type buffer layer interposed therebetween, and the semiconductor layer and the drain electrode layers are electrically connected to each other with the second n-type buffer layer interposed therebetween. The gate insulating layer, the semiconductor layer, the first n-type buffer layer, the second n-type buffer layer and the source and drain electrode layers are successively formed without exposure to air.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a thin film transistor with small photoelectric current, small parasitic capacitance, and high on-off ratio can be obtained, so that a thin film transistor having excellent dynamic characteristics can be manufactured. Therefore, a semiconductor device which includes thin film transistors having high electric properties and high reliability can be provided.</p>

The gate electrode layer <b>101</b> can be formed in such a manner that a conductive film is formed over the substrate <b>100</b> by a sputtering method or a vacuum evaporation method; a mask is formed over the conductive film by a photolithography technique or an inkjet method; and the conductive film is etched using the mask. Alternatively, the gate electrode layer <b>101</b> can be formed by discharging a conductive nanopaste of silver, gold, copper, or the like by an inkjet method and baking it.

<p id="p-0090" num="0090">Note that, because a semiconductor film and a wiring are to be formed over the gate electrode layer <b>101</b>, it is preferable that the gate electrode layer <b>101</b> be processed to have tapered end portions in order to prevent disconnection.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">The gate insulating layer <b>102</b> and the semiconductor film <b>111</b> can be formed successively without exposure to air. By successive formation, each interface between the stacked layers can be formed without being contaminated by atmospheric components or contaminating impurities contained in the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">In an active matrix display device, electric properties of thin film transistors included in a circuit are important, and performance of the display device depends on the electric properties. In particular, the threshold voltage (Vth) is important in the electric properties of the thin film transistor. Even if the field-effect mobility is high, when the threshold voltage value is high or the threshold voltage value is on the minus side it is difficult to control the circuit. When the threshold voltage value is high and the absolute value of the threshold voltage is large in the thin film transistor, the thin film transistor driving at low voltage cannot perform switching function and may be a load. Further, in the case where the threshold voltage value is on the minus side, current tends to flow between the source electrode and the drain electrode even when the gate voltage is 0V; in other words, the thin film transistor tends to be normally on.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">In the case of an n-channel thin film transistor, it is preferable that a channel be formed and drain current begin to flow after the positive voltage is applied as the gate voltage. A transistor in which a channel is not formed unless the driving voltage is increased and a transistor in which a channel is formed and drain current flows even in the case of the negative voltage state are unsuitable for a thin film transistor used in a circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">Thus, it is preferable that a channel be formed at a threshold voltage which is a positive value and as close to 0V as possible, of a gate voltage in a thin film transistor using an oxide semiconductor film containing In, Ga, and Zn.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">An interface of the oxide semiconductor layer, that is, an interface between the oxide semiconductor layer and the gate insulating layer is considered to greatly affect the threshold voltage of the thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">Thus, by formation of the interface in a clean condition, in addition to improving electric properties of the thin film transistor, the manufacturing process can be prevented from being complicated, so that a thin film transistor provided with improved mass productivity and high performance is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">In particular, in the case where moisture from air is present in an interface between the oxide semiconductor layer and the gate insulating layer, problems arise in that the electric properties of the thin film transistor is degraded, the threshold voltages vary, and the thin film transistor tends to be normally on. Successive formation of the oxide semiconductor layer and the gate insulating layer excludes hydrogen compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">Thus, the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> and the semiconductor film <b>111</b> are successively formed under reduced pressure by a sputtering method without exposure to air, whereby a thin film transistor having an excellent interface, reduced leakage current, and high current driving capability can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">Further, the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> and the semiconductor film <b>111</b> which is an oxide semiconductor film containing In, Ga, and Zn are preferably formed in an oxygen atmosphere (or an atmosphere containing oxygen of 90% or higher and a rare gas such as argon or helium of 10% or lower).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">By successive formation with use of a sputtering method in such a manner, productivity is increased and reliability of a thin film interface is stable.

Further, parasitic capacitance is reduced by the buffer layer which is an n-type oxide semiconductor layer containing indium, gallium, and zinc; thus the n-channel TFT described in any one of Embodiments 1 to 4 has high frequency characteristics (referred to as f characteristics). For example, a scan line driver circuit using the n-channel TFT described in any one of Embodiments 1 to 4 can operate at high speed, and thus a frame frequency can be increased and insertion of black images can be realized.</p>

Further, a time ratio grayscale method refers to a driving method by which a period during which a pixel is in a light-emitting state is controlled so that grayscale is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0220">Since the response speed of light-emitting elements is higher than that of liquid crystal elements or the like, the light-emitting elements are more suitable for a time ratio grayscale method than that of liquid-crystal display elements. Specifically, in the case of displaying with a time gray scale method, one frame period is divided into a plurality of subframe periods. Then, in accordance with video signals, the light-emitting element in the pixel is set in a light-emitting state or a non-light-emitting state in each subframe period. By dividing one frame into a plurality of subframes, the total length of time, in which pixels actually emit light in one frame period, can be controlled with video signals so that gray scales are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0221">In the example of the light-emitting display device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, in a case where two TFTs of a switching TFT and a current control TFT are arranged in one pixel, the first scan line driver circuit <b>5402</b> generates a signal which is input to a first scan line serving as a gate wiring of the switching TFT, and the second scan line driver circuit <b>5404</b> generates a signal which is input to a second scan line serving as a gate wiring of the current control TFT; however, one scan line driver circuit may generate both the signal which is input to the first scan line and the signal which is input to the second scan line. In addition, for example, there is a possibility that a plurality of the first scan lines used for controlling the operation of the switching element are provided in each pixel, depending on the number of transistors included in the switching element. In that case, one scan line driver circuit may generate all signals that are input to the plurality of first scan lines, or a plurality of scan line driver circuits may generate signals that are input to the plurality of first scan lines.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0222">In addition, also in the light-emitting display device, a part of the driver circuit that can include n-channel TFTs among driver circuits can be formed over the same substrate as the thin film transistors of the pixel portion. Alternatively, the signal line driver circuit and the scan line driver circuit can be formed using only the n-channel TFTs described in any one of Embodiments 1 to 4.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0223">Moreover, the above-described driver circuit can be used for electronic paper that drives electronic ink using an element electrically connected to a switching element, without being limited to applications to a liquid crystal display device or a light-emitting display device. The electronic paper is also referred to as an electrophoretic display device (electrophoretic display) and has advantages in that it has the same level of readability as plain paper, it has lower power consumption than other display devices, and it can be made thin and lightweight.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0224">Electrophoretic displays can have various modes. Electrophoretic displays contain a plurality of microcapsules dispersed in a solvent or a solute, each microcapsule containing first particles which are positive-charged and second particles which are negative-charged. By applying an electric field to the microcapsules, the particles in the microcapsules are moved in opposite directions to each other and only the color of the particles concentrated on one side is exhibited. Note that the first particles and the second particles each contain pigment and do not move without an electric field. Moreover, the colors of the first particles and the second particles are different from each other (the colors include colorless or achroma).</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0225">In this way, an electrophoretic display is a display that utilizes a so-called dielectrophoretic effect by which a substance that has a high dielectric constant moves to a high-electric field region. An electrophoretic display does not need to use a polarizer and a counter substrate, which are required in a liquid crystal display device, and both the thickness and weight of the electrophoretic display device can be a half of those of a liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0226">A solution in which the aforementioned microcapsules are dispersed throughout a solvent is referred to as electronic ink. This electronic ink can be printed on a surface of glass, plastic, cloth, paper, or the like. Furthermore, by use of a color filter or particles that have a pigment, color display is possible, as well.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0227">In addition, if a plurality of the aforementioned microcapsules are arranged as appropriate over an active matrix substrate so as to be interposed between two electrodes, an active matrix display device can be completed, and display can be performed by application of an electric field to the microcapsules. For example, the active matrix substrate obtained by the thin film transistor described in any one of Embodiments 1 to 4 can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0228">Note that the first particles and the second particles in the microcapsules may each be formed of a single material selected from a conductive material, an insulating material, a semiconductor material, a magnetic material, a liquid crystal material, a ferroelectric material, an electroluminescent material, an electrochromic material, or a magnetophoretic material or formed of a composite material of any of these.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0229">Through the above steps, a highly reliable display device as a semiconductor device can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0230">This embodiment can be combined with any of the other embodiments as appropriate.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Embodiment 6</heading>
<p id="p-0231" num="0231">In this embodiment, a manufacturing example of an inverted staggered thin film transistor is described, in which at least a gate insulating layer and an oxide semiconductor layer are deposited to be stacked successively without being exposed to air. Here, steps up to the successive deposition are described, and steps after the successive deposition may be carried out in accordance with any of Embodiments 1 to 4 to manufacture a thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0232">In this specification, successive deposition is carried out as follows: a substrate to be processed is placed under an atmosphere which is controlled to be vacuum or an inert gas atmosphere (a nitrogen atmosphere or a rare gas atmosphere) at all times without being exposed to a contaminant atmosphere such as air during a process from a first deposition step using a sputtering method to a second deposition step using a sputtering method. By the successive deposition, deposition can be performed while preventing moisture or the like from being attached again to the substrate to be processed which is cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0233">Performing the process from the first deposition step to the second deposition step in the same chamber is within the scope of the successive deposition in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0234">In addition, the following is also within the scope of the successive deposition in this specification: in the case of performing the process from the first deposition step to the second deposition step using plural chambers, the substrate is transferred after the first deposition step to another chamber without being exposed to air and subjected to the second deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0235">Note that between the first deposition step and the second deposition step, a substrate transfer step, an alignment step, a slow-cooling step, a step of heating or cooling the substrate to a temperature which is necessary for the second deposition step, or the like may be provided. Such a process is also within the scope of the successive deposition in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0236">A step in which liquid is used, such as a cleaning step, wet etching, or formation of a resist may be provided between the first deposition step and the second deposition step. This case is not within the scope of the successive deposition in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0237">When films are successively deposited without being exposed to air, a multi-chamber manufacturing apparatus as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0238">At the center of the manufacturing apparatus, a transfer chamber <b>80</b> equipped with a transfer mechanism (typically, a transfer robot <b>81</b>) for transferring a substrate is provided. A cassette chamber <b>82</b> in which a cassette case storing a plurality of substrates carried into and out of the transfer chamber <b>80</b> is set is connected to the transfer chamber <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0239">In addition, a plurality of treatment chambers are connected to the transfer chamber <b>80</b> through gate valves <b>84</b> to <b>88</b>. In this embodiment, an example in which five treatment chambers are connected to the transfer chamber <b>80</b> having a hexagonal top shape is illustrated. Note that, by changing the top shape of the transfer chamber <b>80</b>, the number of treatment chambers which can be connected to the transfer chamber can be changed. For example, three treatment chambers can be connected to a transfer chamber having a tetragonal shape, or seven treatment chambers can be connected to a transfer chamber having an octagonal shape.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0240">At least one treatment chamber among the five treatment chambers is a sputtering chamber in which sputtering is performed. The sputtering chamber is provided with, at least inside the chamber, a sputtering target, a mechanism for applying electric power or a gas introduction means for sputtering the target, a substrate holder for holding a substrate at a predetermined position, and the like. Further, the sputtering chamber is provided with a pressure control means with which the pressure in the chamber is controlled, so that the pressure is reduced in the sputtering chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0241">Examples of a sputtering method include an RF sputtering method in which a high-frequency power source is used for a sputtering power source, a DC sputtering method, and a pulsed DC sputtering method in which a bias is applied in a pulsed manner. An RF sputtering method is mainly used in the case of depositing an insulating film, and a DC sputtering method is mainly used in the case of depositing a metal film.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0242">In addition, there is also a multi-source sputtering apparatus in which a plurality of targets of different materials can be set. With the multi-source sputtering apparatus, films of different materials can be deposited to be stacked in the same chamber, or a plurality of kinds of materials can be deposited by electric discharge at the same time in the same chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0243">In addition, there are a sputtering apparatus provided with a magnet system inside the chamber and used for a magnetron sputtering method, or a sputtering apparatus used for an ECR sputtering method in which plasma generated with the use of microwaves is used without using glow discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0244">In the sputtering chamber of this embodiment, any of various sputtering methods described above is used as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0245">In addition, as a deposition method, there are also a reactive sputtering method in which a target substance and a sputtering gas component are chemically reacted with each other during deposition to form a thin compound film thereof, and a bias sputtering method in which voltage is also applied to a substrate during deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0246">In addition, among the five treatment chambers, one of the other treatment chambers than the sputtering chamber is a heating chamber in which a substrate is preheated or the like before sputtering, a cooling chamber in which a substrate is cooled after sputtering, or a chamber in which plasma treatment is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0247">Next, an example of an operation of the manufacturing apparatus is described.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0248">A substrate cassette storing a substrate <b>94</b> whose deposition target surface faces downward is set in the cassette chamber <b>82</b>, and the cassette chamber <b>82</b> is placed in a reduced pressure state by a vacuum exhaust means provided in the cassette chamber <b>82</b>. In each of the treatment chambers and the transfer chamber <b>80</b>, the pressure is reduced in advance by a vacuum exhaust means provided in each chamber. Accordingly, during transferring the substrate between the treatment chambers, the substrate is not exposed to air and can be kept clean.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0249">Note that at least a gate electrode is provided in advance for the substrate <b>94</b> which is placed so that its deposition target surface faces downward. For example, a base insulating film such as a silicon nitride film or a silicon nitride oxide film may also be provided by a plasma CVD method between the substrate and the gate electrode. When a glass substrate containing alkali metal is used as the substrate <b>94</b>, the base insulating film has an effect of preventing mobile ions of sodium or the like from entering a semiconductor region from the substrate so that variation in electric properties of a TFT can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0250">Here, a substrate over which a silicon nitride film covering the gate electrode is formed by a plasma CVD method to form a first layer of a gate insulating film is used. The silicon nitride film formed by a plasma CVD method is dense, so that generation of pin holes or the like can be suppressed by using this silicon nitride film as the first layer of the gate insulating film. Although this embodiment shows an example in which the gate insulating film has a layered structure, the present invention is not limited thereto, and the gate insulating film may be a single layer or have a layered structure including three or more layers.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0251">Then, the gate valve <b>83</b> is opened and the substrate <b>94</b> which is the first substrate is picked up from the cassette by the transfer robot <b>81</b>. After that, the gate valve <b>84</b> is opened, the substrate <b>94</b> is transferred to a first treatment chamber <b>89</b>, and then, the gate valve <b>84</b> is closed. In the first treatment chamber <b>89</b>, by heating the substrate <b>94</b> by a heater or a lamp, moisture or the like attached to the substrate <b>94</b> is removed. In particular, when the gate insulating film contains moisture, a TFT has a risk of changing its electric properties; therefore, heating before sputtering deposition is effective. In the case where moisture has been sufficiently removed at the time when the substrate is set in the cassette chamber <b>82</b>, this heating treatment is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0252">In addition, plasma treatment may be performed on the surface of the first layer of the gate insulating film by providing a plasma treatment means in the first treatment chamber <b>89</b>. Furthermore, heating for removing moisture may be performed in the cassette chamber <b>82</b> by providing a heating means in the cassette chamber <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0253">Then, the gate valve <b>84</b> is opened and the substrate is transferred to the transfer chamber <b>80</b> by the transfer robot <b>81</b>. After that, the gate valve <b>85</b> is opened and the substrate is transferred to a second treatment chamber <b>90</b>, and the gate valve <b>85</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0254">In this embodiment, the second treatment chamber <b>90</b> is a sputtering chamber in which sputtering is performed using an RF magnetron sputtering method. In the second treatment chamber <b>90</b>, a silicon oxide (SiOx) film is deposited as a second layer of the gate insulating film. As the second layer of the gate insulating film, other than a silicon oxide film, an aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) film, a magnesium oxide (MgOx) film, an aluminum nitride (AlNx) film, an yttrium oxide (YOx) film, or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0255">A small amount of a halogen element such as fluorine or chlorine may be added to the second layer of the gate insulating film so as to immobilize mobile ions of sodium or the like. As a method for adding a small amount of a halogen element, sputtering is performed by introducing a gas containing a halogen element into the chamber. In the case where a gas containing a halogen element is introduced, the exhaust means of the chamber is needed to be provided with an abatement system. The peak of the concentration of a halogen element to be contained in the gate insulating film is measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and is preferably in the range of from 1&#xd7;10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>inclusive.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0256">When the SiOx film is formed, a sputtering method in which artificial quartz is used as a target and a rare gas, typically, argon is used, or a reactive sputtering method in which single crystal silicon is used as a target and chemically reacted with an oxygen gas to obtain a SiOx film can be used. Here, artificial quartz is used as a target, and sputtering is performed in an atmosphere containing only oxygen or an atmosphere containing oxygen of 90% or higher and Ar of 10% or lower so that as much oxygen as possible is contained in a SiOx film. Thus, a SiOx film containing excessive oxygen is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0257">After the SiOx film is deposited, the gate valve <b>85</b> is opened, and the substrate is transferred to the transfer chamber <b>80</b> by the transfer robot <b>81</b> without being exposed to air. Then, the gate valve <b>86</b> is opened, the substrate is transferred to a third treatment chamber <b>91</b>, and the gate valve <b>86</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0258">In this embodiment, the third treatment chamber <b>91</b> is a sputtering chamber in which sputtering is performed using a DC magnetron sputtering method. In the third treatment chamber <b>91</b>, an oxide semiconductor film containing In, Ga, and Zn (IGZO film) is deposited as a semiconductor layer. The IGZO film can be deposited using an oxide semiconductor target containing In, Ga, and Zn, in a rare gas atmosphere or an oxygen atmosphere. Here, an oxide semiconductor containing In, Ga, and Zn is used as a target and sputtering is performed by a pulsed DC sputtering method in an atmosphere containing only oxygen or an atmosphere containing oxygen of 90% or higher and Ar of 10% or lower so that as much oxygen as possible is contained in the IGZO film, whereby an IGZO film containing excessive oxygen is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0259">As described above, the SiOx film containing excessive oxygen and the IGZO film containing excessive oxygen are deposited successively without being exposed to air, whereby an interface state between the films containing excessive oxygen can be stabilized, and the reliability of a TFT can be improved. If the substrate is exposed to air before deposition of the IGZO film, moisture or the like is attached and the interface state is adversely affected, which may cause defects such as variation in threshold voltages, deterioration in electric properties, and a normally-on TFT. Moisture is a hydrogen compound. When the films are successively deposited without being exposed to air, the hydrogen compound can be prevented from existing at the interface. Therefore, by successive deposition, variation in threshold voltages can be reduced, deterioration in electric properties can be prevented, or shift of the TFT characteristics to the normally-on side can be reduced, desirably, the shift of the TFT characteristics can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0260">In addition, in the second treatment chamber <b>90</b> which is a sputtering chamber, both an artificial quartz target and an oxide semiconductor target containing In, Ga, and Zn are placed, and the films are successively deposited by using a shutter; therefore, the films can be stacked in the same chamber. Shutters are provided between the targets and the substrate; one of the shutters is opened for a target which is deposited, and a target which is not deposited is shielded by the other one of the shutters. Advantages of a process in which the films are stacked in the same chamber are the following points: reduction of the number of chambers which are used, and prevention of particles or the like attached to the substrate during transfer of the substrate between different chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0261">Next, the gate valve <b>86</b> is opened and the substrate is transferred to the transfer chamber <b>80</b> by the transfer robot <b>81</b> without being exposed to air.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0262">If a gray-tone mask is not used, the substrate is carried out of the manufacturing apparatus through the cassette chamber at this stage, and the IGZO film containing excessive oxygen is patterned through a photolithography technique. If a gray-tone mask is used, successive deposition described below is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0263">Then, the gate valve <b>87</b> is opened, and the substrate is transferred to a fourth treatment chamber <b>92</b> without being exposed to air. After that, the gate valve <b>87</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0264">In this embodiment, the fourth treatment chamber <b>92</b> is a sputtering chamber in which sputtering is performed using a DC magnetron sputtering method. In the fourth treatment chamber <b>92</b>, sputtering is performed by a pulsed DC sputtering method in an atmosphere containing only a rare gas, so that a second IGZO film that is to be a buffer layer is formed on and in contact with the IGZO film containing excessive oxygen. This second IGZO film has lower oxygen concentration than the IGZO film containing excessive oxygen. Further, the second IGZO film preferably has higher carrier concentration than the IGZO film containing excessive oxygen. As a target, a target in which Mg, Al, or Ti is contained in the oxide semiconductor containing In, Ga, and Zn may be used. Mg, Al, or Ti is a material which easily reacts with oxide, and such a material is contained in the second IGZO film, whereby a blocking effect against oxygen is obtained. Thus, the oxygen concentration in the semiconductor layer can be kept within an optimal range even if heat treatment is performed after deposition. This second IGZO film functions as a source and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0265">Next, the gate valve <b>87</b> is opened, and the substrate is transferred to the transfer chamber <b>80</b> by the transfer robot <b>81</b>. Then, the gate valve <b>88</b> is opened, the substrate is transferred to a fifth treatment chamber <b>93</b>, and the gate valve <b>88</b> is closed. Note that transportation of the substrate is carried out without being exposed to air.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0266">In this embodiment, the fifth treatment chamber <b>93</b> is a sputtering chamber in which sputtering is performed using a DC magnetron sputtering method. In the fifth treatment chamber <b>93</b>, a metal multi-layer film which becomes a source and drain electrode layers is deposited. In the fifth treatment chamber <b>93</b> which is a sputtering chamber, both a titanium target and an aluminum target are placed. The films are deposited to be stacked in the same chamber by successive deposition using a shutter. Here, an aluminum film is stacked over a titanium film, and a titanium film is further stacked over the aluminum film.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0267">As described above, when a gray-tone mask is used, the SiOx film containing excessive oxygen, the IGZO film containing excessive oxygen, the second IGZO film, and the metal multi-layer film can be deposited successively without being exposed to air, whereby an interface state of the IGZO film containing excessive oxygen is particularly stabilized, and the reliability of a TFT can be improved. If the substrate is exposed to air before or after deposition of the IGZO film, moisture or the like is attached and the interface state is adversely affected, which may cause defects such as variation in threshold voltages, deterioration in electric properties, and a normally-on TFT. Moisture is a hydrogen compound. When the films are successively deposited without being exposed to air, the hydrogen compound can be prevented from existing at the interface of the IGZO film. Therefore, by successive deposition of the four layers, variation in threshold voltages can be reduced, deterioration in electric properties can be prevented, or shift of the TFT characteristics to the normally-on side can be reduced, desirably, the shift of the TFT characteristics can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0268">Further, the second IGZO film that is to be a buffer layer and a metal multi-layer film that is to be a source and drain electrode layers are successively formed without exposure to air, whereby a favorable interface between the second IGZO film and the metal multi-layer film can be formed and contact resistance can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0269">Alternatively, an artificial quartz target and an oxide semiconductor target containing In, Ga, and Zn are both placed in the sputtering chamber of the second treatment chamber <b>90</b>, and three layers are successively formed by shifting gases which are sequentially introduced with use of a shutter, so that the layers can be stacked in the same chamber. Advantages of a process in which the films are stacked in the same chamber are the following points: reduction of the number of chambers which are used, and prevention of particles or the like attached to the substrate during transfer of the substrate between different chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0270">After the above-described steps are repeated to perform a deposition process on a plurality of substrates in a cassette case, the vacuum cassette chamber is exposed to air, and the substrate and the cassette are taken out.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0271">Further, heat treatment, specifically, heat treatment at 300&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C., preferably, heat treatment at 350&#xb0; C. or higher can be performed in the first treatment chamber <b>89</b> after deposition of the IGZO film containing excessive oxygen. By such heat treatment, electric properties of an inverted staggered thin film transistor can be improved. Timing of the heat treatment is not limited to a particular timing as long as the heat treatment is performed after deposition of the IGZO film containing excessive oxygen and can be performed right after deposition of the IGZO film containing excessive oxygen or right after deposition of the metal multi-layer film, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0272">Then, each of the stacked films is patterned using a gray-tone mask. The film may be patterned using dry etching or wet etching, or etched by plural times of etching selectively.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0273">Steps after the patterning are carried out in accordance with any one of Embodiments 1 to 4, whereby an inverted staggered thin film transistor can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0274">In this embodiment, a multi-chamber manufacturing apparatus is shown as an example, but an in-line manufacturing apparatus in which sputtering chambers are connected in series may be used and successive deposition may be performed without being exposed to air.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0275">The apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> has a so-called face-down treatment chamber in which the deposition target surface of the substrate faces downward, but may also have a vertical placement treatment chamber in which a substrate is placed vertically. The vertical placement treatment chamber has an advantage that a footprint is smaller than that of a face-down treatment chamber and can be effectively used in the case where a large-area substrate which could be bent due to its weight is used.</p>

<p id="p-0285" num="0285">Alternatively, liquid crystal showing a blue phase for which an alignment film is unnecessary may be used. A blue phase is one of liquid crystal phases, which is generated just before a cholesteric phase changes into an isotropic phase while temperature of cholesteric liquid crystal is increased. Since the blue phase is generated within an only narrow range of temperature, liquid crystal composition containing a chiral agent at 5 wt % so as to improve the temperature range is used for the liquid crystal layer <b>262</b>. The liquid crystal composition which includes liquid crystal showing a blue phase and a chiral agent have such characteristics that the response time is 10 &#x3bc;s to 100 &#x3bc;s, which is small, the alignment process is unnecessary because the liquid crystal composition has optical isotropy, and viewing angle dependency is small.</p>

<p id="p-0288" num="0288">In this embodiment, in order to reduce surface unevenness of the thin film transistor and to improve reliability of the thin film transistor, the thin film transistor obtained by Embodiment 1 is covered with the insulating layers (the insulating layer <b>211</b>, the insulating layer <b>212</b>, and the insulating layer <b>213</b>) functioning as a protective film or a planarizing insulating film. Note that the protective film is provided to prevent entry of contaminant impurities such as an organic substance, a metal substance, or moisture floating in air and is preferably a dense film. The protective film may be formed with a single layer or a stacked layer of a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxynitride film, and/or a silicon nitride oxide film. Alternatively, as the protective film, a silicon oxide film may be formed using a process gas containing an organosilane gas and oxygen by a plasma CVD method.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0289">As examples of organosilane, the following compounds can be given: tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (chemical formula: Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), tetramethylsilane (TMS) (chemical formula: Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS), hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), triethoxysilane (chemical formula: SiH(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>), trisdimethylaminosilane (chemical formula: SiH(N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0290">As a first layer of the protective film, the insulating layer <b>211</b> is formed. The insulating layer <b>211</b> has an effect of preventing hillock of an aluminum film.

The flow rates of TEOS and O<sub>2 </sub>are 15 (sccm) and 750 (sccm), respectively. The substrate temperature in the formation step is 300&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0291">As a second layer of the protective film, the insulating layer <b>212</b> is formed.

For a process gas for forming the silicon nitride film, SiH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2 </sub>are used. The use of the silicon nitride film as one layer of the protective film can prevent mobile ions of sodium or the like from entering a semiconductor region so that variation in electric properties of the TFT can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0292">After the protective film is formed, the IGZO semiconductor layer may be annealed at 300&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0293">The insulating layer <b>213</b> is formed as the planarizing insulating film is formed.

Other than such organic materials, it is also possible to use a low-dielectric constant material (a low-k material), a siloxane-based resin, PSG (phosphosilicate glass), BPSG (borophosphosilicate glass), or the like. A siloxane-based resin may include as a substituent at least one of fluorine, an alkyl group, and an aryl group, as well as hydrogen. Note that the insulating layer <b>213</b> may be formed by stacking a plurality of insulating films formed of these materials.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0294">Note that a siloxane-based resin is a resin formed from a siloxane-based material as a starting material and having the bond of Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Si.

In the case of forming the insulating layer <b>213</b> using a material solution, annealing (300&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C.) of the IGZO semiconductor layer may be performed at the same time of a baking step.

The thin film transistors described in Embodiments 1, 3, or 4 can also be used as the thin film transistor <b>581</b> of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0304">The electronic paper in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is an example of a display device using a twisting ball display system. The twisting ball display system refers to a method in which spherical particles each colored in black and white are arranged between a first electrode layer and a second electrode layer which are electrode layers used for a display element, and a potential difference is generated between the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer to control orientation of the spherical particles, so that display is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0305">The thin film transistor <b>581</b> over a substrate <b>580</b> is an inverted staggered thin film transistor with a multi-gate structure, and a source or drain electrode layer thereof is in contact with a first electrode layer <b>587</b> through an opening formed in insulating layers <b>583</b>, <b>584</b> and <b>585</b>, whereby the thin film transistor <b>581</b> is electrically connected to the first electrode layer <b>587</b>.

<p id="p-0306" num="0306">Further, instead of the twisting ball, an electrophoretic element can also be used. A microcapsule having a diameter of about 10 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m in which transparent liquid, positively charged white microparticles, and negatively charged black microparticles are encapsulated, is used. In the microcapsule which is provided between the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer, when an electric field is applied by the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer, the white microparticles and black microparticles move to opposite sides, so that white or black can be displayed. A display element using this principle is an electrophoretic display element and is called electronic paper in general. The electrophoretic display element has higher reflectance than a liquid crystal display element, and thus, an auxiliary light is unnecessary, power consumption is low, and a display portion can be recognized in a dim place. In addition, even when power is not supplied to the display portion, an image which has been displayed once can be maintained. Accordingly, a displayed image can be stored even if a semiconductor device having a display function (which may be referred to simply as a display device or a semiconductor device provided with a display device) is distanced from an electric wave source.</p>

As a display element included in a display device, a light-emitting element utilizing electroluminescence is described here. Light-emitting elements utilizing electroluminescence are classified according to whether a light-emitting material is an organic compound or an inorganic compound. In general, the former is referred to as an organic EL element, and the latter is referred to as an inorganic EL element.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0310">In an organic EL element, by application of voltage to a light-emitting element, electrons and holes are separately injected from a pair of electrodes into a layer containing a light-emitting organic compound, and current flows. The carriers (electrons and holes) are recombined, and thus, the light-emitting organic compound is excited. The light-emitting organic compound returns to a ground state from the excited state, thereby emitting light. Owing to such a mechanism, this light-emitting element is referred to as a current-excitation light-emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0311">The inorganic EL elements are classified according to their element structures into a dispersion-type inorganic EL element and a thin-film inorganic EL element. A dispersion-type inorganic EL element has a light-emitting layer where particles of a light-emitting material are dispersed in a binder, and its light emission mechanism is donor-acceptor recombination type light emission that utilizes a donor level and an acceptor level. A thin-film inorganic EL element has a structure where a light-emitting layer is sandwiched between dielectric layers, which are further sandwiched between electrodes, and its light emission mechanism is localized type light emission that utilizes inner-shell electron transition of metal ions.

The mobile phone handset <b>1000</b> is provided with a display portion <b>1002</b> incorporated in a housing <b>1001</b>, operation buttons <b>1003</b>, an external connection port <b>1004</b>, a speaker <b>1005</b>, a microphone <b>1006</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0383">When the display portion <b>1002</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is touched with a finger or the like, data can be input into the mobile phone handset <b>1000</b>. Further, operations such as making calls and composing mails can be performed by touching the display portion <b>1002</b> with a finger or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0384">There are mainly three screen modes of the display portion <b>1002</b>. The first mode is a display mode mainly for displaying an image. The second mode is an input mode mainly for inputting data such as text. The third mode is a display-and-input mode in which two modes of the display mode and the input mode are combined.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0385">For example, in the case of making a call or composing a mail, a text input mode mainly for inputting text is selected for the display portion <b>1002</b> so that text displayed on a screen can be inputted. In that case, it is preferable to display a keyboard or number buttons on almost all area of the screen of the display portion <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0386">When a detection device including a sensor for detecting inclination, such as a gyroscope or an acceleration sensor, is provided inside the mobile phone <b>1000</b>, display in the screen of the display portion <b>1002</b> can be automatically switched by determining the direction of the mobile phone <b>1000</b> (whether the mobile phone <b>1000</b> is placed horizontally or vertically for a landscape mode or portrait mode).</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0387">The screen modes are switched by touching the display portion <b>1002</b> or operating the operation buttons <b>1003</b> of the housing <b>1001</b>. Alternatively, the screen modes may be switched depending on the kind of the image displayed on the display portion <b>1002</b>. For example, when a signal of an image displayed on the display portion is the one of moving image data, the screen mode is switched to the display mode. When the signal is the one of text data, the screen mode is switched to the input mode.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0388">Further, in the input mode, when input by touching the display portion <b>1002</b> is not performed for a certain period while a signal detected by the optical sensor in the display portion <b>1002</b> is detected, the screen mode may be controlled so as to be switched from the input mode to the display mode.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0389">The display portion <b>1002</b> may function as an image sensor. For example, an image of the palm print, the fingerprint, or the like is taken by touching the display portion <b>1002</b> with the palm or the finger, whereby personal authentication can be performed. Further, by providing a backlight or sensing light source emitting a near-infrared light for the display portion, an image of a finger vein, a palm vein, or the like can be taken.</p>
