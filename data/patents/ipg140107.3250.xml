<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates generally to capacitors, and more specifically, to capacitors formed as a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Capacitors are used in some form in most integrated circuits and thus formed as semiconductor devices. They are used for a variety of purposes including filters, amplifiers, sample and hold, analog to digital converters, storage devices, power supplies, as well as others. A particular use may have a higher importance on precision and other uses may have a higher importance on the magnitude of capacitance. In all cases though, it is beneficial to have small size and ease of routing the connections to and from the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, regardless of the application, there is a need for additional advancements in providing a capacitor with more efficient routing and/or size.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one aspect, a semiconductor device is formed to make a capacitor structure in which the primary capacitance is formed between an inner electrode and an outer electrode that surrounds the inner electrode. The inner electrode has a lower portion that contacts a first conductive region below the inner electrode and an upper portion that contacts a second conductive region above the inner electrode. A conductive path is thereby established between the upper portion and the lower portion. This is better understood by reference to the drawings and the following written description.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The semiconductor substrate described herein can be any semiconductor material or combinations of materials, such as gallium arsenide, silicon germanium, silicon-on-insulator (SOI), silicon, monocrystalline silicon, the like, and combinations of the above.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a semiconductor device <b>10</b> having a substrate <b>12</b> and a conductive region <b>14</b> at a top surface of substrate <b>12</b>. Conductive region <b>14</b> may be formed by an implant and may be a portion of a current electrode, such as a source or drain, of a transistor. Conductive region <b>14</b> could also be a well tie.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after forming an interlayer dielectric (ILD) <b>16</b>.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after forming a conductive region <b>18</b> at a top surface of ILD <b>16</b> and having at least a portion over conductive region <b>14</b>. Conductive region <b>18</b> may be formed by forming an opening at the surface of ILD <b>16</b>, followed by depositing a metal such as tungsten over the surface of ILD <b>16</b> which would fill the opening, and then performing chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). The result is a top surface that is planar having conductive region <b>18</b> as a portion of the top surface and ILD <b>16</b> as a portion of the top surface. An alternative, which results in a somewhat different structure, is to deposit metal and then pattern it to result in a region above ILD <b>16</b> with the same shape as conductive region <b>18</b>. As is typical of depositions of conductive layers, especially ones that contain metal, there may be multiple layers of different conductive layers. For example, a relatively thin barrier layer may be deposited prior to the main deposition that forms most of conductive region <b>18</b>. The thickness of conductive region <b>18</b> may be approximately 500 Angstroms, but it may be thicker or thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after forming a dielectric layer <b>20</b> that may be comprised of silicon nitride.

Dielectric layer <b>20</b> may have a thickness of about 100 to 200 Angstroms, but may be thicker or thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after forming an opening <b>22</b> in ILD <b>16</b> that is over conductive region <b>14</b>. Opening <b>22</b> can vary in width based on the desired capacitance that is to be obtained. Opening <b>22</b> has a bottom that is spaced from conductive region <b>14</b> by a region <b>24</b> in ILD <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, spacing <b>24</b> may be approximately 200 Angstroms thick. Opening <b>22</b> is preferably aligned with at least one side of conductive region <b>18</b> and leaves a portion of conductive region <b>18</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This remaining portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be referenced as a contact which will be used as a contact of one of the electrodes of the capacitor that is in the process of being formed. Dielectric layer <b>20</b> remains on the top surface of ILD <b>16</b> and conductive region <b>18</b> but is not otherwise present in opening <b>22</b>. If the approach of depositing conductive region <b>18</b> followed by patterned etch is used instead of the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, then the interface with opening <b>22</b> would be the same even though it would extend above the top surface of ILD <b>16</b> on the side of conductive region <b>18</b> away from opening <b>22</b>, and the remaining steps may be the same.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after an anisotropic etch that removes conductive layer <b>26</b> over dielectric layer <b>20</b> and from the bottom of opening <b>22</b>. This leaves conductive layer <b>26</b> on the sidewall of opening <b>22</b>. Dielectric layer <b>20</b> provides an etch stop for this etch of conductive layer <b>26</b>. This allows for an overetch that ensures that conductive layer <b>26</b> is completely removed from over dielectric layer <b>20</b> and from the bottom of opening <b>22</b> without adversely affecting conductive region <b>18</b>. This has the effect of reducing the height of conductive layer <b>26</b> remaining on the sidewall so that a portion of the side of dielectric layer <b>20</b> is exposed where conductive layer <b>26</b> is recessed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after forming a dielectric layer <b>28</b> over dielectric layer <b>20</b>, conductive layer <b>26</b>, and the bottom of opening <b>22</b>. Dielectric layer <b>28</b> may be a high k dielectric layer such as hafnium oxide for enhancing capacitance. Dielectric layer <b>28</b> may have a thickness of about 25 to 100 Angstroms. Due to conductive layer <b>26</b> being recessed, dielectric layer <b>28</b> is a little thicker at that location.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after performing an etch of ILD <b>16</b> where it is exposed at the bottom of opening <b>22</b> to expose conductive region <b>14</b>.

It may be noted that in an alternative embodiment, conductive layer <b>26</b> and dielectric layer <b>28</b> may be sequentially deposited and then anisotropically etched after both layers are deposited. In such an embodiment, a second deposition of a dielectric layer similar to dielectric layer <b>28</b> and subsequent anisotropic etch of the layer may be performed following the etch of ILD <b>16</b> to expose conductive region <b>14</b>.</p>

This removal of the top portion of conductive region <b>18</b> and ILD <b>16</b> also removes dielectric layer <b>20</b> and a top portion of conductive layer <b>26</b>. The removal of the top portion of conductive layer <b>26</b> ensures that even if the top portion of conductive layer <b>26</b> was exposed when conductive layer <b>30</b> was deposited and thus establishing contact between conductive layer <b>26</b> and conductive layer <b>30</b>, that area of contact would be removed by CMP. The result is that after CMP, conductive layer <b>26</b> would not be in contact even if there was physical and thus electrical contact immediately after the deposition of conductive layer <b>30</b>.

Also as a result of performing the CMP, dielectric layer <b>28</b> has a top surface coplanar with the top surface of dielectric layer <b>16</b>, and since dielectric layer <b>28</b> is within an opening, opening <b>22</b>, of dielectric layer <b>16</b>, dielectric layer <b>28</b> may be considered to be within dielectric layer <b>16</b>.</p>
