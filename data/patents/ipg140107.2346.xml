<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A touch screen panel may be used as an input device that selects instructions displayed on a screen (such as an image display device, etc.) using a person's hand or an object to input instructions of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A touch screen panel may be provided on a front face of an image display device to convert positions directly contacting a person's hand or an object into electrical signals. Therefore, the instructions selected at the contact position may be received as the input signals. The touch screen panel may replace a separate input device (such as a keyboard and a mouse) that is operated by being connected with the image display device. Thus, the use field of the touch screen panel is being expanded gradually.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a touch screen panel <b>10</b> according to an embodiment may include a plurality of sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> that are formed on a first surface of the substrate <b>11</b>, metal patterns <b>15</b> that connect the sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to position detection lines (not shown), and an insulating layer <b>16</b> that is formed to cover the sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may be alternately disposed to each other, and may include X sensing patterns <b>12</b> and Y sensing patterns <b>14</b> formed to be connected to each other in one column having the same X coordinates and in one row having the same Y coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the X sensing patterns <b>12</b> may be formed of the plurality of X patterns formed so that the sensing patterns disposed in one column having the same X coordinates along a first direction (column direction) are connected to each other. The Y sensing patterns <b>140</b> may be formed of the plurality of Y patterns formed so that the sensing patterns disposed in one row having the same Y coordinates along a second direction (row direction) are connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The X and Y sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may be interposed between the insulating layer <b>13</b> and formed at different layers. In this case, the X sensing patterns <b>12</b> may be patterned to be connected to each other in a first direction from a patterning step, and the Y sensing patterns <b>140</b> may be patterned to be connected to each other in a second direction. Therefore, a process of forming separate contact holes and connection patterns may be omitted, thereby reducing the number of masks and simplifying the process. In another implementation, the X and Y sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may be formed on the same layer. In this case, any one type of sensing patterns among the X and Y sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may be formed to be connected to each other in the first or second direction at the patterning step, and the other sensing patterns may be connected to each other in the first and second directions at a step of forming the contact hole and the connection pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The metal patterns <b>15</b> may be disposed at an edge region of a region in which the X and Y sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are formed, thereby connecting the X and Y sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to the position detection line (not shown). For example, the metal patterns <b>15</b> may electrically connect the X and Y sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in one column or one row unit to the position detection line, thereby supplying the contact position detection signal to a driving circuit, etc. The insulating layer <b>16</b> may be made of a transparent insulating material covering the sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The touch screen panel may be a capacitive touch screen panel and, when it is touched with a contact object such as a person's hand or a touch stick, etc., the change in capacitance according to the contact position may be transferred to the driving circuit side via the metal patterns <b>15</b> and the position detection line from the sensing patterns <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The change in capacitance may be converted into an electrical signal by an X and Y input processing circuit (not shown), etc., thereby indicating the contact position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an embodiment, the anti-reflection (AR) layer <b>20</b> may be formed on the second surface of the substrate <b>11</b>. The anti-reflection layer <b>20</b> may be formed by applying a liquefied inorganic mixture on the second surface of the substrate <b>11</b> through, e.g., a gravure printing process. The liquefied inorganic mixture may be a solution, suspension, etc. An anti-reflection effect may be maximized using a difference in specific gravity for each component of the inorganic mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The gravure printing process, which is a process that rakes out extra ink by covering ink on a concave plate, transfers ink on the substrate by using a transfer roll. Thus, by using the transfer roll corresponding to an area of the desired substrate, a pattern may be formed by a one-time transfer even in the case of a large-area display device. The term &#x201c;ink&#x201d; means a material to be printed, and in the present embodiment, the liquefied inorganic mixture corresponds to the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the present embodiment, the final anti-reflection layer <b>20</b> may be formed by mixing at least two inorganic materials as a solute, making it into a solution through a solvent and forming it on the second surface of the substrate <b>11</b>, and then removing the solvent through a curing process. It will be appreciated that a solution, suspension, etc., may each be used in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In more detail, when printing the inorganic mixture solution and then performing the curing process thereon, a component having a high specific gravity and a component having low specific gravity among the inorganic materials included in the inorganic mixture may be divided, either partially or completely, such that the layers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> each having a different refractive index are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The layers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> of the anti-reflection layer <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment, which is divided by the specific gravity difference of at least two inorganic materials included in the inorganic mixture solution, may each have a different refractive index.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Since the gravure printing process rakes out extra ink by covering ink on a concave plate and transfers ink on the substrate using a transfer roll, by using the transfer roll corresponding to an area of the desired substrate, a pattern may be formed by one-time transfer even in the case of a large-area display device.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the present embodiment, the inorganic mixture is a mixture of at least two inorganic materials of SiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and ZrO<sub>2</sub>. The refractive index and specific gravity of each inorganic material is described in Table 1. The mixed inorganic materials may have a different refractive index and specific gravity, e.g., the mixture may be a mixture of SiO<sub>2 </sub>as an inorganic material having low refractive index and specific gravity, and TiO<sub>2 </sub>and/or ZrO<sub>2 </sub>as an inorganic material having a high specific gravity. Thus, the inorganic mixture may be a mixture of, e.g., SiO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2 </sub>and ZrO<sub>2</sub>, or SiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and ZrO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the solvent of the inorganic mixture solution may be removed through the curing process to implement the anti-reflection layer <b>20</b>. In more detail, when printing the inorganic mixture solution and then performing the curing process thereon, the component having high specific gravity and the component having low specific gravity among the inorganic materials included in the inorganic mixture may be partially or entirely divided, or separated on average, such that layers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> each having a different refractive index are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The anti-reflection layer <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment has different refractive index by the difference in the specific gravity for each component of the mixed inorganic material.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, as can be appreciated from the foregoing Table 2, the thickness and each refractive index of the first and second layers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> forming the anti-reflection layer may be controlled by controlling a ratio of SiO<sub>2 </sub>having a relatively small specific gravity and TiO<sub>2 </sub>having a relatively large specific gravity with respect to the inorganic mixture. Through this, the optimal combination capable of maximizing the anti-reflection effect suitable for the specific TSP panel may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Generally, a touch screen panel may be attached to the upper portion of a flat display panel, such as a liquid crystal display device, etc., such that the flat display panel has problems such as transmittance degradation and display quality degradation due to surface reflection. Therefore, there is a need to apply a high definition technology to the flat display device to which the touch screen panel is attached. An example of the high definition technology may include an anti-reflection (AR) process. The anti-reflection layer may be formed on one surface of the touch screen panel to reduce the amount of light reflected from the surface of the touch screen panel, thereby making it possible to overcome the defect problem of visibility due to the reflected light.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The anti-reflection layer may be implemented through a repetitive process of sequentially depositing a plurality of inorganic layers having different refractive layers, wherein the deposition process is performed within a high-vacuum chamber. However, when the anti-reflection layer is formed by such a method, the frequency of the occurrence of defects may be increased due to the complicated process, and the manufacturing costs may be increased due to the additional process costs.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In contrast, as described above, embodiments may provide an anti-reflection layer on a surface of the touch screen panel of the inorganic mixture by, e.g., a gravure printing process, and may make it possible to minimize the fabricating costs. Further, the anti-reflection layer may be applied, e.g., printed, only on the necessary region in a pattern, thereby making it possible to form the anti-reflection layer on a mother substrate state, i.e., prior to cutting the original substrate into cell units. In addition, embodiments may implement a plurality of layers using a difference in specific gravities of components of an inorganic mixture when forming the anti-reflection layer, thereby making it possible to maximize the effect of the anti-reflection coating while using a simple process.</p>
