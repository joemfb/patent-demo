<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a cleaning shoe for an agricultural combine. More particularly, it relates to a cleaning shoe having a sieve supported for lateral movement.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is important to evenly distribute harvested crop material across a sieve in a cleaning shoe. Uneven distribution of crop material can reduce the capacity of the cleaning shoe and increase grain loss.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In EP2145530(A2), a cleaning shoe is suspended for fore and aft movement and also is permitted to move laterally. Various means of support are provided to achieve lateral as well as fore-and-aft movement.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In DE 102009000797 (A1), a cleaning shoe is coupled to an oscillating weight that can rotate about a generally vertical axis to produce two dimensional movement in a plurality of directions lying in a horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The arrangements above permit both fore-and-aft and lateral movement of the sieve with respect to the agricultural combine. However, in none of the arrangements is the sieve supported in the cleaning shoe for convenient removal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of this arrangement to provide a sieve adapted for convenient removal from the cleaning shoe while still providing both fore-and-aft and lateral movement of the sieve.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A cleaning shoe frame is supported on a first plurality of hangers for fore-and-aft movement with respect to the body or chassis of an agricultural combine. The cleaning shoe frame supports two fore-and-aft extending rods, each rod being disposed on an opposing side of the cleaning shoe frame. The rods include a second plurality of hangers, each hanger having a proximal end which is fixed to the rod and having a distal end which is coupled to and supports a sieve.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The forward portion of each rod is supported in a front receiver that is fixed to a forward portion of the cleaning shoe frame. The rear portion of the rod is supported in a rear receiver that is fixed to a rear portion of the cleaning shoe frame.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Each of the plurality of rods is supported by its front and rear receivers such that it is rotatable about its longitudinal axis. The front and rear hangers of each rod are fixed to that rod such that when the rod rotates about its longitudinal axis, the distal end of the hangers moves laterally.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a cleaning shoe for an agricultural combine having a body is provided that comprises a cleaning shoe frame; a first plurality of hangers supporting the cleaning shoe frame on the body; a sieve disposed within the cleaning shoe frame; two rods supported on the cleaning shoe frame, wherein each rod is constrained to pivot about a fore-and-aft axis with respect to the cleaning shoe frame; and a second plurality of hangers supported on the rods and coupled to the sieve to support the sieve and constrain the sieve to reciprocate in a lateral direction with respect to the cleaning shoe frame.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The cleaning shoe may further comprise forward bearing mounts disposed on the cleaning shoe frame and coupling a forward portion of the rods to the cleaning shoe frame, wherein the forward bearing mounts constrain the rods to pivot about their respective longitudinal axes at forward ends of the rods. It may further comprise rear bearing mounts disposed on the cleaning shoe frame and coupling a rear portion of the rods to the cleaning shoe frame, wherein the rear bearing mounts constrain the rods to pivot about their respective longitudinal axes at rear ends of the rods. A forward end of each rod may be configured to slidingly engage its corresponding forward bearing mount by movement of said each rod in a forward direction, and further wherein the rods are prevented by the rear bearing mounts from moving rearward and sliding out of the forward bearing mounts. The second plurality of hangers may extend generally downward from the two rods and may be coupled to the sieve underneath a pivotal axis of the two rods.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, a cleaning shoe for an agricultural combine having a body is provided comprising a cleaning shoe frame; a plurality of fore-and-aft reciprocating supports coupled to the body and to the cleaning shoe frame and on which the cleaning shoe frame is suspended inside the body; a generally planar sieve disposed generally horizontally within the cleaning shoe frame; two elongate members extending generally in a fore-and-aft direction, wherein each of the two elongate members is mounted on the cleaning shoe frame for rotational movement with respect to said cleaning shoe frame about a generally horizontal and fore-and-aft extending axis of rotation; and a plurality of laterally reciprocating supports coupling the sieve to each of the two elongate members, whereby the sieve is constrained to laterally reciprocate in a horizontal plane with respect to the cleaning shoe frame.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The cleaning shoe may further comprise forward bearing mounts disposed on the cleaning shoe frame and coupling a forward portion of the two elongate members to the cleaning shoe frame, and the forward bearing mounts may constrain the two elongate members to pivot about their respective longitudinal axes at forward ends of the two elongate members. The cleaning shoe may further comprise rear bearing mounts disposed on the cleaning shoe frame and coupling a rear portion of the two elongate members to the cleaning shoe frame, and the rear bearing mounts may constrain the two elongate members to pivot about their respective longitudinal axes at rear ends of the two elongate members. A forward end of each elongate member may be configured to slidingly engage its corresponding forward bearing mount by movement of said each elongate member in a forward direction, and the two elongate members may be prevented by the rear bearing mounts from moving rearward and sliding out of the forward bearing mounts.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, a cleaning shoe for an agricultural combine having a body is provided comprising a cleaning shoe frame suspended in the body on a plurality of hangers that constrain the cleaning shoe frame to pivot fore-and-aft; and a sieve supported in the cleaning shoe frame on sieve mounts, wherein the sieve mounts are configured to engage and disengage the sieve from the cleaning shoe frame by respective forward and rearward translation of the sieve with respect to the cleaning shoe frame while the cleaning shoe is suspended in the body of the agricultural combine.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The sieve mounts may include at least two forward bearing mounts that engage and support a front portion of the sieve to a front portion of the cleaning shoe frame when the front portion of the sieve is translated forward in the cleaning shoe frame. The sieve mounts may include at least two rear bearing mounts that engage and support a rear portion of the sieve to a rear portion of the cleaning shoe frame. The cleaning shoe may comprise generally horizontal and longitudinally extending left and right sidewalls disposed at respective left and right sides of the cleaning shoe, and the at least two rear bearing mounts may be removably fastened to rear portions of the left and right sidewalls. The rear bearing mounts may prevent the front portion of the sieve from being released from the cleaning shoe frame when the rear bearing mounts are fixed to the left and right sidewalls, and the rear bearing mounts may permit the front portion of the sieve to be released from the cleaning shoe frame when said rear bearing mounts are unfixed from the left and right sidewalls.</p>

The arrangement <b>100</b> includes a cleaning shoe <b>102</b> that is supported on a plurality of hangers <b>104</b> that are pivotally coupled at their proximal ends to the cleaning shoe <b>102</b> and are pivotally coupled at their distal ends to a body or chassis <b>106</b> of the agricultural combine. The hangers constrain the cleaning shoe to pivot in a fore-and-aft direction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A driver <b>108</b> drives the cleaning shoe in fore-and-aft reciprocating movement, shaking the cleaning shoe in a fore-and-aft direction to assist the sieving of crop material (not shown) that is poured into the cleaning shoe. In this embodiment, the driver <b>108</b> includes a rotary motor <b>110</b> to which a proximal end of a crank arm <b>112</b> is coupled. The crank arm <b>112</b> is pivotally coupled to the rotary motor in a position offset from the rotational axis of the motor. This causes the distal end of the crank arm <b>112</b> to drive the cleaning shoe in reciprocating movement in a fore-and-aft direction. The distal end of the crank arm <b>112</b> is pivotally coupled to the cleaning shoe <b>102</b>. The cleaning shoe reciprocates fore-and-aft in a generally horizontal plane. It is constrained in its movement by the plurality of hangers <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cleaning shoe is comprised of a cleaning shoe frame <b>200</b> that is generally U-shaped in plan view having a generally laterally and horizontally extending front member <b>202</b>, a left-side sidewall <b>204</b> and a right-side sidewall <b>206</b> that extend longitudinally and vertically. The left and right sidewalls <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> of the cleaning shoe <b>102</b> are disposed just inside left and right opposing sidewalls <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> of the agricultural combine.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A sieve <b>212</b> is supported on a plurality of hangers <b>214</b>. Hangers <b>214</b> are pivotally coupled to the left and right sides of sieve <b>212</b> at the proximal ends of the hangers <b>214</b>. Hangers <b>214</b> are fixed to left and right side rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> at the distal ends of the hangers <b>214</b>. The hangers <b>214</b> constrain the sieve to pivot transversely with respect to the cleaning shoe frame when the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> oscillate about the respective longitudinal axes of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sieve <b>212</b> includes a sieve frame <b>250</b> generally in the form of a rectangular box having a left side, a right side <b>254</b>, a front side <b>258</b> and a rear side <b>260</b> that support a plurality of laterally extending slats <b>256</b> of conventional design.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The left and right side rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are disposed at the left and right sides of sieve <b>212</b>. The left and right side rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are preferably disposed either just above or just below the sieve <b>212</b> such that the hangers <b>214</b> extend generally downward from the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to the sieve <b>212</b>, as shown herein, and hence the proximal ends of the hangers <b>214</b> are preferably directly below the rotational axis of the rod <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to which the hanger <b>214</b> is fixed, or such that the hangers <b>214</b> extend generally upward from the rods to the sieve <b>212</b> and hence the proximal ends of the hangers <b>214</b> are preferably directly above the rotational axis of the rods to which the hanger <b>214</b> is fixed, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The left and right side rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are disposed generally fore-and-aft and horizontally and pivot about fore-and-aft extending horizontal axes that are parallel to each other and are also disposed in a generally horizontally extending plane. While described as &#x201c;rods&#x201d; herein, both in the specification and in the claims, the term as used herein encompasses any generally horizontal and fore-and-aft extending elongate structure of regular or irregular cross section. The plurality of hangers <b>214</b> are of generally equal length, and thus maintain the sieve in a generally horizontal plane that is parallel to the plane defined by the left and right side rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> has two hangers <b>214</b> that are spaced apart from each other along the length of the rod. The forward hangers <b>214</b> on the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> support the front portion of sieve <b>212</b> and the rear hangers <b>214</b> on the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> support the rear portion of sieve <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The hangers <b>214</b> are fixed to rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> with keys, splines, pins, or similar devices <b>221</b> such that when the rods rotate about their longitudinal axes, the rotational movement is communicated to the hangers <b>214</b> and the hangers <b>214</b> also rotate about the rotational axes. The hangers are preferably fixed to the left and right side rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, such that they cannot move with respect thereto. When one of rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> is oscillated about its longitudinal axis, it drives both hangers <b>214</b> in an oscillating side-to-side motion. In the embodiment shown herein, an oscillating motor <b>219</b> is shown coupled to the right side rod <b>218</b> to drive the right side rod in rotary oscillating motion about the longitudinal axis of right side rod <b>218</b>. The front and rear hangers <b>214</b>, which are coupled at their lower ends to the sieve <b>212</b>, drive the sieve <b>212</b> in the same side-to-side motion. The side-to-side motion of the sieve <b>212</b> then drives the front and rear hangers <b>214</b> on the opposite side of the sieve in a side-to-side motion, which drives the rod <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> on the opposite side of the sieve <b>212</b> in an oscillating or reciprocating motion about its longitudinal axis. In this way, the entire sieve can be evenly and consistently driven in lateral (i.e. side-to-side) oscillations by driving just one of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The sieve <b>212</b> can be readily removed from the cleaning shoe frame <b>200</b> for repair or replacement. The front ends of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are each supported in a front bearing mount <b>220</b> that is fixed to the front member <b>202</b> of the cleaning shoe frame. The front bearing mounts <b>220</b> are of a quick connect type and each defines a rearwardly opening receptacle <b>221</b> permitting the operator to mount and dismount the front ends of rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> by sliding the sieve assembly comprising the sieve <b>212</b>, hanger <b>214</b> and rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> forward into the U-shaped cleaning shoe frame <b>200</b> from the rear of the cleaning shoe frame, and inserting the front ends of rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> into the rearwardly opening receptacles of the front bearing mounts <b>220</b>. The front bearing mounts <b>220</b> support the front ends of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and constrain the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to pivot about their respective longitudinal axes.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Once inserted, the operator then lifts the rear of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> into position and attaches rear portions or of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to the rear left side and rear right side, respectively, of the cleaning shoe frame <b>200</b>. The rear portions of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are supported for pivoting movement on rear left and rear right side locations of the cleaning shoe frame <b>200</b> by inner races of rear bearings <b>217</b> contained in rear bearing mounts <b>230</b> including housings that are releasably fixed as by fasteners <b>231</b>, to the rear left and rear right side locations of the cleaning shoe frame, respectively. The inner races of the bearings <b>217</b> are fixed, as by fasteners <b>232</b>, to the rear portions of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> so as to prevent the forward ends of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> from moving rearward and sliding out of the forward bearing mounts when the rear portions of the rods <b>216</b>,<b>218</b> are attached to the cleaning shoe frame <b>200</b> with the respective rear bearing mounts <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Removal of the sieve <b>212</b> is performed by executing the same procedure in is reverse order: the rear bearing mounts <b>230</b> are respectively released from the rear left and rear right side locations of the cleaning shoe frame <b>200</b>, permitting the operator to slide the sieve assembly, which includes the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> rearward. This rearward movement disconnects the forward ends of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> from the front bearing mounts <b>220</b>. This releases the sieve <b>212</b> from the cleaning shoe frame and permits the sieve <b>212</b> to be withdrawn rearward out of the cleaning shoe frame <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">This arrangement permits the operator to remove, repair and replace the sieve quickly and easily by the expedient of unfastening the rear of the rods <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> from the cleaning shoe frame and sliding the sieve rearward and out of the cleaning shoe frame.</p>
