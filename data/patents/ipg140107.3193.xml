<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a thin film transistor, a manufacturing method thereof, and a display device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As one type of field-effect transistor, a thin film transistor whose channel region is formed using a semiconductor film which is formed over a substrate having an insulating surface is known. Techniques in which amorphous silicon, microcrystalline silicon, or polycrystalline silicon is used for the semiconductor film where the channel region is formed in the thin film transistor have been disclosed. Further, a thin film transistor is disclosed which includes, between a gate insulating layer formed over a gate electrode and source and drain regions, a microcrystalline semiconductor layer and a pair of buffer layers formed over the microcrystalline semiconductor layer and formed of an amorphous semiconductor (see Patent Document 1). A typical application of such a thin film transistor is a liquid crystal television device, in which the thin film transistor has been used as a switching transistor in each pixel in a display screen.</p>

</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A thin film transistor whose channel region is formed using an amorphous or microcrystalline silicon film can be manufactured by a smaller number of steps as compared to a thin film transistor whose channel region is formed using a polycrystalline silicon film, and can be manufactured over a large-sized substrate, which can lead a reduction in manufacturing costs. However, such a thin film transistor whose channel region is formed using the amorphous or microcrystalline silicon film has a problem in that electrical characteristics thereof change depending on temperature or operating time to lower the reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above, an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a highly reliable transistor in which change in electrical characteristics is suppressed. An object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a highly reliable transistor in which change in electrical characteristics is suppressed with high productivity. An object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a display device with less image deterioration over time.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One embodiment of the present invention is an inverted staggered thin film transistor which includes, between a gate insulating film and impurity semiconductor films functioning as source and drain regions, a semiconductor stacked body including a microcrystalline semiconductor region and a pair of amorphous semiconductor regions. In the microcrystalline semiconductor region, the nitrogen concentration on the gate insulating film side is low and the nitrogen concentration in a region in contact with the amorphous semiconductor region is high. Further, an interface between the microcrystalline semiconductor region and the amorphous semiconductor region has unevenness.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One embodiment of the present invention is an inverted staggered thin film transistor which includes the following: a gate electrode; a gate insulating film; impurity semiconductor films functioning as source and drain regions; a semiconductor stacked body provided between the gate insulating film and the impurity semiconductor films; a wiring in contact with the impurity semiconductor films; an insulating film covering the semiconductor stacked body and the wiring; and a back gate electrode formed over the insulating film. The semiconductor stacked body includes a microcrystalline semiconductor region and a pair of amorphous semiconductor regions. In the microcrystalline semiconductor region, the nitrogen concentrations on the gate insulating film side and the insulating film side are low and the nitrogen concentration in a region in contact with the amorphous semiconductor region is high. Further, an interface between the microcrystalline semiconductor region and the amorphous semiconductor region has unevenness.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One embodiment of the present invention is an inverted staggered thin film transistor which includes, between a gate insulating film and impurity semiconductor films functioning as source and drain regions, a semiconductor stacked body including a microcrystalline semiconductor region and a pair of amorphous semiconductor regions. In the microcrystalline semiconductor region which is in contact with the amorphous semiconductor region, a nitrogen concentration profile by secondary ion mass spectrometry is low on the gate insulating film side and marks a peak concentration on the amorphous semiconductor region side. In the microcrystalline semiconductor region which is not in contact with the amorphous semiconductor region, a nitrogen concentration profile by secondary ion mass spectrometry marks no peak concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One embodiment of the present invention is an inverted staggered thin film transistor which includes, between a gate insulating film and impurity semiconductor films functioning as source and drain regions, a semiconductor stacked body including a microcrystalline semiconductor region and a pair of amorphous semiconductor regions. In the microcrystalline semiconductor region which is in contact with the amorphous semiconductor region, a nitrogen concentration profile by secondary ion mass spectrometry is low on the gate insulating film side, increases toward the amorphous semiconductor region, and has the maximum value in the microcrystalline semiconductor region and the amorphous semiconductor region. In the microcrystalline semiconductor region which is not in contact with the amorphous semiconductor region, a nitrogen concentration profile by secondary ion mass spectrometry marks no peak concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The nitrogen concentration is low in a region of the microcrystalline region on the gate insulating film side; thus, defects in that region can be reduced. As a result, the thin film transistor can have improved reliability. Further, an uneven region containing nitrogen is included in the microcrystalline semiconductor regions which overlap with the impurity semiconductor films functioning as the source and drain regions. Thus, resistance in the vertical direction (the film thickness direction) of when voltage is applied between source and drain electrodes in an on state can be lowered. Accordingly, change in the electrical characteristics of the thin film transistor can be reduced while on-state current and field-effect mobility thereof are increased.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the reliability of a thin film transistor can be improved. Further, a highly reliable thin film transistor in which change in electrical characteristics is suppressed can be manufactured with high productivity. In addition, image deterioration over time in a display device can be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A thin film transistor illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes, over a substrate <b>101</b>, a gate electrode <b>103</b> (also referred to as a first gate electrode), a semiconductor stacked body <b>133</b>, a gate insulating film <b>105</b> (also referred to as a first gate insulating film) provided between the gate electrode <b>103</b> and the semiconductor stacked body <b>133</b>, impurity semiconductor films <b>131</b><i>a </i>and <b>131</b><i>b </i>which are in contact with the semiconductor stacked body <b>133</b> and function as source and drain regions, and wirings <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b </i>which are in contact with the impurity semiconductor films <b>131</b><i>a </i>and <b>131</b><i>b</i>.

A back gate electrode <b>139</b> (also referred to as a second gate electrode) may be provided over the insulating film <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The semiconductor stacked body <b>133</b> includes a microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>and a pair of amorphous semiconductor regions <b>133</b><i>b</i>. The microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>has a surface which is in contact with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a first surface) and a surface which faces the first surface and is in contact with the pair of amorphous semiconductor regions <b>133</b><i>b </i>and the insulating film <b>137</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a second surface). The amorphous semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>b </i>has a surface which is in contact with the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>(hereinafter, referred to as a first surface) and a surface which faces the first surface and is in contact with the impurity semiconductor films <b>131</b><i>a </i>and <b>131</b><i>b </i>(hereinafter, referred to as a second surface). A region of the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>which is not covered with the pair of amorphous semiconductor regions <b>133</b><i>b </i>has a concave portion. That region of the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>functions as a channel region.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Note that a microcrystalline semiconductor is a semiconductor having an intermediate structure between an amorphous structure and a crystalline structure (including a single crystal structure and a polycrystalline structure). A microcrystalline semiconductor is a semiconductor having a third state that is stable in terms of free energy and is a crystalline semiconductor having short-range order and lattice distortion, in which column-like or needle-like mixed phase grains having a mixed phase grain size greater than or equal to 2 nm and less than or equal to 200 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 80 nm, more preferably greater than or equal to 20 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm grow in a direction normal to the substrate surface. Therefore, there is a case in which a grain boundary is formed at the interface between the column-like or needle-like mixed phase grains. Note that the mixed phase grain size means the maximum diameter of mixed phase grains in a plane parallel to the substrate surface. Further, the mixed phase grain includes an amorphous silicon region and a crystallite that is a small crystal regarded as a single crystal. In some cases, the mixed phase grain may include a twin crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The Raman spectrum of microcrystalline silicon, which is a typical example of a microcrystalline semiconductor, is located in a lower wave number side than 520 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which represents single crystal silicon. That is, the peak of the Raman spectrum of the microcrystalline silicon exists between 520 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>which represents single crystal silicon and 480 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>which represents amorphous silicon. In addition, microcrystalline silicon includes hydrogen or halogen at 1 at. % or more in order to terminate dangling bonds. Moreover, microcrystalline silicon has increased stability and is preferable when containing a rare gas element such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, or xenon to further enhance lattice distortion. Such a description of the microcrystalline semiconductor is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,409,134.</p>

As a three-layer structure, it is preferable to stack a tungsten film or a tungsten nitride film, an alloy film of aluminum and silicon or an alloy film of aluminum and titanium, and a titanium nitride film or a titanium film.

When the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is formed, glow discharge plasma is generated by application of high-frequency power with a frequency of 3 MHz to 30 MHz, typically 13.56 MHz or 27.12 MHz in the HF band, or high-frequency power with a frequency of approximately 30 MHz to 300 MHz in the VHF band, typically 60 MHz. Alternatively, glow discharge plasma is generated by application of high-frequency power with a microwave of 1 GHz or higher. Note that pulsed oscillation in which high-frequency power is applied in a pulsed manner or continuous oscillation in which high-frequency power is applied continuously can be employed. In addition, by superimposing high-frequency power in the HF band and high-frequency power in the VHF band on each other, unevenness of plasma across a large-sized substrate is also reduced, so that uniformity can be improved and the deposition rate can be increased. When the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is formed at a high frequency of 1 GHz or more with a microwave plasma CVD apparatus, the breakdown voltage between the gate electrode and the drain and source electrodes can be improved, whereby a highly reliable thin film transistor can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further, by forming a silicon oxide film by a CVD method using an organosilane gas as the gate insulating film <b>105</b>, the crystallinity of the semiconductor film which is formed later can be improved, whereby the on-state current and the field-effect mobility of the thin film transistor can be increased. Examples of the organosilane gas include silicon-containing compounds such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (chemical formula: Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), tetramethylsilane (TMS) (chemical formula: Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS), hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), triethoxysilane (SiH(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>), and trisdimethylaminosilane (SiH(N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Subsequently, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is opened and then the substrate is transferred to the transfer chamber <b>253</b> (S<b>203</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). After that, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">After that, the inside of the process chamber <b>255</b> is cleaned (S<b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). The inside of the process chamber <b>255</b> is cleaned in such a manner that a fluorine-based gas such as CF<sub>4</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, or the like is introduced into the process chamber <b>255</b> and glow discharge plasma is generated, whereby the gate insulating film attached to the inner wall of the process chamber <b>255</b> is etched by a highly reactive fluorine radical. Alternatively, the gate insulating film attached to the inner wall of the process chamber <b>255</b> can be removed by filling the process chamber <b>255</b> with highly reactive ClF<sub>3</sub>. Accordingly, the impurity concentration and nitrogen concentration in the process chamber <b>255</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Then, a protective film is formed on the inner wall of the process chamber <b>255</b> (S<b>205</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). It is preferable that a film formed of an element that does not serve as an impurity in a microcrystalline semiconductor film be formed as the protective film; typically, an amorphous silicon film, a microcrystalline silicon film, or the like is formed. By formation of the protective film on the inner wall of the process chamber <b>255</b>, mixture of a component of the process chamber or the gas used for cleaning into the microcrystalline semiconductor film can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Subsequently, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is opened and then the substrate is transferred to the process chamber <b>255</b> (S<b>206</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). After that, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is closed. Then, the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> is formed over the gate insulating film <b>105</b> (S<b>207</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">By providing the step of cleaning the inside of the process chamber and the step of forming the protective film between the formation step of the gate insulating film <b>105</b> and the formation step of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, mixture of impurities into the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be suppressed. Especially when a nitride insulating film is used for the gate insulating film <b>105</b> and the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> is formed in the process chamber <b>255</b> in which the nitride insulating film remains, the nitride insulating film is exposed to the plasma and nitrogen floats in the process chamber <b>255</b>. When the microcrystalline semiconductor film is formed under that condition, the nitrogen is mixed into the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b>. On the other hand, in the case where cleaning of the inside of the process chamber <b>255</b> and formation of the protective film on the inner wall of the process chamber <b>255</b> are performed after the substrate is transferred from the process chamber <b>255</b> to the transfer chamber <b>253</b>, the nitrogen concentration of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> is formed in a reaction chamber of a plasma CVD apparatus by glow discharge plasma using a mixture of hydrogen and a deposition gas containing silicon or germanium. Alternatively, the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> may be formed by glow discharge plasma using a mixture of hydrogen, a deposition gas containing silicon or germanium, and a rare gas such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, or xenon. Here, microcrystalline silicon, microcrystalline silicon-germanium, or the like is formed under a condition where the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium is diluted with hydrogen whose flow rate is greater than or equal to 50 times and less than or equal to 1000 times that of the deposition gas. The deposition temperature is preferably room temperature to 350&#xb0; C., more preferably 150&#xb0; C. to 280&#xb0; C. The distance between the upper electrode and the lower electrode is set to a distance which allows generation of plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Typical examples of the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium include SiH<sub>4</sub>, Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, GeH<sub>4</sub>, and Ge<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">When a rare gas such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, or xenon is added to a source gas of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b>, the deposition rate of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be increased. When the deposition rate is increased, the amount of impurities mixed into the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be reduced. Accordingly, the crystallinity of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be improved. By using a rare gas such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, or xenon for the source gas of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b>, stable plasma can be generated without application of high power. Therefore, plasma damage to the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be reduced and the crystallinity of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">For generation of glow discharge plasma in the formation step of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> by a CVD method, the generation condition of the glow discharge plasma which is described related to the gate insulating film <b>105</b> can be employed as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Note that before the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> is formed, a deposition gas containing silicon or germanium may be introduced into the process chamber of the CVD apparatus while the gas in the process chamber is discharged so that impurities in the process chamber can be removed. Thus, the amount of the impurities in the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a semiconductor film <b>111</b> is formed over the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b>. The semiconductor film <b>111</b> includes a microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>111</b><i>a </i>and an amorphous semiconductor region <b>111</b><i>b</i>. Then, an impurity semiconductor film <b>113</b> is formed over the semiconductor film <b>111</b>. Then, a mask <b>115</b> is formed of a resist over the impurity semiconductor film <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The semiconductor film <b>111</b> including the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the amorphous semiconductor region <b>111</b><i>b </i>can be formed under a condition which causes partial crystal growth using the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> as a seed crystal (a condition under which the crystal growth is suppressed).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The semiconductor film <b>111</b> is formed in the process chamber of the plasma CVD apparatus by glow discharge plasma using a mixture of hydrogen, a gas containing nitrogen, and the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium. Examples of the gas containing nitrogen include ammonia, nitrogen, nitrogen fluoride, nitrogen chloride, chloroamine, fluoroamine, and the like. Glow discharge plasma can be generated as in the case of the gate insulating film <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In this case, the flow ratio of hydrogen and the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium is set so as to allow the formation of a microcrystalline semiconductor film as in the case of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b>, and a gas containing nitrogen is further used for the source gas, whereby crystal growth can be suppressed as compared to the deposition condition for the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b>. Specifically, since a gas containing nitrogen is included in the source gas, the crystal growth is partly suppressed at an early stage of the deposition of the semiconductor film <b>111</b>; thus, a conical or pyramidal microcrystalline semiconductor region grows, and an amorphous semiconductor region is formed. Furthermore, at a middle stage or a later stage of the deposition, the crystal growth of the conical or pyramidal microcrystalline semiconductor region stops, and only the amorphous semiconductor region is deposited. As a result, in the semiconductor film <b>111</b>, the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the amorphous semiconductor region <b>111</b><i>b </i>which is formed using a well-ordered semiconductor film having fewer defects and a steep tail of a level at a band edge in the valence band, can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Here, a typical example of a condition for forming the semiconductor film <b>111</b> is a condition where the flow rate of hydrogen is 10 times to 2000 times, preferably 10 times to 200 times that of the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium. Note that in a typical example of a condition for forming a normal amorphous semiconductor layer, the flow rate of hydrogen is 0 times to 5 times that of the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">By adding a rare gas such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, or xenon to the source gas of the semiconductor film <b>111</b>, the deposition rate can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The thickness of the semiconductor film <b>111</b> is preferably 50 nm to 350 nm, more preferably 120 nm to 250 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Here, the semiconductor film <b>111</b> including the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the amorphous semiconductor region <b>111</b><i>b </i>is formed using the source gas including the gas containing nitrogen. Alternatively, the semiconductor film <b>111</b> including the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the amorphous semiconductor region <b>111</b><i>b </i>can be formed in the following manner: the surface of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> is exposed to a gas containing nitrogen so that nitrogen is adsorbed to the surface of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b>, and then film deposition is performed using hydrogen and a deposition gas containing silicon or germanium as a source gas.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The impurity semiconductor film <b>113</b> is formed in a reaction chamber of the plasma CVD apparatus by glow discharge plasma using a mixture of hydrogen, phosphine (diluted with hydrogen or silane), and a deposition gas containing silicon, whereby amorphous silicon to which phosphorus is added or microcrystalline silicon to which phosphorus is added is formed. In the case of manufacturing a p-channel thin film transistor, the impurity semiconductor film <b>113</b> may be formed using glow discharge plasma using diborane instead of phosphine.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Further, in the case where the impurity semiconductor film <b>113</b> is formed using microcrystalline silicon to which phosphorus is added or microcrystalline silicon to which boron is added, a microcrystalline semiconductor film, typically a microcrystalline silicon film, is formed between the semiconductor film <b>111</b> and the impurity semiconductor film <b>113</b>, so that characteristics of the interface can be improved. As a result, resistance generated at the interface between the impurity semiconductor film <b>113</b> and the semiconductor film <b>111</b> can be reduced. Therefore, the amount of current flowing through the source region, the semiconductor film, and the drain region of the thin film transistor can be increased and the on-state current and the field-effect mobility can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The mask <b>115</b> formed of a resist can be formed by a photolithography process.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Next, the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b>, the semiconductor film <b>111</b>, and the impurity semiconductor film <b>113</b> are etched using the mask <b>115</b> formed of a resist. By this step, the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b>, the semiconductor film <b>111</b>, and the impurity semiconductor film <b>113</b> are divided into elements, whereby a semiconductor stacked body <b>117</b> and an impurity semiconductor film <b>121</b> are formed.

Then, the mask <b>115</b> formed of a resist is removed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Next, a conductive film <b>127</b> is formed over the impurity semiconductor film <b>121</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). The conductive film <b>127</b> is formed by a CVD method, a sputtering method, or a vacuum evaporation method. Alternatively, the conductive film <b>127</b> may be formed by discharging a conductive nanopaste of silver, gold, copper, or the like by a screen printing method, an inkjet method, or the like and baking the conductive nanopaste.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Then, a mask is formed of a resist by a photolithography process, and the conductive film <b>127</b> is etched with the use of the mask formed of a resist, whereby the wirings <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b </i>serving as a source electrode and a drain electrode are formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). The etching of the conductive film <b>127</b> may be either dry etching or wet etching.

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Then, the impurity semiconductor film <b>121</b> and the semiconductor stacked body <b>117</b> are partly etched, whereby the impurity semiconductor films <b>131</b><i>a </i>and <b>131</b><i>b </i>serving as a source and drain regions are formed. Further, the semiconductor stacked body <b>133</b> including the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the pair of amorphous semiconductor regions <b>133</b><i>b </i>is formed. At this point, the semiconductor stacked body <b>117</b> is etched so that the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>has a concave portion and the microcrystalline semiconductor region containing nitrogen is removed, whereby the semiconductor stacked body <b>133</b> having the following structure is formed: in regions which are covered with the wirings <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b</i>, the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the amorphous semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>b </i>are stacked, and in a region which is covered with neither the wiring <b>129</b><i>a </i>nor the wiring <b>129</b><i>b </i>and overlaps with the gate electrode, the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>is exposed. The exposed portion of the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>at that time is flat.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Here, ends of the wirings <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b </i>are aligned with ends of the impurity semiconductor films <b>131</b><i>a </i>and <b>131</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Next, dry etching may be performed. The dry etching is performed under a condition where the exposed microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the exposed amorphous semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>b </i>are not damaged and the etching rates of the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the amorphous semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>b </i>are low. As an etching gas, Cl<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, or the like is typically used. There is no particular limitation on an etching method, and an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) method, a capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) method, an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) method, a reactive ion etching (RIE) method, or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Then, the surfaces of the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the amorphous semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>b </i>are subjected to plasma treatment typified by water plasma treatment, oxygen plasma treatment, ozone plasma treatment, N<sub>2</sub>O plasma treatment, plasma treatment using an oxidizing gas atmosphere, an example of which is plasma treatment using a mixed gas of oxygen and hydrogen, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Water plasma treatment can be performed in such a manner that a gas containing water as a main component typified by water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O vapor) is introduced into a reaction space and plasma is generated.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As described above, after the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the amorphous semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>b </i>are formed, dry etching is additionally performed under a condition where the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the amorphous semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>b </i>are not damaged, whereby an impurity such as a residue over the exposed microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the exposed amorphous semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>b </i>can be removed. Further, the dry etching may be followed by water plasma treatment or plasma treatment using a mixed gas of hydrogen and oxygen, whereby a residue of the mask formed of a resist can be removed and defects of the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>can be reduced. Further, by the plasma treatment using an oxidizing gas atmosphere, an oxide insulating film can be formed on a surface of the microcrystalline semiconductor region on the insulating film <b>137</b> side, thereby ensuring insulation between the source region and the drain region; accordingly, in the resulting thin film transistor, off-state current can be reduced and a variation in electrical characteristics can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Note that the mask is formed of a resist by a photolithography process over the conductive film <b>127</b>, and the conductive film <b>127</b> is etched using the mask; whereby the wirings <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b </i>serving as the source and drain electrodes are formed. Then, the impurity semiconductor film <b>121</b> is etched, whereby the impurity semiconductor films <b>131</b><i>a </i>and <b>131</b><i>b </i>serving as the source and drain regions are formed.

In the case where a mixed gas of oxygen, HBr, and at least one of CF<sub>4</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, and SF<sub>6 </sub>is used as an etching gas of the above etching step, a residue to be generated in the etching can be reduced, which can lead to a reduction in a variation in electric characteristics of the thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Further, since the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>117</b><i>a </i>is covered with the amorphous semiconductor region <b>117</b><i>b </i>in the step of removing the mask formed of a resist, the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>117</b><i>a </i>is prevented from being in contact with a resist stripper and a residue of the resist. Further, since the amorphous semiconductor region <b>117</b><i>b </i>is etched using the wirings <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b </i>to expose the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>after the mask formed of a resist is removed, the amorphous semiconductor region which is in contact with the resist stripper and a residue of the resist is not left in a back channel. Consequently, leakage current due to the resist stripper and the residue of the resist left in the back channel is not generated, which can further reduce the off-state current of the thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Through the above process, a single-gate thin film transistor can be manufactured.

Thus, the threshold voltage of the thin film transistor can be controlled. Further, regions in which carriers flow, that is, channel regions are formed on the gate insulating film <b>105</b> side and on the insulating film <b>137</b> side in the microcrystalline semiconductor region; thus, the on-state current of the thin film transistor can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the back gate electrode <b>139</b> can be connected to the gate electrode <b>103</b>.

In this case, potential applied to the back gate electrode <b>139</b> and potential applied to the gate electrode <b>103</b> are equal to each other. Therefore, regions in which carriers flow in a semiconductor film, that is, channel regions are formed on the gate insulating film <b>105</b> side and on the insulating film <b>137</b> side in the microcrystalline semiconductor region; thus, the on-state current of the thin film transistor can be increased.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In this embodiment, since cleaning of the inside of the process chamber and formation of the protective film are performed before the microcrystalline semiconductor film is formed over the gate insulating film, the nitrogen concentration of the microcrystalline semiconductor film in contact with the gate insulating film can be reduced. In the thin film transistor described in this embodiment, the nitrogen concentration is low in regions of the microcrystalline semiconductor region to be the channel region, which are on the gate insulating film side and the insulating film side; thus, defects in those regions can be reduced. Thus, the thin film transistor can have improved reliability. Further, the microcrystalline semiconductor region having a conical or pyramidal shape and containing nitrogen is included in the microcrystalline semiconductor regions which overlap with the impurity semiconductor films functioning as the source and drain regions. Thus, resistance in the vertical direction (the film thickness direction) of when voltage is applied between the source and drain electrodes in an on state can be lowered. Further, tunnel current does not easily flow and the off-state current can be reduced because the amorphous semiconductor region containing nitrogen which is a well-ordered semiconductor having fewer defects and a steep tail of a level at a band edge in the valence band is provided between the microcrystalline semiconductor region and the impurity semiconductor film.

This embodiment is different from Embodiment 1 in that a so-called multi-chamber CVD apparatus, which is provided with a plurality of process chambers, is used for forming a gate insulating film and a microcrystalline semiconductor film.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a schematic diagram of a CVD apparatus and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a process from and including a step for depositing the gate insulating film to and including a step for depositing the microcrystalline semiconductor film.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The schematic diagram of the CVD apparatus is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. The CVD apparatus includes the load lock chamber <b>251</b>, the transfer chamber <b>253</b>, a first process chamber <b>265</b>, and a second process chamber <b>267</b>. The gate valve <b>257</b><i>a </i>is provided between the load lock chamber <b>251</b> and the transfer chamber <b>253</b>, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is provided between the transfer chamber <b>253</b> and the first process chamber <b>265</b>, and a gate valve <b>257</b><i>c </i>is provided between the transfer chamber <b>253</b> and the second process chamber <b>267</b>.

<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Similarly to Embodiment 1, the substrate <b>101</b> with the gate electrode <b>103</b> is set in a cassette of the load lock chamber <b>251</b> of the CVD apparatus and transferred to the first process chamber <b>265</b> through the transfer chamber <b>253</b> (S<b>201</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). After that, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is closed.

<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Subsequently, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is opened and then the substrate is transferred to the process chamber <b>253</b> (S<b>203</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). After that, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Subsequently, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>c </i>is opened and then the substrate is transferred to the second process chamber <b>267</b> (S<b>211</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). After that, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>c </i>is closed. Then, the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> is formed over the gate insulating film <b>105</b> (S<b>212</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In this embodiment, the first process chamber <b>265</b> is a process chamber in which only the gate insulating film is formed; the second process chamber <b>267</b> is a process chamber in which only the microcrystalline semiconductor film is formed. By forming the gate insulating film <b>105</b> and the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> in different process chambers, mixture of impurities into the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be suppressed. Thus, the nitrogen concentration of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be reduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In this embodiment, a method is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, by which the concentration of nitrogen contained in a microcrystalline semiconductor film can be further reduced as compared to Embodiments 1 and 2. Note that in this embodiment, description is made using Embodiment 1; however, this embodiment can also be applied to Embodiment 2 as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Similarly to Embodiment 1, the substrate <b>101</b> with the gate electrode <b>103</b> is set in a cassette of the load lock chamber <b>251</b> of the CVD apparatus and transferred to the process chamber <b>255</b> through the transfer chamber <b>253</b> (S<b>201</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). After that, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is closed. Then, similarly to Embodiment 1, the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is formed over the substrate <b>101</b> and the gate electrode <b>103</b> (S<b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Then, an oxidizing gas is introduced into the process chamber <b>255</b>, and then glow discharge is generated to expose a surface of the gate insulating film <b>105</b> to oxygen plasma, so that an oxide insulating film is formed on the surface of the gate insulating film <b>105</b> (S<b>221</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). As the oxide insulating film, a silicon oxide film, an aluminum oxide film, or the like can be given.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Examples of the oxidizing gas include oxygen, ozone, dinitrogen monoxide, water vapor, and a mixed gas of oxygen and hydrogen. By forming the oxide insulating film on the surface of the gate insulating film <b>105</b> by exposure of the gate insulating film <b>105</b> to the oxygen plasma, nitrogen or other impurities can be prevented from being desorbed from the gate insulating film <b>105</b> to the inside of the process chamber in a later step of forming the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b>. Thus, the nitrogen concentration of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be further reduced. Further, the nitrogen concentration of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be still further reduced in the case where plasma is generated in an atmosphere of a gas containing no nitrogen, examples of which are oxygen, ozone, water vapor, and a mixed gas of oxygen and hydrogen, because an oxide insulating film with a reduced nitrogen concentration can be formed on the surface of the gate insulating film <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Subsequently, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is opened and then the substrate is transferred to the transfer chamber <b>253</b> (S<b>203</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). After that, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Then, similarly to Embodiment 1, the inside of the process chamber <b>255</b> is cleaned (S<b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Then, a protective film is formed on the inner wall of the process chamber <b>255</b> (S<b>205</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Subsequently, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is opened and then the substrate is transferred to the process chamber <b>255</b> (S<b>206</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). After that, the gate valve <b>257</b><i>b </i>is closed.</p>

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In this embodiment, the oxide insulating film serving as a protective film can be formed on the surface of the gate insulating film by performing the oxygen plasma treatment on the surface of the gate insulating film; thus, mixture of impurities into the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be suppressed.

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In this embodiment, a method for forming a microcrystalline semiconductor film in which mixed phase grains are more densely formed as compared to the microcrystalline semiconductor films in Embodiments 1 to 3 is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, similarly to Embodiment 1, the gate electrode <b>103</b> is formed over the substrate <b>101</b> and the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is formed over the substrate <b>101</b> and the gate electrode <b>103</b>. Then, the seed crystal <b>107</b> is formed over the gate insulating film <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The seed crystal <b>107</b> is formed using a microcrystalline semiconductor film typified by a microcrystalline silicon film, a microcrystalline silicon germanium film, or the like. The seed crystal <b>107</b> may be in a state in which mixed phase grains are dispersed, in which mixed phase grains are continuously provided and form a film, or in which mixed phase grains and an amorphous semiconductor are continuously provided and form a film. The seed crystal <b>107</b> may have a space between adjacent mixed phase grains without the mixed phase grains being in contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The seed crystal <b>107</b> is formed in a reaction chamber of a plasma CVD apparatus by glow discharge plasma using a mixture of hydrogen and a deposition gas containing silicon or germanium, under a condition by which the crystallinity is increased. Alternatively, the seed crystal <b>107</b> is formed by glow discharge plasma using a mixture of hydrogen, a deposition gas containing silicon or germanium, and a rare gas such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, or xenon. Here, microcrystalline silicon, microcrystalline silicon germanium, or the like is formed under a condition where the flow rate of hydrogen is greater than or equal to 50 times and less than or equal to 1000 times that of the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium so that the deposition gas is diluted, and the pressure in the process chamber is greater than or equal to 67 Pa and less than or equal to 13332 Pa (greater than or equal to 0.5 Torr and less than or equal to 100 Torr). The deposition temperature at this time is preferably room temperature to 350&#xb0; C., more preferably 150&#xb0; C. to 280&#xb0; C. The distance between an upper electrode and a lower electrode is set to a distance which allows generation of plasma. With the condition by which the crystallinity is increased, crystal growth is promoted and the crystallinity of the mixed phase grain is improved. That is, the size of the crystallite included in the mixed phase grain is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">When a rare gas such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, or xenon is added to a source gas of the seed crystal <b>107</b>, the deposition rate of the seed crystal <b>107</b> is increased. When the deposition rate is increased, the amount of impurities mixed into the seed crystal <b>107</b> can be reduced. Accordingly, the crystallinity of the seed crystal <b>107</b> can be improved. By using a rare gas such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, or xenon for the source gas of the seed crystal <b>107</b>, stable plasma can be generated without application of high power. Therefore, plasma damage to the seed crystal <b>107</b> can be reduced and the crystallinity of the mixed phase grains can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">For generation of glow discharge plasma in the formation of the seed crystal <b>107</b>, the condition of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> can be employed as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, a microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> is formed over the seed crystal <b>107</b>. The microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> is formed under a condition which allows crystals of mixed phase grains to grow so that the space between the mixed phase grains is filled. Note that the thickness of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> is preferably greater than or equal to 30 nm and less than or equal to 100 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> is formed in the reaction chamber of the plasma CVD apparatus by glow discharge plasma using a mixture of hydrogen and a deposition gas containing silicon or germanium, and setting the pressure in the process chamber to greater than or equal to 1333 Pa and less than or equal to 13332 Pa (greater than or equal to 10 Torr and less than or equal to 100 Torr). Alternatively, the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> may be formed by glow discharge plasma using a mixture of a source gas and a rare gas such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, or xenon, and setting the pressure in the process chamber to greater than or equal to 1333 Pa and less than or equal to 13332 Pa (greater than or equal to 10 Torr and less than or equal to 100 Torr). Note that the flow ratio of hydrogen and the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium may be periodically increased and decreased, and the pressure in the process chamber may be greater than or equal to 1333 Pa and less than or equal to 13332 Pa (greater than or equal to 10 Torr and less than or equal to 100 Torr).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Microcrystalline silicon, microcrystalline silicon germanium, or the like is formed under a condition by which the space between the seed crystals <b>107</b> is filled and also the crystal growth is promoted. As a result, in the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b>, the ratio of the crystal regions to the amorphous semiconductor is increased and the space between the mixed phase grains is reduced, whereby the crystallinity is improved. The deposition temperature at this time is preferably room temperature to 350&#xb0; C., more preferably 150&#xb0; C. to 280&#xb0; C. The distance between the upper electrode and the lower electrode is set to a distance which allows generation of plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The condition for generating glow discharge plasma in the formation of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>109</b> described in Embodiment 1 can be employed as appropriate for generating glow discharge plasma in the formation of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b>. In the case where the condition for generating glow discharge plasma in the formation of the seed crystal <b>107</b> and that in the formation of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> are the same, throughput can be increased. Note that the conditions may be different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">When the deposition condition of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> is set as follows, owing to the high pressure in the process chamber, a mean free path of the deposition gas becomes short and the energy of plasma ions is reduced, which leads to improvement of the coverage with the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b>, a reduction in ion damage to the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b>, and a reduction in defects: the flow rate of hydrogen is greater than or equal to 100 times and less than or equal to 2000 times that of a deposition gas containing silicon or germanium so that the deposition gas is diluted, and the pressure in the process chamber is greater than or equal to 1333 Pa and less than or equal to 13332 Pa (greater than or equal to 10 Torr and less than or equal to 100 Torr). Further, under the above condition, since the dilution ratio of the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium is high and the amount of generated hydrogen radicals is increased, the crystal grows using the crystallite in the mixed phase grain as a seed crystal while the amorphous semiconductor region is etched. As a result, in the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b>, the ratio of the crystal regions to the amorphous semiconductor region is increased and the crystallinity is improved. Further, defects in the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Through the above steps, the microcrystalline semiconductor film having high crystallinity in which the density of mixed phase grains is high can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Note that the pressure in the deposition condition of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> may be set to higher than that in the deposition condition of the seed crystal <b>107</b>. Alternatively, the pressure in the deposition condition of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> may be set to lower than that in the deposition condition of the seed crystal <b>107</b>. Further alternatively, the pressure in the deposition condition of the seed crystal <b>107</b> may be set to the same as that in the deposition condition of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The thickness of the seed crystal <b>107</b> is preferably greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm. If the thickness of the seed crystal <b>107</b> is greater than 10 nm, even when the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> is deposited, it is difficult to fill the space between the mixed phase grains and to etch the amorphous semiconductor contained in the seed crystal <b>107</b>, which reduces the crystallinity of the seed crystal <b>107</b> and the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b>. In addition, since the mixed phase grain needs to be formed in the seed crystal <b>107</b>, the thickness of the seed crystal <b>107</b> is preferably 1 nm or more.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The thickness of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> is preferably greater than or equal to 30 nm and less than or equal to 100 nm. The reason for this is as follows: when the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> has a thickness of 30 nm or more, a variation in electrical characteristics of thin film transistors can be reduced; and when the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> has a thickness of 100 nm or less, throughput can be increased and film peeling due to stress can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">According to this embodiment, a microcrystalline semiconductor film having higher crystallinity with a reduced space between mixed phase grains can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Note that, for further increasing the crystallinity of the microcrystalline semiconductor film, another microcrystalline semiconductor film may be formed over the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> under a condition by which the crystallinity is increased. A condition by which the crystallinity is higher than that of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> is as follows: the flow ratio of hydrogen to the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium is higher than that in the deposition condition of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> and the deposition gas is diluted, and the pressure in the process chamber is greater than or equal to 1333 Pa and less than or equal to 13332 Pa (greater than or equal to 10 Torr and less than or equal to 100 Torr).</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Another condition by which the crystallinity is higher than that of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b> is as follows, similarly to the deposition condition for the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b>: the flow ratio of hydrogen and the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium is periodically increased and decreased, and the pressure in the process chamber is greater than or equal to 1333 Pa and less than or equal to 13332 Pa (greater than or equal to 10 Torr and less than or equal to 100 Torr). In the above condition, during the period when the flow ratio of hydrogen to the deposition gas containing silicon or germanium is low, the flow ratio of hydrogen may be set to be higher than that in the deposition condition of the microcrystalline semiconductor film <b>108</b>, whereby the crystallinity can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Subsequently, the process including and after the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> which is described in Embodiment 1 is performed, whereby a thin film transistor with high on-state current and high field-effect mobility, and low off-state current, in which change in electrical characteristics is suppressed can be manufactured.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Embodiment 5</heading>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In this embodiment, a method for manufacturing a thin film transistor, by which the off-state current can be further reduced as compared to the off-state current in any of Embodiments 1 to 4, will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">As in Embodiment 1, the semiconductor stacked body <b>117</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is formed through the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Next, plasma treatment is performed in which a side surface of the semiconductor stacked body <b>117</b> is exposed to plasma <b>123</b> while the mask <b>115</b> formed of a resist is left. Here, plasma is generated in an oxidizing gas atmosphere or a nitriding gas atmosphere, and the semiconductor stacked body <b>117</b> is exposed to the plasma <b>123</b>. Examples of the oxidizing gas include oxygen, ozone, dinitrogen monoxide, water vapor, and a mixed gas of oxygen and hydrogen. Examples of the nitriding gas include nitrogen, ammonia, nitrogen fluoride, nitrogen chloride, chloroamine, and fluoroamine. By generating plasma in an oxidation gas or a nitriding gas, an oxygen radical or a nitrogen radical is generated. The radical reacts with the semiconductor stacked body <b>117</b>, thereby forming an insulating region on the side surface of the semiconductor stacked body <b>117</b>. Note that instead of irradiation with plasma, irradiation with ultraviolet light may be performed for generation of an oxygen radical or a nitrogen radical.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In the case of using oxygen, ozone, water vapor, or a mixed gas of oxygen and hydrogen as the oxidizing gas, the resist recedes by plasma irradiation, whereby a mask <b>115</b><i>a </i>whose top and bottom surfaces are reduced in area is formed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. Consequently, through the plasma treatment, the exposed impurity semiconductor film <b>121</b> is oxidized in addition to the side surface of the semiconductor stacked body <b>117</b>, whereby an insulating region <b>125</b> is formed on the side surface of the semiconductor stacked body <b>117</b> and on the side surface and part of the top surface of the impurity semiconductor film <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Next, as described in Embodiment 1, through a process similar to the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the wirings <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b </i>serving as a source electrode and a drain electrode, the impurity semiconductor films <b>131</b><i>a </i>and <b>131</b><i>b </i>serving as a source region and a drain region, the semiconductor stacked body <b>133</b> including the microcrystalline semiconductor region <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the pair of amorphous semiconductor regions <b>133</b><i>b</i>, and the insulating film <b>137</b> are formed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>.

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Although not shown, when a back gate electrode is formed over the insulating film <b>137</b>, a dual-gate thin film transistor can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">According to this embodiment, since the insulating region is provided between the semiconductor stacked body <b>133</b> and the wirings <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b</i>, holes injected from the wirings <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b </i>to the semiconductor stacked body <b>133</b> can be reduced; thus, a thin film transistor having low off-state current, high field-effect mobility, and high on-state current can be manufactured.</p>

<p id="p-0230" num="0229">A specific method of a gate BT test is as follows: the temperature of a substrate over which a transistor is formed (substrate temperature) is set at fixed temperature, the potentials of a source and a drain of the transistor are set to be almost equal, and a gate is supplied with a potential different from those of the source and the drain for a certain period. The substrate temperature may be set as appropriate in accordance with the purpose of the test.

<p id="p-0242" num="0241">As described above, it was shown that the amount of change in threshold voltage and the amount of change in a shift value between before and after a gate BT test can be reduced and the reliability of a thin film transistor can be thus improved when the thin film transistor is manufactured under a condition where nitrogen is less likely to be mixed into a microcrystalline semiconductor region.</p>

A curve <b>501</b>, a curve <b>502</b>, and a curve <b>503</b> are a first derivative curve of Sample F, that of Sample G, and that of Sample H, respectively. Note that a horizontal axis with respect to the middle point of two peak points of the first derivative curve denotes the center of absorption (a resonance magnetic field). Note that in the ESR analysis, the measurement was performed in such a manner that the sample was irradiated with a microwave with a frequency of 9.456 GHz while a magnetic field was applied on the sample under a condition where the microwave electric power was 0.5 mW, modulation amplitude was 5 G, conversion time was 800 msec, the number of times of scanning was 2, and the measurement temperature was 10 K.

<p id="p-0303" num="0302">Next, a bond defect whose g value belongs to near 1.9965 in an ESR spectrum observed in ESR measurement of the microcrystalline silicon film was verified by quantum chemistry calculation.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">An ESR signal whose g value is near 1.9965 is observed with a deposition condition where nitrogen can be mixed into microcrystalline silicon. In this example, attention was focused on influence of nitrogen on a bond defect, and a cluster model including a silicon atom and a nitrogen atom and including a bond defect was formed. Note that bond defects except for one bond defect were terminated with hydrogen atoms. In the calculation, structure optimization was performed and a g value was then calculated by a gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO) method.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">The density functional theory (DFT) using Gaussian basis was employed for structure optimization calculation. Also in the DFT, an exchange-correlation interaction is approximated by a functional (that is, a function of another function) of one electron potential represented in terms of electron density to enable high-speed calculations. Here, B3LYP which was a hybrid functional was used to specify the weight of each parameter related to exchange-correlation energy. In addition, as a basis function, 6-311G (a basis function of a triple-split valence basis set using three contraction functions for each valence orbital) was applied to all the atoms. By the above basis function, for example, orbitals of is to 3s are considered in the case of hydrogen atoms while orbitals of 1s to 4s and 2p to 4p are considered in the case of nitrogen atoms. Furthermore, to improve calculation accuracy, the p function and the d function as polarization basis sets were added respectively to hydrogen atoms and atoms other than hydrogen atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">For the calculation of g values, a gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO) method was employed as a method for calculation of a magnetic shield constant of a molecule. A Hartree-Fock (HF) method was employed in calculation of electron state by a GIAO method. The same conditions as the structure optimization calculation were applied as a basis function.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Note that Gaussian 09 was used as a quantum chemistry computational program. A high performance computer (Altix 4700, manufactured by SGI Japan, Ltd.) was used for the calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A to 19F</figref> are schematic diagrams of bond defects of the cluster models used in the calculation, which can be seen as a cause of the g value of 1.9965. FIGS. <b>19</b>A and <b>19</b>B are schematic diagrams of bond defects of a structure A; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19C and 19D</figref> are schematic diagrams of bond defects of a structure B; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19E and 19F</figref> are schematic diagrams of bond defects of a structure C.

Further, a silyl group is bonded to the other of the doubly bonded nitrogen atoms. In the structure C, a silicon atom which is doubly bonded to a nitrogen atom has a defect. Further, a silyl group is bonded to the silicon atom. Moreover, a silyl group is bonded to the nitrogen to which the silicon atom is doubly bonded.</p>

<p id="p-0311" num="0310">Note that with the structure A, one of the doubly bonded nitrogen atoms had the defect and the silicon atom was bonded to the other of the doubly bonded nitrogen atoms, so that the g value became the value in Table 1. With the structure B, the silicon atom bonded to one of the doubly bonded nitrogen atoms had the defect, so that the g value became the value in Table 1. With the structure C, the silicon atom doubly bonded to the nitrogen atom had the defect, so that the g value became the value in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">From the calculation results, it was found that a bond defect of a structure in which nitrogen atoms are doubly bonded or a silicon atom and a nitrogen atom are doubly bonded to each other tends to make the g value close to 1.9965.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">Thus, the following was indicated. In the case where a microcrystalline silicon film is deposited in a process chamber filled with an atmosphere containing nitrogen atoms, a structure may be formed in which a double bond is formed between atoms, depending on a condition. When the structure has a bond defect, an ESR signal whose g value is 1.9965 may be observed.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">Due to a gate BT test, a hydrogen atom becomes easy to be detached from doubly bonded nitrogen atoms or a silicon atom bonded to doubly bonded nitrogen atoms; as a result of the detachment, an unpaired electron is formed. Such an unpaired electron can be seen as a cause of a reduction in the reliability of a thin film transistor. Thus, by reducing the nitrogen concentration in a microcrystalline silicon film, the reliability of a thin film transistor can be increased.</p>
