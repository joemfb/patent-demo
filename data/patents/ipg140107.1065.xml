<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A fluid dispensing system may include a fluid outlet connected to a flexible fluid reservoir and a docking station configured to receive the fluid outlet and align the fluid outlet. In some examples, a fluid pump that defines a driveshaft aperture that is connected to the fluid outlet. In some additional examples, a drive motor is attached to the docking station that includes a driveshaft for driving the fluid pump. The docking station may align the fluid outlet so that the driveshaft aperture defined by the fluid pump is co-axially aligned with the driveshaft. This may allow an operator to efficiently take an empty reservoir out of service and replace it with a new reservoir full of fluid.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to fluid reservoirs and, more particularly, to docking stations for fluid reservoirs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fluid reservoirs are used to store and transport fluids in a variety of different industries. For example, in the food industry, fluid containers are used to store condiments, mixes, sauces, beverages and other similar edible fluids. As another example, in the cleaning industry, fluid containers are used to store cleaning and sanitizing agents, detergents, antimicrobial agents and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the most common types of disposable fluid containers for commercial customers that require comparatively large volumes of fluid is a bag-in-a-box-style fluid container. Typically, these types of containers are constructed from a flexible, fluid-impermeable bag that is positioned within a comparatively rigid box. The bag prevents the fluid from leaking out of the container while the box provides structural support and puncture resistance for the bag. Oftentimes, bag-in-a-box-style fluid containers have a fluid outlet nozzle extending from the fluid-impermeable bag to outside of the box. The fluid outlet nozzle can be connected to a dispensing device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As fluid within a disposable fluid container is used up, the container can be replaced with a fresh container full of fluid. Depending on the application, a disposable fluid container may need to be replaced on a regular basis such as a weekly or even daily basis. Ensuring that a fluid outlet nozzle of a container accurately mates with a corresponding dispensing device may be useful for the quick and safe replacement of the container.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, this disclosure is directed to docking stations for fluid reservoirs such as bag-in-a-box type reservoirs. Is some examples, the docking station is configured to receive a fluid outlet connected to the fluid reservoir and align the fluid outlet. For example, the docking station may receive the fluid outlet and align the fluid outlet so that a fluid pump connected to the fluid outlet is aligned with a drive motor attached to the docking station. The drive motor may include a driveshaft that is insertable into the fluid pump and that can operate to mechanically pump fluid out of the fluid reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To insert a fluid outlet into such an example docking station, a user may slide a flange extending about at least a portion of the fluid outlet into a cavity defined between a receiving surface, a mating surface, and an outlet surface of the docking station. The receiving surface may include a guide channel into which the flange can be inserted and which aligns the flange in a direction substantially parallel to the fluid reservoir. Regardless, the docking station may align the fluid outlet so that an opening in the fluid pump that is designed to receive a driveshaft is coaxially aligned with the driveshaft extending from the docking station. When so aligned, the user can insert the fluid outlet into the docking station until the fluid outlet is in contact with the mating surface and the driveshaft is inserted into the opening in the fluid pump designed to receive the driveshaft. Instead of requiring the user to carefully align the driveshaft on the drive motor with the driveshaft opening on the fluid pump, the docking station may help perform the alignment function. This may allow an user to efficiently take an empty reservoir out of service and place a new reservoir in service.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one example, a fluid dispensing system is described that includes a flexible fluid reservoir, a fluid outlet connected to the flexible fluid reservoir, and a fluid pump connected to the fluid outlet, where the fluid pump defines a driveshaft aperture configured to receive a driveshaft for driving the fluid pump. According to the example, the system also includes a drive motor that includes the driveshaft for driving the fluid pump and a docking station connected to the drive motor. The docking station is configured to receive the fluid outlet and align the fluid outlet so that the driveshaft aperture defined by the fluid pump is co-axially aligned with the driveshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another example, a docking station is described that includes a receiving surface, a mating surface, an outlet surface, and a locking member. The receiving surface is configured to receive a flange extending about at least a portion of a fluid dispensing aperture defined by a fluid outlet connected to a flexible fluid reservoir. The mating surface extends substantially orthogonally from the receiving surface and is configured to mate with a drive motor that includes a driveshaft for driving a fluid pump connected to the fluid outlet. The outlet surface extends substantially orthogonally from the receiving surface and substantially orthogonally from the mating surface and is configured to support the fluid outlet. In addition, the locking member defines an inlet nozzle and outlet nozzle, where the inlet nozzle is configured to be inserted into the fluid outlet and the locking member is configured to releasably lock to the outlet surface so as to mechanically affix the fluid outlet to the outlet surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example, a fluid dispensing system is described that includes means for storing fluid, a fluid outlet connected to the means for storing fluid, and means for mechanically conveying fluid out of the means for storing fluid, the means for mechanically conveying fluid being connected to the fluid outlet. According to the example, the system also includes means for driving the means for mechanically conveying fluid and means for receiving the fluid outlet and aligning the fluid outlet so that the means for mechanically conveying fluid are aligned with the means for driving.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following detailed description is exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention. Rather, the following description provides some practical illustrations for implementing examples of the present invention. Examples of constructions, materials, dimensions, and manufacturing processes are provided for selected elements, and all other elements employ that which is known to those of ordinary skill in the field of the invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many of the noted examples have a variety of suitable alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Fluid reservoirs can be used to transport, store, and dispense flowable materials, such as foods and beverages, cleaning agents, and sanitizing agents, just to name a few. Depending on the application, a fluid reservoir may be permanent and refillable or a fluid reservoir may be disposed after a single use or a limited number of uses. Because disposable fluid reservoirs eliminate the mess and hassle attendant to refilling a reservoir, disposable fluid reservoirs are often used in commercial settings, such as fast food restaurants, hotels, hospitals, car washes, and other similar commercial settings. Typically, upon emptying the fluid in the reservoir, an operator will dispose of the reservoir and replace it with a new disposable reservoir full of fluid. The operator may need to connect the new fluid reservoir to a fluid discharge line, a fluid pump, a fluid pump motor, or other fluid discharge device to place the reservoir in operation and to establish fluid communication between the reservoir and an intended discharge location. If the fluid reservoir is not properly connected, the reservoir can leak or an outlet nozzle of the reservoir can be damaged, potentially rendering the reservoir unsuitable for service.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">This disclosure describes a fluid dispensing system that includes a docking station that is configured to mate with an outlet nozzle of a fluid reservoir. The docking station can secure and align the nozzle for subsequent use. For instance, in one example, the system includes a fluid outlet nozzle connected to a flexible fluid reservoir such as, e.g., a flexible bag positioned within a box. The fluid outlet nozzle in this example also includes a fluid pump connected to the fluid outlet nozzle. To connect the reservoir for dispensing product, the fluid outlet nozzle can be connected to an outlet conduit and the fluid pump can be connect to a driveshaft that drives the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Because a fluid nozzle connected to flexible bag may shift in orientation and alignment, it can be particularly challenging to connect the nozzle to dispense product. For example, when configured with a pump, the pump can shift relative to the driveshaft that drives the pump. Further, the fluid outlet can shift relative to a conduit that conveys fluid from the reservoir to a dispensing location. As described in some examples in the present disclosure, a docking station is provided that is connected to a drive motor that includes a driveshaft. The docking station is configured to receive the fluid outlet and align the fluid outlet so that the fluid pump connected to the fluid outlet is aligned with the driveshaft. The alignment function provided by the docking station can help an operator efficiently mate the fluid reservoir with a dispensing device such as, e.g., a pump driveshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, the docking station may help facilitate replacement of a disposable fluid reservoir that includes a disposable fluid pump mounted to an outlet nozzle of the fluid reservoir. With such a configuration, each new disposable reservoir full of fluid may include a new pump connected to an outlet nozzle of the reservoir. Placing the new fluid reservoir in service may involve connecting the reservoir to a dispensing conduit and further connecting the new pump associated with the new reservoir to a drive motor. Rather than requiring an operator to carefully align a pump with a driveshaft attached to the drive motor to place the reservoir in service, the docking station may align the nozzle, allowing the operator to easily place the reservoir in service.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Although the configuration of the fluid nozzle and the docking station can vary depending on the application, in one example, the fluid outlet defines a fluid dispensing aperture and a flange extending about at least a portion of the fluid dispensing aperture. Further, the docking station defines a receiving surface configured to receive the flange and a mating surface extending substantially orthogonally from the receiving surface. In this example, the mating surface is configured to mate with the drive motor. Accordingly, when inserting the fluid nozzle into the docking station, the flange can be positioned adjacent the receiving surface of the docking station and advanced toward the mating surface so as to connect the pump to the driveshaft. The docking station can align the fluid outlet so the pump is co-axially aligned with the driveshaft as the pump is advanced toward the driveshaft. The docking station can further secure the pump for subsequent pumping operation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are schematic drawings of an example fluid dispensing system <b>10</b>, which includes a fluid reservoir <b>12</b>, a fluid outlet <b>14</b>, and a docking station <b>16</b>. Fluid outlet <b>14</b> is shown outside of and insertable into docking station <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, while fluid outlet <b>14</b> is shown inserted into docking station <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Fluid outlet <b>14</b> is connected to and in fluid communication with fluid reservoir <b>12</b> such that fluid can be discharged from the fluid reservoir through the fluid outlet. Docking station <b>16</b> is configured to receive fluid outlet <b>14</b> and align the fluid outlet for dispensing operations. In particular, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, docking station <b>16</b> is configured to receive fluid outlet <b>14</b> by sliding the fluid reservoir in the Y-direction shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> until the fluid outlet is positioned adjacent an abutting surface of the docking station. In other examples, docking station <b>16</b> may receive fluid outlet <b>14</b> from a different direction than shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which may depend, for example, on the arrangement of the fluid outlet relative to fluid reservoir <b>12</b> and the configuration of the docking station. For instance, in one example, docking station <b>16</b> receives fluid outlet <b>14</b> by moving fluid reservoir <b>12</b> in the negative Z-direction indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> relative to the docking station.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> also includes a fluid pump <b>18</b> and a fluid pump drive motor <b>20</b> (hereinafter &#x201c;drive motor <b>20</b>&#x201d;). Fluid pump <b>18</b> is connected to fluid outlet <b>14</b> and configured to mechanically pump fluid from fluid reservoir <b>12</b> to a dispensing location. Drive motor <b>20</b> is configured to provide a driving force for driving fluid pump <b>18</b>. Specifically, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, drive motor <b>20</b> includes a driveshaft <b>22</b> that can be inserted into a corresponding driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> defined by fluid pump <b>18</b>. During operation, drive motor <b>20</b> can turn driveshaft <b>22</b> so as to convey mechanical energy from the fluid pump motor to the fluid pump, thereby pumping fluid out of fluid reservoir <b>12</b> via fluid outlet <b>14</b>. In some examples, driveshaft <b>22</b> defines a spline drive that is mechanically coupled to a rotor or other fluid movement device within fluid pump <b>18</b> for mechanically transferring fluid. Typically, a spline drive includes a series of projections extending radially from a shaft that fit into corresponding slots in a shaft opening.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Docking station <b>16</b> is configured to receive a fluid outlet connected to fluid reservoir <b>12</b>. Docking station <b>16</b> is illustrated as being attached to a fluid reservoir guide bracket <b>17</b>. Fluid reservoir guide bracket <b>17</b> is sized and shaped to receive fluid reservoir <b>12</b> such that fluid reservoir <b>12</b> can be inserted into the fluid reservoir guide bracket while fluid outlet <b>14</b> is inserted into the docking station attached to the guide bracket. Fluid reservoir guide bracket <b>17</b> may help position fluid outlet <b>14</b> for insertion into docking station <b>16</b>. This may help a user quickly exchange an empty reservoir for a fresh reservoir full of fluid. That being said, in other examples, docking station <b>16</b> may receive fluid outlet <b>14</b> without being attached to a fluid reservoir guide bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In general, fluid reservoir <b>12</b> may be any type of container that defines a fluid impermeable structure for storing fluid. Fluid reservoir <b>12</b> may be a rigid container such as a box, bottle, drum, or other container formed of a rigid material (e.g., glass, metal, a rigid thermoplastic). Alternatively, fluid reservoir <b>12</b> may be a flexible container such as a bag or other structure that does not define a rigid, fixed shape. A flexible container may, but need not, define a volume that expands and contracts in response to increasing and decreasing fluid volumes in the container.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, fluid reservoir <b>12</b> is generally illustrated in the style of a bag-in-a-box-type container. Bag-in-a-box-style containers may include a flexible bag positioned within a box that is more rigid than the bag. For example, a bag-in-a-box container may be fabricated from a flexible plastic bag positioned within a cardboard box. The bag and box may or may not be heat sealed together. As fluid reservoir <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated as a generally rectangularly-shaped box that includes a fluid impermeable bag in the box, the remainder of the present disclosure generally refers to an example configuration of docking station <b>16</b> where the docking station is designed to receive a fluid outlet connected to a bag-in-a-box-style reservoir. However, other configurations of docking station <b>16</b> are possible in accordance with the present disclosure, and it should be appreciated that the disclosure is not limited to any particular type of docking station. For example, docking station <b>16</b> can be configured to receive a fluid outlet nozzle attached to a bottle, a drum, or other flexible or inflexible container, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In use, fluid reservoir <b>12</b> can store any suitable types of fluids and the disclosure is not limited to a fluid reservoir that stores a particular type of fluid. Example fluids include cleaning agents, sanitizing agents, foods, beverages, lubricants, chemical agents, and other flowable fluids. Further, although fluid reservoir <b>12</b> is described as storing a fluid, the fluid need not be a pure liquid. The fluid reservoir may store viscous flowable materials, semi-liquid fluids, or the like. In different examples, the fluid within fluid reservoir <b>12</b> may be stored at ambient pressure or a positive pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To help secure and align fluid outlet <b>14</b> for dispensing fluid from fluid reservoir <b>12</b>, fluid outlet <b>14</b> may be inserted into docking station <b>16</b> in accordance with this disclosure. Docking station <b>16</b> can assume different configurations; however, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (which is shown in an exploded view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), docking station <b>16</b> includes a receiving surface <b>24</b>, a mating surface <b>26</b>, and an outlet surface <b>28</b>. Receiving surface <b>24</b> receives fluid outlet <b>14</b> and, in some examples, supports the fluid outlet from the Z-direction shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Mating surface <b>26</b> extends substantially orthogonally from receiving surface <b>26</b> (i.e., in the Z-direction shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). Mating surface <b>26</b> mates with drive motor <b>20</b>, e.g., to secure the drive motor to the docking station and fix an orientation of driveshaft <b>22</b> relative to the docking station. Outlet surface <b>28</b> extends substantially orthogonally from both receiving surface <b>24</b> and mating surface <b>26</b> (i.e., in the Y-Z plane shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). Outlet surface <b>28</b> may support fluid outlet <b>14</b> and, in some examples, mate with a locking member to mechanically affix the fluid outlet to the outlet surface. By positioning fluid outlet <b>14</b> between receiving surface <b>24</b>, mating surface <b>26</b>, and outlet surface <b>28</b>, the fluid outlet may be aligned so that driveshaft <b>22</b> inserts into fluid pump <b>18</b> as the fluid outlet is inserted into docking station <b>16</b>. Further, positioning fluid outlet <b>14</b> between receiving surface <b>24</b>, mating surface <b>26</b>, and outlet surface <b>28</b> may secure the fluid outlet, e.g., to prevent the fluid outlet from disconnecting from a conduit subsequently attached to the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In combination, receiving surface <b>24</b>, mating surface <b>26</b>, and outlet surface <b>28</b> define a partially-enclosed cavity into which fluid outlet <b>14</b> and connected fluid pump <b>18</b> can be inserted. For example, to insert fluid outlet <b>14</b> into docking station <b>16</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a user can slide fluid outlet <b>14</b> from the Y-direction until the fluid outlet is positioned adjacent to and in contact with mating surface <b>26</b>. As described in greater detail below, docking station <b>16</b> may include features that align and secure the fluid outlet to facilitate pumping operation. In one example, docking station <b>16</b> includes a guide slot that aligns fluid outlet <b>14</b> so that the driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> defined by fluid pump <b>18</b> is co-axially aligned with driveshaft <b>22</b>. When aligned, driveshaft <b>22</b> can be inserted into the driveshaft aperture by advancing fluid outlet <b>14</b> until the fluid outlet is positioned adjacent mating surface <b>26</b>. In another example, docking station <b>16</b> is configured to receive a locking member <b>44</b> that secures fluid outlet to outlet surface <b>28</b>. The locking member may help prevent fluid outlet <b>14</b> from disconnecting from a conduit (not shown) that conveys fluid from fluid reservoir <b>12</b> to a downstream dispensing location. For example, the locking member may help prevent fluid outlet <b>14</b> from disconnecting from the conduit when pumping to a downstream dispensing location that is at a pressure above ambient pressure, which may require higher pressures within the conduit that promote separation from the fluid outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Docking station <b>16</b> is configured to receive fluid outlet <b>14</b>. Fluid outlet <b>14</b> is in fluid communication with a volume of fluid stored within fluid reservoir <b>12</b>. In some examples, such as the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, fluid outlet <b>14</b> define a nozzle that projects from an exterior surface of fluid reservoir <b>12</b>. In other examples, fluid outlet <b>14</b> is flush with or recessed into an exterior surface of fluid reservoir <b>12</b>. In either set of examples, fluid outlet <b>14</b> may be connected to fluid pump <b>18</b> for mechanically conveying fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Fluid pump <b>18</b> is a device that transfers fluid from fluid reservoir <b>12</b> to a downstream dispensing location. In various examples, fluid pump <b>18</b> may be a gear pump, a screw pump, a diaphragm pump, or other type of devices that conveys fluid. In one example, fluid pump <b>18</b> is a two-part pump that includes a central rotor and a housing that includes a flexible diaphragm. The rotor may have indents that pick up fluid from an input side and transport the fluid around the housing to an output port. The flexible diaphragm on the housing may push the fluid into the output, emptying the indents on the rotor. The rate of flow of the pump may be controlled by the rate of rotation of the rotor. Such a pump is commercially available from Quantex Arc Ltd. It should be appreciated, however, that fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> may include any suitable type of pump and the disclosure is not limited in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Independent of the specific type of pump used for fluid pump <b>18</b>, the fluid pump may be permanent or disposable. Fluid pump <b>18</b> may be permanent or semi-permanent in that the same pump may be used for multiple different reservoirs of fluid. That is, the same fluid pump <b>18</b> may be transferred from an old reservoir to a new reservoir as the new reservoir replaces the old reservoir. Alternatively, fluid pump <b>18</b> may be disposable such that each new fluid reservoir <b>12</b> inserted into docking station <b>16</b> includes a new pump attached to that reservoir. Including a new pump with each new fluid reservoir inserted into docking station <b>16</b> may provide a more sanitary system than reusing the same pump for multiple different reservoirs of fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When configured with fluid pump <b>18</b>, the fluid pump may be connected to fluid outlet <b>14</b> in any suitable orientation relative to the fluid outlet. Fluid pump <b>18</b> may be connected either directly to fluid outlet <b>14</b> or with the aid of an extension or intermediate conduit (not shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, fluid pump <b>18</b> is directly connected to fluid outlet <b>14</b> at a distal end of the outlet extending away from fluid reservoir <b>12</b>. In particular, in the illustrated example, fluid pump <b>18</b> projects distally from a distal most end of fluid outlet <b>14</b>. In some examples, fluid pump <b>18</b> is mechanically attached to fluid outlet <b>14</b>. For example, a mechanical fixation element such as, e.g., bolts, screws, adhesive, or the like may be used to mechanically attach the fluid pump to the fluid outlet. In other examples, fluid pump <b>18</b> is attached to fluid outlet <b>14</b> without the aid of a mechanical fixation element. For example, fluid pump <b>18</b> may include an inlet nozzle that has an exterior perimeter smaller than the interior perimeter of fluid outlet <b>14</b>. The inlet nozzle of fluid pump <b>18</b> can be friction fit into fluid outlet <b>14</b> to secure the fluid pump to the fluid outlet without the aid of a mechanical fixation element. Additionally or alternatively, fluid pump <b>18</b> may attach over fluid outlet <b>14</b>, e.g., by being secured about an exterior perimeter of the fluid outlet. During operation, fluid can flow out of fluid reservoir <b>12</b> and through fluid outlet <b>14</b> via fluid pump <b>18</b> to a dispensing location.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, fluid outlet <b>14</b> defines a fluid dispensing aperture (which may be an opening in fluid communication with fluid pump <b>18</b> for pumping fluid out of fluid reservoir <b>12</b>) and at least one flange which, in the illustrated example, is shown as two flanges <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B (collectively &#x201c;flange <b>30</b>&#x201d;). Flange <b>30</b> extends at least partially, and in some examples, fully about a perimeter of the fluid dispensing aperture. Flange <b>30</b> may define a rim that extends radially outward away from fluid outlet <b>14</b>. Flange <b>30</b> may strengthen the connection between fluid reservoir <b>12</b> and fluid outlet <b>14</b> and/or help align the fluid outlet when the outlet is inserted into docking station <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, flange <b>30</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> may provide structural rigidity between fluid outlet <b>14</b> and fluid reservoir <b>12</b>, e.g., by expanding the surface area over which forces on the fluid outlet are transferred to the fluid reservoir. In some examples, flange <b>30</b>A is positioned adjacent to (e.g., flush with) an exterior surface of fluid reservoir <b>12</b> (e.g., in the Y-Z plane illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). By contrast, flange <b>30</b>B may be spaced away from fluid reservoir <b>12</b> and used to help align fluid outlet <b>14</b> while the fluid outlet is being inserted into docking station <b>16</b>. Flange <b>30</b>B is illustrated as being parallel to (i.e., parallel Y-Z planes) and spaced from flange <b>30</b>A so as to define a channel <b>32</b> between the two flanges. Channel <b>32</b> may be a recessed area between projecting edges of flange <b>30</b>A and flange <b>30</b>B that may help align outlet <b>14</b> upon being inserted into docking station <b>16</b>. Further, while fluid outlet <b>14</b> in the example of fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> includes two flanges, in other examples, the fluid outlet may include fewer flanges (e.g., none, one) or more flanges (e.g., three, four, or more).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To place fluid reservoir <b>12</b> in service for dispensing fluid, fluid pump <b>18</b> projecting from fluid outlet <b>14</b> may be connected drive motor <b>20</b>. In particular, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, driveshaft <b>22</b> coupled to drive motor <b>20</b> can be inserted into a corresponding driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> defined in the fluid pump to place the fluid pump in service. The driveshaft aperture, which may be an opening that extends partially or fully through fluid pump <b>18</b>, can be configured (e.g., sized and/or shaped) to receive the driveshaft. Once inserted into driveshaft aperture <b>19</b>, drive motor <b>20</b> can turn the driveshaft to engage fluid pump <b>18</b> for delivering fluid from the fluid reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In practice, inserting driveshaft <b>22</b> into the driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> defined in fluid pump <b>18</b> may be challenging because fluid outlet <b>14</b>, and hence driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> connected to the fluid outlet, may shift relative to fluid reservoir <b>12</b>. For example, when fluid reservoir <b>12</b> includes a flexible bag (e.g., a bag-in-box-style reservoir) the surface of the bag to which fluid outlet <b>14</b> is attached may flex and move. This movement may cause driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> to move in the X-, Y-, and/or Z-directions indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> when attempting to insert driveshaft <b>22</b> into the driveshaft aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Docking station <b>16</b> may help align the driveshaft aperture with driveshaft <b>22</b> to facilitate mating between the components. For example, docking station <b>16</b> may fix the orientation of driveshaft <b>22</b> in three-dimensional space and guide placement of driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> defined by fluid pump <b>18</b> in three-dimensional space so that the aperture and driveshaft are aligned. In one example, docking station <b>16</b> is configured to align the driveshaft aperture with the driveshaft so that the components are coaxially positioned about an axis passing through a center of both the aperture and the driveshaft. When so aligned, driveshaft <b>22</b> may be inserted into the driveshaft aperture by advancing one of the components (e.g., the fluid pump that defines the driveshaft aperture) towards the other of the components (e.g., the driveshaft operably connected to the drive motor), e.g., linearly along the axis. In this way, docking station <b>16</b> may align driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> defined by fluid pump <b>18</b> with driveshaft <b>22</b> for mechanically mating the components.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional illustration of a portion of fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (with fluid outlet <b>14</b> inserted into docking station <b>16</b>) taken along the X-Z plane illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As seen in this example, a distal end of driveshaft <b>22</b> is inserted into driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> so that the driveshaft and aperture are coaxially aligned about a common axis <b>35</b>. Further, in this example, teeth of driveshaft <b>22</b> project into corresponding recesses defined around an interior perimeter of driveshaft aperture <b>19</b>, while recesses defined between adjacent teeth of driveshaft <b>22</b> are filled with corresponding teeth extending between adjacent recesses defined around an interior perimeter of driveshaft aperture <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some instances, even when driveshaft <b>22</b> is aligned (e.g., coaxially) with the driveshaft aperture defined by fluid pump <b>18</b>, the driveshaft may be difficult to insert into the driveshaft aperture if mechanical engagement features on the driveshaft not properly oriented with corresponding engagement features about the driveshaft aperture. For instance, driveshaft <b>22</b> and driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> defined by fluid pump <b>18</b> may be configured to mate via a spline drive, where one of the components includes a plurality of radial projections and the other of the components includes a plurality of corresponding radial slots. When so configured, the radial projections on driveshaft <b>22</b> or driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> may be out of rotational alignment with the corresponding slots on the other of the components, even though the components are coaxially aligned. In such a situation, driveshaft <b>22</b> may resist entering driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> when fluid outlet <b>14</b> is inserted into docking station <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional drawing of an example driveshaft <b>22</b> and drive motor <b>20</b>, which may be used in the example fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. As shown, driveshaft <b>22</b> is operably coupled to drive motor <b>20</b> and is configured to bias away from the drive motor in the Y-direction shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A spring, piston, or biasing mechanism <b>37</b> may be positioned between the driveshaft and the drive motor to bias the driveshaft away from the drive motor. In instances in which fluid outlet <b>14</b> is inserted into docking station <b>16</b> while the radial projections on driveshaft <b>22</b> or the driveshaft aperture are out of rotational alignment with the corresponding slots on the other of the components, the driveshaft can retract from the fluid outlet as the fluid outlet is inserted into the docking station. Upon subsequently activating drive motor <b>20</b>, driveshaft <b>22</b> may rotate until the radial projections or slots are rotationally aligned with the corresponding slots or projections on driveshaft aperture <b>19</b>. Upon aligning, driveshaft <b>22</b> may bias forward to enter driveshaft aperture <b>19</b>, thereby mechanically mating the two components.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, docking station <b>16</b> includes previously-described receiving surface <b>24</b>, mating surface <b>26</b>, and outlet surface <b>28</b>. Receiving surface <b>24</b> receives fluid outlet <b>14</b> by positioning an edge of flange <b>30</b> on the receiving surface. Receiving surface <b>24</b> may define any suitable size and shape, and the size and shape of the surface may vary, e.g., based on the size and shape of fluid outlet <b>14</b> and/or flange <b>30</b>. For example, receiving surface <b>24</b> may define a planar surface that extends outwardly in a direction projecting away from an exterior surface of fluid reservoir <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In another example, receiving surface <b>24</b> may define a non-planar surface (e.g., a curved surface), which may or may not also extend outwardly in a direction projecting away from an exterior surface of fluid reservoir <b>12</b>. Receiving surface <b>24</b> may fix the relative orientation of fluid outlet <b>14</b> and/or driveshaft <b>22</b> in at least one dimension (e.g., the Z-direction indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some examples, docking station <b>16</b> includes a plurality of receiving surfaces (e.g., two, three, or more receiving surfaces) that receive flange <b>30</b>, e.g., for aligning and securing fluid outlet <b>14</b> for dispensing fluid. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, docking station includes receiving surface <b>24</b> and a second receiving surface <b>25</b> positioned parallel to and spaced apart from receiving surface <b>24</b>. In combination, receiving surface <b>24</b>, second receiving surface <b>25</b>, and at least a portion of mating surface <b>26</b> define a cavity bounded at least partially on three sides that is configured (e.g., sized and/or shaped) so that flange <b>30</b> can be inserted into the cavity. In some examples, docking station <b>16</b> also includes a flange wall <b>27</b> extending parallel to flange <b>30</b> and/or an exterior surface of fluid reservoir <b>12</b> that bounds fluid outlet <b>14</b> in a direction substantially orthogonal to the exterior surface of fluid reservoir <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">By inserting flange <b>30</b> into the cavity defined by receiving surface <b>24</b>, second receiving surface <b>25</b>, mating surface <b>26</b>, and flange wall <b>27</b>, docking station <b>16</b> may fix the relative orientation of fluid outlet <b>14</b> and/or driveshaft <b>22</b> in at least two dimension (e.g., the X- and Z-directions indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), thereby aligning the driveshaft with the driveshaft aperture in the at least two dimensions. Specifically, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when fluid outlet <b>14</b> is positioned within the cavity, the fluid outlet may be bounded in the negative Z-direction by receiving surface <b>24</b>, in the positive Z-direction by second receiving surface <b>25</b>, in the positive Y-direction by mating surface <b>26</b>, and in the positive X-direction by flange wall <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To assist a user in inserting fluid outlet <b>14</b> into docking station <b>16</b>, docking station <b>16</b> can be configured with features to help the user guide and align flange <b>30</b> within the cavity defined by receiving surface <b>24</b>, second receiving surface <b>25</b>, mating surface <b>26</b>, and flange wall <b>27</b>. For instance, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, docking station <b>16</b> includes a guide channel <b>33</b> defined between flange wall <b>27</b> and a rib <b>34</b> positioned parallel to flange wall <b>27</b>. Guide channel <b>33</b> may help a user guide fluid outlet <b>14</b> into docking station <b>16</b>. When introducing fluid outlet <b>14</b> into docking station <b>16</b>, an edge portion of flange <b>30</b>B can be inserted into guide channel <b>33</b> while rib <b>34</b> is inserted into the channel <b>32</b> defined between flange <b>30</b>A and flange <b>30</b>B. In this way, docking station <b>16</b> can help guide fluid outlet <b>14</b> and, in particular, flange <b>30</b> of fluid outlet <b>14</b> into the docking station, helping to align the flange in a direction substantially parallel to fluid reservoir <b>12</b> (e.g., so the flange is parallel to the fluid reservoir in the Y-Z plane indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when docking station <b>16</b> includes second receiving surface <b>25</b>, the second receiving surface can also include a guide channel corresponding to guide channel <b>33</b> that receives an edge portion of flange <b>30</b>B opposite the portion inserted into guide channel <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Independent of the number of guide channels defined by docking station <b>16</b>, in some examples, one or more the guide channels defined by the docking station (e.g., all of the guide channels when the docking station is configured with multiple guide channels) may taper in width (e.g., in the X-direction indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) as the guide channel extends from farther away from drive motor <b>22</b> to closer to the guide motor (i.e., in the Y-direction indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Such a configuration may provide a comparatively wide guide channel into which a user can insert flange <b>30</b>B, while the comparatively narrower portion of the guide channel adjacent drive motor <b>20</b> may reduce or eliminate axially movement (e.g., in the X-direction indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of fluid outlet <b>14</b>, thereby helping to secure the fluid outlet and align the fluid outlet relative to driveshaft <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">While flange <b>30</b> is illustrated as defining a substantially circular cross-sectional shape (i.e., in the Y-Z plane indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), in other examples, flange <b>30</b> can define other shapes. Flange <b>30</b> can define any polygonal (e.g., square, hexagonal) or arcuate (e.g., circular, elliptical) shape, or even combinations of polygonal and arcuate shapes. In some examples, flange <b>30</b> defines a guide surface configured to be inserted into guide channel <b>33</b>. The guide surface of flange <b>30</b> may be an edge portion of the flange that is configured to rotationally align the flange (e.g., while being inserted into docking station <b>16</b>) about an axis extending substantially orthogonally from an exterior surface of fluid reservoir <b>12</b>. For example, flange <b>30</b> may include a guide surface that rotationally aligns the flange (i.e., in the Y-Z plane indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) about an axis <b>40</b> extending through a center of the fluid dispensing aperture defined by fluid outlet <b>14</b>. Such an arrangement may help ensure that the drive aperture defined by fluid pump <b>18</b> is properly aligned with driveshaft <b>22</b> as fluid outlet <b>14</b> advances into docking station <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional illustration of an example flange <b>30</b> that includes at least one guide surface which, in the illustrated example, is shown as two guide surfaces <b>42</b>A and <b>42</b>B. Guide surfaces <b>42</b>A and <b>42</b>B are positioned on opposing sides of flange <b>30</b>. Guide surfaces <b>42</b>A and <b>42</b>B are illustrated as chamfered or planar edges on the otherwise substantially circular flange. Such guide surfaces may rotationally align (e.g., square) fluid outlet <b>14</b> as the fluid outlet is inserted into guide channel <b>33</b> defined by docking station <b>16</b>. Although guide surfaces <b>42</b>A and <b>42</b>B are shown as chamfered edges, other types of guide edges are both possible and contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Docking station <b>16</b> of fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) also includes mating surface <b>26</b>. Mating surface <b>26</b> mates with drive motor <b>20</b>, e.g., to secure the drive motor to the docking station and fix an orientation of driveshaft <b>22</b> relative to the docking station. Drive motor <b>20</b> can mate to docking station <b>16</b> prior to inserting fluid outlet <b>14</b> into the docking station. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, when drive motor <b>20</b> is mated with mating surface <b>26</b>, driveshaft <b>22</b> may extend through an aperture defined in the mating surface such that, when fluid outlet <b>14</b> is inserted into docking station <b>16</b>, the driveshaft is inserted into driveshaft aperture <b>19</b> with the fluid pump positioned on one side of mating surface <b>26</b> and the drive motor positioned on an opposite side of the mating surface. In some examples, drive motor <b>20</b> is mechanically attached to mating surface <b>26</b>. For example, a mechanical fixation element such as, e.g., bolts, screws, adhesive, or the like may be used to mechanically attach the drive motor to the mating surface. In other examples, drive motor is mated to mating surface <b>26</b> without the aid of a mechanical fixation element.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Mating surface <b>26</b> may define any suitable size and shape, and the size and shape of the surface may vary, e.g., based on the size and shape of fluid outlet <b>14</b> and/or flange <b>30</b> and/or drive motor <b>20</b>. For example, mating surface <b>26</b> may define a planar surface that extends outwardly in a direction projecting away from an exterior surface of fluid reservoir <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In another example, mating surface <b>26</b> may define a non-planar surface (e.g., a curved surface), which may or may not also extend outwardly in a direction projecting away from an exterior surface of fluid reservoir <b>12</b>. Mating surface <b>26</b> may fix the relative orientation of fluid outlet <b>14</b> and/or driveshaft <b>22</b> in at least one dimension (e.g., the Y-direction indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Drive motor <b>20</b> may be implemented as any device that is configured to convert energy to mechanical motion for rotating drive shaft <b>22</b>. In different examples, drive motor <b>20</b> may be an electric motor, a pneumatic motor, or a hydraulic motor. Other types of motors may also be used in accordance with the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">During operation, fluid pump <b>18</b> can receive fluid from fluid reservoir <b>12</b>, pressurize the fluid to a pressure greater than the pressure in the reservoir, and discharge the fluid to a downstream dispensing location. Depending on the application, fluid pump <b>18</b> may generate pressure in a conduit (not shown) that conveys fluid from the pump to the dispensing location that causes the conduit to try and disengage from fluid outlet <b>14</b>. For this reason, docking station may include an outlet surface that helps secure the fluid outlet, e.g., to prevent the fluid outlet from disconnecting from a conduit subsequently attached to the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, docking station includes outlet surface <b>28</b>, which is positioned farther away from fluid reservoir <b>12</b> than fluid outlet <b>14</b>. Outlet surface <b>28</b> extends substantially orthogonally from both receiving surface <b>24</b> and mating surface <b>26</b> (i.e., in the Y-Z plane shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). Outlet surface <b>28</b> may or may not physically support fluid outlet <b>14</b>. In some examples, outlet surface <b>28</b> may be configured to mate with a locking member to mechanically affix the fluid outlet to outlet surface.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes locking member <b>44</b>. Locking member <b>44</b> includes an inlet nozzle <b>46</b>, an outlet nozzle <b>48</b>, and an attachment member <b>50</b>. Inlet nozzle <b>46</b> can be inserted into fluid outlet <b>14</b> and, in particular, a discharge end of fluid pump <b>18</b> attached to the fluid outlet. Outlet nozzle <b>48</b> can be connected to a conduit (not shown) that conveys fluid from fluid pump <b>18</b> to a downstream dispensing location. Attachment member <b>50</b> can be used to attach and secure locking member <b>44</b> to outlet surface <b>28</b>. For instance, after inserting fluid outlet <b>14</b> into docking station <b>16</b>, a user can insert inlet nozzle <b>46</b> of locking member <b>44</b> into fluid outlet <b>14</b> though an opening defined in outlet surface <b>28</b>. The user can then secure the locking member to the outlet surface using attachment member <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Depending on the configuration of the fluid dispensing system, in some examples when inlet nozzle <b>46</b> is inserted into fluid outlet <b>14</b> and attachment member <b>50</b> is secured to outlet surface <b>28</b>, an axis extending through a center of the inlet nozzle may intersect a substantially orthogonal axis passing through a center of driveshaft <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional illustration of such an example arrangement. As shown in this example, inlet nozzle <b>46</b> is inserted the fluid outlet and an axis <b>40</b> extends through a center of both the inlet nozzle and the fluid dispensing aperture defined by the fluid outlet. Axis <b>40</b> is substantially orthogonal to and intersects an axis <b>35</b> extending through a center of driveshaft <b>22</b>, which is inserted into driveshaft aperture <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the user screws attachment member <b>50</b> onto a substantially circular threaded surface projecting away from a planar portion of outlet surface <b>28</b>. In some examples, attachment member <b>50</b> is configured to secure to outlet surface <b>28</b> by screwing the attachment member a half turn (180 degrees) or less, allowing a user to quickly secure the attachment member to the outlet surface. In different examples, attachment member <b>50</b> may be configured to secure to outlet surface <b>28</b> using a different type of attachment feature such as, e.g., clips, bolts, or the like. By mechanically affixing fluid outlet <b>14</b> to outlet surface <b>28</b> via locking member <b>44</b>, vibration motion imparted to the fluid outlet during operation of fluid pump <b>18</b> may be attenuated. This may help prevent the fluid outlet from disconnecting from a conduit attached to the outlet. This may also help prevent fluid pump <b>18</b> from disengaging with drive motor <b>20</b> (e.g., driveshaft <b>22</b> coming out of driveshaft aperture <b>19</b>), even when pumping against pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When mating fluid outlet <b>14</b> with docking station <b>16</b>, it may be useful if an user can readily determine when the fluid outlet is sufficiently inserted into the docking station such that locking member <b>44</b> can be secured to outlet surface <b>28</b> and/or fluid pump <b>18</b> can be activated. In some examples, the user determines that fluid outlet <b>14</b> is sufficiently inserted into docking station <b>16</b> by inserting the fluid outlet into the docking station until the fluid outlet is adjacent to and in contact with mating surface <b>26</b> of the docking station. The tactile feedback associated with contacting mating surface <b>26</b> may indicate to the user that fluid outlet <b>14</b> is sufficiently inserted into docking station <b>16</b>. In other examples, fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> may provide a visual and/or audible indication when fluid outlet <b>14</b> is sufficiently inserted into docking station <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, docking station <b>16</b> includes a docking light <b>100</b>. Docking light <b>100</b> may illuminate when fluid outlet <b>14</b> is sufficiently inserted into docking station <b>16</b>. For example, inserting fluid outlet <b>14</b> to a desired location in docking station <b>16</b> may close a circuit that causes docking light <b>100</b> to activate. The activated docking light may indicate to the user that locking member <b>44</b> can be secured to outlet surface <b>28</b> and/or fluid pump <b>18</b> can be activated. By contrast, deactivation of docking light <b>100</b> may indicate to the user that fluid outlet <b>14</b> has moved out of proper position with respect to docking station <b>16</b> and should be repositioned.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition to or in lieu of docking light <b>100</b>, fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> may include a variety of other features to sense and/or indicate operational performance of the fluid dispensing system. In one example, fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> includes a product delivery indicator to indicate when fluid is flowing through fluid outlet <b>14</b>. The product delivery indicator may provide an indication of whether fluid is or is not flowing through fluid outlet <b>14</b>, e.g., during operation of fluid pump <b>18</b>. If fluid is flowing through fluid outlet <b>14</b>, the product delivery indicator may provide a proof-of-delivery (POD) indication. If fluid is not flowing through fluid outlet <b>14</b>, for example because fluid reservoir <b>12</b> is empty, the product delivery indicator may provide an out-of-product-alert (OOPA) indication. The fluid delivery indicator may be an audible indicator, a visual (e.g., an LED) indicator, a tactile indicator, or a combination thereof. In one example, the fluid delivery indicator is a light that activates when fluid is flowing through fluid outlet <b>14</b> and that deactivates when fluid is not detected as flowing through fluid outlet <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some examples, a fluid delivery indicator for fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> may be implemented as a check valve that moves in response to fluid flowing through fluid outlet <b>14</b>. The check valve can be positioned in fluid outlet <b>14</b>, fluid pump <b>18</b>, locking member <b>44</b>, or another location suitable for detecting fluid flow through fluid outlet <b>14</b>. The check valve may move in response to fluid flow through fluid outlet <b>14</b>, causing activation of the product delivery indicator. For example, the check valve may include a rare earth magnet that moves relative to a Hall Effect sensor as fluid flows or stops flowing through fluid outlet <b>14</b>. The Hall Effect sensor may detect changes in a magnetic field caused by the moving check valve, resulting in activation or deactivation of the product delivery indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As another example, fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> can include an radio frequency identification (RFID) tag reader positioned to read an RFID tag on fluid reservoir <b>12</b>. When fluid reservoir <b>12</b> includes an RFID tag and is inserted into docking station <b>16</b>, the RFID tag read can read information stored on the RFID tag. For example, the RFID tag may store information indicative of the fluid stored within the reservoir and information indicating what to order to order as the fluid is depleted (e.g., manufacturer names, product codes, or the like).</p>
