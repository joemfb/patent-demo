<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a recuperator burner for heating a volume such as a furnace space, or also the interior space of a jet pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recuperator burners are used e.g. for the direct or indirect heating of industrial furnaces. In direct heating, the oxidation of the fuel takes place in the furnace space. In indirect heating, for example by means of a jet pipe, the combustion takes place within a pipe (jet pipe) that extends into the furnace space but is closed relative to said furnace space, thus causing said pipe to be heated and to emit thermal radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An example of a recuperator burner, with or without jet pipe, is disclosed by document EP 0 685 683 B1. Herein, the recuperator is located in the furnace wall and has a typical length of 400 mm and, depending on burner output, a diameter of 100-300 mm. This recuperator consists of ribbed segments of high-temperature cast steel or also of ceramic material. In order to reduce the generation of nitrogen oxide, a strong exhaust gas recirculation is established in the heated volume, thus leading to a so-called &#x201c;flameless oxidation.&#x201d; This operation is also referred to as FLOX&#xae; operation (FLOX is a registered trademark of WS-Warmeprozesstechnik GmbH). Burners of this design have an efficiency of 65 to 75%.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The same publication also discloses a regenerator burner. This regenerator burner comprises two heat-storing regenerators that are alternately heated by exhaust gas, or they release their thermal energy to the supplied combustion air. Such regenerator burners achieve an efficiency of up to 90%. However, due to the control arrangement required for the alternating operation of the two regenerators to achieve the constant flow reversals, such an arrangement causes increased expenses and efforts for installation and control.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a recuperator burner with simplified operability and improved operating efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a highly efficient recuperator burner, which comprises at least one combustion chamber for warm-up operation and is otherwise set up for FLOX&#xae; operation, and a recuperator for preheating combustion air by means of thermal exhaust gas energy in a counter-current heat exchange mode via heat exchanger pipes, each heat exchanger pipe has, in a heat exchange section thereof, a flattened gap cross-section and, at its end facing a volume to be heated, a nozzle cross-section, which differs from the flattened gap cross-section of the heat exchanger pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The recuperator burner in accordance with the invention comprises a recuperator that contains several pipes of heat-resistant material, said pipes being used for preheating the combustion air and potentially also the fuel gas or a part thereof when low-energy gases such as, for example, landfill gases are used as fuel. The heat exchanger pipes of the recuperator burner are flattened so as to form in the section provided for heat exchange, an interior space with a flattened gap cross-section. Since the heat transfer coefficient &#x3b1; is inversely proportional to the gap width s, when a laminar flow exists in the gap, extremely high &#x3b1; values are achieved with small gap widths. Preferably, the pipes are exposed to the exhaust gas on the outside the combustion air flows through the pipe interior. On their end facing the gas volume to be heated, the pipes have a nozzle cross-section that differs from the gap cross-section. The nozzle cross-section is for example circular. This cross-section permits the acceleration of the combustion air flow and the formation of an exit jet that enters the volume to be heated at high speed and causes a recirculation of the exhaust gas. Preferably, the nozzle cross-section is dimensioned in such a manner that jet velocities of e.g., 100 m/sec. are achieved. As a result of this, an exhaust gas recirculation factor of e.g. 4 or 5 is reached, thus largely preventing the development of temperature peaks and the generation of thermal NOx in the exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the gap cross-section is greater than the nozzle cross-section. Consequently, a lower flow rate is present in the gap region than in the nozzle. The heat exchanger pipes are preferably provided with at least one tapered end, said end having a circumference that is smaller than the circumference of the flattened heat exchanger pipe section. Preferably, such a pipe is manufactured in that a pipe having a circumference corresponding approximately to the circumference of the later heat exchanger pipe section is tapered on at least one end, preferably however at both ends, i.e., the diameter is reduced, thus reducing the pipe cross-section, for example, by a forming process. Subsequently, the heat exchanger pipe section is pressed flat in order to provide the desired gap shape. In this instance, preferably a pipe gap width s&#x3c;3 mm and a pipe gap length b&#x3e;4 s are maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the cold side, the ends of the heat exchanger pipes may be mounted&#x2014;for example, by soldering&#x2014;in a sealed manner in the openings of an orifice plate. Preferably, the heat exchanger pipes are attached only at one end. On the hot end, they may optionally be fixed to each other by joining means such as a ribbon or a welding spot, or they may remain free. In either case, they may freely expand. All the pipes may have the same shape and may be manufactured in series production.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is possible&#x2014;by appropriate bending of the hot ends of the heat exchanger pipes&#x2014;to pre-specify a jet direction as desired. For example, jet pipes arranged in a circle may have nozzle ends whose axes are located on the envelope of a cone.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">On the one hand, said heat exchanger pipes achieve a good heat transfer from the exhaust gas to the combustion air and, on the other hand, they generate only a minimal loss of pressure. This is achieved, in particular, when the cross-section of the flattened gap-shaped section is greater than the cross-section of the discharge nozzle. In so doing, the flow speed in the gap cross-section becomes smaller than in the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, the exhaust gas passages between the pipes may be configured with a slightly greater gap width in order to reduce the pressure loss also in the exhaust gas passages. The heat transfer that is potentially reduced as a result of this can be compensated for by auxiliary heating surfaces in the form of corrugated sheet metal inserts. These may act at the same time as spacers between the heat exchange pipes. The corrugated sheet metal inserts and/or the heat exchange pipes may furthermore be coated with a catalytically active material&#x2014;at least in some areas&#x2014;so as to act as catalysts for exhaust gas cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The flattened pipes are preferably arranged in the form of a circle or a ring. They may be arranged in several rings that are concentric to each other. If uniform flattened pipes are used, gaps may occur in the individual rings, which may be closed by webs.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The recuperator burner is designed so as to bring about a flameless oxidation in a heated volume in that, due to the preheated air which is being injected in jets, an exhaust gas recirculation in front of the recuperator burner is established whereby supplied fuel is oxidized in a high-speed gas stream having a high content of inert gas. This mode of operation is suitable for a furnace space that has been preheated to above 800&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, it is possible to provide another mode of operation for operating the recuperator burner in a furnace space at a temperature below the ignition temperature (approximately 800&#xb0; C.). To do so, the recuperator burner comprises a combustion chamber, into which at least a portion of the combustion air and of the fuel gas may be introduced for combustion therein. In the combustion chamber, a flame is generated, whose hot exhaust gases possibly together with flames exit the burner and thus heat the volume.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, a third mode of operation may be provided, this mode being potentially referred to as boosted or assisted FLOX&#xae; mode. This mode of operation is appropriate for operating the recuperator burner as long as temperatures below the ignition temperature prevail in the heated volume. In this mode, part of the oxidation is effected in the combustion chamber of the burner. The hot exhaust gases in this kind of combustion enter&#x2014;together with the combustion air and a portion of the fuel&#x2014;in jets the furnace space and, there, assist in the oxidation of fuel injected into the furnace space.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention and advantageous embodiments thereof will become more readily apparent from the following description on the basis of the accompanying drawings. The description is restricted to essential aspects of the invention and to various situations. The drawings disclose additional details.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a recuperator burner <b>1</b> which is used for heating a furnace space <b>2</b> and, to do so, is arranged in an opening of a furnace wall <b>3</b>. The recuperator burner comprises a burner head <b>4</b> for supplying combustion air and fuel to the burner and for removing exhaust gases. To accomplish this, a FLOX&#xae; gas connection <b>5</b>, a warm-up gas connection <b>6</b>, a FLOX&#xae; air connection <b>7</b>, a warm-up air connection <b>8</b> and an exhaust gas connection <b>9</b> for the exhaust gas exit are provided on the burner head <b>4</b>. The FLOX&#xae; gas connection <b>5</b> and FLOX&#xae; air connection <b>7</b> are used for the supply of liquid vaporous or gaseous fuel and air for the operation of the recuperator burner <b>1</b> with flameless oxidation in the furnace space <b>2</b>. The warm-up gas connection <b>6</b> and the warm-up air connection <b>8</b> are used to heat up a combustion chamber <b>10</b> in the recuperator burner <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The recuperator burner includes a combustion chamber <b>10</b> which is formed by a pipe <b>11</b> with an open end that tapers toward the furnace side, and is supported at its other end by a flange plate <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flange plate <b>12</b> is disposed between the burner head <b>1</b> and a flange <b>13</b> with appropriate seals interposed between the burner head and the flange <b>13</b> which may be supported via a tubular socket <b>14</b> on the furnace wall <b>3</b>. The flange plate <b>12</b> is provided with a number of bores that are preferably located on concentric circles around the pipe <b>11</b> and the central axis <b>15</b> of said pipe. Inserted in the bores are heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> consisting for example of high-temperature steel. The pipes <b>16</b> are sealingly secured in the flange <b>12</b> by suitable joining means such as, for example, brazing solder connections. The bores extend in the burner head to an air distributor channel <b>17</b>. Possibly, a few of the bores may extend to an additional distributor channel <b>18</b> which is in communication with a separate connection <b>19</b>. Preferably, the connection <b>19</b> is arranged concentrically in the FLOX&#xae; air connection <b>7</b>. In this manner, normally sufficient air is supplied to the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> to maintain the flameless oxidation. However, it is also possible to supply other fluids such as, for example, combustible gas, to the distributor channel <b>18</b> via the connection <b>19</b>, as the distributor channel <b>18</b> is separate from the air distributor channel <b>17</b>, in order to preheat said gas.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> are arranged in an annular exhaust gas channel <b>20</b> which is formed by an outer pipe <b>21</b> which is supported at one end by the flange plate <b>12</b>. The exhaust gas channel leads to an exhaust gas collector <b>22</b> in the burner head <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the pipe <b>11</b>, there is a fuel pipe <b>23</b> in the form of a central gas lance that is arranged so as to be concentric to the central axis <b>15</b> for supplying fuel to the furnace <b>2</b> for FLOX&#xae; operation. Concentric with the fuel pipe <b>23</b>, there is another pipe <b>24</b> communicating with the preheating gas connection <b>6</b>, whereby gas discharge openings <b>25</b> are provided at the end of said pipe <b>24</b>. These gas discharge openings generate fuel jets which are inclined with respect to the central axis <b>15</b>. At some distance from the gas exit openings <b>25</b>, a perforated plate <b>26</b> for vortexing the air which has been introduced into the combustion chamber <b>10</b> is provided on the pipe <b>24</b>. In addition, preferably an ignition and monitoring electrode <b>27</b> extends into the combustion chamber <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, all of the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> have essentially the same configuration. Provided between them are filler elements, for example, in the form of corrugated sheet metal elements <b>28</b> that are particularly apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The corrugations of said elements are in contact with the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> that are arranged in several circles concentric with the central axis <b>15</b>, thus holding the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> in a spaced relationship. In addition, they transfer the thermal energy absorbed from the exhaust gas stream in a convective manner&#x2014;and by heat radiation&#x2014;to the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b>. The corrugated sheet metal elements <b>28</b> consist of high-temperature steel, for example. Their corrugations preferably extend parallel to the central axis <b>15</b>. In addition, as is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, strips <b>29</b> may be provided between the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> in order to avoid the formation of excessively large spaces between the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b>. The heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> as well as the corrugated sheet metal elements <b>28</b> may be coated fully or in part with catalytically active material <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>a</i>, preferably for exhaust gas treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Together with any strips <b>29</b> present and with the corrugated sheet metal elements <b>28</b>, and ultimately also the pipes <b>11</b> and <b>21</b>, the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> form a recuperator <b>30</b> which, for example, has an outside diameter D of 130 mm (FIG. <b>2</b>), a length L of 400 mm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and consists for example of 72 pipes. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> one heat exchanger pipe <b>16</b> of this recuperator <b>30</b> is shown representative for all other heat exchanger pipes. The heat exchanger pipe has a flattened section <b>31</b> for heat exchange and end sections <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> as well as intermediate transition sections. As is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the section <b>31</b> has a different cross-section than the section <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) or the section <b>32</b>. The section <b>31</b> defines a gap cross-section <b>34</b> having a gap length b that preferably is more than four times the gap width s. Referring to the present exemplary embodiment, for example, s=1.5 mm and b=15 mm, each measured from inside area to inside area of the gap cross-section <b>34</b>. As opposed to this, the section <b>33</b> defines a nozzle cross-section <b>35</b> having, for example, a diameter d=2.5 mm. Consequently the area of the gap cross-section <b>34</b> is greater than that of the nozzle cross-section <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The nozzle cross-section <b>35</b> may be formed integrally with the heat exchanger pipe <b>16</b> or it may be formed by an attached component. In addition, the section <b>33</b> may be straight or, as shown, bent in a simple, arcuate or also s-shaped manner. The heat exchanger pipe is manufactured, for example, starting with a pipe having a larger diameter. The pipe is tapered at its ends <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, for example, by means of an appropriate forming process, as is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The original diameter is maintained in a section <b>38</b> located between the ends <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>. The thusly produced preform <b>39</b> of the heat exchanger pipe <b>16</b> has initially also a circular cross-section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This circular cross-section is subsequently flattened during a plastic deforming process in order to produce the gap cross-section <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the gap cross-section <b>34</b> is delimited by flat walls <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the wall <b>40</b> and/or the wall <b>41</b> may be provided with same-size or different-size nubs <b>42</b> that extend into the gap cross-section <b>34</b> and are preferably in contact with each other. These nubs <b>42</b> form a support for the walls <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> in order to prevent the gap cross-section <b>34</b> from collapsing. The nubs <b>42</b> can also be used to create a welding joint between the walls <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>. This allows the construction of particularly thin-walled heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The recuperator burner <b>1</b> as described so far has a total heat transfer surface of for example 0.95 m<sup>2</sup>. It operates as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For heating up the furnace space <b>2</b>, natural gas is supplied via the warm-up gas connection <b>6</b>, and air is supplied via the warm-up air connection <b>8</b>, for example. A flame is ignited in the combustion chamber <b>10</b>, whereby the hot exhaust gases of said flame enter into the furnace space <b>2</b> in order to heat said space. Once this has taken place, the recuperator burner <b>1</b> may go into FLOX&#xae; mode.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To do so, the air supply to the FLOX&#xae; air connection <b>7</b> and the gas supply to the FLOX&#xae; gas connection <b>5</b> are reversed. The combustion air now flows through the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> into the furnace space and forms there the jets <b>43</b> as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The fuel is conducted through the fuel pipe <b>23</b> into the furnace space <b>2</b>, as is indicated by an arrow <b>44</b>. An exhaust gas recirculation is generated (arrow <b>45</b>). Only a part of the circulatory combustion gas and exhaust gas reaches the exhaust gas channel <b>20</b> (arrow <b>46</b>) and is discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An air supply of 36 m<sup>3</sup>/h for the combustion of 35 kW natural gas is preheated from 20&#xb0; C. to 880&#xb0; C. when the exhaust. gas flows at 1000&#xb0; C. from the furnace into the recuperator <b>30</b>. The exhaust gas temperature at the exhaust gas connection <b>9</b> is 300&#xb0; C., and the exhaust gas loss is 14%. At half-load (17 kW), the air preheating temperature increases to 950&#xb0; C., whereas the exhaust gas temperature decreases to 230&#xb0; C., and the exhaust gas loss drops to 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The seventy-two air jets formed at the open ends of the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> suck in a multiple amount of furnace gas over a short path length, so that the temperature in the reaction zone remains below 1500&#xb0; C., thus suppressing the thermal NOx formation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Comparison with Prior Art:</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is apparent from the above table that, with the same burner volume, the energy consumption is lowered by 16.3% and, in addition, the use of materials can be reduced by 50%. Overall, a robust and highly efficient recuperator burner is provided. This burner comprises, optionally, at least one combustion chamber for warm-up mode and is otherwise set up for FLOX&#xae; mode. A transition operation is possible in that part of the fuel, for example, 10 to 40% of the fuel, is supplied to the combustion chamber <b>10</b>, whereas the other part of the fuel is conducted, via the central fuel pipe <b>22</b>, into the furnace space. Accordingly, one part of the combustion air of the combustion chamber <b>10</b> and another part are conducted through the recuperator <b>30</b> into the furnace space. In this way, it is possible to achieve a FLOX&#xae; operation in a not yet sufficiently heated furnace chamber. In cases of applications with very long warm-up phases or with furnace space temperature which is deliberately kept low, at least a part of the fuel is oxidized under FLOX&#xae; conditions, thus achieving an overall reduction of NOx emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With the present invention, a reliable, highly efficient recuperator burner is provided. It comprises, at least optionally, a combustion chamber for warm-up operation and is otherwise set up for FLOX&#xae; operation. As the recuperator <b>30</b> for preheating combustion air by means of thermal exhaust gas energy operates in a counter-current mode, the heat exchanger is very efficient. pipes <b>16</b> are provided. The heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> have, in a section <b>31</b> designed for heat exchange, a flattened gap cross-section <b>34</b> and, at their end <b>33</b> facing the volume <b>2</b>, a gap cross-section <b>34</b> that is different from the nozzle cross-section <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Preferably, each of the heat exchanger pipes <b>16</b> has a tapered nozzle end <b>23</b> which has a circumference that is smaller than the circumference of the pipe sections <b>31</b> provided for heat exchange. The heat exchanger pipe <b>16</b> is preferably made from a seamless pipe as a single piece.</p>
