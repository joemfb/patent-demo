<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention generally relates to golf clubs, and more specifically to golf clubs having an improved hosel connection that provides interchangeability between a shaft with a club head.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to improve their game, golfers often customize their equipment to fit their particular swing. In the absence of a convenient way to make shafts and club heads interchangeable, a store or a business offering custom fitting must either have a large number of clubs with specific characteristics, or must change a particular club using a complicated disassembly and reassembly process. If, for example, a golfer wants to try a golf club shaft with different flex characteristics, or use a club head with a different mass, center of gravity, or moment of inertia, in the past it has not been practical to make such changes. Golf equipment manufacturers have been increasing the variety of clubs available to golfers. For example, a particular model of golf club may be offered in several different loft angles and lie angles to suit a particular golfer's needs. In addition, golfers can choose shafts, whether metal or graphite, and adjust the length of the shaft to suit their swing. Recently, golf clubs have emerged that allow shaft and club head components, such as adjustable weights, to be interchanged to facilitate this customization process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example is U.S. Pat. No. 3,524,646 to Wheeler for a Golf Club Assembly. The Wheeler patent discloses a putter having a grip and a putter head, both of which are detachable from a shaft. Fastening members, provided on the upper and lower ends of the shaft, have internal threads, which engage the external threads provided on both the lower end of the grip and the upper end of the putter head shank to secure these components to the shaft. The lower portion of the shaft further includes a flange, which contacts the upper end of the putter head shank, when the putter head is coupled to the shaft. This design produces an unaesthetic bulge at the top of the shaft and another unaesthetic bulge at the bottom of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 4,943,059 to Morell for a Golf Club Having Removable Head. The Morell patent discloses a putter golf club including a releasable golf club head and an elongated golf club shaft. The club head hosel has a plug containing a threaded axial bore. A threaded rod is retained on the connector portion of the shaft, and is threaded into the axial bore of the plug of the club head for operatively connecting the shaft to the head.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,442 to Walker for Golf Clubs with Quick Release Heads. The Walker patent discloses a golf club in which the club head is secured to the shaft by a coupling rod and a quick release pin. The upper end of the coupling rod has external threads that engage the internal threads formed in the lower portion of the shaft. The lower end of the coupling rod, which is inserted into the hosel of the club head, has diametric apertures that align with diametric apertures in the hosel to receive the quick release pin.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 5,722,901 to Barron et al. for a Releasable Fastening Structure for Trial Golf Club Shafts and Heads. The Barron patent discloses a bayonet-style releasable fastening structure for a golf club and shaft. The club head hosel has a fastening pin in its bore that extends diametrically. The head portion of the shaft has two opposing &#x201c;U&#x201d; or &#x201c;J&#x201d; shaped channels. The head end portion of shaft fastens on the hosel pin through axial and rotary motion. A spring in the hosel maintains this fastenable interconnection, but allows manually generated, axially inward hosel motion for quick assembly and disassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 5,951,411 to Wood et al. for a Hosel Coupling Assembly and Method of Using Same. The Wood patent discloses a golf club including a club head, an interchangeable shaft, and a hosel with an anti-rotation device. The hosel contains an alignment member with an angular surface that is fixed, by a stud, within the hosel bore. A sleeve secured on the shaft end forms another alignment arrangement element and is adapted to engage the alignment element disposed in the hosel bore. A capture mechanism disposed on the shaft engages the hosel to fix releasably the shaft relative to the club head.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another example is U.S. Publ. Pat. App. No. 2001/0007835 A1 to Baron for a Modular Golf Club System and Method. The Baron publication discloses a modular golf club including club head, hosel, and shaft. A hosel is attached to a shaft and rotation is prevented rotation by complementary interacting surfaces, adhesive bonding or mechanical fit. The club head and shaft are removably joined together by a collet-type connection.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another example is U.S. Pub. Pat. App. No. 2006/0105855 A1 to Cackett et al. for a Golf Club with Interchangeable Head-Shaft Connections. The Cackett publication discloses a golf club that uses a sleeve/tube arrangement instead of a traditional hosel to connect the interchangeable shaft to the club head in an effort to reduce material weight and provide for quick installation. A mechanical fastener (screw) entering the club head through the sole plate is used to secure the shaft to the club head.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,547,673 to Roark for an Interchangeable Golf Club Head and Adjustable Handle System. The Roark patent discloses a golf club with a quick release for detaching a club head from a shaft. The quick release is a two-piece connector including a lower connector, which is secured to the hosel of the club head, and an upper connector, which is secured to the lower portion of the shaft. The upper connector has a pin and a ball catch that both protrude radially outward from the lower end of the upper connector. The upper end of the lower connector has a corresponding slot formed therein for receiving the upper connector pin, and a separate hole for receiving the ball catch. When the shaft is coupled to the club head, the lower connector hole retains the ball catch to secure the shaft to the club head.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other published patent documents, such as U.S. Pat. No. 7,083,529 and U.S. Publ. Pat. App. Nos. 2006/0287125, 2006/0293115, 2006/0293116 and 2006/0281575, disclose interchangeable shafts and club heads with anti-rotation devices located therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There remains a need in the art for golf clubs with an improved connection that provides a method for quickly and easily interchanging the shaft, removable weights and other attachments with the club head.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention is directed to a quick connection system for connecting the shaft to a club head and for changing the shaft or the club head to optimize the golfer's strength to the playing conditions. Such a system can be utilized or customized for various applications, including, but not limited, to the shaft-club head connection, the insertion of adjustable weights in the club head, and the connection of a sole plate to the club head. Several embodiments of the present invention are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Inventive connection system <b>10</b> is designed for club fitters to repeatedly change shaft or club head combinations during a fitting session. Inventive connection system <b>10</b> is designed to give fitting accounts maximum fitting options with a system that is fast and easy to use.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, connection system <b>10</b> releasably connects club head <b>12</b> to shaft <b>14</b>, such that different shafts <b>14</b> can be connected to different club heads <b>12</b>. Connection system <b>10</b> comprises a two-part hosel, i.e., shaft serrated hosel <b>16</b> and driver serrated hosel <b>18</b> and internally threaded shaft insert <b>20</b>. Serrated surface <b>17</b> of shaft hosel <b>16</b> and serrated surface <b>19</b> driver hosel <b>18</b> are sized to mate with each other to minimize or prevent relative rotation between shaft hosel <b>16</b> and driver hosel <b>18</b>. Preferably, each serrated surface comprises a plurality of corresponding teeth. Connection system <b>10</b> further comprises driver sole insert <b>22</b> and screw <b>24</b>, which are connected to club head <b>12</b> on the sole side, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, shaft <b>14</b> is at least partially hollow and is sized and dimensioned to receive and retain internally threaded shaft insert <b>20</b> therewithin. Preferably, shaft insert <b>20</b> is securely attached to shaft <b>14</b> by means of adhesives, epoxies or similar materials. Shaft serrated hosel <b>16</b> is sized and dimensioned to fit on the outside of shaft <b>14</b>. A predetermined length <b>26</b> of shaft <b>14</b> is positioned below shaft serrated hosel <b>16</b> for insertion into club head <b>12</b>. The internal threads of shaft insert <b>20</b> are adapted to receive the external threads of fastener <b>24</b>, such as screw <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, driver serrated hosel <b>18</b> has external threads, as shown, and is threaded into the top of bore <b>28</b> of club head <b>12</b>. Adhesives or epoxies can also be used to affix driver serrated hosel <b>18</b> to bore <b>28</b>. At the bottom of bore <b>28</b>, driver sole insert <b>22</b> is inserted into bore <b>28</b> and affixed therein. Preferably, driver sole insert <b>22</b> is serrated or threaded on the outside surface to increase the surface area to adhesives or epoxies. The assembled shaft <b>14</b> with shaft insert <b>20</b> and shaft hosel <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is inserted through driver hosel <b>18</b> and into bore <b>28</b>. Screw <b>24</b> is inserted through driver sole insert <b>22</b> and is threaded into shaft insert <b>20</b> to secure shaft <b>14</b> to club head <b>12</b>. Preferably, distal tip <b>30</b> of shaft <b>14</b> is spaced apart from the top of driver sole insert <b>22</b> and shaft <b>14</b> and driver sole insert <b>22</b> is separated by gap <b>32</b>. Gap <b>32</b> ensures that screw <b>24</b> can fully pull shaft <b>14</b> downward toward the sole of club head <b>12</b> so that serrated surfaces <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> fully engage each other to minimize relative rotation between the two hosels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> thereby minimizing relative rotation between shaft <b>14</b> and club head <b>12</b>. In other words, gap <b>32</b> ensures that screw <b>24</b> does not &#x201c;bottom out&#x201d; inside threaded shaft insert <b>20</b> so that serrated hosels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> can fully mate with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Optionally, bore <b>28</b> has ledge <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> formed integrally thereon, e.g., through the casting process, to abut driver sole insert <b>22</b> to provide additional structural support for driver sole insert <b>22</b> and screw <b>24</b>. Alternatively, driver sole insert <b>22</b> can be formed integrally on bore <b>28</b>. These alternatives are applicable to all of the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a fully assembled golf club is shown. Serrated hosels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> form a single hosel and the serrated lines <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> separating the two hosels are preferably located above the top of club head <b>12</b>. The advantage of locating the anti-rotation device, i.e., shaft serrated hosel <b>16</b> and driver serrated hosel <b>18</b>, above the club head is that no additional mass is added, thereby preserving the mass properties of the club head and eliminating a protrusion at the shaft/hosel intersection. The anti-rotation device uses a standard hosel to make both the shaft serrated hosel and the driver serrated hosel. This means there is no weight gained or lost from the device, which in turn means no change in moment of inertia or center of gravity. Furthermore, serrated lines <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> add a visual distinction to the golf club and readily identify the golf club as an interchangeable golf club.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Driver sole insert <b>22</b> and shaft threaded insert <b>20</b>, as well as hosel insert <b>16</b> and/or hosel insert <b>18</b>, can be made out of aluminum, stainless steel or titanium. Screw <b>24</b> can be any threaded screw, and is preferably a TORX&#x2122; drive flat head screw and the sole insert <b>22</b> is tapered so that the head of screw <b>24</b> can be flushed with sole insert <b>22</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, another embodiment of connection system <b>10</b> is shown. In this embodiment, the two-part hosel of the first embodiment is replaced by a keyed anti-rotation device. This keyed anti-rotation device comprises angled cut-out <b>36</b> on the distal tip of shaft <b>14</b>. Shaft <b>14</b> is also hollow and has threaded shaft insert <b>20</b> inserted therein and conventional hosel <b>40</b> disposed thereon. Driver sole insert <b>22</b>&#x2032; has angled surface <b>38</b> sized and dimensioned to match cut-out <b>36</b>. In this embodiment, shaft <b>14</b> is inserted into driver sole insert <b>22</b>&#x2032;, and angled cut-out <b>36</b> is keyed to angled surface <b>38</b> as screw <b>24</b> is threaded into shaft insert <b>20</b> to minimize or prevent relative rotation between shaft <b>14</b> and driver sole insert <b>22</b>&#x2032;/club head <b>12</b>. An advantage of this embodiment is that an anti-rotation device can be added without adding substantial weight to the club head thereby minimizing the effect on the club's swing weight.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, another embodiment of connection system <b>10</b> is shown. In this embodiment, bore <b>28</b> does not extend though club head <b>12</b>. Club head <b>12</b> has hosel <b>42</b>, which has at least one and preferably two or more channels <b>44</b>. Channel <b>44</b> has entry leg <b>46</b> and locking leg <b>48</b>. Leg <b>46</b> is adapted to receive post <b>50</b> on shaft <b>14</b>. After post <b>50</b> travels through entry leg <b>46</b>, it passes transverse leg <b>47</b> before being received and held in locking leg <b>48</b>. Disposed within hosel <b>42</b> is spring <b>52</b> that exerts an upward force on shaft <b>14</b> to hold securely post <b>50</b> in locking leg <b>48</b>. Spring <b>52</b> is selected so that it can exert a sufficient force to hold post <b>50</b> within channel <b>44</b>. Preferably, spring <b>52</b> has a spring constant from about 5 to about 100 pounds-force/inch. More preferably, the spring constant can be in the range of about 20 to about 75 pounds-force/inch and most preferably about 33 pounds-force/inch. A golfer can conveniently insert shaft <b>14</b> into hosel <b>42</b> after aligning post <b>50</b> to leg <b>46</b>. Thereafter, shaft <b>14</b> is rotated along transverse leg <b>47</b> and afterward spring <b>52</b> pushes shaft <b>14</b> up locking leg <b>48</b>. Post <b>50</b> and channel <b>44</b> is also known as a bayonet mount or connection.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although channel <b>44</b> is illustrated as a &#x201c;J-shaped&#x201d; channel, it can have any shape, e.g., &#x201c;U&#x201d;, &#x201c;L&#x201d;, &#x201c;S&#x201d;, &#x201c;V&#x201d; or &#x201c;W&#x201d; shape. Also, preferably leg <b>46</b> is preferably deep so that as post <b>50</b> is moved down into hosel <b>42</b>, more of shaft <b>14</b> overlaps hosel <b>42</b> to increase mechanical stability. Alternatively, the top of locking leg may have a reduced diameter section to hold post <b>50</b> by press-fit or by increased friction. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the reduced diameter section can be a triangular section. The reduced diameter section can also be a figure-eight or waist section.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates another variation of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, where hosel <b>42</b> has two or more channels <b>44</b>. Channels <b>44</b> can have the shapes or configurations of those described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 8A</figref>. An advantage of this embodiment is that having two or more locking legs <b>48</b> prevents twisting at the lower end of the leg and it offers a back up should one of the locking legs <b>48</b> fail.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10D</figref>, another embodiment of connection system <b>10</b> comprises a first rotatable hosel sheath <b>70</b> with internal threads and a second threaded, hollow hosel part <b>72</b>, which is fixedly attached to club head <b>74</b>. Preferably, second threaded hosel part <b>72</b> is made integral to club head <b>74</b>, and hosel sheath <b>70</b> and hosel part <b>72</b> are sized and dimensioned to threadably attach to each other to connect shaft <b>14</b> to club head <b>74</b>. Connection system <b>10</b> further comprises an anti-rotation device, made up of first serrated surface <b>76</b> disposed on inner shaft insert <b>80</b> and corresponding second serrated surface <b>78</b> disposed on second threaded hosel part <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To assemble the club, upper end <b>82</b> of inner shaft insert <b>80</b> is inserted into the threaded end of rotatable hosel sheath <b>70</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>. End <b>82</b> is sized and dimensioned to pass through aperture <b>84</b> of hosel sheath <b>70</b>, but the top portion of serrated surface <b>76</b> is retained within hosel sheath <b>70</b>. End <b>82</b> is then inserted into aperture <b>86</b> and finally attached to outer shaft insert <b>88</b>. After end <b>82</b> of inner shaft insert <b>80</b> is fixedly connected to outer shaft insert <b>88</b>, there is sufficient clearance for first hosel sheath <b>70</b> to be freely rotatable to connect to second hosel part <b>72</b>. Preferably, the length of end <b>82</b> is dimensioned so that once end <b>82</b> is fully inserted into aperture <b>86</b>, there remains sufficient clearance between outer shaft insert <b>88</b> and hosel sheath <b>70</b> for hosel sheath <b>70</b> to rotate freely. Outer shaft insert <b>88</b> is then inserted into shaft <b>14</b>. Alternatively, inner sheath insert <b>80</b> is inserted into and attached directly to shaft <b>14</b> and outer sheath insert <b>88</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although this embodiment of the present invention is particularly suited to hosel sheath <b>70</b> made of metal, hosel sheath <b>70</b> can be made of high impact transparent or translucent materials. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, polymethacrylate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polycarbonate (Lexan&#xae;), and glycol modified polyethylene teraphthalate.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Afterward, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>, shaft <b>14</b>, with decorative ferrule <b>90</b>, hosel sheath <b>70</b> and both shaft inserts <b>80</b> and <b>88</b>, is assembled with club head <b>74</b>. More specifically, lower end <b>83</b> of inner shaft <b>80</b> is inserted into second hosel part <b>72</b> to allow corresponding threads of hosel sheath <b>70</b> and hosel part <b>72</b> to mate and connect shaft <b>14</b> to club head <b>74</b>. End <b>83</b> may extend partially or fully into club head <b>74</b>. Serrated surfaces <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> also mate to minimize relative rotation between the shaft and the club head.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11D</figref>, another embodiment of connection system <b>10</b> comprises a rotatable hosel reverse sheath <b>92</b> with internal threads and a threaded, hollow shaft insert <b>94</b>, which is fixedly attached to shaft <b>14</b>. Hosel reverse sheath <b>92</b> and shaft insert <b>94</b> are sized and dimensioned to threadably attach to each other to connect shaft <b>14</b> to club head <b>98</b>. Connection system <b>10</b> further comprises an anti-rotation device, made up of first serrated surface <b>100</b> disposed on club insert <b>102</b> and corresponding second serrated surface <b>104</b> disposed on shaft insert <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To assemble the club, upper end <b>96</b> of shaft insert <b>94</b> is inserted into and fixedly connected to shaft <b>14</b> for example by adhesive or epoxy, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. Preferably, the length of end <b>96</b> is dimensioned so that there is a sufficient bond between shaft insert <b>94</b> and shaft <b>14</b>. Threads <b>106</b> and second serrated surface <b>104</b> should remain outside of shaft <b>14</b> and next to decorative ferrule <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, lower end <b>110</b> of club insert <b>102</b> is inserted into reverse sheath <b>92</b>. End <b>110</b> is sized and dimensioned to pass through aperture <b>112</b> of reverse sheath <b>92</b>, but the bottom portion of serrated surface <b>100</b> is retained within rotatable reverse sheath <b>92</b>. End <b>110</b> is then inserted into hosel <b>114</b> and is attached thereto. End <b>110</b> may extend partially or fully into club head <b>98</b> so long as there is sufficient clearance for reverse sheath <b>92</b> to rotate freely. To assemble the club, the assembled version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> is inserted into the assembled version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>. Serrated surfaces <b>100</b> and <b>104</b> mate to minimize relative rotation between the shaft and the club head and reverse hosel sheath <b>92</b> is rotated so that its internal threads mate with threads <b>106</b> of shaft insert <b>94</b> to connect club head <b>98</b> to shaft <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12E</figref>, another embodiment of connection system <b>10</b> comprises hollow shaft insert <b>54</b> connecting shaft <b>14</b> to club head <b>56</b>. Shaft insert <b>54</b> comprises affixing leg <b>57</b> and non-affixing leg <b>58</b>, which have uneven lengths, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. Hosel <b>55</b> has receiving area <b>59</b> adapted to receive shaft insert <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">To assemble the club, shaft tip <b>60</b> is maintained below decorative ferrule <b>61</b> disposed on shaft <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>. Upper end <b>62</b> of shaft insert <b>54</b> is inserted into shaft tip <b>60</b>, and shaft insert <b>54</b> is fixedly attached to shaft <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Afterward, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref>, shaft <b>14</b>, with decorative ferrule <b>61</b> and shaft insert <b>54</b> is assembled with club head <b>56</b>. Specifically, lower end <b>63</b> of shaft insert <b>54</b> is inserted into receiving area <b>59</b> to connect shaft <b>14</b> to club head <b>56</b>. More specifically, affixing leg <b>57</b> is inserted into aperture <b>64</b> and threadably attached to sole nut <b>65</b> in bore <b>66</b> of club head <b>56</b>, while non-affixing leg <b>58</b> is mated to receiving area <b>59</b> to minimize relative rotation between the shaft and the club head. Preferably, non-affixing leg <b>58</b> is conical, wedge, or other key shape.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 12E</figref> and <b>14</b>A to <b>15</b>G, the embodiments of the present invention are illustrated with various single thread fasteners. These fasteners can be right-handed or left-handed and can have single thread or multiple threads. These fasteners need to be sufficiently strong to withstand repeated impacts between the golf club and the balls. An impact can create a force of up to 2,000 lbs. and depending on the location of the impact on the hitting face, connection system <b>10</b> may experience a torque load of 2,000&#xb7;x, where x is a distance between the impact location and the neutral axis of the club. For example, a toe impact would produce more torque than a center impact. A heel impact would produce more torque (reverse direction) than a center impact. The density of threads and the dimensions of the threads should be designed to withstand the torque produced by toe and heel impacts.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> illustrates the force-flow lines <b>120</b> through a set of threaded fasteners used to clamp two members together. (Further detail can be found in <i>Fundamentals of Machine Component Design </i>by Robert C. Juvinall, copyright 1983, by John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc.) Direct compressive stress, often called bearing, exists between threaded fastener <b>122</b> and corresponding fastener <b>124</b>. Stress (a) is defined as load (P) <b>128</b> divided by the cross sectional area (A) <b>130</b> that exists when the load is acting: &#x3c3;=P/A. In this particular situation, the area used for the P/A stress calculation is projected area <b>132</b> that, for each thread, is &#x3c0;(d<sup>2</sup>&#x2212;d<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>)/4, where d <b>134</b> is outer diameter of fastener cylinder and d<sub>i </sub><b>136</b> is inner diameter of fastener <b>122</b> contact with nut <b>124</b>. The number of threads in contact is t/p, where t is fastener length of engagement <b>138</b> and p is fastener thread pitch, typically reported as inches per thread turn. (In practice, thread pitch is known by its reciprocal of threads per inch.) By substitution, &#x3c3;=(4P/&#x3c0;(d<sup>2</sup>&#x2212;d<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>))&#xb7;p/t. This equation demonstrates the advantage of more threaded contacts in the present invention, which is the strength of a set of threaded fasteners is proportionately increased by increasing the threaded fastener contacts. Preferably, fastener threads per inch is 12 to 36 threads/inch. More preferably, fastener threads per inch is 18 to 30 threads/inch and most preferably 24 threads/inch.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Increasing fastener contacts could increase the golfer's fastener tightening and untightening time, which is undesirable to a method for quickly and easily interchanging the shaft, removable weights and other attachments with the club head. Typically, threaded fasteners comprise a single helical groove <b>140</b> disposed on a cylindrical rod from end thread <b>142</b>, however if the helix angle <b>144</b> is increased other threads may be cut between the grooves of the first thread, so fasteners can have two <b>146</b> or more parallel threads, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. (Further detail can be found in <i>Fundamentals of Machine Component Design </i>by Robert C. Juvinall, copyright 1983, by John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc.) A fastener thread is assumed to be single thread, unless otherwise stated. Lead is the distance a threaded fastener advances axially in one turn. On a single threaded fastener <b>140</b>, the lead <b>148</b> and pitch <b>150</b> are identical; on a double thread fastener <b>146</b>, the lead <b>152</b> is twice the pitch <b>154</b>, etc. The end result is that the threaded fastener will advance twice as far in a single turn on a double thread fastener than it would on a single thread fastener, etc., so double, triple, or more threads are used whenever rapid advance is desired. The advantage of multiple parallel threads is that the thread count of the fastener connection can be increased to strengthen the fastener connection while minimizing the golfer's time to connect the threaded connectors together. Preferably, fasteners will be multiple thread and have the same direction. More preferably, fasteners will be double thread and have the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, a thread may be either right-hand <b>140</b> or left-hand <b>146</b>. Almost all threaded fasteners tighten, or move away from the viewer, when rotated clockwise; a left-hand thread advances when turned counterclockwise. A fastener thread is assumed to be right-hand unless otherwise stated. During use of an assembled golf club, swinging the golf club and hitting the ball tends to tighten or loosen threaded connections, depending on whether the club is right- or left-handed and whether the thread is right- or left-hand. For right-handed golf clubs, left-hand threading would tighten during ball striking; for left-landed golf clubs, right-hand threading would tighten during ball striking. Preferably, fastener threading would be matched to loosening and tightening needs, so that the club can be readily assembled and disassembled before and after use.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14E</figref>, another embodiment of connection system <b>10</b> comprises a wedge hosel <b>160</b> with tapered receiving area <b>162</b>, a hollow club head insert <b>164</b> that is fixedly attached to club head <b>166</b>, and a wedge screw <b>168</b> with a first smooth tapered end <b>170</b> and a second threaded cylindrical end <b>172</b>. Tapered receiving area <b>162</b> of wedge hosel <b>160</b> is adapted to receive tapered head <b>170</b> of wedge screw <b>168</b>. Connection system <b>10</b> further comprises an anti-rotation device, made up of first serrated surface <b>174</b> disposed on wedge hosel <b>160</b> and corresponding second serrated surface <b>176</b> disposed on club head insert <b>164</b>. Additionally, when tapered head <b>170</b> is inserted into receiving area <b>162</b>, tapered head <b>170</b> also minimizes relative rotation between club head <b>166</b> and shaft <b>14</b>. Wedge screw <b>168</b> is preferably aligned substantially perpendicular or orthogonal to the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">To assemble the club, shaft tip <b>178</b> is maintained below decorative ferrule <b>180</b> disposed on shaft <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>. Upper end <b>182</b> of wedge hosel <b>160</b> is sized and dimensioned to fit on the outside of shaft <b>14</b>, and wedge hosel <b>160</b> is fixedly attached to shaft <b>14</b> by means of adhesives, epoxies or similar materials. Shaft tip <b>178</b> is retained within wedge hosel <b>160</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>. Preferably, upper end <b>182</b> of wedge hosel <b>160</b> is flush with decorative ferrule <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Club head insert <b>164</b> is inserted the top of bore <b>184</b> of club head <b>166</b> and affixed therein with diametric aperture <b>186</b> of club head insert <b>164</b> aligned with threaded side aperture <b>188</b> of club head <b>166</b>. Preferably, club head insert <b>164</b> is serrated or threaded on its outside surface to increase the surface area to adhesives or epoxies. Alternatively, club head insert <b>164</b> is made integral to club head <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thereafter, shaft <b>14</b> and wedge hosel <b>160</b> assembly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F</figref>, is inserted the top of bore <b>184</b> of club head <b>166</b>. The interaction of serrated surfaces <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> of wedge hosel <b>160</b> and club head insert <b>164</b> directs shaft <b>14</b> within bore <b>184</b> so that tapered receiving area <b>162</b> of wedge hosel <b>160</b> aligns with side aperture <b>188</b> of club head <b>166</b>. Tapered end <b>170</b> of wedge screw <b>168</b> is inserted through side aperture <b>188</b> of club head <b>166</b> into receiving area <b>162</b> of wedge hosel <b>160</b> and threaded end <b>172</b> of wedge screw <b>168</b> is releasably fastened into threaded side aperture <b>188</b> of club head <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Wedge <b>168</b> may comprise two components: wedge shell <b>169</b> and threaded fastener <b>171</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14G-J</figref>. Fastener <b>171</b> fits within wedge shell <b>169</b> and is rotatably connecting hosel <b>160</b> to club head <b>12</b>. The two-component wedge is similar to the one-component wedge, except that the threads are located on the inner threaded fastener <b>171</b> and wedge shell <b>169</b> has substantially smooth outer surface to fit snugly to receiving area <b>162</b>. The end of wedge shell <b>169</b> can be conical, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14H</figref> or tapered, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14I</figref>. The conical end has an advantage of self-centering as two component wedge <b>168</b> is being inserted into hosel <b>160</b>. The tapered end has an advantage of providing an anti-rotation tendency between wedge <b>168</b> and hosel <b>160</b>. Alternatively, wedge housing <b>169</b> can have a cylindrical outer shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14J</figref>. In the cylindrical embodiment, all of outer surface <b>173</b> is in contact with hosel <b>160</b> to provide enhanced contact between these two parts. A cover <b>175</b> is optionally provided to keep wedge <b>168</b> free of debris.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 15D</figref> illustrate another embodiment of connection system <b>10</b> with a bendable hosel <b>190</b>. Hosel <b>190</b> is designed to bend preferable at section <b>192</b>, where the outer diameter of hosel <b>190</b> has a substantial change. Hosel <b>190</b> can be bent about section <b>192</b> to change the loft and/or lie angle of the golf club. Any bendable hosel with predetermined bends or any hosel with a weakened section can be used. Hosel <b>190</b> can be bent by automatic/motored or hydraulic bending tools, commonly used in golf pro shops, e.g., Steelclub Angle Machine sold by Mitchell Golf Equipment Co., and those used to bend pipes in the plumbing art. Suitable bendable hosels are disclosed in commonly owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/621,754, filed on Jan. 10, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Hosel <b>190</b> should be bendable only by equipment made for bending hosels, and not by impact with golf balls.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Similar to the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14F</figref>, this connection system also has an anti-rotation device comprising a first serrated surface <b>194</b> on the hosel and a corresponding second serrated surface <b>196</b> on hollow club head insert <b>198</b>. To assemble the golf club, shaft insert <b>200</b> with internal threads in first inserted into shaft <b>14</b>, and then bendable hosel <b>190</b> is attached to the outside of shaft <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15C-15D</figref>. The shaft and hosel assembly is then inserted into club head <b>202</b>. A screw <b>204</b> is inserted into heel opening <b>206</b> of club head <b>202</b> and is threaded into shaft insert <b>200</b> to retain shaft <b>14</b> to club head <b>202</b>, similar to the retaining mechanism shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and described above.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A-16E</figref> illustrate a system for retaining screw <b>204</b> within club head <b>202</b> during the changing of hosel or club head. The connection system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>, except for hollow screw cap <b>208</b>. After screw <b>204</b> is inserted into heel opening <b>206</b>, as discussed in the preceding paragraph, screw cap is inserted into heel opening <b>206</b> and is sized and dimensioned to be positioned at a predetermined distance, l, below the top of screw <b>204</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>. Distance l is preferably greater than the depth of the teeth of serrated surfaces <b>194</b> and <b>196</b>. When a user wishes to change the hosel or club head, the user would insert a screwdriver to similar tool into heel opening <b>206</b>, through hollow screw cap <b>208</b> to the top of screw <b>204</b>. The user would then unscrew screw <b>204</b> to move screw <b>204</b> a distance l, or until the top of screw <b>204</b> comes into contact with screw cap <b>208</b>. At this point, the user can pull shaft <b>14</b> upward to disengage first serrated surface <b>194</b> of hosel <b>190</b> from the corresponding second serrated surface <b>196</b> of club head insert <b>198</b>. The user then can freely rotate shaft <b>14</b> relative to club head <b>202</b> to separate shaft <b>14</b> from club head <b>202</b>. The advantage of using screw cap <b>208</b> is that screw <b>204</b> is kept within the club head and the chance of misplacing screw <b>204</b> is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Screw cap <b>208</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>, may have waist <b>210</b>, and heel opening <b>206</b> may have at least one ledge <b>212</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</figref>, adapted to be received within waist <b>210</b> to keep screw cap <b>208</b> securely within the club head. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16E</figref> may have one or more protrusions <b>214</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16E</figref>, to provide an interference fit between screw cap <b>208</b> and the walls of heel opening <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In another embodiment, the club head may have an opening <b>216</b> formed on its heel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>. Opening <b>216</b> is adapted to receive a high impact transparent or translucent cap <b>218</b>, which allows the user to view the mechanisms of connection system <b>10</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, polymethacrylate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polycarbonate (Lexan&#xae;), and glycol modified polyethylene teraphthalate, discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Another way to change the lie and/or loft angle of the golf club is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>. Here, golf club <b>10</b> which includes club head <b>12</b>, shaft <b>14</b> and hosel parts <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, shown above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, has hosel insert <b>220</b> disposed between hosel parts <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. Hosel insert <b>220</b> have serrated surfaces on its top and bottom to match the serrated surfaces <b>17</b> and <b>19</b>, so that hosel insert <b>220</b> would fit flush in between. To change the loft/lie angle of club <b>10</b>, first side <b>222</b> and second side <b>224</b> of hosel insert <b>220</b> are different from each other, or top line <b>226</b> is not parallel to bottom line <b>228</b>, as illustrated by lines <b>226</b>&#x2032; and 228&#x2032;. In other words, hosel insert <b>220</b> is askew. In one example, if first side <b>222</b> is shorter than second side <b>224</b>, then
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>angle &#x3b1;&#x3e;angle &#x3b2;<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
and &#x3b1;=91&#xb0; and &#x3b2;=90&#xb0;, then the shaft angle has been shifted by 1&#xb0;. If the shaft coincides with the vertical axis then the shaft would have been shifted toward first side <b>222</b> by an amount equal to
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>|90&#xb0;&#x2212;&#x3b2;|+|90&#xb0;&#x2212;&#x3b1;|<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
In this example, if first side <b>222</b> and second side <b>224</b> are oriented in the toe-heel direction, then hosel insert <b>220</b> can change the lie angle. If first side <b>222</b> and second side <b>224</b> are oriented in the front-rear direction, then hosel insert <b>220</b> can change the loft angle.
</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It is noted that hosel insert <b>220</b> does not need to have the serrated top and bottom surfaces as shown, so long as these surfaces match the corresponding surfaces on hosel parts <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>. For example, if the corresponding surfaces of hosel parts <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> are linear or curvilinear, then the top and bottom surfaces of hosel insert <b>220</b> can assume the same shape. Furthermore, hosel insert <b>220</b> can be positioned above club head <b>12</b>, as shown; however, it can also be located inside the club head.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Furthermore, one of the hosel parts, can be made integral with club head <b>12</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>. The hosel parts are preferably made from low density aluminum so that more mass can be distributed elsewhere to improve inertia and center of gravity properties. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> and is illustrated with similar reference numbers. As shown, hosel part <b>18</b> is made integral to club head <b>12</b> and matching serrated surfaces <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> are positioned above club head <b>12</b>, similar to the view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Furthermore, hosel insert <b>220</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-B</figref>, can be used with this embodiment to change the lie and loft angle without bending the hosel. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, matching serrated surface <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> are positioned internal to club head <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, serrated surface <b>19</b> may be formed directed on club head <b>12</b> during the casting process, and hosel part <b>18</b> can be omitted. Also, threaded shaft insert <b>20</b> can be omitted, when hosel insert <b>16</b> has threaded internal surface <b>238</b>, sized and dimensioned to receive screw <b>24</b> to attach hosel <b>14</b> to club head <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref>. An advantage of this embodiment, is that it has fewer parts than the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref> and that instead of the smaller contact surface between shaft insert <b>20</b> and hosel <b>14</b>, a larger contact surface between hosel <b>14</b> and hosel <b>16</b> is available to be epoxied together to withstand the impact force between club and golf balls.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">To minimize the possibility of vibration caused by ball-club impacts, a damper or a pre-load spring can be added, for example between the shaft and the club head or portion thereof as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref> is an enlarged portion <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref>, showing damper/spring <b>240</b>. It is noted that damper/spring <b>240</b> can be used with any of the embodiments discussed and claimed herein. Part <b>240</b> can be an elastomeric or viscoelastic member designed to absorb vibration caused by impacts, and can be compressed between the hosel and the club head, as shown. Alternatively, part <b>240</b> can be one or more spring washers being compressed between the hosel and the club head to absorb the vibration. Suitable spring washers include, but are not limited to, Belleville or cupped spring washers, star spring washers, wave spring washers, curve spring washers, and locking washers.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Also, any of the threaded connections described herein, can be reinforced by a threaded helical coil, commercially available as Helicoil&#x2122; from many sources, including Emhart Teknologies. These coils are precision formed screw thread coils made from stainless steel, titanium or other durable metals, that have a diamond shaped cross-section. These coils are inserted into threaded holes, and are adapted to receive threaded fasteners. These coils are designed to be placed snugly between the threaded fasteners and threaded holes, and are designed to spread the load evenly among the threads. Typically, these coils are harder than the holes and the fasteners to minimize the possibility of thread tripping.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Typically, shafts <b>14</b> are long and slender and their geometry affects the number of teeth that can be present on serrated surfaces <b>17</b> and <b>19</b>, as shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, as well as the geometry of these teeth. The size of the teeth also needs to be sufficiently robust to withstand the stresses and torque applied to the shaft. The cutting tools have their own limitation as to how small they can cut the serrated teeth. The inventors of the present invention have discovered that in one preferred embodiment three teeth on each hosel insert <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> can sufficiently perform the anti-rotation function, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A-C</figref>. As shown, hosel part <b>16</b> has three thick tapered teeth <b>230</b> and hosel part <b>18</b> has three corresponding thin tapered teeth <b>232</b>. Alternatively, thick tapered teeth <b>230</b> can be associated with hosel part <b>18</b> and vice versa. The slopes of tapered teeth <b>230</b> and tapered teeth <b>232</b> are substantially the same and are from about 20&#xb0; to about 40&#xb0;, preferably from about 25&#xb0; to about 35&#xb0;, and more preferably about 30&#xb0;. Such angle extends the wear of the teeth and allows debris and dirt to escape. Teeth <b>232</b> can be from about 0.07 inch to 0.25 inch in height, preferably between about 0.09 inch to about 0.20 inch in height, and more preferably between about 0.10 inch to about 0.15 inch in height.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the tapered teeth (or prongs) on serrated surfaces <b>17</b> and <b>19</b>, such as teeth <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>, do not come into contact with the opposing hosel part, so that the tapered teeth or prongs don't bottom out or come into contact with the opposing hosel part. In other words, a gap <b>236</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> is present when hosel parts <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are assembled. This provides a manufacturing tolerance so that hosel parts <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> can fit flush together. For example, if no gap <b>236</b> is allowed and one of the teeth is slightly longer than the rest, then when assembled this longer tooth prevents the two hosel parts from coming flush together. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</figref> illustrates another example of gap <b>236</b> with tapered teeth <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> having substantially the same size.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The embodiments of the present invention are illustrated with driver-type or iron-type clubs. However, it is understood that any type of golf club can utilize inventive connection system <b>10</b>. Additionally, connection system <b>10</b> can be used with non-golf equipment, such as fishing poles, aiming sights for firearms, plumbing, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">While it is apparent that the illustrative embodiments of the invention disclosed herein fulfill the objectives stated above, it is appreciated that numerous modifications and other embodiments may be devised by those skilled in the art. Elements from one embodiment can be incorporated into other embodiments.
