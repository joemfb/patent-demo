<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to data bus switches. More particularly, the present invention relates to wireless data bus switches.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As electronic devices have become smaller and thus more mobile, there is an increasing demand for wireless data transmission systems to operate with ever increasing performance statistics. In particular, as data storage for electronic devices has become more compact, synchronizing large collections of data wirelessly has become unduly tiresome due to low data throughputs and limited battery life. For manufacturers endeavoring to meet the consumer demand, this has translated to high development costs associated with customized solutions that are often error prone and typically short lived due to incompatibility issues.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To address these concerns, there have been attempts to develop wireless extensions to various standardized data buses typically found in a personal computer. Unfortunately, conventional methods have characteristically been very similar to the customized solutions already attempted, which incorporate undesirable traits such as low data throughputs, high power consumption, high development costs, limited utility, and dubious product lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need to overcome the drawbacks and deficiencies in the art by providing systems and methods for coupling a wireless link to a data bus using a dynamically configurable data bus switch that can be implemented in a variety of contexts yet be capable of high data throughputs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present application is directed to a dynamically configurable wireless data bus switch, substantially as shown in and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present application is directed to a dynamically configurable wireless data bus switch. The following description contains specific information pertaining to the implementation of the present invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be implemented in a manner different from that specifically discussed in the present application. Moreover, some of the specific details of the invention are not discussed in order not to obscure the invention. The specific details not described in the present application are within the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The drawings in the present application and their accompanying detailed description are directed to merely exemplary embodiments of the invention. To maintain brevity, other embodiments of the invention, which use the principles of the present invention, are not specifically described in the present application and are not specifically illustrated by the present drawings. Unless noted otherwise, like or corresponding elements among the figures may be indicated by like or corresponding reference numerals. Moreover, the drawings and illustrations in the present application are generally not to scale, and are not intended to correspond to actual relative dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows system <b>100</b> illustrating an embodiment of the present inventive concepts addressing the concerns described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>100</b> includes host central processing unit (CPU) <b>110</b> coupled to wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>, which is in turn coupled to wireless link <b>114</b> and data bus <b>190</b>. Host CPU <b>110</b> may comprise any processor external to wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>, for example, that can be configured to execute station management entity (SME) <b>112</b> in addition to other host-level processes. SME <b>112</b> may comprise an updateable software logical module that can be executed by host CPU <b>110</b>, for example, and may be configured to provide an interface for users to administer, configure, provision, and collect various statistics from wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>, for instance. A more extensive description of a functionality of SME <b>112</b> is provided below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, host CPU <b>110</b> may be coupled to wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> over one or more data links, for example, such as data links <b>116</b> and <b>117</b>. For instance, data link <b>116</b> may represent a data link formed over a peripheral component interconnect express data bus, for example, and data link <b>117</b> may represent a separate universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) data link.

A more extensive description of a functionality of PALCP <b>136</b> is provided below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Configurable PALDP <b>140</b> of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> may comprise a configurable hardware module residing in wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>, for example, and may be configured to provide an interface to data bus <b>190</b>.

Thus, in one embodiment, configurable PALDP <b>140</b> may be configured to distinguish control packets from data packets and direct control packets to processor <b>130</b> and any of the software modules executing therein. As with SME <b>112</b>, eSME <b>132</b> and PALCP <b>136</b> above, a more extensive description of a functionality of configurable PALDP <b>140</b> is provided below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are LMAC <b>160</b> providing an interface to wireless link <b>114</b>, SHM <b>180</b>, and data bus link <b>118</b> coupling data bus <b>190</b> to configurable PALDP <b>140</b>. LMAC <b>160</b> may comprise any physical layer or layers (PHY) capable of coupling to configurable PALDP <b>140</b>, for example, and supporting one or more wireless links, such as wireless link <b>114</b> for example. As such, LMAC <b>160</b> may comprise any PHY capable of providing an interface to one or more wireless links for wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>. For instance, LMAC <b>160</b> may be a hardware module configured to support wireless data transmissions over 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 60 GHz wireless links, for example, and support a wide variety of wireless transmission protocols, such as 802.11 based wireless transmission protocols for example, used to communicate wirelessly with other wireless devices. Utilizing any of such protocols, LMAC <b>160</b> may be configured to transceive data packets and/or control packets for configurable PALDP <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, functionality of LMAC <b>160</b> may be managed, at least in part, by HMAC <b>134</b>. LMAC <b>160</b> may be configured to support various modulation and coding schemes, for example, that are managed by HMAC <b>134</b>, for instance, to help support high data throughput, power reduction, and other functionality depending on a particular need. Such functionality may be configured at an initialization of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>, for example, or may be dynamically configurable after an initialization of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, LMAC <b>160</b> may be configured to support multiple wireless links substantially simultaneously, for example, or to support multiple wireless links sequentially, for instance, to increase reliability, extend effective wireless range, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">SHM <b>180</b> may comprise any memory module or architecture, for example, that is capable of being coupled to processor <b>120</b>, LMAC <b>160</b> and/or configurable PALDP <b>140</b>.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As noted above, configurable PALDP <b>140</b> may be configured to provide an interface to data bus <b>190</b>, where data bus link <b>118</b> may be used to couple data bus <b>190</b> to configurable PALDP <b>140</b>, for example. As such, in some embodiments, configurable PALDP <b>140</b> may be configured to transmit data both to data bus link <b>118</b> and to data bus <b>190</b>. For example, in one embodiment, data bus <b>190</b> may comprise a peripheral component interface express (PCIe) data bus, for example, and data bus link <b>118</b> may comprise a root complex for the PCIe data bus. As such, configurable PALDP <b>140</b> may be configured to transmit data both to the root complex of a PCIe bus and to devices attached to a PCIe data bus. Thus, configurable PALDP may transmit data to, for example, a bus controller for a PCIe data bus and to the PCIe data bus itself to facilitate seamless data transmissions between end points coupled to data bus <b>190</b> and other end points coupled to other wireless data bus switches, for example, coupled to wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> over wireless link <b>114</b>. Thus, in some embodiments, wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> may be configured to form at least a part of a seamless wireless extension of a PCIe data bus. It should be understood that data bus <b>190</b> may comprise other data buses, for example, such as a universal serial bus (USB), an industry standard architecture (ISA) data bus, or legacy PCI bus.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> as comprising multiple hardware modules, in some embodiments, any of processor <b>130</b>, configurable PALDP <b>140</b>, LMAC <b>160</b> and/or SHM <b>180</b> may integrated into the same semiconductor die. Moreover, in other embodiments, wireless data bus switch may comprise only processor <b>130</b> and configurable PALDP <b>140</b>, where LMAC and shared memory functionality are implemented outside wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As explained above, configurable PALDP <b>140</b> may be configured to translate data bus data packets into PAL data packets to facilitate seamless and high speed data transmissions between end points coupled to data bus <b>190</b> and other end points coupled to, for example, other wireless data bus switches. For example, when incorporating 60 GHz wireless link capability, embodiments of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> may provide wireless data transmission between end points up to approximately 7 Gbps. However, in addition to its high speed data transmission capability, wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> also provides a dynamically configurable platform that may be used in a variety of contexts without requiring costly redesign and that may be updated to confront typical issues found in an evolving technology. For example, wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> may be configured to support both a host PAL (HPAL) mode and a device PAL (DPAL) mode that may be selected dynamically or at initialization, for example, which allows embodiments of the present inventive concepts to be quickly implemented into both host and non-host devices. Moreover, through use of SMEs such as SME <b>112</b> and/or eSME <b>132</b>, embodiments of the present inventive concepts may collaborate to form efficient and high speed wireless data bus extensions for a variety of data buses and end point applications with very little development overhead.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For instance, in some embodiments, eSME <b>132</b> may additionally be configured to detect when wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> is coupled to a host device, such as a host computer, for example, by detecting a presence of host CPU <b>110</b> or SME <b>112</b>, for instance. Upon such detection, eSME <b>132</b> may be configured to place wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> into an HPAL mode. While in an HPAL mode, and in addition to the functionality described above, SME <b>112</b> and eSME <b>132</b> of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> may be configured to collaborate and manage HMAC <b>134</b>, LMAC <b>160</b>, PALCP <b>136</b> and PALDP <b>140</b>, to provision various access policies, and to dynamically allocate bandwidth for any DPAL mode switches in a wireless domain managed by wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> according to wireless link conditions, current workload on wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>, and characteristics of each DPAL mode switch in the wireless domain. As such, SME <b>112</b> and eSME <b>132</b> of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> may be configured to manage one or more HPAL/DPAL wireless domains comprising wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> in an HPAL mode and one or more DPAL mode switches.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, in such HPAL mode, HMAC <b>134</b> and LMAC <b>160</b> may be configured by SME <b>112</b> and/or eSME <b>132</b> to perform MAC related tasks consistent with the selected HPAL mode. In like manner, PALCP <b>136</b> and configurable PALDP <b>140</b> may be configured to use information provided by SME <b>112</b> and/or eSME <b>132</b> to place themselves in a corresponding HPAL operational mode, for example, and build up necessary operational parameters, such as a route mapping table for example, to manage a wireless domain of DPAL mode switches.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition to the above, eSME <b>132</b> may also be configured to detect when wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> should be placed into a DPAL mode, such as when wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> is coupled to an end point or is not coupled to a host device, for example, or when wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> will be configured to participate in a wireless domain managed by another HPAL mode switch. Upon such detection, eSME <b>132</b> may be configured to place wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> into a DPAL mode. While in a DPAL mode, eSME <b>132</b> may be configured to function without interaction with an external SME such as SME <b>112</b>, for example. As such, while in a DPAL mode, and in addition to the functionality described above, eSME <b>132</b> of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> may be configured to manage HMAC <b>134</b>, LMAC <b>160</b>, PALCP <b>136</b> and PALDP <b>140</b>, to collect characteristics of end points connected to data bus <b>190</b>, and to measure current workload, power source mode and wireless link condition statistics and request bandwidth accordingly. As such, eSME <b>132</b> of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> may be configured to couple to a wireless domain managed by a HPAL mode switch.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, in such DPAL mode, HMAC <b>134</b> and LMAC <b>160</b> may be configured by eSME <b>132</b> to perform MAC related tasks consistent with the selected DPAL mode.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, detection of circumstances indicating an HPAL mode or a DPAL mode may be performed at initialization of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>, as indicated above, but in other embodiments, wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> may be configured to perform such detection periodically, for example, or upon request by SME <b>112</b>, such as before attempting to join a wireless domain managed by an HPAL mode switch, for instance. In addition, coupling to a host device and/or an end point may or may not comprise physical connections, for example. In some embodiments, such detection capability may be omitted in order to save resources of processor <b>130</b>, SHM <b>180</b>, host CPU <b>110</b> or the like, and wireless data bus switch may be configured to always be in an HPAL or DPAL mode. Although the above description indicates that eSME <b>132</b> may perform detection and mode selection operations, in other embodiments, SME <b>112</b> may be configured to participate in both detection and mode selection operations. In addition, even when in HPAL mode, wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> may be configured to utilize eSME <b>132</b> as the primary software module for managing ongoing operations of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>, for example, thereby limiting reliance on an uncongested data link to SME <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, embodiments of the present inventive concepts advantageously provide flexibility by functioning in either an HPAL or DPAL mode, high data throughput by supporting up to 7 Gbps data streams, and power savings by being able to selectively power off modules when there is no data traffic. Moreover, such embodiments may provide an extended product life by including software modules that may be periodically updated by a manufacturer, for example, to correct errors and add functionality, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Moving to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</figref>, these Figures illustrate transmit and receive data flows for HPAL (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) and DPAL (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) mode dynamically configurable data bus switches, according to embodiments of the present inventive concepts. In some embodiments, one dynamically configurable wireless data bus switch, such as wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for example, may be configured to be capable of entering into each of the states depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</figref>, for example, at different times during normal operation. With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, SME <b>212</b>, processor <b>230</b>, HMAC security agent <b>234</b>, HMAC MLME/scheduler <b>235</b>, switch HPAL control plane (SWFICP) <b>236</b>, and configurable switch HPAL data plane (SWHDP) <b>240</b> may correspond respectively to SME <b>112</b>, processor <b>130</b>, HMAC <b>134</b>, MLME <b>135</b>, PALCP <b>136</b> and configurable PALDP <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; e.g., each corresponding module may function similarly and comprise the same structure, arrangement and materials as its counterpart. In particular, root complex (RC) <b>292</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may correspond to data bus link <b>118</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where upstream port <b>242</b> may provide access to a PCIe data bus corresponding to data bus <b>190</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As noted above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a detailed data flow <b>200</b> for a dynamically configurable wireless data bus switch, similar to wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that has been placed into an HPAL mode and is configured to translate data bus data packets arriving at upstream port <b>242</b> into PAL data packets ready to be sent to an LMAC from LMAC queue <b>244</b>. For example, with respect to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, configurable SWHDP <b>240</b> includes upstream port <b>242</b>, LMAC queue <b>244</b>, route map table <b>246</b>, transmit status <b>248</b>, decoder <b>250</b>, configurable queue block <b>252</b>, egress arbiter <b>254</b> and data bus flow control <b>258</b>. Looking at steps <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>, decoder <b>250</b> may be configured to accept a data bus data packet from upstream port <b>242</b>, assign a PAL serial number to retain proper order, and push the data bus data packet and the assigned serial number into configurable queue block <b>252</b>. Configurable queue block <b>252</b> may then provide such queued data packets to egress arbiter <b>254</b> which encapsulates queued data packets into PAL data packets according to, for example, the source queue, serial number and routing information provided by route map table <b>246</b>. After encapsulation by egress arbiter <b>254</b>, PAL data packets are provided to LMAC queue <b>244</b> for transmission to an LMAC and over a coupled wireless link to other wireless data bus switches, for example. Additionally, as egress arbiter <b>254</b> provides PAL data packets to LMAC queue <b>244</b>, egress arbiter may also provide flow control data, for example, to root complex <b>292</b> through flow control <b>258</b>, for instance, to seamlessly accept transmission data packets from a coupled data bus. HPAL data plane (HDP) status <b>248</b> may be configured to notify modules in processor <b>230</b> that there is data to be transmitted, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each of decoder <b>250</b>, configurable queue block <b>252</b> and egress arbiter <b>254</b>, and thus configurable SWHDP <b>240</b>, may be dynamically configurable by software modules residing in processor <b>230</b>, for example. In particular, configurable SWHDP <b>240</b>, which may be coupled to processor <b>230</b> over multiple data links, may be dynamically configurable by SWHCP <b>236</b> of processor <b>230</b>, for example. For instance, decoder <b>250</b> may be periodically provided with QoS information by SWHCP <b>236</b> that causes decoder <b>250</b> to push data bus data packets into a particular queue in configurable queue block <b>252</b>, for example, in order to take advantage of processing assigned to a particular queue, for example. Moreover, SWHCP <b>236</b> may also dynamically configure configurable queue block <b>252</b> to, for example, allocate more of its resources to a particular queue to facilitate higher bandwidth processing, for instance. In addition to the above, SWHCP <b>236</b> may provide further QoS information to route map table <b>246</b> to configure egress arbiter <b>254</b> to encapsulate data packets with emphasis on reducing latency or increasing throughput, for example. Although each of decoder <b>250</b>, configurable queue block <b>252</b> and egress arbiter <b>254</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as receiving QoS information from processor <b>230</b>, and even though some receive such information through interstitial modules, in other embodiments, any modules within processor <b>230</b> may configure each of decoder <b>250</b>, configurable queue block <b>252</b> and egress arbiter <b>254</b>, and thus configurable SWHDP <b>240</b> utilizing information other than QoS information, and other data links than those explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a data flow for control packets transmitted from processor <b>230</b>, where such control packets may be sent to a data tightly coupled memory (DTCM) and then bridged to a control packet queue dynamically allocated within configurable queue block <b>252</b>, by processor <b>230</b> for example, much as data bus data packet queues are dynamically allocated as described above. Then, such queued control packets may be encapsulated by egress arbiter <b>254</b> into PAL control packets that are then queued for transmission to an LMAC by LMAC queue <b>244</b>.</p>

As is clear from steps <b>401</b> through <b>403</b> and a general layout of switch DPAL data plane (SWDDP) <b>440</b>, data flow <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> largely corresponds to data flow <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, except that SME <b>212</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has been replaced with eSME <b>432</b> residing in processor <b>430</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and upstream port <b>242</b>, decoder <b>250</b>, flow control <b>258</b> and root complex <b>292</b> has been replaced with downstream ports <b>442</b><i>a </i>and <b>442</b><i>b</i>, decoders <b>450</b><i>a </i>and <b>450</b><i>b</i>, flow controls <b>458</b><i>a </i>and <b>458</b><i>b</i>, and end points <b>492</b><i>a </i>and <b>492</b><i>b</i>. Additionally, in the embodiment illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, configurable queue block <b>452</b> is shown as configured with fewer configured queues, and LMAC queue <b>444</b> is shown as narrower than, for example, LMAC queue <b>244</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. These changes illustrate different physical connections and concomitant resource allocations that may be configured to facilitate a particular mode, such as a HPAL or DPAL mode, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an HPAL mode switch may be configured to provide a wireless data bus extension from one data bus to multiple DPAL mode switches, and so in that embodiment, only one upstream port <b>242</b> may be allocated to the data bus, but many queues may be allocated in configurable queue block <b>252</b>, for example, to facilitate high bandwidth connections between endpoints connected to a data bus accessed through upstream port <b>242</b> and multiple DPAL mode switches, for example. By contrast, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a DPAL mode switch may be configured to provide a wireless data bus extension from multiple data buses, with one end point per data bus, for example, to only one HPAL mode switch, for instance, and so allocate available modules within SWDDP <b>440</b>, for example, differently. For example, in some embodiments, a wireless data bus switch according to the present inventive concepts, when in a DPAL mode, may be able to couple to up to 32 separate data buses/end points substantially simultaneously, and coordinate resource allocations according to individual bandwidth needs and the like. In one embodiment, end points <b>492</b><i>a </i>and <b>492</b><i>b </i>may comprise any PCIe devices, for example, and downstream ports <b>442</b><i>a </i>and <b>442</b><i>b </i>may provide access to a PCIe data bus interface of end points <b>492</b><i>a </i>and <b>492</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, when in HPAL mode, a wireless data bus switch according to embodiments of the present inventive concepts may manage up to 32 DPAL mode switches and end points (combined).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It is important to reiterate that one dynamically configurable wireless data bus switch according to the present inventive concepts may be configured to exhibit the characteristics of both data flow <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and data flow <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, depending on a selected mode of the wireless data bus switch and other management decision made by, for example, modules within processor <b>230</b> or <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, illustrates a detailed data flow <b>500</b> for a dynamically configurable data bus switch that has been placed into a DPAL mode, but that is configured to translate PAL data packets and PAL control packets received by LMAC queue <b>544</b> into data bus data packets and control packets provided to downstream ports <b>542</b><i>a </i>and <b>542</b><i>b </i>and processor <b>530</b>, respectively. Data flow <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> largely corresponds to data flow <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with differences similar to those differences between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 2</figref>, and with similar explanations as to why those differences may exist in various embodiments of the present inventive concepts.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When a wireless data bus switch according to the present inventive concepts is in an HPAL mode, a corresponding SWHCP, such as SWHCP <b>236</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and SWHCP <b>336</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for example, may be configured to process various management or control packets, to manage interfaces to an SME, eSME, HMAC, LMAC and configurable SWHDP, and to control data flow from a root complex and/or data bus to end points coupled to a DPAL mode wireless data bus switch, for example. Moreover, a SWHCP may additionally be configured to manage any DPAL mode switches, using transmitted and received control packets for example, that are under its associated wireless domain. Additionally, a corresponding configurable SWHDP, such as configurable SWHDP <b>240</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and configurable SWHDP <b>340</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for example, may be configured to process data bus data packets, control packets, PAL data packets and PAL control packets, and to manage interfaces to a root complex, an upstream port, an SWHCP, and all LMAC, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As discussed above, a wireless data bus switch in an HPAL mode may comprise both an SME residing in an external host CPU, such as SME <b>212</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and SME <b>312</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for example, and, in some embodiments, an eSME residing in a processor of the wireless data bus switch, such as eSME <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example. Both the external SME and the eSME, which may be referred to jointly as an SME of a wireless data bus switch, may be configured to provide an interface for users to administer, configure, provision, and collect various statistics from a corresponding HPAL mode switch, and may be configured to manage interfaces to a corresponding SWHCP, HMAC, LMAC and configurable SWHDP. As such, the external SME and the eSME may be configured to manage one or more HPAL/DPAL wireless domains, as described above. Furthermore, a corresponding SWHDP (e.g., a PALDP) may be dynamically configurable by each of the SME, the eSME and a corresponding SWHCP (e.g., a PALCP), for example, to facilitate management of one or more HPAL/DPAL wireless domains, for example. As such, where a corresponding SWHDP (e.g., a PALDP) comprises a decoder, a configurable queue block, and an egress arbiter, such as SWHDP <b>240</b> comprising decoder <b>250</b>, configurable queue block <b>252</b> and egress arbiter <b>254</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for example, each of the decoder, configurable queue block and egress arbiter may be dynamically configurable by each of the SME, the eSME and a corresponding SWHCP (e.g., a PALCP).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When a wireless data bus switch according to the present inventive concepts is instead in a DPAL mode, a corresponding SWDCP, such as SWDCP <b>436</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and SWDCP <b>536</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for example, may be configured to process various management or control packets and to manage interfaces to an SME, eSME, HMAC, LMAC and configurable SWDDP, but may also be configured to discover available HPAL mode switches to facilitate joining a wireless domain, for example. A corresponding configurable SWDDP, such as configurable SWDDP <b>440</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and configurable SWDDP <b>540</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for example, may be configured to process data bus data packets, control packets, PAL data packets and PAL control packets, and to manage interfaces to downstream ports/end points, an SWDCP, and an LMAC, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A wireless data bus switch in a DPAL mode may lack an external SME and comprise only an eSME residing in a processor of the wireless data bus switch, such as eSME <b>432</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and eSME <b>532</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example. The eSME of a DPAL mode switch may be configured to provide an interface for users to administer, configure, provision, and collect various statistics from the DPAL mode switch, through an HPAL mode switch managing a wireless domain of the DPAL mode switch, for example. Additionally, the eSME of a DPAL mode switch may also be configured to decide when to join a wireless domain managed by a specific HPAL mode switch, for example, and/or which of a plurality of wireless domains to join. Furthermore, a corresponding SWDDP (e.g., a PALDP) may be dynamically configurable by the eSME and a corresponding SWDCP (e.g., a PALCP), for example, to facilitate joining one or more wireless domains, for example. As such, where a corresponding SWDDP (e.g., a PALDP) comprises a decoder, a configurable queue block, and an egress arbiter, such as SWDDP <b>440</b> comprising decoders <b>450</b><i>a </i>and <b>450</b><i>b</i>, configurable queue block <b>452</b> and egress arbiter <b>454</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> for example, each of the decoder, configurable queue block and egress arbiter may be dynamically configurable by the eSME and a corresponding SWDCP (e.g., a PALCP).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although functionalities of various modules of a wireless data bus switch according to the present inventive concepts may overlap, particularly with respect to management functionalities described above, such modules may be configured to form a hierarchy based on authority and efficiency, for example, such that, for instance, an SME may be relatively slow and inefficient yet be able to overrule all other modules with respect to wireless domain management, for example. In one embodiment, a hierarchy may comprise an SME, a PALCP, and a PALDP, for example, in order of decreasing authority and increasing efficiency and speed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is important to note that the preceding discussion with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</figref> describes mode-specific functionalities of a PALCP and a PALDP (e.g., a SWHCP and SWDCP, and a SWHDP and SWDDP) that may supplement the more general functionalities described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows flowchart <b>600</b> illustrating a method for execution by a processor of a dynamically configurable wireless data bus switch for coupling a wireless link to a data bus. Certain details and features have been left out of flowchart <b>600</b> that are apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a step may consist of one or more substeps or may involve specialized equipment or materials, as known in the art. Steps <b>610</b> through <b>660</b> indicated in flowchart <b>600</b> are sufficient to describe one embodiment of the present invention; however, other embodiments of the invention may make use of steps different from those shown in flowchart <b>600</b>. It is noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a system capable of performing the method of flowchart <b>600</b>, and so steps <b>610</b> through <b>660</b> are described with reference to system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to step <b>610</b> of the method embodied in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, step <b>610</b> of flowchart <b>600</b> comprises processor <b>130</b> detecting a host computer coupled to wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>. For example, any module of data bus switch <b>120</b> may be configured to detect a presence of host CPU <b>110</b>, for example, or SME <b>112</b>. As noted above, such detection may take place at initialization of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>, for example, or at any time subsequent to initialization.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Continuing with step <b>620</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, step <b>620</b> of flowchart <b>600</b> comprises processor <b>130</b> selecting an HPAL mode for wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Moving to step <b>630</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, step <b>630</b> of flowchart <b>600</b> comprises processor <b>130</b> configuring PALCP <b>136</b> and configurable PALDP <b>140</b> of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> to manage a first wireless domain. As described previously, SME <b>112</b> and eSME <b>132</b> may collaboratively manage and configure PALCP <b>136</b> and configurable PALDP <b>140</b> to create and administer a wireless domain managed by wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to step <b>640</b> of the method embodied in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, step <b>640</b> of flowchart <b>600</b> comprises processor <b>130</b> detecting a host computer decoupling from wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>.

Alternatively, step <b>650</b> may comprise simply detecting an absence of a host computer, or even a presence of an end point, for example, where a host computer is never coupled to wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Moving to step <b>660</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, step <b>660</b> of flowchart <b>600</b> comprises processor <b>130</b> configuring PALCP <b>136</b> and configurable PALDP <b>140</b> of wireless data bus switch <b>120</b> to join a second wireless domain managed by another wireless data bus switch, which may or may not be similar to wireless data bus switch <b>120</b>. Since SME <b>112</b> and host CPU <b>110</b> are not present in this embodiment, eSME <b>132</b> alone may manage and configure PALCP <b>136</b> and configurable PALDP <b>140</b> to join a second wireless domain, for example, managed by another wireless data bus switch, as is described above.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Thus, various embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for coupling a wireless link to a data bus using a dynamically configurable wireless data bus switch. In particular, embodiments of the present inventive concepts may be configured to provide architectural flexibility, scalability, high data throughput, intelligent routing, and power savings, as described above, which can lead to cost savings when developing devices leveraging wireless data bus extensions. For example, by incorporating dynamically configurable queue blocks, embodiments can be scaled to support many different combinations of DPAL mode switches and end points without requiring expensive redesigns for each specific combination. Additionally, in some embodiments, an SME, eSME or PALCP, for example, may collect constantly updated information about link conditions, workloads and end point characteristics, for example, and combine them with efficient direct memory mechanisms, for example, to leverage substantially all of a wireless link bandwidth, thus maximizing data throughput while retaining the aforementioned configurable flexibility.</p>
