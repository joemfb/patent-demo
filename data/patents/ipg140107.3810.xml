<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0100588, filed on Oct. 22, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a display device, and more particularly to a display device with an optical sensing frame wherein a waveguide unit having a double-layer structure including a light-receiving layer and a light-emitting layer is applied to realize structural simplification and increase an active area, and a method for detecting touch using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a touch panel forms an interface between information and communication devices using a variety of displays and a user. The touch panel is an input device which interfaces with an apparatus by directly contacting a screen by hand or with a pen. A touch panel is an input apparatus which can be manipulated by contacting a button displayed on a display with a user's finger. Accordingly, a touch panel is easily utilized by users of all ages. Touch panels are utilized in a variety of applications including issuing machines in banks or government offices, various medical apparatuses, electronic tour guides, and electronic traffic guides.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Based on the manner in which touch is sensed, touch panels are divided into resistive touch panels, micro capacitive touch panels (glasses), ultrasonic touch panels (glasses), infrared touch panels, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">First, the resistive touch panel is composed of two conductive transparent layers, i.e., a lower layer made of a glass or plastic coated with a conductive material and an upper layer made of a film coated with a conductive material. The two layers are electrically isolated by a predetermined distance through a micro-printed spacer. In accordance with the resistive touch panel, when a predetermined voltage is applied to the two layers coated with a conductive material and an upper plate is touched by hand or with a pen, an upper plate (X axis) and a lower plate (Y axis) undergo variations in resistance depending on the position of touch, and a controller present therein calculates the positions of the upper plate (X axis) and lower plate (Y axis) that undergo resistance variation to display X and Y coordinates on a screen, and data may be inputted by the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The micro capacitive touch panel includes a transparent glass sensor thinly coated with a conductive material. The conductive coating layer includes electrode patterns finely printed along an edge of the conductive coating layer. A protective coating film made of a transparent glass is also applied in close contact with an upper side of the conductive layer to protect and enclose the glass sensor. The micro capacitive touch panel operates such that a predetermined voltage is applied to a glass screen and the electrode patterns form a low voltage field on a surface of the touch sensor through the conductive layer. Therefore, when the user touches the screen with his or her finger, a micro-amperage current is generated at the touched portion. Further, a touch screen controller can determine the touched portion through proportional calculations using the amperage of the current because the current from each corner is proportional to a distance from the corner to the finger.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The ultrasonic wave touch panel is made entirely of glass. Therefore, as compared to other touch screens, in which the lifespan can be reduced via even minor scratches or abrasions on the surface, the ultrasonic wave touch panel is not influenced by surface damage or abrasion. Further, in the ultrasonic wave touch panel, a touch screen controller transmits 5 MHz electric signals to a transmitting transducer which generates ultrasonic waves. The generated ultrasonic waves are then passed through a panel surface by reflected lines. Therefore, when the user touches a surface of the touch screen, a part of the ultrasonic waves passing through the touched portion are absorbed by the user and loss of signals is transmitted to the controller through received signals and a digital map. Then, the controller calculates the coordinate values of the portions where the variation in the signals occurs. The above serial operations are performed with respect to the X-axis and the Y-axis, independently.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The infrared type touch panel uses the straightness effect of infrared rays, i.e., uses a principle in that infrared rays do not advance beyond an obstacle placed ahead of the rays. In more detail, infrared rays emitted in horizontal and vertical directions are obstructed at a portion touched by the user, and a controller determines the coordinate values of the X-axis and Y-axis of the infrared-obstruction. Thus, the infrared touch panel detects the touched portion through interruption of the infrared ray at a front side of the touch panel. Further, infrared rays are emitted from one side of the X-axis and the Y-axis and received at the other side of the X-axis and the Y-axis, thereby forming an invisible infrared matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Although each type of panel has different advantages, mentioned above, infrared touch panels currently attract much attention because they require less pressure to be applied to the touch panels. Next, a related art infrared type touch panel will be described with reference to the annexed drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view illustrating an infrared touch panel according to the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the related art infrared touch panel, as mentioned above, forms an infrared ray (IR) matrix, a light-emitting portion <b>19</b> provided with a light-emitting waveguide <b>10</b> at two sides adjacent to a touch panel surface <b>14</b>, and a light-receiving portion <b>20</b> provided with a light-receiving waveguide <b>16</b> at the other adjacent two sides.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The light-emitting portion <b>19</b> and the light-receiving portion <b>20</b> are provided with lenses <b>12</b> and <b>15</b> connected to the light-emitting and light-receiving waveguides <b>10</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively, to straightly transfer light emitted and received through the respective waveguides to the matrix. The light-emitting waveguide <b>10</b> of the light-emitting portion <b>19</b> is provided at one side thereof with an LED light source <b>11</b> to transfer light thereto and a light splitter <b>18</b>. The light-receiving portion <b>20</b> is provided at one side thereof with a photo sensor <b>17</b>, connected to the light-receiving waveguide <b>16</b>, to detect presence of touch. Here, the photo sensor <b>17</b> is provided with a photo sensor array to decide coordinates of a user's touch since photo sensor <b>17</b> is connected to the light-receiving waveguide <b>16</b> which is connected to both the X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In such a structure, the light-emitting portion <b>19</b> and the light-receiving portion <b>20</b> are provided at one side thereof with a light source <b>11</b> and a photo sensor <b>17</b>, respectively. To connect the light source <b>11</b> and the photo sensor <b>17</b> to the waveguides <b>10</b> and <b>16</b> so as to transfer light in X-axis and Y-axis directions, line lengths of the waveguide far from the light source <b>11</b> and the photo sensor <b>17</b> as well as areas of the light-emitting portion <b>19</b> and the light-receiving portion <b>20</b> must inevitably be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The aforementioned related art infrared touch panel has the several disadvantages. First, the light-emitting portion or light-receiving portion provided with the waveguide and lens should be arranged at four sides of the touch panel plane. For touch sensing, all configurations should be provided throughout all edges of the touch panel. Accordingly, location of elements is complicated and lengths of lines are increased. Due to these disadvantages, electric noise or EMI generated from display devices may affect touch systems. Second, the light-receiving portion and the light-emitting portion should be provided at two adjacent sides which complicates the structure and reduces an active area. Third, as the area of the touch panel increases, the number of pixels also increases, and more waveguides and lenses are required. An active area of the touch panel of a predetermined size is decreased. The touch panel at two respective sides thereof with the light-emitting portion and the light-receiving portion does not reflect active area efficiency of a display panel arranged in a lower region. As a result, the related art infrared touch panel is inapplicable to large-area display devices. In addition, the recent trend toward thin bezels inhibits realization of touch module-integrated displays due to the volume of the touch module.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Hereinafter, a display device with an optical sensing frame and a method for detecting touch using the same according to the present invention will be described with reference to the annexed drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view illustrating an exemplary display device with an optical sensing frame according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view illustrating the exemplary display device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the display device with an optical sensing frame <b>100</b> includes a display panel <b>200</b> having a rectangular structure with four plane sides, a waveguide unit <b>110</b> arranged on adjacent two sides of the display panel <b>200</b> having a stacked structure including a light-emitting layer (represented by reference numeral &#x201c;<b>111</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) emitting infrared light and a light-receiving layer (represented by reference numeral &#x201c;<b>112</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) receiving reflected light and detecting touch, a retroreflector unit <b>120</b> arranged on the remaining two sides of the display panel <b>200</b>, and a case (not shown) encasing the display panel <b>200</b>, the waveguide unit <b>110</b>, and the retroreflector unit <b>120</b>. The light-emitting layer <b>111</b> and the light-receiving layer <b>112</b> may be stacked in a reverse position and may each independently have a stacked structure including two or more layers, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, light is emitted straight from the waveguide unit <b>110</b> in a plurality of portions in X and Y axial directions. The retroreflector unit <b>120</b> reflects the received light in a reverse direction again. That is, the retroreflector unit <b>120</b> receives straight light allowing the light to be straightly transmitted to the waveguide unit.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When a predetermined portion of the display device with an optical sensing frame <b>100</b> is touched by an object, the object blocks passage of straight light in the corresponding portion due to absorbance, scattering, or reflection, etc. Thus, the received light is prevented from being transmitted to the retroreflector. The waveguide unit <b>110</b> determines the reception of light and variations thereof. Thus, the presence of the touch and the corresponding position thereof is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the exemplary waveguide unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the waveguide unit <b>110</b> includes the light-emitting layer <b>111</b> and the light-receiving layer <b>112</b> which are illuminated in this order. In particular, the light-emitting layer <b>111</b> of the waveguide unit <b>110</b> is provided at one side thereof with an infrared LED <b>113</b> to emit infrared light, a light splitter (not shown) to distribute light, and a plurality of optical fibers <b>114</b> to allow light split from the infrared LED <b>113</b> to be transmitted straight in a plurality of portions to X and Y axes.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The light-receiving layer <b>112</b> of the waveguide unit <b>110</b> includes a plurality of optical fibers <b>116</b> receiving light reflected from the retroreflector unit <b>120</b> and a line photo sensor <b>115</b>, connected to one side of the optical fibers <b>116</b>, to detect the presence of touch using light transmitted from the optical fibers <b>116</b>. In addition, an optical efficiency lens may also be provided adjacent to the sides of the display panel <b>200</b> at which the optical fibers <b>116</b> and <b>114</b> are arranged. In one embodiment, a first type of optical efficiency lens may be connected to each of the plurality of optical fibers <b>114</b>, and a second type of optical efficiency lens may be connected to each of the plurality of optical fibers <b>116</b>. The first type of optical lens may be a light focusing optical lens, and the second type of optical lens may be a narrow viewing angle optical lens.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view illustrating the exemplary retroreflector unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view illustrating an exemplary liquid crystal display device comprising the optical sensing frame according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the retroreflector unit <b>120</b> includes an optical filter <b>121</b> to transmit only infrared rays, a retroreflector <b>123</b> to reflect the received light, and a first adhesive layer <b>122</b>, interposed between the optical filter <b>121</b> and the retroreflector <b>123</b>, to adhere the optical filter <b>121</b> and to the retroreflector <b>123</b>. In addition, the retroreflector unit <b>120</b> further includes a second adhesive layer <b>124</b> arranged under the retroreflector <b>123</b>. In the second adhesive layer <b>124</b>, a case top (<b>185</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) used for a case is provided at an inner side thereof with a line supporter (<b>180</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) supporting the retroreflector unit <b>120</b>. Also, the retroreflector unit <b>120</b> may be adhered to one side of the supporter <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a top view illustrating the exemplary retroreflector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the retroreflector <b>123</b> is in the form of a cube-corner, like a micro prism. The light angle is in the range of 0 to 65 degrees with excellent rectoreflection efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a graph showing transmittance of an exemplary optical filter of the exemplary retroreflector unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the optical filter <b>121</b> transmits only light above infrared rays and blocks the remaining light above visible rays. A black material (visible ray-absorbing material) may be applied in order to block visible rays. For example, the optical filter <b>121</b> may have a cut-off frequency of about 700 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The optical filter <b>121</b> may be made of an acrylic resin. For example, the acrylic resin may be polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or polycarbonate. Alternatively, the optical filter <b>121</b> may contain glass.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Meanwhile, the display panel used for the display device provided with an optical sensing frame may be selected from liquid crystal panels, PDP panels, organic light-emitting display panels, and electrophoretic panels. The liquid crystal panel is provided with an additional light source in a lower region thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Such a display device requires a material to encase the display panel <b>200</b>, the waveguide unit <b>110</b> arranged in the periphery of the display panel <b>200</b>, and the retroreflector unit <b>120</b>. Also, the waveguide unit <b>110</b> and the retroreflector unit <b>120</b> may also be included in the case.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, when the display panel is a liquid crystal panel which includes a first substrate, a second substrate, and a liquid crystal layer filled therebetween, a frame-type case top <b>185</b>, which overlaps the periphery and side of the liquid crystal panel, is provided. The display panel includes a case top <b>185</b> to shield the waveguide unit <b>110</b> and the retroreflector unit <b>120</b> which are arranged at the peripheries of the liquid crystal panel.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Here, the retroreflector unit <b>120</b> is adhered to an inner side of the case top <b>185</b>, and the waveguide unit <b>110</b> is adhered to or structurally inserted into other inner side of the case top <b>185</b> to realize an integrated structure. The waveguide unit <b>110</b> having a double-layer stacked structure including the light-emitting layer <b>111</b> and the light-receiving layer <b>112</b> is applied to two adjacent sides of the display panel and the retroreflector is applied to the remaining two sides thereof to integrate the optical sensing frame in a display module without increasing a non-active area.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In particular, the retroreflector is composed of only a film or an adhesive layer, without any reflective lens, line, or element. Accordingly, the width of the retroreflector can be significantly reduced, as compared to the waveguide unit, and the thickness thereof can be reduced to 1,000 &#x3bc;m or less. For this reason, the retroreflector is useful for slim display devices. As a result, a borderless structure can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also, the double-layer stacked structure waveguide unit including the light-emitting layer <b>111</b> and the light-receiving layer <b>112</b> is advantageous in that the infrared LED and the line photo sensor connected to the light-emitting layer <b>111</b> and the light-receiving layer <b>112</b>, respectively, can be readily located in each block and the waveguide unit is useful for large display devices. For example, the line photo sensor is located in each block comprising pixels corresponding to its resolution. In addition, the infrared LED may be located such that luminance efficiency of the infrared LED and reflection efficiency, in which the retroreflector unit <b>120</b> reflects light received from the LED, are maintained at a predetermined level.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The liquid crystal display device senses touch in the following manner. The infrared LED <b>113</b> present in the light-emitting portion <b>111</b> of the waveguide unit <b>110</b> emits infrared light and the retroreflector unit <b>120</b> retro-reflects the infrared light to an opposite side in order to transfer the light to the light-receiving portion <b>112</b> of the waveguide unit <b>110</b>, thereby allowing the line photo sensor <b>115</b> of the light-receiving portion <b>112</b> to sense the reflected and transmitted light. At this time, when the device is touched by an input, such as a hand or pen, transfer of emitted and reflected light is blocked in the corresponding portion due to the intervention of the input means. Accordingly, presence of touch, the portion at which light amount varies, and the corresponding position (X and Y coordinates), connected through optical fibers, as the touched portion can be considered by sensing variation in reception amount of reflected light read from the line photo sensor <b>115</b>. That is, this waveguide unit <b>110</b> senses variations of absorbed, scattered, and reflected light generated by respective elements based on inherent reflectivity of an input in a touched region and blocks light emitted by the input to prevent retro-reflection and thus realize presence of touch and regions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The display device with an optical sensing frame according to the present invention has the following advantages. First, the waveguide unit having a double-layer stacked structure including the light-receiving layer and the light-emitting layer is applied to two adjacent sides of the display panel and the retroreflector unit is applied to the remaining two sides thereof, to integrate the optical sensing frame in a display module. Second, the retroreflector is applied to the sides of the display panel, which face the waveguide, without applying any reflective lens to the waveguide, thus eliminating the necessity of using any reflective lens and elements connected thereto and simplifying configurations for touch sensation. Third, in the case of a large display device, the display panel may be partitioned into a plurality of blocks and the infrared LED and the line photo sensor may be located in each block. The line photo sensor senses retroreflection of emitted light, or the touch object blocks emitted light to prevent transfer of the light to the retroreflector. Accordingly, the presence of touch can be detected by sensing whether light is not transmitted to the retroreflector unit and thus retroreflection does not occur. Accordingly, the display panel is useful for large display devices. Fourth, as compared to related art display devices wherein a waveguide, a lens, and a sensor or a light source are provided in a light-receiving portion and a light-emitting portion, separately, the display device of the present invention, wherein a waveguide unit is applied to two sides of the display panel and a retroreflector having a simple structure is applied to the remaining two sides thereof, utilizes only optical elements without locating any electric lines, thus simplifying design of instruments, reducing an area of instruments present in the edge of the optical sensing frame, and finally realizing a display device with an approximately borderless structure. Fifth, the number of lenses connected to the waveguide is decreased, and fabrication costs are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the display device having optical sensing frame and method for detecting touch using the same of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
