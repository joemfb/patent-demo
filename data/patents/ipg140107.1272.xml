<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to mobile catering/vending/food service/ facilities and, more particularly, to a catering/vending/food service/vehicle/unit with a drive through vending capability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">General Background and State of the Art</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the United States of America, most mobile food service or mobile catering/vending/food service units have their customer accessible windows on the &#x201c;passenger&#x201d; or right side of the vehicle/unit only. When parked, most serving windows swing outward and upward, creating a temporary canopy for customers. Most units park on a street with traffic and serve walk-up only patrons on the sidewalks or at least the land adjacent the street. Increasingly, special lots are set aside for the use of mobile catering/vending/food service vehicles/units, such lots acting as food courts.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">These vehicle/units are designed to serve a pedestrian customer base walking up to the mobile unit and placing orders as if one walked into a restaurant; hence leaving an untapped potential source of customers who are in their vehicles and do not wish to leave to order food. Most, if not all, fast food establishments provide a drive through capability to accommodate customers in vehicles. Accordingly, there is a need for a mobile catering/vending /food service vehicle/unit that can serve both pedestrians and vehicle occupants, as well.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">INVENTION SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To maximize business opportunities, a mobile vehicle/unit can be provided with a &#x201c;drive thru&#x201d; window on the driver's side to provide &#x201c;drive through&#x201d; service. Where possible and if not a pedestrian hazard, a &#x201c;drive thru&#x201d; window can be placed on the passenger's side. This mobile vehicle/unit interior is modified to provide a platform that places the server at or near eye level of the patron in an automobile. To minimize traffic hazards, the serving window can slide open rather than creating a potential problem by swinging outward and/or upward as do the walk-up windows.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In operation, the mobile catering/vending/food service vehicle/unit serves its pedestrian patrons from the passenger or curbside of the vehicle/unit while motorists can approach the vehicle/unit from the driver's side and be served from a window on that side that can be somewhat closer to the patron's window. In some cases, the mobile vehicle/unit can also have both sides acting as the &#x201c;drive thru&#x201d; window to maximize &#x201c;to-go&#x201d; customers from their personal vehicles if not on a busy thoroughfare.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, a movable platform with integral steps is lowered from the interior floor of the vehicle/unit, placing the server closer to the motorist. In other embodiments, a permanent lower platform is built into the chassis. A menu station can be established at an end of the vehicle/unit so that motorist's orders can be placed before the service window is reached, much in the fashion of fast food restaurants with drive through windows.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In those locations where it is safe, pedestrian and vehicles can also approach from the front of the vehicle/unit, placing the driver adjacent the service window. Further, applications can be developed for hand held devices that can permit ordering in advance of arrival at the service window to supplement the touch screen menu displays which enable order placement.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In those areas which are similar to food courts and only open to pedestrian patrons, the &#x201c;drive thru&#x201d; service window can be an additional place from which patrons can be served. This would be most useful at times when patrons are pressed for time and large numbers of walk-up patrons are seeking service.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The novel features which are characteristic of the invention, both as to structure and method of operation thereof, together with further objects and advantages thereof, will be understood from the following description, considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which the preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated by way of example. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for the purpose of illustration and description only, and they are not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a mobile catering/vending/food service vehicle/unit <b>10</b> with a &#x201c;drive thru&#x201d; window <b>12</b> according to the present invention. In alternative embodiments, the window <b>12</b> can be an outward or upward swinging window where such an arrangement does not result in a traffic hazard, or, alternatively, the mobile vehicle/unit <b>10</b> of the present invention can provide a sliding window which presents no hazards to pedestrians or vehicles. The view is of the driver's or traffic side of the vehicle/unit <b>10</b> so that primary service is provided from the opposite side to a predominantly pedestrian patron.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A microphone/speaker combination <b>14</b> is provided at the rear of the mobile vehicle/unit <b>10</b> to allow motorists to deliver their orders before reaching the drive through window <b>12</b>. Vents <b>16</b> are provided on the roof of the mobile vehicle/unit <b>10</b> to enable better air circulation in the mobile vehicle/unit <b>10</b> when parked and servicing customers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The undersurface <b>18</b> of the mobile vehicle/unit <b>10</b> is lowered in the area of the &#x201c;drive thru&#x201d; window <b>12</b> and the driver's door <b>20</b> to allow for easier access to vehicles or pedestrians. This will allow the customer in a vehicle to communicate and exchange currency. It also permits a server at the &#x201c;drive thru&#x201d; window <b>12</b> of the mobile food unit <b>10</b> to service the customer. In alternative embodiments, the undersurface <b>18</b> could be at a uniform height to assure adequate ground clearance and a platform could be deployed downward when the mobile vehicle/unit <b>10</b> is at rest and serving customers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turning next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown an interior view of the driver's side of the mobile vehicle/unit <b>10</b>, showing some of the various cupboards, appliances and working areas normally found in a conventional mobile catering/vending/food service vehicle/unit and generally irrelevant to the present invention except that the present invention contemplates that a complete mobile catering/vending/food service vehicle/unit is equipped with a &#x201c;drive thru&#x201d; capability.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Next, looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown the rear of a typical mobile catering/vending/food service vehicle/unit <b>10</b> with the passenger or curb side service window <b>30</b> deployed to serve pedestrian or walk-up patrons only.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Turning next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a top view of the interior of the mobile vehicle/unit <b>10</b>. With this view, the service platform <b>32</b> can be seen. Because the platform <b>32</b> is somewhat lower than the rest of the mobile vehicle/unit interior floor, a series of steps <b>36</b> are provided to gain access to the platform <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In alternative embodiments, where terrain clearance is a problem, the platform <b>32</b> can be retractable and can be latched to provide a uniform floor throughout the mobile vehicle/unit.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the platform <b>32</b> and steps <b>36</b> are more clearly shown. It is to be understood, however, that the platform <b>32</b> is intended to provide a server better access to customers in vehicles, but can serve pedestrians customers if in a location where pedestrian traffic on the driver's side of the vehicle is safe.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While the specification describes particular embodiments of the present invention, those of ordinary skill can devise variations of the present invention without departing from the inventive concept. However, the invention should only be limited by the scope of the claims appended below.</p>
