<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This description relates to load balancing in a network.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional sensors can be configured to communicate through networks to computers. Some forms of networked sensor can transmit status information and operating data over the network, as well as receive and respond to messages, such as commands or queries, received over the network.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one general aspect, a sensor in a network to which to route a packet is selected. Where the sensor is selected independently of energy status of the sensors included in the network, and the sensor is selected by a source sensor. The packet is routed from the source sensor toward the selected sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The source sensor may select the sensor at random or pseudo-randomly from among the sensors included in the sensor network. Selecting the sensor independently of the energy status of the sensors included in the network may include selecting the sensor without consideration of the energy status of the sensors included in the network. Selecting the sensor independently of the energy status of the sensors included in the network may include selecting the sensor without determining whether the sensor has been previously selected. Routing the packet may include routing the packet using an underlying routing protocol of the sensor network. The underlying routing protocol of the sensor network may be a point-to-point routing protocol. Routing the packet from the source sensor toward the selected sensor may include routing the packet toward the selected sensor without enumeration of a path from the source sensor to the selected sensor. The packet may be routed from the selected sensor toward the destination sensor. A value of an indicator configured to indicate whether to route the packet to the selected sensor or to the destination sensor may be determined, and whether to route the packet to the destination sensor may be determined based on a distance to the destination sensor. The value of the indicator may be changed to indicate that the packet is to be routed to the destination sensor based on the determination of whether to route the packet to the destination sensor. The packet may be routed to the destination sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another general aspect, a packet is routed along a path through a sensor network from a source sensor to the destination sensor. The path is independent of alternative paths through the network from the source to the destination sensor, the path is independent of an energy status of the sensors included in the network, and the path is determined by the source sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The path may be progressively developed while routing the packet from the source sensor such that the path is not enumerated before routing the packet along the path. The path may be a first path and a second packet may be routed along a second path through the sensor network from the source sensor to the destination sensor. The second path may be independent from the path through the sensor network. The path through the sensor network may include one or more intermediate sensors. The source sensor may select one of the intermediate sensors and the packet may be routed from the source sensor to the selected intermediate sensor before routing the packet to the destination sensor. The source sensor may select one of the intermediate sensors at random from among the sensors included in the sensor network.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another general aspect, a sensing device includes at least one processor and a storage device. The storage device stores instructions for causing the at least one processing device to select two or more sensors in a network to which to route a packet. The sensors are selected independently of energy status of the sensors included in the network, the sensors are selected by the source sensor, and the network includes sensors and a geographic area in which no sensors are deployed. Whether a number of packets routed in a direction toward one of the selected sensors does not exceed the number of packets routed in a direction of the other selected sensors is determined. The packet is routed from the source sensor toward the one of the selected sensors, the routing being conditioned upon a determination that a number of packets routed in the direction toward the one of the selected sensors does not exceed the number of packets routed in the direction of the others of the selected sensors. The source sensor may select the sensors at random from among the sensors in the sensor network. The number of packets routed in the direction of the selected sensors may be equal and the at least one processing device may determine to which of the selected sensors a packet was least recently routed toward, and select the sensor least recently routed toward as the one of the selected sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The geographic area in which no sensors are deployed may include a region that includes a physical obstruction. Determining whether a number of packets routed in the direction toward one of the selected sensors may include determining a number of packets routed in the direction toward a neighbor of the source sensor. Routing the packet may include routing the packet using an underlying routing protocol of the sensor network. The underlying routing protocol of the sensor network may be a point-to-point routing protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another general aspect, a packet is identified for routing through a network from a source sensor to a destination associated with the network. A plurality of sensors in the network is randomly selected at the source sensor. A load associated with each of the plurality of sensors is determined. The packet is routed to the sensor having the lightest load rather than directly to the destination, where the sensor having the lightest load is the sensor to which the fewest packets have been routed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another general aspect, a sensor in a network to which to route a packet from a source sensor in a path toward a destination is selected. The sensor is selected independently of energy status of the sensors included in the network, the sensor is selected by the source sensor, and the sensors in the network have a non-uniform spatial distribution. Whether a number of packets routed in the direction toward the selected sensor does not exceed the number of packets routed in the direction of neighbor sensors of the source sensor is determined. The packet is routed from the source sensor toward the selected sensor. The routing is conditioned upon a determination that a number of packets routed in the direction toward the selected sensor does not exceed the number of packets routed in the direction of the neighbors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The source may select the sensor at random from among the sensors included in the sensor network. The routing may be conditioned upon a determination that the number of packets routed in the direction toward the selected sensor does not exceed a number of packets routed in the direction toward the neighbors comprises routing the packet conditioned upon a determination that the number of packets routed in the direction toward the selected sensor is less than the number of packets routed in the direction of each of the neighbors. The routing may be conditioned upon a determination that the number of packets routed in the direction toward the selected sensor does not exceed the number of packets routed in the direction of the neighbors, and a second sensor in the network to which to route the packet may be selected before the packet is routed to the destination sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The packet may be routed from the source sensor toward the selected second sensor without enumeration of a path from the source sensor to the selected second sensor, and the routing may be conditioned upon a determination that the number of packets routed in the direction toward the selected second sensor is less than the number of packets routed toward each neighbor of the second sensor. A count may be maintained on the source sensor in response to a packet being routed from the source sensor to the selected sensor. The number of packets routed to the selected sensor may be determined based on the counter and without communication between the source sensor and the selected sensor. Determining that the number of packets routed in the direction toward the selected sensor does not exceed the number of packets routed in the direction toward the neighbors may be determined based on a comparison, to a threshold, of a ratio of a counter representing a direction of the selected sensor and the sum of counters representing directions of the neighbor sensors. The packet may be forwarded in a direction other than the direction toward the selected sensor when the threshold value is exceeded. The neighbor sensors of the source sensor may be sensors within the communication range of the source sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Implementations of the described techniques may include a method or process or computer software on a computer-readable medium.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates an example communications system <b>100</b> in which sensor query devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>G query sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>FF for information stored on the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>FF. In some implementations, the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH are clustered into geographically localized sensor networks, illustrated as sensor networks <b>120</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>129</b>. The sensor networks <b>120</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>129</b> also may be referred to as clusters or sensor clusters.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A sensor query device may be (or included in) mobile devices such as, for example, cellular telephones, personal data assistants (PDAs), robots, media players, and laptops. As illustrated, sensor query devices <b>110</b>B-<b>110</b>H are mobile devices. A sensor query device also may be or included in stationary devices such as, for example, servers, workstations, set-top boxes, game consoles, and desktop computers. As illustrated, sensor query device <b>110</b>A is a stationary device. Because the sensor query devices <b>110</b>B-<b>110</b>H are mobile devices that can move in and out of the networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b>, and move around within the networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b>, the amount and distribution of traffic (which arises from queries made by the sensor query devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>H) in the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> may be unpredictable because the number and location of sensor query devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>H can be variable. Moreover, queries may be made by sensor query devices that are within the boundaries of the networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b>, such as the sensor query device <b>110</b>D, or by sensor query devices located outside of the boundaries of the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b>, such as the sensor query devices <b>110</b>E-<b>110</b>H. The sensor query devices <b>110</b>B-<b>110</b>H may move around within the networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> and they may move between the networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b>. For example, as shown, the sensor query device <b>110</b>D is located within the network <b>120</b>. However, the sensor query device <b>110</b>D may move around within the network <b>120</b>, outside of the network <b>120</b>, or inside of the network <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, the amount and distribution of traffic across the networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> may vary temporally because certain types of queries are more popular during a particular time of day (e.g., queries for available parking spots near a popular restaurant during dinner time) or during a particular event (e.g., queries for available parking spots at a stadium shortly before a professional sports game). Thus, the traffic across the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> may be unevenly distributed, which may lead to reduced lifetime and reduced operability of the sensors that process a higher volume of packets.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A traffic-oblivious load-balancing protocol may make the distribution of traffic across the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> more uniform. The traffic-oblivious load-balancing protocol routes packets from a source sensor to a destination sensor based on, for example, decisions made by the source sensor. Additionally, the traffic-oblivious load-balancing protocol routes a packet through the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> even though the packet's path through the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> is not predetermined, enumerated or otherwise predefined before the routing is initiated. Avoiding the use of a predetermined path through which to route packets through the sensor network may reduce the storage load on the sensors because the sensors do not have to store the predetermined paths.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The traffic-oblivious routing protocol does not depend on the underlying routing protocol used by the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b>. The traffic-oblivious routing protocol uses source sensors or sensor-querying devices to select intermediate sensors or locations within the network to which to route packets, but the underlying routing protocol of the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> is used to pass the packet through the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b>. Thus, the traffic-oblivious routing protocol may be used on top of (or otherwise in combination, association or conjunction with) any underlying sensor network protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additionally, in some implementations, the traffic-oblivious load-balancing protocol routes packets independently of the energy state of the sensors in the networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> to achieve traffic-oblivious load balancing. In some implementations, the protocol randomly, or pseudo-randomly (and referred to hereafter as just randomly) selects a location or a sensor to which to route a packet prior to routing the packet. Thus, the protocol is independent of the energy state of the sensors in the network, and the protocol is performed without communication between the sensors prior to routing the packet.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described in greater detail below, randomly selecting an intermediate destination sensor in the network, or a random location near a sensor in the network, to which to route a packet before the packet is routed to its destination sensor may result in a more even distribution of traffic across the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b>. In particular, random selection of an intermediate destination sensor results in packets being routed through different paths through the sensor network to reach the same destination sensor. Traffic across the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> may be considered to be evenly distributed, or balanced, if the energy consumption of the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH is approximately equal. By routing packets through different paths through the sensor network, the energy consumption of the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH is more evenly distributed across each of the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the sensor <b>115</b> generally includes a sensing element <b>130</b>, local storage <b>135</b>, a power source <b>140</b>, a processor <b>145</b>, and a network interface <b>150</b>. The configuration of sensor <b>115</b> is shown as an example, other sensors in the sensor network <b>100</b> may include similar or different components/configurations. The sensing element <b>130</b> collects data that is stored in the local storage <b>135</b> such that the sensor <b>115</b> may provide the data in response to a query. The sensing element <b>130</b> may include more than one type of sensing device. For example, the sensing element <b>130</b> may be a sensor such as a temperature sensor, a pressure sensor, a motion sensor, a moisture sensor, an infrared sensor, a biosensor, and/or a device capable of collecting image, video, or other data (e.g., a camera). Thus, the sensing element <b>130</b> may monitor data related to the physical environment in the vicinity of the sensor <b>115</b>. In addition to, or instead of, storing data collected by the sensing element <b>130</b>, the local storage <b>135</b> may store data received from another sensor in the sensor network, another sensor outside the sensor network or a sensor query device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The local storage <b>135</b> may be a semiconductor memory device, such as an Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM), an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), a flash memory device, or another type of component that stores data collected by the sensing element <b>130</b>. In some implementations, the local storage <b>135</b> is configured to overwrite stored data with recently received data. Thus, the sensor <b>115</b> may provide real-time, or near real-time, information in response to queries while also allowing the local storage <b>130</b> to be of relatively small capacity. In some implementations, the local storage <b>135</b> may store two queries and two responses in addition to the data collected by the sensing element <b>130</b>. In one example, the local storage <b>135</b> may have a capacity of about one megabyte or less.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The local storage <b>135</b> also may store data related to the status of the sensor <b>115</b>. For example, the local storage <b>135</b> may store data associated with the activity of the sensor <b>115</b>, such as, for example, power remaining in the power source <b>140</b>, the number of queries received by the sensor <b>115</b>, the number of queries and packets forwarded by the sensor <b>115</b>, the number of responses provided by the sensor <b>115</b>, and information associated with the sources of the queries made to the sensor <b>115</b> (such as identifiers of the sources of the queries). Additionally, the local storage <b>135</b> may store instructions for processing and responding to queries received by the sensor <b>115</b>. In some implementations, the sensor <b>115</b> also may include a status indicator component that is separate from the local storage <b>135</b>. The status indicator may store, for example, power remaining in the power source <b>140</b> in lieu of such information being stored in the local storage <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The power source <b>140</b> may be a portable power source that is included within the sensor <b>115</b>, such as a battery. In other implementations, the power source <b>140</b> may be external to the sensor <b>115</b>. The sensor <b>115</b> also includes a network interface <b>150</b> through which the sensor <b>115</b> communicates with the other sensors in the sensor network, the sensor query devices <b>110</b>, and a gateway <b>125</b>. The network interface <b>150</b> may be a wireline or wireless interface configured to provide a data connection between the sensor <b>115</b> and the other sensors in the sensor network, the sensor query devices <b>110</b>, and the gateway <b>125</b>. For example, the network interface <b>150</b> may be, for example, an Ethernet port, a Wi-Fi interface (e.g., an IEEE 802.11 interface), a Bluetooth interface (e.g., an IEEE 802.15.1) interface, or a generic radio transceiver interface.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, one or more of the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> may be of the form of sensor <b>115</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH may include more than one sensor, or a sensor may include more than one type of sensing elements. For example, a sensor may include multiple video cameras and multiple motion detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The sensors included in the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> may communicate with a network <b>127</b> that is separate from the sensor networks <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> through the gateway <b>125</b>. The network <b>127</b> may be, for example, the Internet. In some implementations, the gateway <b>125</b> may include a sensor similar to the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>FF. Thus, the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>M included in the network <b>124</b> may communicate with the sensors <b>115</b>N-<b>115</b>FF included in the network <b>120</b> through a sensor similar to the sensor <b>115</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In some implementations, the sensors in the network <b>120</b> may communicate with the sensors in the network <b>124</b> through an intermediate network <b>128</b>. As shown, the intermediate network <b>128</b> includes sensors <b>115</b>GG and <b>115</b>HH. However, the intermediate network <b>128</b> may include more or fewer sensors. As shown, the sensors <b>115</b>J and <b>115</b>K communicate with the sensors <b>115</b>N and <b>115</b>O through the sensors <b>115</b>GG and <b>115</b>HH, respectively. Additionally, the sensors <b>115</b>J, <b>115</b>K, <b>115</b>N, <b>115</b>O, <b>115</b>GG, and <b>115</b>HH may be considered an additional network <b>129</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH generally receive queries from the sensor query devices <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>G requesting data from the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH. Because the sensor query device <b>110</b> may be a mobile device that moves in and out of the boundaries of the sensor network and moves around within the sensor network, the amount and distribution of traffic in the sensor network resulting from queries from the sensor query device <b>110</b> may be unpredictable.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In particular, a query hotspot may occur when most of the queries made within the sensor network request data stored on one or a small number of the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>FF. For example, a query hotspot <b>160</b> is illustrated in the sensor network <b>120</b>. In this example, the sensor query devices <b>110</b>D-<b>110</b>G query the sensor <b>115</b>FF simultaneously to cause a query hotspot <b>160</b>. The query hotspot <b>160</b> may occur because of the popularity of a particular sensor at a certain time of day, day of the week, because of the location of the sensor, or because of the type of data that the sensor provides. For example, the query hotspot <b>160</b> may be caused by many queries requesting temperature readings stored on a relatively small number of sensors <b>115</b>. In another example, the query hotspot <b>160</b> may be a result of many queries simultaneously requesting geographic location-specific information from a sensor located in an area of interest to many users of mobile devices, such as a sensor with data related to available parking spots during the lunch hour on a weekday.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The presence of the query hotspot <b>160</b> increases the possibility of a skewed distribution of traffic across the sensor network <b>120</b> because of the concentration of queries in a relatively localized area of the sensor network <b>120</b>. As a result of the query hotspot <b>160</b>, network traffic may be concentrated in the relatively localized area of the sensor network <b>120</b>, which may cause the power sources of the sensors in and around the hot spot <b>160</b> to be depleted more quickly as compared to other sensors in the sensor network <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To more evenly distribute the traffic across the sensor network <b>120</b>, the sensor that receives the query from the mobile device (which may be referred to as the &#x201c;source sensor&#x201d;), or the sensor query device that issued the query, randomly selects a sensor in the sensor network <b>120</b>, or a location in the sensor network <b>120</b>, to which to route a packet that includes information associated with the query. By randomly selecting a sensor in the sensor network <b>120</b>, the packets follow different paths through the sensor network <b>120</b> even though the packets result from queries requesting data from the same sensor (sensor <b>115</b>FF in this example).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the sensor query device <b>110</b>D makes a query for data stored on the sensor <b>115</b>FF. The sensor <b>1155</b> receives the query and randomly selects a sensor to which to route the corresponding packet. In this example, the sensor <b>1155</b> randomly selects the sensor <b>115</b>R. The sensor <b>115</b>S routes the packet toward the sensor <b>115</b>S before routing it to the destination sensor (e.g., the sensor <b>115</b>FF). The packet may be greedily routed through the network. In other words, the packet is routed through the network using an underlying point-to-point routing protocol of the sensor network. For example, to greedily route the packet, the sensor <b>115</b>N receives the packet and passes it to a local sensor, such as the sensor <b>1150</b>, which is near the sensor <b>115</b>N rather than broadcasting the packet to a sensor that is more remote from the sensor <b>115</b>N. The packet continues to be greedily routed to a local sensor as it follows a path through the sensor network <b>120</b> from the sensor <b>115</b>N as it is routed toward the randomly selected sensor <b>115</b>R. The packet is routed to the sensor <b>115</b>FF (e.g., the destination sensor) after it has been routed toward the sensor <b>115</b>R. In this example, the packet corresponding to the query from the sensor query device <b>110</b>D follows a path from the sensor <b>1155</b> to the sensor <b>115</b>FF through the sensor network <b>120</b> such that the path is not predetermined, enumerated or otherwise predefined before the routing is initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The queries from the sensor query devices <b>110</b>E-<b>110</b>H are also routed through the sensor network <b>120</b> by randomly selecting a sensor in the sensor network <b>120</b> to which to route the packet. As a result, each of the queries from the sensor query devices <b>110</b>E-<b>110</b>H will generally follow a different path through the sensor network <b>120</b> even though each of the queries requests data from the same sensor (sensor <b>115</b>FF in this example). For example, the packet corresponding to the query from the sensor query device <b>110</b>F travels through the sensor <b>115</b>W to the sensor <b>115</b>FF. Because the packets travel through different paths as a result of randomly selecting the sensor to which to route the packet, the traffic across the network is generally evenly distributed even when most, or all, queries in the network request data from the same sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some implementations, the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH generally know their location and the boundaries of the network. In some implementations, the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH may be addressed relative to each other or they may be addressed by absolute coordinates, such as the latitude and longitude location of each of the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH. Thus, the sensors <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>HH can, in some implementations, route packets to other sensors within the network using either the relative or absolute coordinates of the other sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an example sensor network <b>200</b> includes multiple sensors distributed in a metropolitan area. As shown, the sensor network <b>200</b> is distributed over a geographical region including several city blocks. However, in other implementations, the sensor network may be distributed over a larger or smaller geographical area, or distributed within a different type of geographical area (such as, for example, a sensor network in a wilderness area designed to collect and distribute data related to wildlife).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The sensors in the example network <b>200</b> measure data and provide information of interest to mobile device users in the area of the sensors or to Internet users that have access to the network <b>200</b>. For example, a person traveling in an automobile on 7<sup>th </sup>Avenue between W 42<sup>nd </sup>Street and W 43<sup>rd </sup>Street may use a mobile device to query the sensor network <b>200</b> to find a coffee shop in the vicinity that has available tables. Sensors <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>215</b> are located in or near coffee shops. In this example, the sensor <b>220</b>, which is located in or near a sushi restaurant, is the closest sensor to the mobile device, thus the sensor <b>220</b> receives the query from the mobile device. The sensor <b>220</b> selects a random location, or a random sensor, in the sensor network <b>200</b> to which to route a packet corresponding to the query. The packet is routed toward the randomly selected location or sensor and to the sensors <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>215</b> after the packet has been routed toward the randomly selected sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Other types of sensors are included in the sensor network <b>200</b>. A sensor <b>225</b> is located in or near a pizza restaurant. In response to a query from a sensor query device, the sensor <b>225</b> may provide, for example, an estimated wait time for a table in the restaurant. In this example, the sensor <b>225</b> may include one or more of a motion sensor, an infrared sensor, and an imaging sensor. The sensor <b>225</b> may estimate the wait time for a table in the pizza restaurant by sensing and characterizing the line of customers waiting for a table. For example, the sensor <b>225</b> may collect video data from the imaging sensor that may be analyzed to determine the length of the line and how quickly it is moving. The wait time for a table may be approximated from this data.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Sensors <b>230</b> and <b>235</b> are located in or near a deli and a coffee shop, respectively. The sensors may provide information similar to that provided by sensor <b>225</b> but specific to the deli and the coffee shop. For example, the sensor <b>235</b> may indicate the types of coffee that are available at from the coffee shop and whether there are any available tables within the coffee shop. The sensor network <b>200</b> also includes a sensor <b>240</b>, which is located at a gas station. The sensor <b>240</b> may be configured to provide gasoline prices in response to queries from mobile devices roaming in the area of the sensor network <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an example process <b>300</b> routes a packet through a network from a source sensor to a destination sensor. The network may be a sensor network such as sensor networks <b>120</b> or <b>124</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The source sensor may be a sensor such as the sensor <b>115</b>S, and the destination sensor may be a sensor such as the sensor <b>115</b>FF, both of which are described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The process <b>300</b> may be performed by a sensor that has received a packet to be routed in the sensor network.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The process <b>300</b> begins when a sensor in the network to which to route the packet is randomly selected (<b>310</b>). The sensor is randomly selected before the packet is routed to the destination sensor. Randomly selecting the sensor to which to route the packet may help to balance the traffic in the network. For example, by selecting the sensor to which to route the packet randomly, different available routing paths are used as time progresses. Thus, traffic across the network generally passes through all, or almost all, of the sensors in the network rather than only through the sensors that lie in a particular path. As a result, the power sources of the sensors in the network tend to be depleted relatively uniformly, which may lead to an increase in overall network lifetime. In some implementations, the source sensor performs the random selection of the sensor to which to route the packet. In this implementation, a processor on the source sensor may perform the random selection. Routing the packet can be performed using, for example, an underlying routing process in the network. For example, the packet may be routed using a point-to-point routing protocol used by the network. In this example, the packet may be routed greedily. The packet is routed greedily by sending it from a first sensor to a second sensor in the vicinity of the first sensor. Additionally, routing the packet may include routing based on physical coordinates of the sensors or based on logical coordinates of the sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The process <b>300</b> continues when the packet is routed from the source sensor toward the randomly selected sensor (<b>320</b>). In one implementation, the packet is routed without enumeration of a path from the source sensor to the randomly selected sensor. Rather, the path that the packet follows from the source sensor to the randomly selected sensor is determined dynamically as the packet is routed toward the randomly selected sensor. The process <b>300</b> continues when the packet is routed to the destination sensor only after the packet has been routed toward the randomly selected sensor (<b>330</b>). In some implementations, the randomly selected sensor routes the packet toward the destination sensor. In other implementations, a sensor located near the randomly selected sensor routes the packet toward the destination sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a process <b>400</b> illustrates an example of a source sensor <b>405</b> routing a packet through an intermediate sensor <b>410</b> to a final destination sensor <b>415</b>. The source sensor <b>405</b> may be a sensor such as the sensor <b>115</b>S described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the intermediate sensor <b>410</b> may be a sensor such as the sensor <b>115</b>N shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the final destination sensor <b>415</b> may be a sensor such as the sensor <b>115</b>FF shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The source sensor <b>405</b> receives a packet (<b>420</b>) that is to be routed through the sensor network to the final destination sensor <b>415</b>. The packet may include a query, or a portion of a query, from a sensor query device requesting information from a sensor in the sensor network. The sensor query device that issued the query or source sensor <b>405</b> may select a random location within the sensor network to which to route the packet (<b>425</b>). The randomly selected location may be expressed in terms of physical or logical coordinates of a sensor, a node, or a location near a sensor. As discussed above, the coordinates may be relative or absolute coordinates. In general, the sensors in the network are capable of approximating the physical or logical boundaries of the network. Thus, the randomly selected location is a location within the boundaries of the network (e.g., within the service area of the network). As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, random selection of the location to which to route the packet may result in improved load balancing of the traffic across the sensor network.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The source sensor <b>405</b> sets an intermediate destination sensor of the packet (<b>430</b>) and a final destination sensor of the packet (<b>435</b>). The intermediate destination sensor of the packet may be a sensor near the randomly selected location. Alternatively, the intermediate destination sensor may be a randomly selected sensor. The source sensor <b>405</b> also sets a destination flag to a first value indicating that the packet should be routed towards the intermediate destination sensor (<b>440</b>). For example, the first value may be set to zero to indicate that the packet should be routed towards the intermediate destination sensor. The packet is greedily routed toward the intermediate destination sensor (<b>445</b>). For example, by routing the packet using the underlying routing protocol used by the sensor network (for example, a point-to-point routing protocol that forwards the packet from one sensor to another local sensor), the packet is routed greedily from the source sensor <b>405</b> towards the intermediate destination sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The intermediate sensor <b>410</b> receives the packet from the source sensor <b>405</b> (<b>450</b>). The destination flag set in (<b>440</b>) is checked to determine the value of the destination flag. The value of the destination flag is used to determine whether to forward the packet toward the intermediate destination sensor of the packet or to the final destination sensor <b>415</b> of the packet (<b>460</b>). For example, if the value of the destination flag is zero, the packet is not forwarded to the final destination sensor <b>415</b>. The intermediate sensor <b>410</b> determines whether it is closer to the intermediate destination sensor of the packet than any of it neighbor sensors (<b>465</b>). If the intermediate sensor <b>410</b> is not closer to the intermediate destination sensor, the destination flag of the packet remains set to the value indicating that the packet is to be forwarded to the intermediate destination sensor. In this case, the intermediate sensor <b>410</b> forwards the packet toward the intermediate destination sensor by forwarding the packet to another local intermediate sensor. When the other intermediate sensor receives the packet, it will check the value of the destination flag and determine whether it is closer to the intermediate destination sensor than its neighbor sensors. In contrast, if the intermediate sensor <b>410</b> is closer to the intermediate destination sensor of the packet, then the destination flag of the packet is set to a value indicating that it is to be forwarded to the final destination sensor <b>415</b> (<b>470</b>). For example, the destination flag may be changed from zero to one to indicate that the packet is to be forwarded to the final destination sensor <b>415</b>. The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> ends when the packet reaches its final destination sensor <b>415</b> (<b>480</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an example sensor network <b>500</b> is illustrated in which a packet <b>505</b> is routed from a source sensor <b>510</b> towards a destination sensor <b>525</b>. In particular, the source sensor <b>510</b> selects a random location R <b>515</b> within the sensor network <b>500</b> and routes the packet <b>505</b> greedily to a sensor near the random location R <b>515</b>. As shown, the random location R <b>515</b> is a location near a sensor. The source sensor <b>510</b> sets an intermediate destination sensor <b>520</b> of the packet <b>505</b> to a sensor near the random location R <b>515</b>. Alternatively, the random location R <b>515</b> may be a randomly selected sensor.

The source sensor <b>510</b> also sets a final destination sensor <b>527</b> of the packet <b>505</b>. In this example, the final destination sensor <b>527</b> is set to &#x201c;sensor 6&#x201d; to indicate that &#x201c;sensor 6&#x201d; <b>525</b> is the final destination sensor of the packet <b>505</b>.

Thus, compared to its neighbors, the intermediate sensor &#x201c;sensor 1&#x201d; <b>535</b> is not closer to the intermediate destination sensor <b>520</b> (which is set to &#x201c;sensor 2&#x201d; <b>540</b> in this example). As a result, the destination flag <b>530</b> remains unchanged and the intermediate sensor &#x201c;sensor 1&#x201d; <b>535</b> forwards the packet <b>505</b> towards the intermediate sensor destination <b>527</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the intermediate sensor &#x201c;sensor 2&#x201d; <b>540</b> receives the packet <b>505</b>, it also checks the value of the destination flag <b>530</b> to determine whether to forward the packet <b>505</b> to the intermediate destination sensor <b>520</b> or the final destination sensor <b>527</b>. The intermediate sensor &#x201c;sensor 2&#x201d; <b>540</b> then determines whether it is closer to the intermediate destination sensor <b>520</b> than its neighbors. In the example shown, the intermediate sensor &#x201c;sensor 2&#x201d; is the intermediate destination sensor <b>520</b>, thus the destination flag <b>530</b> is changed to a value indicating that the packet <b>505</b> is to be forwarded to the final destination sensor <b>527</b> (which is &#x201c;sensor 6&#x201d; <b>525</b> in this example). For example, and as shown in the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the value of the destination flag is changed from &#x201c;0&#x201d; to &#x201c;1&#x201d; such that the packet <b>505</b> is forwarded to the final destination sensor <b>527</b>. The intermediate sensor &#x201c;sensor 2&#x201d; <b>540</b> then forwards the packet <b>505</b> to the final destination sensor <b>527</b>, which is the &#x201c;sensor 6&#x201d; <b>525</b> in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the example shown, the packet <b>505</b> is routed to &#x201c;sensor 3&#x201d; <b>545</b> and then to the &#x201c;sensor 6&#x201d; <b>525</b>. In other examples, the packet <b>505</b> may pass through more or fewer sensors before reaching the final destination sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Thus, the packet <b>505</b> is routed from the source sensor <b>510</b> to the final destination sensor &#x201c;sensor 6&#x201d; <b>525</b> as shown by the solid line path. The dashed line path shows the shortest route from the source sensor <b>510</b> to the final destination sensor &#x201c;sensor 6&#x201d; <b>525</b>. The path of the packet <b>505</b> is not predetermined, enumerated or otherwise predefined before the routing is initiated. Thus, the packet <b>505</b> follows a path through the sensor network based on the selection of the random location rather than on a predefined path or a predefined criteria (such as the shortest path from the source sensor to the final destination sensor).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an example process <b>600</b> selects a sensor to which a packet is to be routed. The process <b>600</b> may be an example of a routing a packet between adjacent sensors during a process to route the packet from a source sensor to a destination sensor. In a more particular example using the sensor network <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> as an example, the process of routing a packet from a source sensor <b>115</b>S to the destination sensor <b>115</b>FF may involve routing the packet between many other sensors, such as <b>115</b>T, <b>115</b>U and <b>115</b>V. Moreover, the process <b>600</b> may be used as a part of a process that routes a packet through a randomly selected sensor before routing the packet to a final destination sensor, such as described previously with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. The process <b>600</b> may be performed by a sensor in a sensor network in response to the sensor's receipt of a packet.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The process <b>600</b> begins when a temporary counter is initialized (<b>610</b>). The temporary counter may be initialized to a relatively high value, such as a value that is likely to be higher than number of packets that the sensor forwarded to any of its neighbor sensors. In some implementations, the temporary counter may be initialized to infinity. As explained below, the counter is used to determine a sensor to which to forward the packet. In general, the packet is forwarded to a neighbor sensor to which the fewest packets have been routed. The sensor selects a neighbor sensor (<b>620</b>). In some implementations, such as in a mesh network, the sensor selects a sensor that is adjacent to itself. In other implementations, any sensor in the sensor network with which the sensor may communicate is a neighbor sensor. The sensor determines the number of packets routed in the direction of the selected neighbor sensor (<b>630</b>). As discussed more fully with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the sensor keeps track of the number of packets the sensor has forwarded to other sensors in the sensor network. Thus, the sensor determines the number of packets routed in the direction of the neighbor sensor without communicating with the neighbor sensor or other sensors in the sensor network.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The number of packets routed in the direction of the selected neighbor sensor is an approximation for the number of packets that have passed through all of the paths on which the selected neighbor sensor falls. The number of packets routed in the direction of the selected neighbor sensor is also an approximation of the number of packets routed to the sensors that are in the portion of the sensor network behind the selected neighbor sensor. Thus, determining the number of packets routed in the direction of each of the neighbor sensors provides an approximation of the number of packets forwarded to each sensor in the sensor network without having to communicate with each sensor in the sensor network. Additionally, the number of packets routed in the direction of the selected sensor may be an indication of the energy status of the selected sensor. If a relatively large number of packets has been forwarded in the direction of the selected sensor, it may be an indication that traffic across the network would be more balanced if the packet was routed in another direction.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The distribution also may take into account the configuration of sensors behind a given neighbor. For example, the number of sensors behind a neighbor may be considered in determining how to route the packets. For example, one sensor may have two neighbors, A and B. A has 8 neighbors, and B has two neighbors. The process <b>600</b> may account for A having more neighbors than B by routing more packets to A than B. The sensor then compares the number of packets forwarded to the selected neighbor sensor to the value of the temporary counter (<b>640</b>). As discussed above, the sensor tracks the number of packets forwarded to its neighbors. If the number of packets forwarded to the selected neighbor is less than the value of the temporary counter, the value of the temporary counter is set to the number of packets forwarded to the neighboring sensor (<b>650</b>). In some implementations, the value of the temporary counter is set to the number of packets forwarded to the neighboring sensor if the number of packets forwarded is less than or equal to the value of the temporary counter. Additionally, if the number of packets forwarded to the neighboring sensor is less than the value of the temporary counter, the temporary counter or the sensor stores an identifier of the selected neighbor sensor. If the number of packets routed is not less than the value of the temporary counter, then the counter is not set to the number of packets forwarded to the selected neighbor sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The sensor then determines whether all of the neighbor sensors have been selected (<b>660</b>). If all of the neighbor sensors have not been selected, the process <b>600</b> returns to (<b>620</b>) and selects another neighbor sensor. Thus, the process <b>600</b> continues until the sensor has selected all neighbor sensors. This results in the temporary counter indicating the neighbor sensor to which the fewest packets have been routed unless the initial value of the temporary sensor was a value that was lower than the number of packets forwarded to any neighbor sensor. In this case, the sensor may randomly select a neighbor sensor to which to forward the packet.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If all of the neighbor sensors have been selected, the packet is forwarded to the neighbor sensor indicated by the temporary counter (<b>670</b>). As discussed above, the temporary counter indicates which neighbor sensor has received the fewest packets from the sensor. Thus, the sensor forwards the packet to the neighbor sensor to which it has routed the fewest packets.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The process <b>600</b> may be used in conjunction with routing a packet to a randomly selected sensor before routing the packet to the final destination sensor, which also helps to balance traffic across the sensor network. In some cases, network traffic may be more efficiently balanced through the use of the combined techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an example sensor network <b>700</b> includes sensors <b>705</b>A-<b>705</b>E. The sensors <b>705</b>A-<b>705</b>E may be similar to the sensors described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. Each of the sensors <b>705</b>A-<b>705</b>E includes corresponding counters <b>710</b>A-<b>710</b>E that indicates the number of packets forwarded by each sensor to neighboring sensors. The number of packets forwarded by each sensor may be the number of packets forwarded within a predetermined time period. The predetermined time period may be measured temporally (for example, hours or days) or from an event (for example, the predetermined time period may be measured since the installation or recharging of the sensor's power source). The information in the counters <b>710</b>A-<b>710</b>E may be used to route a packet from one of the sensors <b>705</b>A-<b>705</b>E to a neighbor to which relatively few packets have been routed. As shown, the counters <b>710</b>A-<b>710</b>E use storage that is separate from the local storage <b>707</b>A-<b>707</b>E included in each of the sensors <b>705</b>A-<b>705</b>E. However, in some implementations, the information stored in the counters <b>710</b>A-<b>710</b>E may be stored on the local storage.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">More particularly, in the example sensor network <b>700</b>, the sensor <b>705</b>A has two neighbors: sensor <b>705</b>B and sensor <b>705</b>E. Thus, the counter <b>710</b>A on the sensor <b>705</b>A indicates how many packets the sensor <b>705</b>A has forwarded to the sensors <b>705</b>B (illustrated by sub-counter <b>711</b>A) and <b>705</b>E (illustrated by sub-counter <b>712</b>A). In this example, the counter <b>710</b>A shows that the sensor <b>705</b>A has forwarded <b>1000</b> packets to the sensor <b>705</b>B (illustrated by sub-counter <b>711</b>A) and <b>3500</b> packets to the sensor <b>705</b>E (illustrated by sub-counter <b>712</b>A). The counters <b>710</b>B-<b>710</b>E included on the other sensors <b>705</b>B-<b>705</b>E in the sensor network show similar information. For example, the counter <b>710</b>B shows that the sensor <b>705</b>B has routed <b>2000</b> packets to the sensor <b>705</b>A (illustrated by sub-counter <b>711</b>B), <b>900</b> packets to the sensor <b>705</b>C (illustrated by sub-counter <b>712</b>B), and <b>3500</b> packets to the sensor <b>705</b>E (illustrated by sub-counter <b>713</b>B). The counters <b>710</b>A-<b>710</b>E in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> indicate the number of packets routed from a sensor to one of its adjacent neighbors, and this information also indicates how many packets a sensor has routed in the direction of each of its adjacent neighbors. Moreover, in other implementations, a neighboring sensor may be adjacent sensors as well as non-adjacent sensors with which another sensor is in communication. In other implementations, neighbor sensors may be other sensors that are physically or logically near the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an example process <b>800</b> is illustrated for using sensor counter in a sensor network in a routing process. For example, the process <b>800</b> may be used to initialize and use the counters <b>710</b>A-<b>710</b>E on the sensors <b>705</b>A-<b>705</b>E in the sensor network <b>700</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As described above, the counters <b>710</b>A-<b>710</b>E include information about the number of packets that a sensor has forwarded to its neighbors. The process <b>800</b> may be used after the occurrence of a particular event, for example, when the sensor network <b>700</b> is first deployed or when one or more power sources in the sensors in the sensor network <b>700</b> are replaced or recharged. Alternatively or additionally, the process <b>800</b> may be used to reset one or more counters in the sensor network after a predetermined time period has elapsed. This allows the counters to indicate the number of packets a sensor has forwarded to each of its neighbors during the time period.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The process <b>800</b> begins when the counters included on the sensors in the network are initialized (<b>810</b>). For example, the counters may be initialized by setting the counters to a value of zero to indicate that the sensor has not forwarded any packets to any of its neighbor sensors. The process <b>800</b> continues when a packet is received at a first sensor in the network (<b>820</b>). The first sensor may be any sensor in the sensor network. For example, the packet may be received by the sensor <b>705</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The process <b>800</b> continues when the first sensor forwards the packet to a second sensor in the sensor network (<b>830</b>). Forwarding the packet to a second sensor may include forwarding the sensor in the direction of the second sensor. For example, the second sensor may be a destination sensor of the packet, or it may be an intermediate destination of the packet. The process <b>800</b> continues when a counter on the first sensor and corresponding to the second sensor is incremented (<b>840</b>). The counter on the first sensor includes data values for each neighbor sensor of the first sensor, and the data value corresponding to the second sensor is incremented in response to forwarding the packet to the second sensor. For example, and referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if the sensor <b>705</b>A forwards a packet to the sensor <b>705</b>B, the &#x201c;SENSOR B&#x201d; data value of the counter <b>710</b>A increases from 1000 to 1001. The process <b>800</b> continues to increment the counters on each sensor in the network until the counters are initialized again.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an example process <b>900</b> determines through which neighbor sensor to route a packet in a direction toward a randomly selected sensor based on a ratio of the counter representing the number of packets routed in the direction of the neighbor sensor to a value representing the number of packets routed in other directions from the sensor. The number of packets forwarded to each neighbor sensor may be an approximation of the number of packets that each of the neighbor sensors have processed. The example process <b>900</b> may be used, for example, to determine a relatively unloaded neighboring sensor (e.g., a neighboring sensor or a direction through which relatively few packets have been forwarded) to which to forward a packet.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The process <b>900</b> begins when a packet to be routed to a randomly selected sensor is received (<b>910</b>). The packet may be received at any sensor in a sensor network such as the sensor network <b>700</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. For example, the packet may be the packet <b>720</b> and it may be received at the sensor <b>705</b>A. The process <b>900</b> continues when a temporary counter is initialized (<b>920</b>). The temporary counter may be initialized to a value that is likely to be higher than the number of packets forwarded by the sensor to any of its neighbors. The process continues when the sensor selects a neighbor sensor to which to forward the packet (<b>930</b>). The neighbor sensor may be a sensor adjacent to the sensor or it may be any sensor in the sensor network with which the sensor communicates. The process <b>900</b> continues when a value based on a counter corresponding to the selected neighbor sensor, or the direction of the selected neighbor sensor, and one or more counters corresponding to the other neighbors of the sensor <b>705</b>A is determined (<b>940</b>). For example, and referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if the selected neighbor sensor is the sensor <b>705</b>B, the value of the counter <b>710</b>A corresponding to the direction or the randomly selected sensor is 1000. The value of the neighbors of the sensor <b>705</b>A are 1000 for the sensor <b>705</b>B and <b>3500</b> for the sensor <b>705</b>E. The value determined may be a ratio of the value of the counter <b>710</b>A in the direction of the randomly selected sensor and the sum of the values of the counters corresponding to the directions of all of the sensor's neighbors. Continuing this example, the value is 1000/4500, or 0.222. The value may be determined based upon other approaches. For example, the value may be determined by the ratio of the value of the counter in the direction of the randomly selected sensor to the value of the counter corresponding to one other direction, or another neighboring sensor, rather than the sum of all neighboring sensors or directions.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The process <b>900</b> continues when the value determined in (<b>940</b>) is compared to a value of the temporary counter (<b>950</b>). If the determined value does not exceed the value of the temporary counter, the temporary counter is set to the determined value (<b>960</b>). The sensor that received the packet determines whether there are any other neighbor sensors (<b>970</b>). If there are other neighbor sensors, the process <b>900</b> returns to <b>920</b> and another neighbor sensor is selected. The process <b>900</b> continues until all neighbor sensors have been selected. Thus, the process <b>900</b> results in selecting a neighboring sensor or direction to which the fewest packets have been forwarded. If all of the neighbor sensors exceed the initial value of the temporary counter, the sensor may forward the packet to the neighbor sensor selected at random.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the example process <b>900</b> may be used in a sensor network <b>1000</b> that includes sensors <b>1010</b>A-<b>1010</b>J arranged irregularly. For example, the sensor network <b>1000</b> has sensors <b>1010</b>A-<b>1010</b>J arranged in what may be referred to as a &#x201c;skewed deployment.&#x201d; In particular, the sensors in the sensor network <b>1000</b> have a non-uniform spatial distribution with respect to a center line <b>1020</b>. The portion of the sensor network <b>1000</b> to the right of the center line <b>1020</b> includes more sensors than the portion of the sensor network <b>1000</b> to the left of the center line <b>1020</b>. If a sensor <b>1010</b>J on the more dense right side of the network is queried often for information by sensor query devices <b>1030</b>A-<b>1030</b>D through a source sensor <b>1010</b>A, the sensors on the left side of the sensor <b>1010</b>A may be more loaded than the sensors on the right side of the sensor <b>1010</b>A. The higher loading on the left side of the network <b>1000</b> may occur because of the relative scarcity of sensors through which to route the packet as it is routed toward a randomly selected sensor and to the destination sensor <b>1010</b>J. By using a process such as the process <b>900</b>, the loading of the left-side neighbor sensor <b>1010</b>C and the loading of the neighbor sensors <b>1010</b>G and <b>1010</b>H may become more uniform, which may further improve the balancing of traffic across the sensor network <b>1000</b> even in the presence of a skewed sensor deployment. In particular, a process such as the process <b>900</b> tends to route packets towards sensors through which fewer queries have been routed (such sensors also may be considered to be the sensors with the lightest loads). Thus, such a process may tend to select the sensors <b>1010</b>G and <b>1010</b>H and reduce the load on the sensor <b>1010</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a sensor network may include one or more geographic areas in which no sensors are deployed. Such a geographic area may be referred to as a gap. The example sensor network <b>1100</b> includes a gap <b>1105</b> in which no sensors are deployed. The gap may be caused by, for example, the inoperability or diminished capacity of the sensors (such as sensors <b>1110</b>K, <b>1110</b>L, and <b>1110</b>M) in the geographic area and/or a physical obstruction (such as an obstruction <b>1115</b>) within the sensor network that prevents the deployment of sensors in the area around the physical obstruction. A gap caused by a group of inoperable sensors may include a small portion of operable sensors that are inaccessible to the sensor network because of the presence of a larger group of inoperable sensors. The physical obstruction may be a natural obstruction, such as a river, lake, mountain, or forest, or it may be a manmade obstruction, such as a building. In the example sensor network <b>1100</b>, the sensors <b>1110</b>B, <b>1110</b>C, and <b>1110</b>N-R border a gap created by the physical obstruction <b>1115</b>. The sensors <b>1110</b>A-C, <b>1110</b>E, <b>1110</b>G, and <b>1110</b>J border a gap created by the inoperability or diminished capacity of the sensors <b>1110</b>K-M.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Similar to the sensor networks discussed above, the sensors in the sensor network <b>1100</b> receive queries from sensor query devices <b>1130</b>A-<b>1130</b>D requesting data stored on the sensors in the sensor network <b>1100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the sensor <b>1110</b>J stores information of interest to multiple users and is queried by the sensor query devices <b>1130</b>A-<b>1130</b>D. Either the sensor query device that issued the query or the sensor that receives the query randomly selects a sensor in the network to which to route the packet, and the packet is routed through the sensor network toward the randomly selected sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The sensors that fall on the border of the gaps tend to become more overloaded with packets resulting from the queries than sensors in other portions of the sensor network because of the relative scarcity of sensors in the vicinity of the gap. In other words, the sensors on the border of the gap region tend to receive and process more packets relative to the other sensors in the network, which may cause the traffic across the sensor network to be unbalanced. Thus, without corrective measures, the border sensors may experience reduced lifetime as compared to the other sensors in the sensor network <b>1110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an example process <b>1200</b> routes a packet from a source sensor to a destination sensor through a sensor network that includes one or more geographic locations where no sensors are deployed (e.g., gaps). As discussed above, groups of sensors that are inoperable or have diminished capacity and/or physical obstructions may cause the gaps. The presence of gaps in the sensor network may cause the sensors on the borders of the gaps to be more loaded than the other sensors in the sensor network. However, by selecting two or more sensors at random to which to route the packet before routing the packet to the destination sensor rather than one, the traffic across a network that includes one or more gaps may be more evenly balanced. In particular, selecting two or more sensors allows the packet to be routed in the direction toward the randomly selected sensor through which fewer packets have been routed. Thus, selection of two or more randomly selected sensors may help reduce the loading of sensors through which a high volume of packets travel, such as sensors that are on the border of gaps within the sensor network.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The process <b>1200</b> begins when two sensors to which to route the packet are selected at random (<b>1210</b>). The sensors may be selected at random by the source sensor (e.g., the sensor that receives a query), or the randomly selected sensors may be selected by a sensor query device that issued a query. The randomly selected sensors are within the sensor network. In some implementations, more than two sensors may be selected at random. Randomly selecting two sensors, or more than two sensors, improves the probability that the randomly selected sensor is not a sensor on the border of a gap. Alternatively or additionally to selecting sensors at random, locations within the network to route the packet toward may be randomly selected.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The process <b>1200</b> continues when the source sensor determines neighbor sensors to forward the packet toward each of the randomly selected sensors (<b>1220</b>). For example, if two sensors are randomly selected, the source sensor determines two neighbors, with one neighbor sensor involved in forwarding the packet to each of the two randomly selected sensors. The source sensor determines the number of packets that have been routed to each of the determined neighbor sensors (<b>1230</b>). The number of packets routed to each of the determined neighbor sensors may be indicated by a counter on the source sensor that tracks the number of packets the source sensor has forwarded to its neighbors, such as the counters <b>710</b>A-<b>710</b>E described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Because each of the determined neighbor sensors are along a route to each of the randomly selected sensors, the number of packets forwarded to the determined neighbor sensors is an approximation of the number of packets routed toward each of the randomly selected sensors. In one implementation, the source sensor selects the neighbor sensor with the lowest counter value (<b>1240</b>). The packet is routed from the source sensor toward one of the randomly selected sensors (<b>1250</b>). In some implementations, the packet is routed without enumeration of a path from the source sensor to the one of the randomly selected sensors. Additionally, the routing can be conditioned upon a determination that the number of packets routed in the direction toward the one of the randomly selected sensors does not exceed the number of packets routed in the direction of the other of the randomly selected sensors. Thus, the packet is generally routed to the randomly selected sensor to which fewer packets have been routed. This may improve the balancing of traffic across the sensor network by not routing packets in the direction of a sensor to which a relatively large number of packets has been routed, such as a sensor on the border of a gap.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">If the same number of packets have been routed toward the randomly selected sensors, the randomly selected sensor with a physical or logical location closest to the sensor routing the packet may be selected. Other approaches for determining which randomly selected sensor to route the packet toward in the event of a tie may be used. For example, the sensor may route the packet toward the randomly selected sensor other than the randomly selected sensor that it routed a packet toward more recently. In this implementation, the counter that tracks the routing of packets towards other sensors in the network also tracks the time at which these packets were routed. If the randomly selected sensors are in the same sub-net, then a third sensor may be selected at random. If the randomly selected sensors are in the same sub-net, there is an increased likelihood that similar numbers of packets have been routed towards these randomly selected sensors. By selecting a third sensor at random, which is probably, or can be stipulated to be, not in the same sub-net, the traffic across the network may be more balanced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The process <b>1200</b> continues when the packet is routed to the destination sensor only after the packet has been routed toward the one of the randomly selected sensors (<b>1240</b>). The process <b>1200</b> ends when the destination sensor receives the packet.</p>
