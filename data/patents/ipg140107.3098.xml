<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a manufacturing method of laser processed parts obtained by processing workpieces such as sheet material, circuit board, semiconductor wafer, glass substrate, ceramic substrate, metal substrate, semiconductor laser or other light emitting and light detecting element board, MEMS board, semiconductor package, cloth, leather, paper or the like, by cutting, drilling, marking, grooving, scribing, trimming or other shaping process by ultraviolet absorption ablation by laser beam. The present invention also relates to a protective sheet for laser processing used when processing a workpiece by ultraviolet absorption ablation by laser beam.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As the electronic and electric appliances are reduced in size recently, component parts are also reduced in size and advanced in definition, and high definition and high precision are demanded in machining of parts at machining precision of +/&#x2212;50 &#x3bc;m or less. In the conventional press processing or blanking process, the precision is about +/&#x2212;100 &#x3bc;m at most, and such demand cannot be satisfied. Drilling of materials is also demanded to conform to high definition and high precision, and drilling by using conventional drill or die cannot meet the needs.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To solve the problems, lately, machining of materials by using laser beam is attracting wide attention. In particular, the machining method by ultraviolet absorption ablation of laser beam of small heat damage and high definition is noticed as precise outline processing method or fine drilling method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the background art, for example, the dicing method of workpiece includes a method of dicing the workpiece by laser beam while supporting and fixing the workpiece on a dicing sheet (Japanese Laid-open Patent No. 2002-343747). Also proposed is a method of dicing a semiconductor wafer by combining laser with water micro jet (Japanese Laid-open Patent No. 2003-34780). The dicing sheet mentioned in these patent publications is disposed at the exit side of laser beam of the workpiece, and is used for supporting and fixing the workpiece (to be processed by laser) during dicing and in the subsequent processes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When laser beam is used, it requires aftertreatment called desmearing in order to remove deposits of decomposition products of carbon or the like generated by laser processing from the surface of workpiece. The sticking strength of decomposition products is firm in proportion to power of laser beam, and when the power of laser beam is increased, it is difficult to remove deposits in aftertreatment. A stubborn decomposition product may be generally removed by wet desmearing using an aqueous solution of potassium permanganate or the like, but the wet desmearing is accompanied by heavy environmental burden of such as waste liquid treatment. In particular, at the side contacting with the processing table of workpiece or adhesive sheet (the laser beam exist side) is likely to be coated not only with the decomposition products of workpiece but also with decomposition products of processing table and adhesive sheet. As a result, improvement of throughput of processing is impeded, or reliability of cutting or drilling is lowered.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a laser processed part by using a protective sheet for laser processing capable of effectively suppressing contamination of surface of workpiece by decomposition product, and processing at high precision, when processing the workpiece by optical absorption ablation of laser beam. It is also an object of the present invention to present a protective sheet for laser processing for use in the manufacturing method of laser processed part.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present inventors have intensively accumulated studies in order to solve the problems, and have completed the invention by discovering that the objects can be achieved by the manufacturing method of laser processed parts by using the following protective sheet for laser processing (hereafter called protective sheet).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Specifically, the present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a laser processed part using a protective sheet for laser processing having at least an adhesive layer on a base material, with an extinction coefficient ratio of 1 or more, the extinction coefficient ratio being an extinction coefficient of protective sheet for laser processing at wavelength 532 nm divided by an extinction coefficient of a workpiece to be processed at wavelength 532 nm, the method comprising the steps of adhering the adhesive layer of the protective sheet for laser processing to a laser beam incident side of the workpiece; processing the protective sheet for laser processing and the workpiece by irradiating a laser beam; and removing the protective sheet for laser processing from the processed workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The protective sheet is laminated at the incident side of laser beam of workpiece (laser beam irradiation side) before laser processing of workpiece by ultraviolet absorption ablation of laser beam, and is used for protecting the workpiece surface from decomposition products and scattering matter generated by ablation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A protective sheet has at least an adhesive layer on a base material. By using an adhesive protective sheet, tightness of interface of protective sheet and workpiece is enhanced, and invasion of decomposition product into interface can be suppressed, and thereby contamination of workpiece surface by decomposition product can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the manufacturing method of the present invention, it is required to select and use a protective sheet of which extinction coefficient ratio (extinction coefficient of protective sheet for laser processing at wavelength 532 nm/extinction coefficient of workpiece at wavelength 532 nm) is 1 or more. The present inventors found correlation between the extinction coefficient and laser processing performance, and discovered that contamination of surface of workpiece by decomposition product can be effectively suppressed by using the protective sheet of which extinction coefficient ratio is 1 or more.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The extinction coefficient ratio is an important parameter for laser processing of protective sheet and workpiece. The smaller the extinction coefficient of a solid matter at a certain wavelength, the smaller is absorption of light energy. That is, optical absorption in a solid matter occurs in light invasion length (effective distance from solid surface: 1/extinction coefficient), and when extinction coefficient is small, light invasion length is long, and accumulated energy per unit volume is small. Hence, laser processing is difficult in a material of small extinction coefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">By using the protective sheet of which extinction coefficient ratio is 1 or more, as in the present invention, invasion length of laser beam in the protective sheet is set shorter than the invasion length of laser beam in the workpiece. Hence, the absorption of light energy in the protective sheet is greater than in the workpiece, and hence laser processing is easier.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">By using the protective sheet of which extinction coefficient ratio is 1 or more, contamination of surface of workpiece by decomposition product can be effectively suppressed, of which reason is estimated as follows. A protective sheet of which extinction coefficient ratio is 1 or more has a laser processing property equivalent or more to that of workpiece, and hence it is etched by laser beam same as or earlier than workpiece. Hence, decomposition product of workpiece scatters effectively to outside from the etching portion of protective sheet, and hardly invades into the interface area of protective sheet and workpiece. As a result, contamination of workpiece surface can be effectively suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the extinction coefficient ratio is 1.2 or more, or more preferably 1.5 or more. If the extinction coefficient ratio is less than 1, etching of workpiece proceeds earlier than cutting or piercing of protective sheet. In such a case, there is no scattering route for decomposition product produced by etching of workpiece, and decomposition product may invade into the interface of protective sheet and workpiece, and the surface of workpiece may be contaminated. When the surface of workpiece is contaminated by decomposition product, after laser processing of workpiece, it may be hard to strip peel off the protective sheet from the workpiece, or it may be hard to remove decomposition product in later process, and the processing precision of workpiece tends to decline.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the manufacturing method of laser processed part of the present invention, preferably, the workpiece is one of a sheet material, a circuit board, a semiconductor wafer, a glass substrate, a ceramic substrate, a metal substrate, a semiconductor laser light emitting or receiving element substrate, an MEMS substrate, and a semiconductor package.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a laser processed part using an protective sheet for laser processing that includes at least an adhesive layer on a base material, and whose extinction coefficient at wavelength 532 nm is 20 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or more, the method comprising the steps of adhering the adhesive layer of the protective sheet for laser processing to a laser beam incident side of a metal material; processing the protective sheet for laser processing and the metal material by irradiating a laser beam; and removing the protective sheet for laser processing from the processed metal material.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When processing a metal material, in particular, it is hard to measure the extinction coefficient of metal material. However, by using a protective sheet of which extinction coefficient at wavelength 532 nm of 20 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or more, contamination of metal material surface by decomposition product can be suppressed effectively. The extinction coefficient at wavelength 532 nm of protective sheet is preferably 30 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or more, or more preferably 50 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or more.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the other aspect of the present invention, the metal material is one of a semiconductor wafer and a metal substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the base material contains an aromatic polymer. Since this material is large in extinction coefficient at wavelength 532 nm, the extinction coefficient ratio at wavelength 532 nm can be adjusted to 1 or more relatively easily.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the manufacturing method of laser processed part of the present invention, preferably, the processing is cutting or drilling.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention relates to the protective sheet for laser processing used in manufacturing method of laser processed parts. The protective sheet is preferably used when manufacturing semiconductor chips, in particular, by dicing a semiconductor wafer.</p>

Alternatively, an adhesive layer may be separately formed on a peeling liner, and it may be adhered to the base material. The adhesive layer may one layer or two or more layers. As required, a separator may be formed on the surface of the adhesive layer.</p>

The peeling method is not particularly specified, but it is important not to apply stress to cause permanent set of laser processed part <b>10</b> at the time of peeling. For example, when radiation curing type adhesive is used in the adhesive layer, the adhesiveness is lowered by curing the adhesive layer by radiation irradiation depending on the type of adhesive agent.

Accordingly, the decomposition product of workpiece (or metal material) efficiently scatters outside from the etching portion of protective sheet, and contamination of interface area of protective sheet and workpiece (or metal material) can be suppressed. Therefore, according to this manufacturing method, decomposition product does not stick to the interface area of protective sheet and workpiece (or metal material), and the protective sheet can be easily separated from the workpiece after laser processing of workpiece (or metal material), and laser processing precision of workpiece (or metal material) can be enhanced.</p>

When processing a metal material, by using a protective sheet of which extinction coefficient is 20 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or more, contamination of metal material surface by decomposition product can be effective suppressed. As a result, the subsequent process of removal of decomposition product can be substantially simplified, and hence it contributes not only to reduction of environmental impact, but also to enhancement of productivity.</p>
