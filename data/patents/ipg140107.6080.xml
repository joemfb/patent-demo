<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">With the proliferation of the smartphones and other mobile devices capable of accessing the Internet, users are accessing websites more frequently using such mobile devices. However, because the majority of the websites are designed so as to be accessed by computers, users accessing such websites end up having less efficient and less satisfactory experience. One approach to ensure that each of the different users accessing a website from the different devices can use the website efficiently is to provide different websites for different devices. For example, a user accessing a website www.thisone.com is redirected to a different website having the address of m.thisone.com. However, such approach has several disadvantages, including, unnecessary content duplication, inefficient marketing, lower search engine rankings, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Another approach is to allow the application of different cascading style sheets (CSS) by the end users' browsers based on the factors such as the screen size of the end user, etc. This approach relies on the browser to determine how the content is displayed to the end user and therefore the developer of the website relying on the CSS has less control on the presentation of the content. Furthermore, all of the content needs to be sent to the browser even if some of such content is not displayed to the end user, which adds inefficiencies to the communication of the content. Yet another approach is to use the tools that automatically refactor the content and the presentation format based on the identity of the device accessing the website. However, this approach also does not provide the designer of the website full control over the resulting look and feel of how the website is presented to the user on different devices. Thus, this approach is designed to address only the bandwidth problem without providing adequate design choice to the developer of the website.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Implementations described and claimed herein address the foregoing problems by providing a web page optimization system that allows a user to generate web pages that are optimized for use with different user devices. In one implementation of the web page optimization system, a number of master pages and page layouts used to generate the web pages are defined, with each of the master pages defining generalized regions shared by all pages of a website and each of the page layouts defining the content and the arrangement of such content on the web pages. The web page optimization system also defines a number of channels and associates the master pages and the page layouts to the channels. Each of the channels is associated with a user device. The web page optimization system identifies components the user agent string of a web page request, such as the user device generating the request, the browser used to generate the request, etc., and renders a web page in response to such web page request using the master page and the page layout associated with the channel identified by such components of the web page request.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The web page optimization system disclosed herein provides the custom optimization of web pages displayed to a large variety of devices and browsers. Specifically, the web page optimization system identifies the device that is used by a user to generate a web page request, and based on the identification of the device, the system selects a custom master page and a custom page layout that can be used to render a web page to the requesting device. For example, if the requesting device is identified as a mobile device, a master page with smaller and less data intensive header, footer, etc., is selected for generating the web page to be sent to the requesting mobile device. Similarly, a page layout with data that is optimized for display on a mobile device is used for generating such a web page. In one implementation, a number of channels are also defined, with each channel associated with a master page and a page layout.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The web page optimization system allows a user to use the same content for generating the web pages optimized for a number of devices such as a mobile phone, a smartphone, a laptop, etc. As a result, user with different devices can access the content from the same web uniform resource locator (URL). Such an approach ensures that any search engine ranking, marketing campaigns, etc., for a website will use the combined web traffic from all users to the website, irrespective of the devices used by the users to access the website. Furthermore, the web page optimization system also provides different level of specificity in defining mobile devices. For example, a general smartphone channel can be provided for generating web pages for all smartphones, while a separate channel for generating web pages for a mobile device using Windows Phone 7 operating systems can also be defined.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the example data sources and flows for a web page optimization system <b>100</b>. Specifically, the web page optimization system <b>100</b> is used to render and communicate the web pages for the New Geographic magazine having the URL of www.newgeographic.com. The web page optimization system <b>100</b> includes a database <b>102</b> that is used to store various template elements used to generate the optimized web pages for the users visiting the website of the New Geographic magazine. In one implementation, such template elements include various master pages, various page layouts, etc. For example, the database <b>102</b> includes a master page I <b>108</b> that provides the generalized regions, such as the headers, shared by all pages of the New Geographic website. Specifically the master page I <b>108</b> is used to render the web pages that will be provided to a visitor that is using a mobile phone to visit the website of the New Geographic magazine. Similarly, a master page II <b>110</b> provides the generalized regions, such as the headers, the side-bars, the footers, etc., shared by all web pages of the New Geographic website when such pages are provided to a visitor using a computer to visit the website of the New Geographic magazine. Because mobile phones generally have limited amount of viewing space for displaying a web page, the master page I <b>108</b> includes only a small header for generating the web pages and no side banner is used. On the other hand, when a user is visiting the New Geographic's website using a computer, the master page II <b>110</b> is used to generate the web pages that provide fuller and richer experience to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The database <b>102</b> also includes a page layout I <b>112</b> that is configured for displaying the content on a mobile phone and a page layout II <b>114</b> that is configured for displaying the content on a computer screen. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a lesser amount of content space is provided on the page layout I <b>112</b> compared to the amount of content space provided on the page layout II <b>114</b>. In one implementation, the page layouts <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are provided with a number of panels where the content within the panels is displayed only on certain types of devices. Thus, a panel containing a large amount of numeric data can be identified by a web page developer as the panel that will be included in a web page to be displayed on a computer. However, such numeric data will not be included on a web page to be displayed on a mobile device. The database also includes various channels <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. Each of the various channels <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> is associated with various template elements. For example, the mobile channel <b>104</b> is associated with the master page I <b>108</b> and the layout I <b>112</b>, wherein the computer channel <b>106</b> is associated with the master page II <b>110</b> and the layout II <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one implementation, the database <b>102</b> is hosted on a webserver that serves the web pages to the users when they visit the website for the New Geographic magazine. When a user requests a web page, the user also sends various other information about the user, such as the device used by the user to visit the web page, other information identifying the user, etc. An example of such information is a hypertext transfer protocol (http) user agent string sent from the user device browser to the webserver providing the web pages. For example, when a user accesses the New Geographic magazine's website using a browser, an http request including a user string with the URL of www.newgeographic.com <b>130</b> is sent to the webserver hosting the website. A user agent string included in the http request include various information identifying the user, such as the browser used by the user, the device used by the user, the geographic location of the user, etc. Thus, for example, when the mobile phone user <b>122</b> sends a request to access the New Geographic magazine's website, the user agent string attached to such a request includes information identifying the device used by the mobile phone user <b>122</b>, the browser used by the mobile phone user <b>122</b>, etc. An example of such a user agent string is as follows:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0019">User Agent String I</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0020">Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.2.1; en-us; Nexus One Build/FRG83) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">The above User Agent String I identifies that the request sent from the mobile phone user <b>122</b> identifies the device as using &#x201c;Mobile Safari&#x201d; as the browser. On the other hand, when a computer user <b>124</b> sends a request to access the New Geographic magazine's website, the user agent string attached to such a request will include different components or component values. An example of such a user agent string is as follows:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0022">User Agent String II</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0023">Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">Once a request to access the website is received, a device identification engine <b>132</b> parses such request and analyzes the various components of the user agent string. Thus, upon receiving the User Agent String I, the device identification engine <b>132</b> identifies the user device as an Android&#x2122; mobile device using the Safari&#x2122; web browser. On the other hand, when the User Agent String II is received, the device identification engine <b>132</b> identifies the user device as a computer using the Internet Explorer&#x2122; 8 as the web browser. Subsequently, a channel selection engine <b>134</b> selects a channel based on the identification of the user device. For example, if the user device is identified as a mobile device, the channel selection engine <b>134</b> selects the mobile channel <b>104</b>. On the other hand, if the user device is identified as a computer, the channel selection engine <b>134</b> selects the computer channel <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">Once the channel selection engine <b>134</b> selects a channel, a master page and a page layout associated with the selected channel are used to render a web page that will be provided to the user. For example, if the mobile channel <b>104</b> is selected, the master page I <b>108</b> and the layout I <b>112</b> are used to render a mobile web page <b>140</b>. On the other hand, if the computer channel <b>106</b> is selected, the master age II <b>110</b> and the layout II <b>114</b> are used to render a computer web page <b>142</b>. In one implementation, the rendered web pages <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> are cached for future use so that when any other users request the web pages from the website of the New Geographic magazine, such web pages can be delivered without having to assemble the master pages, the layouts, and the content. Furthermore, anytime there is any change in the content of the web pages, all of the web pages <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> can be automatically generated and stored in the cache for future use. Such simultaneous caching and updating of the web pages enhances the performance of the web page optimization system <b>100</b>. Once the web pages are cached, the server hosting the website and the database <b>102</b> determines whether a particular request from another user can be served from the cache. In one implementation, if it is determined that the particular request cannot be served from cache, the system renders all of the web pages <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">While the illustrated implementation of the web page optimization system <b>100</b> only discloses two channels, additional channels, such as a tablet channel to serve tablet devices such as an iPad&#x2122;, etc., can also be provided. Moreover, while the illustrated implementation of the web page optimization system <b>100</b> only discloses one mobile channel <b>104</b> that is selected for all mobile devices, in an alternative implementation, different channels are provided for different types of mobile devices. Thus, in such an implementation, a separate channel is provided for Apple&#x2122; smartphones, for Windows&#x2122; smartphones, for Android&#x2122; Smartphones, etc. Yet alternatively, an implementation of the web page optimization system <b>100</b> includes channels that are identified based on the browser used to access the web pages. Thus, for example, separate channels serve Firefox&#x2122; browsers, Internet Explorer&#x2122; browsers, Safari&#x2122; browsers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">It is also possible that in some situations, when the device identification engine <b>132</b> parses a user agent string, it will identify a user device or a user browser for which there is no designated channel. To address such a situation, an implementation of the database <b>102</b> designates one of the channels <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> as the default channel, which is selected in the cases where no other channels can be selected based on the information available from user agent strings. Yet alternatively, the web optimization system <b>100</b> also designates a default master page, a default layout, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">While the web optimization system <b>100</b> is illustrated to have different channels that are selected based on device type, browser type, etc., in an alternative implementation, different channels are selected based on other information received from the user request. For example, if a user request also includes a cookie with other information identifying a user, such as the geographic location of the user, etc., and if the web optimization system <b>100</b> has the permission to use such user identifying information, a particular channel is selected using such user identifying information.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">Furthermore, while the web page optimization system <b>100</b> illustrates each of the channels <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> to have one master page and one layout associated to such channels, in an alternate implementation one master page is used by more than one channels. Yet alternatively, multiple channels can be associated with the same master page but with different layouts. This gives the designer of the database <b>102</b> the flexibility to designate a large number of channels, even when the designer has not developed the templates for each of such channels. The number of channels that a user can create can be determined based on various optimization and efficiency criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">An implementation of the web optimization system <b>100</b> provides a number of override rules. For example, an override rule provides that even if the channel selection engine <b>134</b> selects the mobile channel <b>104</b> to server a web request, if the web request or a cookie suggests that the user is interested in the computer web page <b>142</b>, the web request is associated with the computer channel <b>106</b>. Yet alternatively, such override rule can also request different combination of the master pages and the layouts. Thus, an example user override requests a web page generated using the master page I <b>108</b> and the layout II <b>114</b>. In such a case, the web optimization system <b>100</b> will generate such a web page and cache it for the future use. Furthermore, a hierarchy for the override rules is also provided so that if more than one override requests are received, the web page optimization system <b>100</b> prioritizes among such requests.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">Using the override capabilities of the web optimization system <b>100</b>, a user can request a version of a web page that is different from the web page generated based on the data from the user agent string. For example, when a user using an iPad&#x2122; requests a web page, based on the user agent string, the channel selection engine <b>134</b> selects a tablet channel. However, the user can use a cookie to inform the web optimization system <b>100</b> that the user is interested in receiving the computer web page <b>142</b>, in which case, the computer channel <b>106</b> is selected. Furthermore, because cookies are persistent, the web optimization system <b>100</b> remembers the choice identified by the cookie.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">An alternative implementation of the web optimization system <b>100</b> also provides a programmability hook that allows the web site developers to plug-in custom logic. For example, a developer can use some custom logic to make a channel perform a function that suits the developer's custom needs. Such programmability hooks can also be used to alter an argument or behavior of the web page optimization system <b>100</b>. In one implementation, such programmable hooks allow a developer to select a combination of a master page and a layout for generating web pages in response to detecting that the user is accessing the website using a particular application, such as an App for the iPhone&#x2122;. Alternatively, a developer can override a channel selection based on detecting the size of the device screen as implied by the user agent string of the web page request.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">For allowing the developers to view the various web pages <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, during the development stage of the master pages and the layouts, the web optimization system <b>100</b> also provides the users the capability to simulate various web page renderings. For example, during the development mode, even if the developer sends a request to the web optimization system <b>100</b> using a computer, the developer can specify that the mobile web page <b>140</b> be rendered. An implementation also provides a simulation application that will display the mobile web page <b>140</b> on a simulated mobile device screen on a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example elements database <b>200</b> used in a web page optimization system used by the New Geographic magazine webserver. The elements database <b>200</b> associates a number of channels <b>202</b> to the master pages <b>204</b> and to the layouts <b>206</b>. As illustrated, a mobile channel <b>210</b> is associated with a mobile master page <b>220</b> and a mobile layout <b>230</b>. Therefore, when the mobile channel <b>210</b> is selected based on the components of the user agent string of a web page request, the mobile master page <b>220</b> and the mobile layout <b>230</b> are used to generate a web page. As illustrated, the mobile master page <b>220</b> is designed with a narrower banner that can be easily displayed on a mobile phone. Similarly, the mobile layout <b>230</b> is also designed to be compact and without any images, graphs, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">On the other hand, when a computer channel <b>212</b> is selected based on the components of the user agent string of a web page request, the computer master page <b>222</b> and a computer layout <b>232</b> are used to generate a web page. The computer master page <b>222</b> includes a wider heading, a logo, and an advertisement. Similarly, the computer layout <b>232</b> includes an expansive heading for the content as well as a graph to be displayed with the content of a story. The computer layout <b>232</b> includes the graph component wrapped in a panel <b>240</b>. In one implementation of the database <b>200</b>, the developer of the computer layout <b>232</b> provides the rules identifying the types of devices for which the paneled content is displayed. For example, in one particular implementation, the developer defines that the paneled content of the computer layout <b>232</b> is displayed only on computers. Alternatively, such rule can be based on the user's browser, as identified by the user agent string. Thus, for example, the graph of the computer layout <b>232</b> is displayed only on a browser that supports the Adobe&#x2122; Flash player.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">The tablet channel <b>214</b> is associated with the computer master page <b>222</b> and the computer layout <b>232</b>. While the implementation of database <b>200</b> does not have separate master page and a separate layout for the tablet channel <b>214</b>, a tablet master page and a tablet layout can be added at a later stage and associated with the tablet channel <b>214</b>. The database <b>200</b> also includes a default channel <b>218</b>. When a user agent string is unable to identify the device, browser, etc., that generates a web page request; the default channel <b>218</b> is used to select a default master page <b>224</b> and a default layout <b>234</b> to render web pages. As in the computer layout <b>232</b>, part of the content to be displayed by the default layout <b>234</b> is wrapped in the panel <b>242</b>. In such a case, a developer of the default layout can specify rules regarding the displaying of the paneled picture.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">While the elements database <b>200</b> is illustrated to associate channels <b>202</b> to various web page elements <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, in an alternative implementation, other fields are also provided. For example, in one alternative implementation, each of the channels <b>202</b> is related a device. Thus, an iPad&#x2122; is related to the tablet channel <b>214</b>, a Blackberry&#x2122; phone is related to the mobile channel <b>210</b>, etc. Even though the elements of the database <b>200</b> are illustrated as graphs, in practice, the database can be configured to only include pointers to objects representing the elements of the database <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example computer master page <b>300</b> and an example computer layout <b>302</b> for a web page optimization system. Specifically, the computer master page <b>300</b> provides generalized regions shared by all pages on a website, such as a header <b>304</b>, a sidebar <b>306</b> with an advertisement, and a logo <b>308</b>. On the other hand, the layout <b>302</b> is a secondary visual template that provides structure to the content of individual web pages. For example, for a web page displaying a news story, the layout <b>302</b> provides the positioning, the style, etc., for the various components of such a story, including a news story heading <b>312</b>, a graph <b>314</b> relating to the news story, and the content of the news story <b>316</b>. The graph component <b>314</b> of the computer layout <b>302</b> is wrapped in panels <b>318</b> such that a web page developer can define rules regarding when such paneled components are to be displayed on a web page.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">The computer master page <b>300</b> and the computer layout <b>202</b> are combined to generate a rendered computer web page <b>320</b>. In this particular instance the graph <b>314</b> is displayed on the rendered computer web page <b>320</b>. This could be due to the rule attached to the panel <b>318</b> that specifies that the content wrapped in the panel <b>318</b> should be displayed on a computer web page. However, if the rule specifies that the content wrapped in the panel <b>318</b> should not be displayed on a mobile web page, a mobile web page generated using the computer layout <b>302</b> will not include the graph <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the example communications <b>400</b> between a client <b>402</b> requesting a web page and a server <b>404</b> providing the web pages of a website. The client <b>402</b> sends a web page request <b>410</b> to the server <b>404</b>. Such a web page request <b>410</b> is generated in response to, for example, a user typing the URL of the website in a browser, a user clicking on the link for the website, the user activating an application on a smartphone, etc. The web page request <b>410</b> includes a user agent string including information that identifies the user device, the user browser, etc. In an implementation, the user agent string also includes a cookie or information identifying a cookie. At <b>412</b>, the server <b>404</b> determines the channel that should be associated with the client's we page request. For example, if the server <b>404</b> determines that the requesting device is a mobile device, a mobile channel is associated with the web page request.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">Subsequently, at <b>414</b>, the server <b>404</b> determines if there is a web page in the cache that can be used to service the web page request <b>410</b>. If the server <b>404</b> has served a client using a similar device in recent past, the server's cache will have the requested web page and the server <b>404</b> uses such web page from the cache to respond <b>426</b> to the web page request <b>410</b>. If no web page is found in the cache, at <b>416</b>, the server collects information that is necessary to service the web page request <b>410</b>. Such information include, the master page associated with the identified channel, the layout associated with the identified channel, the content associated with the identified master page and the identified layout, etc. Using the collected information, at <b>418</b>, the server renders the web page. The rendered page is communicated to the client <b>402</b> at <b>420</b> and the client <b>402</b> displays the web page to a user at <b>422</b>. Subsequently, at <b>424</b>, if another client sends a web page request to the server <b>404</b>, the server <b>404</b> communicates <b>426</b> the rendered web page from cache to the client <b>402</b> and the client displays the web page at <b>428</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates example operations <b>500</b> for a web page optimization system. An operation <b>502</b> defines various channels that will be used to serve the client web page requests. For example, a mobile channel, a laptop channel, a desktop channel, etc., are defined. Alternatively, channels can also be defined based on other parameters, such as the screen size of the client device, the browser used by the client device, etc. An operation <b>504</b> designs the master pages and the layouts used to render the web pages. In an alternative implementation, the page layouts include display templates used by certain layout regions displaying repeating content and optimized for display on various devices. For example, different display templates can be used for rendering such repeating content on different devices in different manner. Additionally, page content can also be optimized by adding the device specific content on the web page layouts. For example, a page layout includes a content that will not be shown on certain devices by enclosing the content in virtual containers, wrapping such content in panels, and defining rules for displaying the content from the panels or the virtual containers.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Subsequently, an operation <b>506</b> associates the master pages and the layouts to the channels. For example, a tablet channel can be associated with a computer master page and a mobile page layout. An operation <b>508</b> receives a web page request from a client for a web page. For example, such as request is an http request that identifies the URL of a website or the specific web pages. Such a web page request often includes a user agent string including the information identifying the requesting device, the requesting browser, etc. An operation <b>510</b> analyzes the user agent string attached to the web page request to determine such user identifying information.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">Based on the information from the user agent string, an operation <b>512</b> determines a channel that will be used to generate the requested web page. For example, if the user agent string identifies the requesting device as an iPad&#x2122;, the operation <b>512</b> determines that it can use the tablet channel to gather the components and the content of the web page that will be sent to the requesting device. An operation <b>514</b> fetches the components such as the master page, the layout, and the content from a database on the web server.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">Subsequently, an operation <b>516</b> renders the web page by putting together the various components and the content. An operation <b>518</b> saves the rendered web page in a cache. Such saved web pages can be used to service future requests from other users. The rendered web page is communicated by an operation <b>520</b> to the requesting device. The requesting device receives the rendered web page from the same web address that the requesting device initially used for generating such web page request. Thus, the operations <b>500</b> do not involve any redirecting of the user's request to other URL addresses.</p>
