<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to managing the energy usage of a community of appliances, and more particularly, to methods and systems for community energy management.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The current &#x201c;smart grid&#x201d; initiative using &#x201c;smart meters&#x201d; is driving appliance and equipment manufacturers to provide connectivity that can respond to and control the peak energy loads in residential and business settings. Smart meters raise consumer awareness of the cost and impact of electric devices. Such devices typically utilize ZigBee&#xae; communication protocol for wireless home area networks relying upon different energy profiles to deliver both energy and other information. As ZigBee&#xae; is a relatively low data rate wireless protocol that does not support streaming of content or downloads for remote software updates and applications, WiFi is used complementarily.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For instance, ZigBee is a wireless language connecting different devices to work together. Available ZigBee networks provide a suggested standard for deploying switches, sensors, and controllers using harvested energy in residential, commercial and, industrial environments. The ZigBee networks include a physical radio using IEEE 802.15.4 standard radios operating in a 2.4 GHz band. The proposed ZigBee standard seeks to provide interference avoidance, mesh networking, security, certification, and an open standard.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The emerging Smart Grid provides residential users flexibility in controlling their electricity costs. A primary driving force is the smart meter which can deliver near real-time electricity prices to homes. The consumer can make use of this information via an in-home energy management controller, which uses prices and user preferences to control power usage across the home. The energy management unit, which may be standalone or embedded in the smart meter or appliance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The problem observed with the Smart Grid unit is that there is a &#x201c;rebound&#x201d; effect wherein the &#x201c;scheduled&#x201d; energy management includes more peaks than the &#x201c;non-scheduled&#x201d; solution, thereby negating benefits of off-peak pricing models. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a prior art simulation of an identified &#x201c;rebound&#x201d; problem that occurs at the end of a peak pricing period as identified by L. Snyder, S. Kishore, &#x201c;Control Mechanisms for Residential Electricity Demand in Smart Grids&#x201d;, IEEE Smart Grid Communications Conference, October 2010. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a plot <b>2</b> of the total power consumption of a simulated fifty home community over a three day period. As noted, a utility company may provide information regarding various peak pricing periods <b>4</b> throughout a predetermined time period. The consumer can make use of this information via the in-home energy management controller (EMC) to delay power usage until the end of the peak pricing period <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although the scheduled system reduces the peak demand to a small extent, it also creates a new, even larger &#x201c;rebound&#x201d; peak <b>6</b>, immediately after the peak pricing period <b>4</b> ends and off-peak prices begin. As illustrated, the maximum load is larger in the scheduled system than in the non-scheduled system (83.2 vs. 68.0 kW), as is the standard deviation of the load across periods (13.2 vs. 11.3 kW). This rebound peak <b>6</b> occurs even though the request intensity during off-peak hours is low. Therefore, it is clear that the off-peak pricing model fails to achieve its goal of reducing load peaks, and may even worsen the problem.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To overcome the &#x201c;rebound&#x201d; peak <b>6</b>, the previous system proposed a complex power scheduling protocol in a Smart Grid system, as well as two optimization methods for choosing the timing of appliance operation within a home. The authors distributed scheduling mechanism guarantees homes a base power level while allowing them to compete for the remaining available power. The acknowledged problem being that the proposed optimization methods are complex in nature and do not work for all power grid configurations.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following description of example methods and apparatus is not intended to limit the scope of the description to the precise form or forms detailed herein. Instead, the following description is intended to be illustrative so that others may follow its teachings.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Example methods and systems for providing community energy management for a plurality of appliances are disclosed herein. In general, the disclosed examples allow for the monitoring and/or control of smart grid enabled appliances in a local household and/or community. In this way, the utility provider may be able to provide finer energy control at the business, consumer house, and/or community, while the utility customer will achieve energy management, including possible price reductions. In some embodiments, because the described examples include the ability to schedule various appliances/devices outside of the direct control of the smart grid, the disclosed system may alleviate the &#x201c;loss of control&#x201d; concern sometimes felt by the electrical user.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The example systems disclosed herein allow for the interoperability of different manufacturers of smart household appliances, either through built-in devices, or externally connected devices, to monitor the community of device's electrical usage. In one example an external and/or internal Energy Management Unit (EMU) measures the energy consumption of the connected appliance and/or other electrical device and stores data regarding the energy usage. The EMU may be provided with a capability to regulate the power consumption of a device and/or the capability to switch the device on and off. The energy consumption data is transmitted to a home hub, which processes the energy usage data from all connected devices and schedules the device usage utilizing any suitable algorithm, including, for example a first-in, first-out algorithm, a prioritized algorithm, and/or any suitable combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one example, the system provides the use of commodity hardware, off the shelf software, OS independent applications, form factor independent devices (PC, tablets, smart phones, etc), media independent (voice, text, video) and a cloud based infrastructure to run all functionalities of the appliance connectivity. This is in contrast to the specialized hardware, proprietary software and/or dedicated, non-interconnected processors that typically run current appliances. In the context of a consumer environment, such as for example, a residence, the disclosed methods and systems are particularly useful for providing enhanced services as will be described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference to the figures, the following discloses various example systems and methods for providing community energy management. To this end, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a processing device <b>20</b>&#x2033;, illustrated in the exemplary form of a mobile communication device, a processing device <b>20</b>&#x2032;, illustrated in the exemplary form of a computer system, and a processing device <b>20</b> illustrated in schematic form, such as for example, an appliance, are provided with executable instructions to, for example, provide a means for a customer, e.g., a user, consumer, etc., to interact with the device <b>20</b> and/or to access a host system server <b>68</b>. Generally, the computer executable instructions reside in program modules which may include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the processing devices <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;, <b>20</b>&#x2033; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be embodied in any device having the ability to execute instructions such as, by way of example, an appliance, a personal computer, mainframe computer, personal-digital assistant (&#x201c;PDA&#x201d;), cellular telephone, tablet, ereader, or the like. Furthermore, while described and illustrated in the context of a single processing device <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;, <b>20</b>&#x2033; those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the various tasks described hereinafter may be practiced in a distributed environment having multiple processing devices linked via a local and/or wide-area network whereby the executable instructions may be associated with and/or executed by one or more of multiple processing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For performing the various tasks in accordance with the executable instructions, the example processing device <b>20</b> includes a processing unit <b>22</b> and a system memory <b>24</b> which may be linked via a bus <b>26</b>. Without limitation, the bus <b>26</b> may be a memory bus, a peripheral bus, and/or a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. As needed for any particular purpose, the system memory <b>24</b> may include read only memory (ROM) <b>28</b> and/or random access memory (RAM) <b>30</b>. Additional memory devices may also be made accessible to the processing device <b>20</b> by means of, for example, a hard disk drive interface <b>32</b>, a magnetic disk drive interface <b>34</b>, and/or an optical disk drive interface <b>36</b>. As will be understood, these devices, which would be linked to the system bus <b>26</b>, respectively allow for reading from and writing to a hard disk <b>38</b>, reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk <b>40</b>, and for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk <b>42</b>, such as a CD/DVD ROM or other optical media. The drive interfaces and their associated computer-readable media allow for the nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the processing device <b>20</b>. Those of ordinary skill in the art will further appreciate that other types of non-transitory computer readable media that can store data and/or instructions may be used for this same purpose. Examples of such media devices include, but are not limited to, magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital videodisks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories, nano-drives, memory sticks, and other read/write and/or read-only memories.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A number of program modules may be stored in one or more of the memory/media devices. For example, a basic input/output system (BIOS) <b>44</b>, containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the processing device <b>20</b>, such as during start-up, may be stored in ROM <b>28</b>. Similarly, the RAM <b>30</b>, hard drive <b>38</b>, and/or peripheral memory devices may be used to store computer executable instructions comprising an operating system <b>46</b>, one or more applications programs <b>48</b> (such as a Web browser), other program modules <b>50</b>, and/or program data <b>52</b>. Still further, computer-executable instructions may be downloaded to one or more of the computing devices as needed, for example via a network connection.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">To allow a user to enter commands and information into the processing device <b>20</b>, input devices such as a keyboard <b>54</b> and/or a pointing device <b>56</b> are provided. While not illustrated, other input devices may include a microphone, a joystick, a game pad, a scanner, a camera, touchpad, touch screen, motion sensor, etc. These and other input devices would typically be connected to the processing unit <b>22</b> by means of an interface <b>58</b> which, in turn, would be coupled to the bus <b>26</b>. Input devices may be connected to the processor <b>22</b> using interfaces such as, for example, a parallel port, game port, firewire, or a universal serial bus (USB). To view information from the processing device <b>20</b>, a monitor <b>60</b> or other type of display device may also be connected to the bus <b>26</b> via an interface, such as a video adapter <b>62</b>. In addition to the monitor <b>60</b>, the processing device <b>20</b> may also include other peripheral output devices, not shown, such as, for example, speakers, cameras, printers, or other suitable device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As noted, the processing device <b>20</b> may also utilize logical connections to one or more remote processing devices, such as the host system server <b>68</b> having associated data repository <b>68</b>A. In this example, the server <b>68</b> may act as a scheduler as described herein. In this regard, while the host system server <b>68</b> has been illustrated in the exemplary form of a computer, it will be appreciated that the host system server <b>68</b> may, like processing device <b>20</b>, be any type of device having processing capabilities. Again, it will be appreciated that the host system server <b>68</b> need not be implemented as a single device but may be implemented in a manner such that the tasks performed by the host system server <b>68</b> are distributed amongst a plurality of processing devices/databases located at different geographical locations and linked through a communication network. Additionally, the host system server <b>68</b> may have logical connections to other third party systems via a network <b>12</b>, such as, for example, the Internet, LAN, MAN, WAN, cellular network, cloud network, enterprise network, virtual private network, wired and/or wireless network, or other suitable network, and via such connections, will be associated with data repositories that are associated with such other third party systems. Such third party systems may include, without limitation, systems of banking, credit, or other financial institutions, systems of third party providers of goods and/or services, systems of shipping/delivery companies, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For performing tasks as needed, the host system server <b>68</b> may include many or all of the elements described above relative to the processing device <b>20</b>. In addition, the host system server <b>68</b> would generally include executable instructions for, among other things, receiving information regarding at least one appliance's energy usage, receiving information regarding the operation of the smart grid, and providing a scheduling service to coordinate the use of the appliance.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Communications between the processing device <b>20</b> and the host system server <b>68</b> may be exchanged via a further processing device, such as a network router (not shown), that is responsible for network routing. Communications with the network router may be performed via a network interface component <b>73</b>. Thus, within such a networked environment, e.g., the Internet, World Wide Web, LAN, cloud, or other like type of wired or wireless network, it will be appreciated that program modules depicted relative to the processing device <b>20</b>, or portions thereof, may be stored in the non-transitory memory storage device(s) of the host system server <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example community energy management system <b>100</b> in accordance with one example of the present disclosure. In this example, the system <b>100</b> comprises at least one electronic device, such as a home appliance <b>110</b> in communication with one or more Energy Management Unit (EMU) <b>120</b>. The example EMU <b>120</b> may be a smart grid compatible, energy monitoring device externally connected via a wall-plug form factor, internally connected (i.e. built-in) to the at least one appliance <b>110</b>, or otherwise suitably electrically coupled to the appliance <b>110</b>. In the illustrated example, one EMU <b>120</b> is shown as an external device that plugs directly into an ordinary 120 volt, 60 Hz electrical socket <b>130</b>, while another EMU <b>120</b> is shown as being integrally contained within the appliance <b>110</b>. It is further contemplated that the EMU <b>120</b> may be adapted to plug and/or electrically couple into any suitable power supply including for instance an electrical socket of any suitable voltage and/or prong geometry. It will also be appreciated that the EMU <b>120</b> may be powered via any suitable electrical supply including, for example, direct AC and/or DC supplies.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As noted above, the appliance <b>110</b> may be any electronic device, such as for example, a washing machine, a dryer, a refrigerator, a television, a coffee maker, etc. It will be understood that there are many other appliances and/or pieces of equipment that may be used with the EMU <b>120</b> without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that if multiple EMUs <b>120</b> are utilized in the system <b>100</b>, each EMU may be optionally adapted to communicate with multiple appliances <b>110</b>, with other EMU(s) <b>120</b>, and/or communicate with a home hub <b>140</b> as will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At least one example EMU <b>120</b> is configured to measure the energy usage of the connected appliance(s) <b>110</b> or other piece(s) of equipment. Still further, at least one example EMU <b>120</b> is configured to store the energy usage data of the connect appliance(s) in its own memory. For instance, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an example EMU <b>120</b> includes a flash memory <b>210</b> and/or a random access memory (RAM) <b>212</b> to store the collected energy use data. The EMU <b>120</b> may use other types of memory in addition to, or in lieu of, flash memory <b>210</b> and RAM <b>212</b> to store the energy use data. The energy use data is, in turn, transmitted to the home hub <b>140</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) such as, for example, a personal computer (PC), terminal, router, smartphone, tablet, or other suitable device via a communicator <b>214</b>, such as a wireless connection using the local area network with WiFi, ZigBee&#xae;, Bluetooth, infrared, or the like. While the connection between the EMU <b>120</b> and the home hub <b>140</b> is illustrated as being a communicator <b>214</b>, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the data connection may be any suitable connection including a wired and/or wireless connection as desired. Software, firmware, and/or hardware executing and/or contained within the home hub <b>140</b> processes the transmitted energy use data generated by the connected appliance <b>110</b> and EMU <b>120</b> and is adapted to at least one of display the data on an integrated and/or external display having a user interface <b>216</b>, and/or transmit the data to the host system server <b>68</b>, or other suitable service, such as a cloud service through the network <b>12</b>, including an Internet, cellular, wireless, wired, LAN, tethered, and/or any other suitable connection.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the illustrated example, the transmitted energy use data is segregated into different services and/or servers within the data repository <b>68</b>A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, including a community server <b>170</b>, an analytics server <b>172</b>, a web server <b>174</b>, or a service server <b>176</b>. While the energy use data is segregated in the illustrated example, the data need not be divided or alternatively may be divided even further as desired. The example EMU <b>120</b> facilitates the ability for an operator to offer consumers cost saving recommendations and usage optimization.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the home hub <b>140</b> may also transmit energy use data to a smart meter <b>180</b>, via a wireless connection using ZigBee&#xae; or the like. In this example, the smart meter <b>180</b> is a typical electrical meter that records consumption of electric energy in predefined intervals, such as intervals of an hour or less and communicates consumption information back to a utility company <b>182</b> for monitoring and/or billing purposes. Typically, the smart meter <b>180</b> enables two-way communication between the meter and a central system. Accordingly, the utility company <b>182</b> providing the power to the appliance <b>110</b> and/or other equipment, can access the energy use data stored on the smart meter <b>180</b> for further review.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an example energy management community <b>400</b> is illustrated showing a plurality of home hubs <b>140</b> communicating with the utility <b>182</b> and the network <b>12</b>. In the illustrated example, the utility <b>182</b> is capable of communicating with the home hubs <b>140</b> via any suitable means including, for example, via a cellular network. Each of the example home hubs may be distributed in a subset of the community, such as for example, a single home <b>410</b>, or may be located in multiple homes <b>410</b>, such as for example, in a residential neighborhood. In the example community <b>400</b>, the energy consumption data for each appliance <b>110</b> connected to each EMU <b>120</b> communicating with each of the connected home hubs <b>140</b> is collected and forwarded through the network <b>12</b> to the analytics server <b>172</b>. For instance, the analytics server <b>172</b> may collect any relevant data including, for example, appliance information for each registered appliance <b>110</b>, power drain consumption (PD), Power drain per cycle (PCy), length of operational cycle (TL), utility demand response (DR) information, total amount of home power load allowed during the utility demand response (DR), and/or any other suitable data. It will be appreciated that this information may be provided in any suitable manner, including for example, by manually entering the data, registering the appliance, automatically detecting the information, by a third-party, by the manufacturer, and/or any other suitable method.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One example EMU <b>120</b> for use in the community <b>400</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The example EMU <b>120</b> comprises a line interface <b>230</b> which is inductively coupled to the power line to rectify and provide line powered DC voltage <b>240</b> to a microcontroller <b>250</b>, the memories <b>212</b>, <b>210</b>, an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <b>252</b>, the communicator <b>214</b>, and the user interface <b>216</b>. A load switch <b>260</b>, such as for example, a solid state relay removes or applies power to the coupled appliance <b>110</b> through a load interface circuit <b>262</b>. The example load switch <b>260</b> and the example load interface <b>262</b> are in series with a load monitoring/sensing circuit <b>264</b>. The example load monitoring/sensing circuit <b>264</b> provides a stepped-down current signal which is within the operating range of the A/D converter <b>252</b> for subsequent sampling by the microcontroller <b>250</b>. As previously described, the communicator <b>214</b> periodically transmits energy use data to the home hub <b>140</b> via a wireless and/or wired connection using the local area network with WiFi, ZigBee&#xae;, or the like. The user interface <b>216</b> communicates the status of the EMU <b>120</b> and provide at least one user interface element which allows the user to interact with the EMU <b>120</b>. For instance, the user interface <b>216</b> may provide a display on which energy use data and the like are shown to the user. Additionally, the user interface <b>216</b> may also provide one or more input user interface elements through which the user can toggle interact with the EMU <b>120</b> to retrieve further information regarding energy use, to on and/or off various appliances including the appliance <b>110</b>, to customize various features and/or settings of the EMU <b>120</b> depending on the particular appliance or piece of equipment connected to the EMU <b>120</b>, to customize various user preferences, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Different utilities <b>182</b> may have different ways to assign the maximum power load per community <b>400</b> based upon any number of factors relative to the utilities' unique environments. In one example, it can be assumed that the total power allocated by the utility to the community <b>400</b> is based on 80% of the total peak power consumption of all the homes <b>140</b> in the community <b>400</b>. Accordingly, as long as the community <b>400</b> as a whole is below the maximum power load allocation, then there is no inconvenience to the consumer of delaying usage of the appliance <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To provide one example method of schedule energy usage, a community energy management process <b>600</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the illustrated example, the process <b>600</b> begins at a block <b>602</b> wherein a new load, such as a new appliance <b>110</b> is detected by at least one of the EMU <b>120</b>, the home hub <b>140</b>, and/or the host system <b>68</b>. The detected load may include data representative of the estimated load for the device cycle. In at least one example, the data source for the estimated load is the manufacturer, the device itself, and/or the average load usage data stored, for example, in the EMU <b>120</b>. The process <b>600</b> then determines whether the customer has opted to participate in a demand response pricing structure at a block <b>604</b>. If the customer has not opted to participate, the process <b>600</b> continues on to a block <b>606</b> where the operation of the new load is allowed to operate normally (e.g., without any energy controlling). In this instance, allowing the appliance <b>110</b> to operate under a normal power usage may entail displaying power usage at a block <b>608</b>, such as for example on the user interface <b>216</b> of the EMU <b>120</b>, and may include suggested cost savings at a block <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the process <b>600</b> determines that the customer has opted in to participation with demand response pricing, the process then determines in the demand response pricing is active at a block <b>612</b>. If demand response pricing is not active, then the new load is allowed to operate normally at the block <b>606</b>. If however, demand response pricing is active, the process <b>600</b> utilizes data collected from the utility <b>182</b> to determine if the individual total allowed home power load is above a pre-calculated level at a block <b>614</b>. In this example, the individual total allowed home power load is set equally by the number of homes in the community <b>400</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that many other methods of determining the individual total allowed home power load may be utilized as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If the process <b>600</b> determines that the home is not above the individual total allowed home power load, the appliance <b>110</b> is allowed to operate under normal conditions. If however, the process <b>600</b> determines that the home is above the individual total allowed home power load, a command is sent at block <b>616</b> to cause the appliance <b>110</b> to operate in a low power mode (if available), and/or otherwise limit the appliance's power consumption load. In one example low power mode, the appliance <b>110</b> is still operational, but operates at a lower power consumption, thus requiring longer to complete its operation. Following the enabling of the low power load, the process <b>600</b> again utilizes data collected from the utility <b>182</b> to determine if the total allowed power load for the entire community <b>400</b> is above a pre-calculated level at a block <b>618</b>. If the total community power load is below the pre-calculated level, then the process <b>600</b> continues to allow normal operation at block <b>606</b>, albeit with the new appliance operating in a limited power consumption load.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If the process <b>600</b> determines that the community <b>400</b> is at or above the total community power load, then the process <b>600</b> limits any new loads at block <b>620</b> by delaying the operation of the new load until after the demand response period has ended. the delayed loads are placed in a holding queue <b>621</b> in a first-in sequence. Once new loads are delayed, the process <b>600</b> monitors and determines whether the demand response period has been deactivated at a block <b>622</b>. If the demand response period has not been deactivated, the process <b>600</b> may return to block <b>618</b> to monitor the community power allocation. Thus, if the power load of the community <b>400</b> falls sufficiently, the limitation on new loads may be lifted as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Once the process <b>600</b> determines that the demand response period has been deactivated, the process <b>600</b> initialized a queue management process <b>700</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), such as a first-in, first-out (FIFO) process at a block <b>624</b>. The process <b>700</b> will be described in greater detail, but in general, the process <b>700</b> allows the controlled initialization of any delayed loads while monitoring the power allocation of the community <b>400</b> to avoid the rebound peaks as noted. Specially, while the process <b>700</b> is performing, the process <b>600</b> determines whether the community <b>400</b> is at or above the total community power load at a block <b>626</b>. If the process <b>600</b> determines that the community <b>400</b> is at or above the total community power load, then the process <b>600</b> suspends the process <b>700</b> at a block <b>628</b> until the total community load falls below the allocation. Once the process <b>600</b> determines that the community <b>400</b> is below the total community power load, the process <b>700</b> continues and/or restarts at a block <b>630</b> as necessary. The process <b>600</b> then determines whether the process <b>700</b> is complete at a block <b>632</b> and if not, returns to the block <b>626</b> to continue to monitor the community load level. If the process <b>700</b> is complete, the process <b>600</b> returns to the initial block <b>602</b> to await a new load to enter the community <b>400</b>. In essence, the closed feedback loop provides a mechanism by which to avoid the rebound peaks associated with previous delay methods by intelligently extending the delay to turn-on loads.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an example queue management process <b>700</b> is illustrated in greater detail. In this example, the queue management process is a FIFO sequence, which generally provides that the queue of delayed loads will be initialized in a first-in, first-out sequence. In the illustrated example, the process <b>700</b> begins starting the turn-on process by obtaining the appliance from the queue <b>621</b> that was the first-in to the queue <b>621</b>. The process <b>700</b> then continues on at a block <b>704</b> to determine whether there is a positive load gap between the current community load and the maximum community load level. Specially, the gap is defined as the difference between the community allocation and the actual energy consumption. If there is not a positive gap, the process <b>600</b> will continue to monitor the community load level until a gap occurs (e.g., through the disuse of an appliance in the community).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once there is a positive gap in the community load level, the process <b>700</b> determines whether the estimated load level of the current appliance in the queue is lower than the calculated gap level at a block <b>706</b>. If the estimated load level is less than the load available in the calculated gap, the appliance is turned on at a block <b>708</b> and the process <b>700</b> returns to the block <b>702</b> to process the next appliance in the queue <b>621</b>. If, however, the estimated load for the current appliance is not less than the calculated gap, the process <b>700</b> looks for the next item in the queue at the block <b>710</b> and repeats the determination process at block <b>706</b>. The process <b>700</b> will repeat the queue management process until all items in the queue have been started.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Concurrent with the initialization of the loads in the queue <b>621</b>, the process <b>700</b> may look at all active loads and their cycles at block <b>712</b>, may calculate the time left to complete the cycle a block <b>714</b>, may calculate an approximate time of turn-on for each item in the queue at a block <b>716</b>, and may display the calculated information to the user interface <b>216</b>, or other suitable display, at a block <b>720</b>. It will be appreciated that the process <b>700</b> may provide for a queue management process as is known in the art to allow a user to override, prioritize, and/or customize the queue <b>621</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although certain example methods and apparatus have been described herein, the scope of coverage of this patent is not limited thereto. On the contrary, this patent covers all methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture fairly falling within the scope of the appended claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>
