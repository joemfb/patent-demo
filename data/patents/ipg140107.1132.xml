<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to a near field communications (NFC) device such as an NFC tag or an NFC reader operating in a tag emulation mode.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A near field communications (NFC) tag typically includes an antenna which is connected, via an impedance matching network, to a tag receiver made up of semiconductor components which implement functionality of the tag. The tag receiver has an input impedance which is typically different from an output impedance of the antenna, and so the impedance matching network is used to match the antenna impedance to the input impedance of the tag receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The semiconductor components of the tag receiver are typically configured to operate within a specific range of voltages. For example, the tag receiver may be made up of CMOS semiconductor components. To protect these CMOS semiconductor components from damage resulting from input signals whose voltage amplitude is too high, the tag may include a voltage limiter, which may also act to prevent the semiconductor components from being reverse biased.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The correct operation of the voltage limiter depends upon the source impedance of the impedance matching network. If the source impedance is too low the voltage limiter will not function correctly.</p>

A variable potential divider is included to vary the voltage of the input signal to the load, so that if a potentially damaging over-voltage condition exists the voltage of the input signal to the load can be reduced to a safe level. The variable potential divider may be composed of an effective source impedance, made up of the impedance of the antenna and an impedance matching network, and an effective impedance of the load, and the impedance of the impedance matching network may be variable by means of a variable capacitance and/or a variable resistance, such that the output voltage of the variable potential divider may be adjusted by adjusting the variable capacitance and/or variable resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a near field communications (NFC) device comprising an antenna for generating an electromotive force (EMF) and a load, the antenna and the load being coupled such that the EMF generated by the antenna provides an input signal for the load, wherein the NFC device further comprises a variable potential divider for varying the voltage of the input signal supplied to the load.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic representation of a near field communications (NFC) system <b>10</b>, in which an NFC reader <b>12</b> communicates with an NFC device <b>14</b> by generating an electromagnetic field around its antenna <b>16</b>, which couples the reader antenna <b>16</b> to an antenna <b>18</b> of the NFC device <b>14</b>. Typically the NFC device is a tag, but in some circumstances other NFC devices may emulate a tag, for example an NFC reader may operate in a tag emulation mode. In the following description the NFC device <b>14</b> will be referred to as a tag, but it is to be appreciated that the present invention may be implemented by any NFC device that exhibits tag-like behaviour, such as an NFC reader in tag emulation mode.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a passive mode of communication the tag <b>14</b> modulates the electromagnetic field generated by the reader <b>12</b> to transmit data, whilst in an active mode of communication the reader <b>12</b> and tag <b>14</b> alternately generate their own electromagnetic fields to transmit data between the reader <b>12</b> and the tag <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic representation of an equivalent circuit representing the NFC tag <b>14</b> operating in a passive mode in the presence of the reader <b>12</b>. As a result of magnetic coupling between the reader antenna <b>16</b> and the tag antenna <b>18</b>, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in the tag antenna <b>18</b>, and thus the tag <b>14</b> can be modelled as a Faraday EMF generator <b>22</b> which couples to an antenna impedance matching network <b>24</b> via series inductances <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. The antenna impedance matching network <b>24</b> in turn couples to a tag load, which in the model of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents a tag receiver <b>30</b>, which may be made up, for example, of semiconductor components.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The equivalent circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be re-drawn as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as a single ended voltage source <b>42</b> with an equivalent series source impedance <b>44</b> that is dependent upon the tag antenna <b>18</b>, the reader antenna <b>16</b>, the impedance of the reader <b>12</b>, an impedance of an antenna matching circuit in the tag <b>14</b> and a coupling factor between the tag antenna <b>18</b> and the reader antenna <b>16</b>. The equivalent load impedance of the tag receiver <b>30</b> is represented by a further series impedance <b>46</b>, which acts in parallel with the semiconductor components of the tag receiver <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be appreciated from this that the equivalent source impedance <b>44</b> and the equivalent load impedance <b>46</b> of the tag receiver form a potential divider. The effect of this is that the voltage, at node A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, of the input signal to the semiconductor components of the tag receiver <b>30</b> is dependent upon the magnitude of the equivalent source impedance and the equivalent load impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the equivalent source impedance <b>44</b> depends upon the tag antenna <b>18</b>, the reader antenna <b>16</b>, the impedance of the reader <b>12</b>, an impedance of an antenna matching circuit in the tag <b>14</b> and the coupling factor between the tag antenna <b>18</b> and the reader antenna <b>16</b>, the equivalent source impedance <b>44</b> varies as a function of the proximity of the tag antenna <b>18</b> to the reader antenna <b>16</b>, since the coupling factor varies as a function of the proximity of the tag antenna <b>18</b> to the reader antenna <b>16</b>. Thus, the voltage (at node A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the input signal to the semiconductor components of the tag receiver <b>30</b> is also subject to variation as a function of the proximity of the tag antenna <b>18</b> to the reader antenna <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The semiconductor components of the tag receiver <b>30</b> are typically CMOS components. In order to avoid any risk of damage to the CMOS components of the tag receiver <b>30</b>, the input voltage (at node A) must not fall below around &#x2212;0.5 volts or exceed around 4 volts. Accordingly, the tag receiver <b>30</b> includes an input voltage limiter which is operative to limit the voltage of a signal received at the tag receiver <b>30</b> from the tag antenna <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The voltage limiter is shown generally at <b>50</b> in the schematic representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the voltage limiter <b>50</b> includes a positive amplitude limiter <b>52</b> and a negative amplitude limiter <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A ground potential is defined as a reference for the EMF generated by the tag antenna <b>18</b>, and the voltage output from the tag antenna <b>18</b> will swing above and below this ground potential. As is explained above, it is important that the positive swing does not exceed about 4 volts, whilst the negative swing should not exceed about &#x2212;0.5 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The EMF generated by the tag antenna <b>18</b> is input to both the positive amplitude limiter <b>52</b> and the negative amplitude limiter <b>54</b> in parallel. If the amplitude of the EMF generated by the tag antenna <b>18</b> is below about 4 volts, the positive amplitude limiter <b>52</b> does not operate, and the voltage limiter <b>50</b> permits a signal of unmodified amplitude to be input to the CMOS components of the tag receiver <b>30</b>. However, if the amplitude of the EMF generated by the tag antenna <b>18</b> exceeds about 4 volts, the positive amplitude limiter <b>52</b> limits the amplitude of the input signal to the tag receiver <b>30</b> to about 4 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Similarly, if the EMF generated by the tag antenna <b>18</b> is below about &#x2212;0.5 volts, the negative amplitude limiter <b>54</b> operates and restricts the amplitude of the signal input to the CMOS components of the tag receiver <b>30</b> to about &#x2212;0.5 volts, whilst if the EMF generated by the tag antenna <b>18</b> is above about &#x2212;0.5 volts, the negative amplitude limiter <b>54</b> does not operate, and the voltage limiter <b>50</b> permits a signal of unmodified amplitude to be input to the CMOS components of the tag receiver <b>30</b> (subject of course to the operation of the positive amplitude limiter <b>52</b> if a positive over-voltage condition exists).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order for the voltage limiter <b>50</b> to operate effectively the effective source impedance <b>44</b> must be maximised. However, as the effective source impedance <b>44</b> is variable, depending upon the proximity of the tag antenna <b>18</b> to the reader antenna <b>16</b>, the effective source impedance cannot be maximised in all circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic representation of a tag architecture in which this problem is addressed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the architecture illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a resonant network <b>60</b> (shown in dashed outline) is made up of a series combination of the inductance of the tag antenna <b>18</b>, (represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by the inductance <b>62</b>) and a capacitance <b>64</b>, with a series resistance <b>66</b> representing the effective series resistance of the tag antenna <b>18</b>. The value of the capacitance is selected such that the resonant network <b>60</b> has a resonant frequency equal to that of the carrier frequency used in an NFC system, e.g. 13.56 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The equivalent input (load) impedance of the tag receiver <b>30</b> is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by a parallel combination of a capacitance <b>68</b> and a resistance <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also includes an impedance matching network <b>72</b> which is operative to move the high source impedance seen at the input of the tag antenna <b>18</b> to a lower impedance value. The impedance matching network is made up of a capacitance <b>74</b> in parallel with the resonant network <b>60</b> and an inductance <b>76</b> in series with the resonant network <b>60</b>. A parallel combination of a variable capacitance <b>78</b> and a variable resistance <b>80</b> is connected in series with the inductance <b>76</b>, and permits adjustment of the equivalent source impedance seen by the tag receiver <b>30</b> to ensure correct operation of the voltage limiter <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic block diagram illustrating functions performed by the tag receiver <b>30</b>. It is to be appreciated that the functional blocks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are representative only of functions performed by the tag receiver <b>30</b>, and do not represent physical components of the tag receiver <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the tag receiver <b>30</b> includes an amplitude detector <b>92</b>, which may be implemented as part of an IQ receiver, for example, and which is operative to detect the amplitude of the voltage at the input to the tag receiver <b>30</b> (and therefore also at the input of the voltage limiter <b>50</b>), as generated by the tag antenna <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An output of the amplitude detector <b>92</b> is connected to a processor <b>94</b>, which is operative to determine whether the amplitude of the voltage input <b>50</b> to the tag receiver <b>30</b> is too great, either positive or negative, for the voltage limiter to limit the amplitude sufficiently to ensure that no damage to the semiconductor components of the tag receiver <b>30</b> occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An output of the processor <b>94</b> is connected to an input of a controller <b>96</b>, which in turn has outputs that connect to control inputs of the variable capacitor <b>78</b> and the variable resistor <b>80</b> respectively, such that the capacitance value of the variable capacitor <b>78</b> and the resistance value of the variable resistance <b>80</b> can be adjusted, to adjust the equivalent source impedance seen by the tag receiver <b>30</b>, in response to changes in the equivalent impedance of the tag antenna <b>18</b> resulting from the proximity of an NFC reader <b>12</b>, so as to adjust the input voltage to the tag receiver <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation of the architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the amplitude detector <b>92</b> detects the amplitude of the voltage at the input of the tag receiver <b>30</b> resulting from the EMF generated by the tag antenna <b>18</b>. If the processor <b>94</b> determines that the amplitude of the voltage is within safe positive and negative limits within which the voltage limiter <b>50</b> can operate effectively, no further action is taken.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">However, if the processor <b>94</b> determines that the amplitude of the input voltage exceeds the safe positive or negative limit within which the voltage limiter can operate, it transmits a signal to the controller <b>96</b>, to cause the controller <b>96</b> to adjust the value of the variable capacitor <b>78</b> and/or the variable resistor <b>80</b> so as to increase the effective source impedance seen by the tag receiver <b>30</b>, thereby reducing the voltage at the input of the tag receiver <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The variable resistor <b>80</b> is used to implement a coarse change in the effective source impedance, whilst the variable capacitor <b>78</b> is used to implement a fine change in the effective source impedance. Thus, where the voltage amplitude detected by the amplitude detector is significantly greater (either positive or negative) than the safe amplitude limit of the voltage limiter <b>50</b>, the controller <b>96</b> may cause a large change in the value of the variable resistance <b>80</b> to effect the required large change in the effective source impedance, thereby causing a large reduction in the amplitude of the voltage input to the tag receiver <b>30</b>. In contrast, where the voltage amplitude detected by the amplitude detector <b>92</b> is only a small amount greater than the safe amplitude limit of the voltage limiter <b>50</b>, the controller <b>96</b> may cause a change in the value of the variable capacitor <b>78</b> to effect the required small change in the effective source impedance, thereby causing only a small reduction in the amplitude of the voltage input to the tag receiver <b>30</b>. Of course, the controller <b>96</b> may cause the value of both the capacitor <b>78</b> and the resistor <b>80</b> to change to effect the required change in the effective source impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be appreciated that the variable capacitor <b>78</b> and the variable resistor <b>80</b> and the associated amplitude detector <b>92</b>, processor <b>94</b> and controller <b>96</b> allow the physical size of the positive amplitude limiter <b>52</b> to be minimised, since the magnitude of the reduction in amplitude required can be controlled to a large extent by altering the effective source impedance seen by the tag receiver <b>30</b> by adjusting the values of the capacitor <b>80</b> and resistor <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the foregoing description and the appended drawings, the invention has been described by reference to an NFC tag. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the invention can be implemented as a standalone tag or in any device that exhibits tag-like behaviour, such as an NFC reader that is able to switch between tag and reader emulation modes.</p>
