<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to methods and communication devices in a communications network, in particular, for determining neighbour relationship between communication devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In communications networks when, for example, performing a handover of a user equipment (UE) from one cell to another one need to establish a neighbour relationship between base stations serving the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In Long Term Evolution systems (LTE), an Adaptive Neighbouring Cell Relations (ANR) function is used in the base stations. The ANR is defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 as a function that automatically conFigures neighbouring cell relations between cells. This is done by assistance from a UE.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A first eNodeB serving a first cell has an ANR function. As a part of the normal call procedure, the first eNodeB instructs each UE to perform measurements on the surrounding radio environment. The first eNodeB may use different policies for instructing the UE to do measurements, and when to report them to the first eNodeB. This measurement procedure comprises the steps:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">The UE sends a measurement report regarding a second cell of a second eNodeB. This report contains the second cell's Physical Cell ID (Phy-CID), but not the second cell's Global-CID.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0006">When the first eNodeB receives a UE measurement report containing Phy-CID, the following sequence may be used.
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0007">The first eNodeB instructs the UE, using the newly discovered Phy-CID as parameter, to read the Global-CID, tracking area code (TAC) and all available Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) ID(s) of the related second cell. To do so, the first eNodeB may need to schedule appropriate idle periods to allow the UE to read the Global-CID from the broadcast channel (BCH) of the detected second cell in any known manner.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0008">When the UE has found out the second cell's Global-CID on the BCH, the UE reports the detected Global-CID to the first eNodeB serving the first cell. In addition, the UE reports the TAC and all PLMN IDs that have been detected, whenever the first eNodeB requests this information.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0009">The first eNodeB decides to add this neighbour relation, and can use Phy-CID and Global-CID to:
        <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0010">a Lookup a transport layer address to the new second eNodeB.</li>
            <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0011">b Update its Neighbour Relation List.</li>
            <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0012">c If needed, setup a new X2 interface towards this second eNodeB.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0013">There is a security problem with ANR in that the ANR functionality utilizes information from the UEs to conFigure neighbouring cell relations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0014">A &#x201c;hostile&#x201d; UE could report &#x201c;fictional&#x201d; physical cell identities. This could lead to the creation of neighbouring cells, the creation of neighbouring cell relations and that the establishment of X2 interfaces are initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0015">This type of behaviour could be viewed as a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack since the &#x201c;fictional&#x201d; neighbouring cells would block &#x201c;real&#x201d; neighbouring cells (and relations) from being created; setting up X2 interfaces to fictional neighbouring cells leaving no capacity to &#x201c;real&#x201d; neighbouring cells. Also, the attack would cause increased signalling load in the radio access network (RAN) since X2 connection establishment would be initiated when the &#x201c;fictional&#x201d; neighbouring cell is belonging to another base station.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0016">These types of security issues could be an increasing problem when open source Operating Systems are introduced in the UEs, such as Android and or the like, wherein hostile attacks may increase from different operators/UEs and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0017">A similar problem could also occur due to e.g. weather conditions. In certain weather, the radio propagates further (atmospheric reflection) and this will lead to that UEs may report the physical identities of base stations far away from their serving base station.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0018">When the &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; neighbouring cell relation has been conFigured by ANR, the UEs are handed over to the &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; base station leading to an increased risk of connections being dropped.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019">Embodiments herein disclose a reliable and efficient manner to setup a neighbour relationship between communication devices, for example, base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0020">In some embodiments, a method in a first communication device with an adaptive neighbouring cell relations function is disclosed. The first communication device receives a measurement report of a possible neighbouring cell candidate of a second communication device from a user equipment camped/connected within a first cell served by the first communication device, and determines to set up an inter node connection to the second communication device serving the possible neighbouring cell candidate indicated in the received measurement report. Furthermore, the first communication device initiates to set up the inter node connection to the second communication device by sending a connection request comprising a geographical position of the first communication device to the second communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0021">In order to perform the method a first communication device is provided. The first communication device comprises an adaptive neighbouring cell relations function stored on a memory unit of the first communication device and a control unit arranged to execute the adaptive neighbouring cell relations function The first communication device further comprises a receiving arrangement adapted to receive a measurement report of a possible neighbouring cell candidate from a user equipment connected/camped within a cell of the first communication device. In addition, the control unit is arranged to determine to set up an inter node connection to the second communication device serving the possible neighbouring cell candidate indicated in the received measurement report, and to initiate to set up the inter node connection to the second communication device by sending a connection request comprising a geographical position of the first communication device to the second communication device over a network interface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0022">In some embodiments a method in a second communication device is disclosed. The second communication device receives a connection request for setting up an inter node connection between a first communication device and the second communication device from the first communication device, wherein the connection request comprises a geographical position of the first communication node. The second communication device determines an inter node connection response to the request by comparing the geographical position of the first communication device with a geographical position of the second communication device, wherein the inter node connection response comprises a negative inter node connection response if it is determined that the geographical position of the first communication device is not within a range of the geographical position of the second communication device indicating a non neighbouring relationship. Furthermore, the second communication device transmits the inter node connection response to the first communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0023">In order to perform the method a second communication device is provided. The second communication device comprises a network interface arranged to receive a connection request for setting up an inter node connection between a first communication device and the second communication device from a first communication device, wherein the connection request comprises a geographical position of the first communication node. The second communication device comprises a control unit arranged to determine an inter node connection response to the connection request by comparing the geographical position of the first communication device with a geographical position of the second communication device, wherein the inter node connection response comprises a negative inter node connection response if it is determined that the geographical position of the first communication device is not within a range of the geographical position of the second communication device indicating a non neighbouring relationship. The network interface is further being arranged to transmit the inter node connection response to the first communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0024">Embodiments disclose a way to add a geographical position, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) position, of a requesting base station in an X2 SETUP REQUEST message of the X2-Application Protocol (X2AP) specification. The geographical position could also be complimented with the direction (and coverage) of each cell served by a requesting base station.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0025">In this way, a base station receiving an X2 SETUP REQUEST message have the possibility to check its geographical position towards the received geographical position of the requesting base station and can thus judge if the relation is sensible or not.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0026">A new Cause value should also be included in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message so that the base station that initiated the X2 connection establishment may &#x201c;blacklist&#x201d; the cell having been reported as a possible neighbouring cell candidate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0027">Finally, the base station could &#x201c;blacklist&#x201d; the reporting UE so that the ANR function does not take any more action upon subsequent suggestions for neighbouring cell relations from that UE. This &#x201c;blacklisting&#x201d; should probably only be surviving for as long as the UE is in Connected Mode, and could be transferred in Handover signalling to other base stations so that also other base stations do not act upon reports from that UE.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0028">Unsuccessful ANR configurations should obviously always be logged and should there be many, within a certain time period, there should possibly be an alarm indicating that a Denial of Service (DoS) attack may be occurring.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0040">A first User Equipment (UE) <b>100</b> is connected/camped on a cell A of a first base station <b>10</b>. The UE <b>100</b> transmits a measurement report comprising a cell ID of a cell B served by a second base station <b>20</b> to the serving first base station <b>10</b>. The first base station <b>10</b> may determine that the cell B is a neighbouring cell to the cell A based on information in the measurement report, for example, cell ID, UE identity, signal strength, and/or the like, and sends a connection request to the second base station <b>20</b>, wherein the connection request comprises a geographical position, for example, GPS data and/or the like, of the first base station <b>10</b>. However, the UE <b>100</b> may have received a broadcast channel from the second base station <b>20</b> due to radio propagation (atmospheric reflection) and this will lead to that UE <b>100</b> reports the physical identity of the second base station <b>20</b>, wherein the second base station <b>20</b> is located far away from the first base station <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041">The second base station <b>20</b> compares the geographical position of the first base station <b>10</b> with the geographical position of the second base station <b>20</b> and responds to the connection request based on the comparison. If the first base station <b>10</b> is determined to be outside a range, such as &#x3e;10 km or the like, of the second base station <b>20</b> the connection request is denied. The range may be determined based on coverage and strength of cell A. The range may, for example, be set to twice the radius of the coverage of the cell A and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0042">The first communication device <b>10</b> receives the response stating that the connection request is denied. In some embodiments, the response may comprise a cause value indicating the cause of denying the connection request, for example, a value indicating that the cell is determined not to be a neighbouring cell and/or the like. The first communication device <b>10</b> may then store the cell and/or the reporting UE <b>100</b> to be a false cell/UE in a local list of the first communication device <b>10</b> so that reports from that UE/ of that cell is ignored by the first communication device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0043">The identity of the cell and/or the UE <b>100</b> may also be reported to neighbouring communication devices in, for example, hand over signalling and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a schematic combined method and signalling scheme in a communications network is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0045">A UE <b>100</b> reports a measurement of a possible neighbouring cell served by a second base station eNB <b>20</b> to a first base station eNB <b>10</b> serving the present cell of UE <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0046">When the eNB <b>10</b> receives the report of the possible neighbouring cell candidate, the eNB <b>10</b> may read the Phy CID from the report as the report comprises the possible neighbouring cell's Phy-CID.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047">The eNB <b>10</b> may then instruct the UE <b>100</b>, using the newly discovered Phy-CID as parameter, to read the Global-CID, tracking area code (TAC) and all available Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) ID(s) of the related possible neighbouring cell. To do so, the eNodeB <b>10</b> may need to schedule appropriate idle periods to allow the UE <b>100</b> to read the Global-CID from the broadcast channel (BCH) of the detected possible neighbouring cell candidate in any known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0048">When the UE <b>100</b> has found out the possible neighbouring cell's Global-CID on the BCH, the UE <b>100</b> reports the detected Global-CID to the eNB <b>10</b> serving the cell of the UE <b>100</b>. In addition, the UE <b>100</b> reports the TAC and all PLMN IDs that have been detected, whenever the eNB <b>10</b> requests this information.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0049">In step S<b>1</b>, when the UE <b>100</b> has reported the possible neighbouring cell candidate, the eNB <b>10</b> will initiate the establishment of an X2 connection to the eNB <b>20</b> serving the possible neighbouring cell candidate.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0050">In an X2 SETUP REQUEST message, sent to the eNB <b>20</b>, a new information element will be included describing the geographical position of the eNB <b>10</b> initiating the X2 establishment attempt, and also possibly the direction and coverage area of each cell belonging to eNB <b>10</b>. The geographical position, for example, longitude and latitude, may be determined from a GPS system on the eNB <b>10</b>, manually at the installation of the eNB <b>10</b>, determined by triangulation, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0051">In step S<b>2</b>, the base station eNB <b>20</b> receiving the X2 SETUP REQUEST message will evaluate if the received X2 SETUP REQUEST is a sensible configuration through checking the received geographical position, (and coverage information) towards the geographical position (and coverage information) of the own, served cells. The geographical position of the eNB <b>20</b>, for example, longitude and latitude, may similarly be determined from GPS, manually, triangulation, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0052">Should the eNB <b>20</b> receiving the X2 SETUP REQUEST message determine that it would not be sensible to establish a neighbouring cell relation between any of the own cells towards any of the cells present in the X2 SETUP REQUEST, it will answer the X2 SETUP REQUEST with an X2 SETUP FAILURE message. The X2 SETUP FAILURE message may in this case include a new cause value indicating that the proposed establishment of a neighbouring cell relationship is rejected since the relationship would not be sensible from a radio perspective. A sensible neighbouring cell may be a cell that is within a preset range from the eNB <b>20</b>. The preset range may be set as twice the radius of a cell of eNB <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0053">In step S<b>3</b>, when the eNB <b>10</b> receives an X2 SETUP FAILURE message with the new cause value, it may move the identity of the cell that initiated the X2 connection establishment attempt into a &#x201c;blacklist&#x201d; (and possibly the other cells served by this eNB <b>20</b>) so that no more X2 connection establishments are attempted towards this eNB <b>20</b> (the eNB <b>10</b> could also build an &#x201c;eNB blacklist&#x201d; with the eNB identities of the eNBs that has rejected an X2 connection establishment due to the reason of not being an eNB of a sensible neighbour cell). The cell may be indicated with the Phy-ID, the global ID and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0054">The eNB <b>10</b> could also or alternatively proceed with indicating in the UE context of the UE <b>100</b> that made the suggestion for a new neighbouring cell relation that no more suggestions of neighbouring cell relations from this UE <b>100</b> should be acted upon by an ANR function. The UE context of UE <b>100</b> may be stored in a blacklist at the eNB <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0055">It should also be noted that these types of listing UEs, eNBs, cells may also be performed at the second eNB <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0056">The indication that the UE <b>100</b> has been &#x201c;blacklisted&#x201d; from suggesting new neighbouring cell relations could then be transferred in subsequent Handover signalling for this UE (i.e. 3GPP TS 36.423 and 3GPP TS 36.413 impacts&#x2014;e.g. X2 HANDOVER REQUEST message).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0057">The system above enables, for example, the following:
<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0058">The network is able to determine if a suggested neighbouring cell relation is sensible or not and will thus utilize network resources in a more optimal way</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0059">Less network signalling and processing due to &#x201c;hostile&#x201d; UEs is determined</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0003" num="0060">Less radio signalling due to &#x201c;hostile&#x201d; UEs determined</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0004" num="0061">Less dropped connections due to that UEs have been handed over to incorrect base stations.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0062">Hence, the solution allows the network to determine if a suggested neighbouring cell relation is sensible or not.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0063">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a schematic combined method and signalling scheme in a communications network is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0064">A UE <b>100</b> transmits a measurement report of a second cell of a base station eNB <b>20</b> to a base station eNB <b>10</b> serving a first cell within which the UE <b>100</b> is connected/camped on. The eNB <b>10</b> may identify UE <b>100</b>, eNB <b>20</b> and/or the second cell.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0065">In step S<b>4</b>, the eNB <b>10</b> checks whether the UE context of UE <b>100</b> is in a blacklist indicating UEs from which suggestions of new neighbouring cell relations should be ignored. It should be understood that the blacklist may also be based on UE context, eNB IDs, cell IDs, and/or the like, and may be created by the eNB <b>10</b>, received in hand over signalling from eNB <b>20</b>, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0066">In the illustrated example, the eNB <b>10</b> determines that the UE <b>100</b> is not a reliable source being in the blacklist of eNB <b>10</b> and ignores the report and also sends an indication that cell measurements of the UE <b>100</b> are ignored to the UE <b>100</b>. This may be good to know for the UE <b>100</b> because it may not be able to be handed over to another eNB as long as the UE <b>100</b> is in connected mode.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0067">It should here be noted that all reports from the UE will not be ignored. If the UE sends a report regarding a cell known to the eNB as a neighbouring cell, a Handover may be initiated. But an unknown Physical Cell Identity (PCI) sent in by the UE will not initiate an ANR function, that is, the eNB <b>10</b> does not request the UE <b>100</b> to report back the global identity of the reported cell.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0068">The UE <b>100</b> may be blacklisted as long as the UE <b>100</b> is in connected mode, a preset period of time, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0069">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a schematic flowchart of a method in a first communication device is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0070">In step <b>42</b>, the first communication device receives a measurement report of a possible neighbouring cell candidate from a user equipment camped/connected within a first cell served by the first communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0071">In step <b>44</b>, the first communication device determines to set up an inter node connection to a second communication device serving the possible neighbouring cell candidate indicated in the measurement report. This may be determined based on checking list/s of already neighbouring cells, prohibited cells/UEs and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0072">In step <b>46</b>, the first communication device initiates to set up an inter node connection to the second communication device by sending a connection request to the second communication device, wherein the connection request comprises a geographical position of the first communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0073">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a schematic flowchart of a similar method in a first communication device is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0074">In step <b>42</b>, the first communication device receives a measurement report of a possible neighbouring cell candidate from a user equipment camped/connected within a first cell served by the first communication device. The first communication device may determine Phy-CID of the possible neighbouring cell candidate from the report and request the user equipment to retrieve global CID of the possible neighbouring cell candidate. The global CID is then used to send an inter node connection request, such as an X2 setup request, an lur setup request and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0075">In step <b>44</b>, the first communication device determines to set up an inter node connection (IC) to a second communication device serving the possible neighbouring cell candidate indicated in the measurement report. The inter node connection comprises an X2 connection within an E-UTRAN and/or the like. This is done by sending a connection request to the (possible) neighbouring cell. The first communication device may also be enabled to check whether the Cell-ID, UE, and/or eNB IDs of the neighbouring cell is in a list of non trusted Cell-IDs, UEs, and/or eNBs indicating that no neighbouring relationship should be established or that the Cell ID is in a list of neighbouring cells.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0076">In step <b>46</b>, the first communication device initiates to set up an inter node connection to the second communication device by sending the connection request comprising a geographical position of the first communication device. The geographical position may comprise a Global Positioning System geographical position and/or the like. The connection request may also comprise a direction/coverage/output power of the first cell served by the first communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0077">Then, the first communication device may receive an inter node connection response to the connection request indicating a negative inter node connection response indicating a false neighbouring cell relationship, or a positive inter node connection response indicating a true neighbouring cell relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0078">In step <b>48</b>, the first communication device receives a positive inter node connection response indicating a true neighbouring cell relationship, for example, an inter node connection setup confirmed message.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0079">In step <b>50</b>, the first communication device may then as a result of the positive inter node connection response decide to add the cell to a neighbour relation list of the adaptive neighbouring cell relations function (ANR). It should here be noted that the cell may be added to the neighbour relation list before determining to set up an inter node connection to the second communication device serving the neighbouring cell and if the inter node connection response is positive to keep the cell in the neighbour relation list or if the inter node connection response is negative to remove the cell from the neighbour relation list.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0080">In step <b>52</b>, the first communication device receives an inter node connection response to the connection request indicating a negative inter node connection response indicating a false neighbouring cell relationship, for example, an Inter node connection setup failure message.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0081">In step <b>54</b>, the first communication device may read a cause value in the received inter node connection response indicating that the inter node connection response is negative since the neighbouring relationship is not sensible from a geographical perspective.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0082">In step <b>56</b>, the first communication device stores the identity of the user equipment that sent the measurement report as a non trusted user equipment in a list, a so called blacklist. The first communication device may also/or alternatively store an identity of the second communication device in a list indicating that cells of communication devices listed in the list will not (never) be considered as neighbouring cells to the cells served by the first communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0083">In step <b>58</b>, the first communication device may transmit an indication that the user equipment/cell is non-trusted to a neighbouring communication device. This may be performed in a handover signalling and the indication may be the blacklist.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0084">The first communication device may also log the request procedure as a denied procedure to; for example, determine whether a denial of service attack is in progress.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0085">In order to perform a method according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> a first communication device is provided.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0121">It should here be understood that the connection request may further comprise a direction/coverage/output power of at least one cell served by the first communication device and the control unit <b>201</b> takes the direction/coverage/output power into account when determining the inter node connection response. The control unit <b>201</b> may, for example, be arranged to calculate the coverage of its own cells and compare that with calculations of received cell coverage to determine whether the cells are (sensible) neighbouring cells.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0122">In some embodiments, the range is based on strength/direction/output power/and/or coverage, for example, being in the range twice the radius of a cell of the second communication device and/or the first communication device. For example, the &#x201c;size&#x201d; (coverage) of a cell of a second communication device may be much smaller but still may a cell of the first communication device be a neighbouring cell. Hence, in order to include all possible neighbouring cells the control unit <b>201</b> may be arranged to determine the biggest cell (greatest coverage area) of the first and second cells and based on that, set the range of the distance between the first communication and the second communication device to twice the radius of the biggest cell. Another example would be to set the range to the longest distance of the coverage in a direction of a cell.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0123">In some embodiments, the control unit <b>201</b> may be arranged to determine the geographical position from an internal positioning system, for example, a GPS <b>211</b> within the second communication device, or may be determined by manual input at installation, by triangulation from received signals and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0124">In some embodiments, the control unit <b>201</b> may be arranged to transmit the negative inter node connection response comprising a cause value indicating a cause of rejection over the network interface <b>209</b>. For example, the control unit <b>201</b> may add in the inter node connection response a two bit field wherein a single one value indicates that the control unit <b>201</b> has determined that the cell is not a sensible neighbouring cell from a geographical perspective.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0125">The control unit <b>201</b> may furthermore be arranged to store in a memory <b>207</b> an identity of the first communication device in a list indicating that cells of communication devices listed in the list will never be considered as neighbouring cells to the cells served by the second communication device. It should be understood that the list may contain UE IDs, eNB IDs, Cell IDs, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0126">In some embodiments, the control unit <b>201</b> may be arranged to receive an indication from a first communication device over the network interface <b>209</b> indicating a user equipment that sends erroneous neighbouring measurement reports and to add an identity of the user equipment in a list comprising user equipment that sends erroneous neighbouring measurement reports.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0127">Furthermore, the second communication device may comprise a receiving arrangement <b>203</b> and a transmitting arrangement <b>205</b> arranged to communicate with UEs camped/connected in cells of the second communication device. The second communication device may then deny/ignore a measurement report over the receiving arrangement <b>203</b> from a user equipment in the list in the adaptive neighbouring cell relations function and transmit an indication of that the user equipment over the transmitting arrangement <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0128">The control unit <b>201</b> may comprise a CPU, a single processing unit, a plurality of processing units, and or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0129">The memory unit <b>207</b> may comprise a single memory unit, a plurality of memory units, external and/or internal memory units.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0130">Embodiments are described with reference to block diagrams and/or flowchart illustrations of methods, apparatus (systems). It is understood that several blocks of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustrations, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, and/or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer and/or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the block diagrams and/or flowchart block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0131">These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function/act specified in the block diagrams and/or flowchart block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0132">The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer-implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions/acts specified in the block diagrams and/or flowchart block or blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0133">In some implementations, the functions/acts noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the operational illustrations. For example, two blocks shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality/acts involved. For example, step <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be executed before step <b>44</b> and if the inter node connection response is negative the cell may be removed from the ANR list.</p>
