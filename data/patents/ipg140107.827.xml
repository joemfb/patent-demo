<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Applicant claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 of German Application No. 10 2008 006 388.6 filed Jan. 29, 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a pallet for storage and transport of goods, consisting of an upper deck that serves as a standing surface for the goods, standing feet that can be assembled onto the underside of the upper deck, and accommodation channels formed into the upper deck, for affixing at least one reinforcement strip.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. The Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such pallets are described, for example, in German Patent Applications Nos. DE 10 2004 049 201 A1 and DE 10 2007 013 210. In the case of these known pallets, a diagonally-running reinforcement strip, for example made of steel, is used to reinforce the upper deck.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This reinforcement strip gives the pallet fairly good stability under normal stress, particularly if only one item of transport goods that fills up the entire area of the upper deck is set onto the pallet.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, since often a plurality of smaller containers are also set down next to one another on such pallets, the stability in the regions between the diagonal reinforcement strip is often insufficient.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the invention to guarantee stability over the full area of these pallets.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention achieves this object by a pallet in which the upper deck is divided into at least two rectangular partial regions, and each partial region has an accommodation channel for a reinforcement strip, which is disposed diagonally across the partial region.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this way, significantly better stability is achieved than in the case of the known solution, by means of the reinforcement strips that are laid parallel to one another in the partial region areas.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Stability is further increased if another accommodation channel for a reinforcement strip is provided in the progression of the border between the partial regions. Accommodation channels for reinforcement strips can also be provided in the regions of the longitudinal side edges of the upper deck.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this connection, the reinforcement strips each have the same length, both in the partial region diagonals and in the border region between the partial regions, as well as in the regions of the longitudinal side edges, where their ends are beveled at an acute angle, for example 45&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Specifically because of this bevel, it is possible to produce not only the reinforcement strips that run diagonally but also the ones that run parallel to the longitudinal side edges in the same length, and this simplifies the production effort and the assembly of the pallets.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a final expansion stage, accommodation channels for reinforcement strips are also provided in the regions of the short side edges of the upper deck.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Fixation of the reinforcement strips in the individual accommodation channels is possible in different ways. In one embodiment, the reinforcement strips are secured in the accommodation channels by the standing feet that are assembled on.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For this purpose, the standing feet are screwed onto the four corner points, and possibly also onto the center points of the short sides of the upper deck.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One standing foot can also be screwed on in the center of each of the longitudinal sides of the upper deck, for further stabilization of the pallet.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment, accommodations are formed into the standing surfaces of the standing feet, in which the feet can be attached with runners connecting one another. At their ends, the runners have appropriate tab-like engagement elements that are introduced into the accommodations and screwed in place there. The runners increase the stability of the pallet and are provided with a bevel, so that problem-free introduction of the forks of a lift truck is guaranteed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a further embodiment, accommodations in the standing surfaces of the standing feet are disposed in a symmetrical pattern. This means that the standing surface of the standing feet, which is generally rectangular, has one accommodation in the region of each of the short sides of this rectangle, and two accommodations in each of the longitudinal sides of the rectangle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this way, it is possible to increase the number of standing feet that are disposed next to one another, or to connect another pallet to a pallet that has already been assembled. It is possible to have two standing feet disposed directly next to one another at the connection location of the two pallets, whereby the accommodations that lie opposite one another are connected with one another. In the case of this type of pallet expansion, the accommodation channels in the short sides of the upper deck are continuous towards the side, so that one reinforcement strip that covers both pallets can be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, it is also possible to do without a standing foot disposed adjacent, by means of runners having the appropriate dimensions, and to produce a connection from the side standing foot of the one pallet to the center foot of the joined pallet.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The upper deck can be, for example, an injection-molded plastic part that has a reinforcing rib pattern. The upper side of the upper deck can be covered by a plastic panel that is welded on. The standing feet can also be injection-molded plastic parts.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The shape of the reinforcement strips can be varied. Preferably, the strips are tubes having a rectangular cross section and are made from metal.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pallet is shown and indicated in general with the reference symbol <b>1</b>. It consists of an upper deck <b>2</b>, which has a rectangular frame <b>3</b> that encloses a rib structure <b>4</b>. Frame <b>3</b> and rib structure <b>4</b> form the standing surface for goods set down onto the pallet <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Accommodation channels <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are formed into upper deck <b>2</b>, integrated into rib structure <b>4</b>, and connecting frame parts <b>3</b> with one another. Channel <b>5</b> passes through upper deck <b>2</b> diagonally. Channels <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> pass through two partial areas of upper deck <b>2</b> diagonally. Deck <b>2</b> is divided into two rectangles disposed symmetrical to one another, by channel <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the underside of upper deck <b>2</b>, standing feet <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> are screwed on and are connected with one another on their underside by means of runners <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a pallet <b>1</b> that corresponds to the pallet <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but is provided with a welded-on plastic panel <b>11</b> on the surface of upper deck <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a pallet <b>1</b>, specifically in its simplest embodiment. Here, standing feet <b>8</b> are screwed on only at the corner points of upper deck <b>2</b>, and a reinforcement strip <b>12</b> made of metal is laid into the diagonal accommodation channel <b>5</b>; the strip is secured in its position by standing feet <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, additional accommodation channels <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> are formed into the longitudinal side region and into the short side region of upper deck <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a pallet <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but here, additional reinforcement strips <b>15</b> are laid into accommodation channels <b>14</b>. These reinforcement strips <b>15</b> are also secured in their position by standing feet <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows another expansion stage of pallet <b>1</b>. In addition to the reinforcement strips as they are laid into the pallet according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, additional reinforcement strips <b>16</b> are laid into accommodation channels <b>13</b>. These reinforcement strips <b>16</b> are also held by screwed-on standing feet <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of pallet <b>1</b>. Here, there is no diagonal reinforcement by means of strip <b>12</b>. Instead, a reinforcement strip is laid into accommodation channel <b>7</b> that runs parallel to accommodation channels <b>14</b>. Two additional standing feet <b>8</b> are assembled onto the ends of accommodation channels <b>7</b>; they secure reinforcement strip <b>17</b> in its position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a pallet according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, whereby here, reinforcement strip <b>17</b> has been left out. Instead, two reinforcement strips <b>18</b> that run parallel to one another have been laid into accommodation channels <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>; they run in the diagonal of the partial regions of upper deck <b>2</b>. These two reinforcement strips <b>18</b> are also held in their position by standing feet <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a completely reinforced pallet <b>1</b>, whereby in addition to the reinforcements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, reinforcement strip <b>17</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the pallet according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown from below, whereby here, standing feet <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> are connected with one another by means of runners <b>10</b>. Runners <b>10</b> have tabs <b>21</b> at their ends, which tabs are laid into corresponding recesses <b>22</b> in the standing surfaces of standing feet <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, respectively, and screwed on there.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Standing feet <b>8</b> have a recess structure that is configured in such a manner that two recesses <b>22</b> are present symmetrical to the center longitudinal axis, while only one recess <b>22</b> is present symmetrical to the crosswise axis of the standing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the case of standing feet <b>9</b>, only two recesses <b>22</b> are present, symmetrical to the crosswise axis of the standing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the possibility is indicated that two pallets can be connected with one another. For this purpose, accommodation channels <b>13</b> are open on the side, so that an extra-long reinforcement strip <b>16</b>&#x2032; can be laid in. The projecting end of reinforcement strip <b>16</b>&#x2032; is laid into accommodation channel <b>13</b> of another upper deck, not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows that another runner <b>10</b>&#x2032;, the length of which does not have to be equal to the length of runners <b>10</b> in pallet <b>1</b> that has already been completed, extends from standing foot <b>8</b>, so that the two pallets <b>1</b> disposed next to one another are securely connected with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the expansion stage according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, whereby&#x2014;as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>&#x2014;a plastic panel <b>11</b>&#x2032; to be welded on is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Alternatively to the embodiments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, it is possible that additional standing feet <b>8</b> can be disposed directly next to the outer standing feet <b>8</b> that are adjacent to the pallet expansion, which then can be connected with one another, i.e. from pallet to pallet expansion. In this embodiment, the runners <b>10</b> can have the same length as in the case of the original pallet <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Accordingly, while only a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is obvious that many changes and modifications may be made thereunto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
