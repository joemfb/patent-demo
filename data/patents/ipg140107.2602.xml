<p id="p-0004" num="0005">The present invention relates generally to an integrated circuit packaging system, and more particularly to a system for an integrated circuit packaging system with package-on-package.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0006">Increased miniaturization of components, greater packaging density of integrated circuits (&#x201c;ICs&#x201d;), higher performance, and lower cost are ongoing goals of the computer industry. Semiconductor package structures continue to advance toward miniaturization, to increase the density of the components that are packaged therein while decreasing the sizes of the products that are made therefrom. This is in response to continually increasing demands on information and communication products for ever-reduced sizes, thicknesses, and costs, along with ever-increasing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">These increasing requirements for miniaturization are particularly noteworthy, for example, in portable information and communication devices such as cellular phones, hands-free cellular phone headsets, personal data assistants (&#x201c;PDA's&#x201d;), camcorders, notebook computers, and so forth. All of these devices continue to be made smaller and thinner to improve their portability. Accordingly, large-scale IC (&#x201c;LSI&#x201d;) packages that are incorporated into these devices are required to be made smaller and thinner. The package configurations that house and protect LSI require them to be made smaller and thinner as well.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">Consumer electronics requirements demand more integrated circuits in an integrated circuit package while paradoxically providing less physical space in the system for the increased integrated circuits content. Continuous cost reduction is another requirement. Some technologies primarily focus on integrating more functions into each integrated circuit. Other technologies focus on stacking these integrated circuits into a single package. While these approaches provide more functions within an integrated circuit, they do not fully address the requirements for integration and cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">Thus, a need still remains for an integrated circuit packaging system providing integration, space savings, and low cost manufacturing. In view of the ever-increasing need to increase density of integrated circuits and particularly portable electronic products, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems. In view of the ever-increasing commercial competitive pressures, along with growing consumer expectations and the diminishing opportunities for meaningful product differentiation in the marketplace, it is critical that answers be found for these problems. Additionally, the need to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and performance, and meet competitive pressures adds an even greater urgency to the critical necessity for finding answers to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0047">The following embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to make and use the invention. It is to be understood that other embodiments would be evident based on the present disclosure, and that system, process, or mechanical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">In the following description, numerous specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In order to avoid obscuring the present invention, some well-known circuits, system configurations, and process steps are not disclosed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">The drawings showing embodiments of the system are semi-diagrammatic and not to scale and, particularly, some of the dimensions are for the clarity of presentation and are shown exaggerated in the drawing FIGs. Similarly, although the views in the drawings for ease of description generally show similar orientations, this depiction in the FIGs. is arbitrary for the most part. Generally, the invention can be operated in any orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">Where multiple embodiments are disclosed and described having some features in common, for clarity and ease of illustration, description, and comprehension thereof, similar and like features one to another will ordinarily be described with similar reference numerals. The embodiments have been numbered first embodiment, second embodiment, etc. as a matter of descriptive convenience and are not intended to have any other significance or provide limitations for the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">For expository purposes, the term &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a plane parallel to the plane of an active surface of the integrated circuit, regardless of its orientation. The term &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal as just defined. Terms, such as &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;side&#x201d; (as in &#x201c;sidewall&#x201d;), &#x201c;higher&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;over&#x201d;, and &#x201c;under&#x201d;, are defined with respect to the horizontal plane, as shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">The term &#x201c;on&#x201d; means that there is contact between elements. The term &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; means that there is direct contact between one element and another element without an intervening element.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">The term &#x201c;active side&#x201d; refers to a side of a die, a module, a package, or an electronic structure having active circuitry fabricated thereon or having elements for connection to the active circuitry within the die, the module, the package, or the electronic structure. The term &#x201c;processing&#x201d; as used herein includes deposition of material or photoresist, patterning, exposure, development, etching, cleaning, and/or removal of the material or photoresist as required in forming a described structure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">Compared to other packaging technologies, the present invention provides a cost effective process. The present invention provides a much lower substrate cost, eliminates laser ablation process, and provides an option not to include ball attach process.</p>
