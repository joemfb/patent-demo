<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The administration of proteins to animals, including humans, in nutritional supplements or as therapeutics has been known for some time. Proteins for therapeutic or nutritional administration generally are available either as (1) concentrates or powders that are administered directly or are reconstituted in a liquid of choice prior to use; or (2) liquid formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The preparation and delivery of therapeutic proteins of interest in powder or particle form is an area of concentrated research and development activity in the pharmaceutical industry. For therapeutic efficacy, it is desirable to have a uniform formulation. For example, for pulmonary administration, the protein ideally is prepared in the form of discrete microspheres, which are solid or semi-solid particles having a diameter of between 0.5 and 5.0 microns. It also is desirable for the particles to have a protein content that is as high as possible and that maintains its activity for concentrated delivery and therapeutic efficacy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Previous methods of producing protein microparticles or nanoparticles have involved complex steps, such as blending with organic polymers and/or forming a lattice array with polymers; spray drying, spray freeze-drying or supercritical fluid antisolvent techniques that use specialized and complex equipment; or lyophilization followed by pulverization or milling that often results in non-uniform particles that must further be sorted. Often previous methods of producing solid protein formulations involve processing steps, such as heating, that denature the protein and compromise its activity. In addition, some methods do not provide high recovery from solution into the solid formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need for a method for producing protein and other macromolecular microparticles that does not require complex or specialized equipment and that produces uniform-sized microparticles for delivery. There further is a need for a method of producing microparticles that contain high concentrations of the protein or macromolecule relative to other components, that are stable and maintain their activity for long periods of time when stored at ambient temperature and that do not contain a significant amount of denatured protein. There also is a need for a method of producing microparticles of proteins and other macromolecules wherein substantially all of the protein or macromolecule in the starting material is recovered in the microparticle formulation, with minimal loss. There also is a need for microparticles of proteins or other macromolecules containing these properties for administration, for example, as a therapeutic or nutritional supplement.</p>

Thus, a composition containing microparticles separated from &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; all other contaminants and/or ingredients including counterions, salts and solvents from the cocktail solution means that at least about 60% or 60%, about 70% or 70%, or about or at 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher amounts of contaminants and/or reagents have been removed from the cocktail solution in which the microparticles are formed. The term &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially homologous&#x201d; or similar varies with the context as understood by those skilled in the relevant art and generally means at least about 60% or 60%, about 70% or 70%, or about or at 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher identity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The term &#x201c;consists essentially of&#x201d; or &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; as used herein refers to an entity from which substantially all other components/ingredients that are not associated with the entity or its properties have been removed or separated from the entity. Thus, a composition &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; microparticles means that all other ingredients such as contaminants and solvents have substantially been removed from the solution/suspension containing the microparticles.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The term &#x201c;microparticle&#x201d; as used herein is interchangeable with &#x201c;microsphere&#x201d; and refers to particles in the size range (average length, width or diameter) of about or at 0.001 micron (&#x3bc;m) to about or at 500 microns that contain a macromolecule and deliver an agent of interest, such as a drug or nutritional supplement, to a subject. The agent can be the macromolecule, for example, a protein, nucleic acid, lipid or polysaccharide, or the macromolecule forming the microparticle can be a carrier for the active agent, such as a drug or a nutritional supplement. The microparticles also can contain synthetic macromolecules including polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polylactic acid (PLA), polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), and natural polymers such as albumin, gelatin, chitosan and dextran. The &#x201c;microparticles&#x201d; as described herein can contain and can be made from a particular natural or synthetic macromolecule alone, or from more than one type of the same natural or synthetic macromolecule (e.g., more than one type of protein), or from combinations of more than one different type of natural or synthetic macromolecule (e.g., a protein and a nucleic acid or a protein and a synthetic polymer).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The term &#x201c;microparticle&#x201d; as used herein also generally refers to a particle that is not a solid form of the entire solution from which it is produced, although frozen and/or dried particles of a solution containing macromolecules also are contemplated herein. Rather, the microparticle as used herein generally is an assembly of a fraction of the components of a solution, including salts, counterions, solvents and other ingredients, that is formed by a process including, but not limited to, precipitation, sedimentation, phase separation and colloid formation.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The term &#x201c;precipitation&#x201d; as used herein refers to a process whereby a solute or solutes of interest in a solution, such as the components of a microparticle, no longer stay in solution and form a phase that is distinct from the solvent or solvents that were used to form the solution. Precipitation of a microparticle and controlling the size of the precipitated microparticle can be accomplished by a variety of means including, but not limited to, adjusting temperature, ionic strength, pH, dielectric constant, counterion concentration, organic solvent concentration, the addition of polyelectrolytes or polymers, surfactants, detergents, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The term &#x201c;phase separation&#x201d; as used herein refers to the transformation of a single homogeneous phase, such as a solution, into two or more phases, such as a suspension of a solid particle in a solvent or solution.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The term &#x201c;sedimentation&#x201d; as used herein refers to the motion of particles, such as microparticles, which are in a suspension in a liquid or which are formed in a solution in response to an external force such as gravity, centrifugal force or electric force.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The term &#x201c;solution&#x201d; is used interchangeably with &#x201c;cocktail solution&#x201d; herein and refers to a homogeneous mixture of two or more ingredients in a single phase, solid, liquid, or gas, where the distinct ingredients only are recognizable at the molecular level. The solution can be a liquid in which one or more solutes, such as salts, are dissolved in a solvent, such as water or alcohol, or dissolved in a mixture of miscible solvents, such as a mixture of water and ethyl alcohol. The solution also can be a frozen form of a liquid solution.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The term &#x201c;miscible&#x201d; as used herein refers to the ability of one or more components, such as liquids, solids and gases, to mix together to form a single, homogeneous phase. Thus, two liquids are miscible if they can be mixed to form a single, homogenous liquid whose distinct components are recognized only at the molecular level. When components are &#x201c;partially miscible,&#x201d; it means that they can be mixed to form a single homogenous phase in a certain concentration range, but not at other concentration ranges. As used herein, when a solvent is &#x201c;partially miscible&#x201d; with another solvent, it means that it is miscible at a concentration of about or at 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5% or below volume/volume (v/v), when mixed with the other solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As used herein, &#x201c;immiscible&#x201d; means that when two or more components, such as liquids, solids or gases are mixed, they form more than one phase. For example, when an organic solvent is immiscible with an aqueous solvent (e.g., hexane and water), the organic solvent is visible as a distinct layer that does not mix with the layer of aqueous solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As used herein, the term &#x201c;polypeptide,&#x201d; means at least two amino acids, or amino acid derivatives, including mass modified amino acids and amino acid analogs, that are linked by a peptide bond, which can be a modified peptide bond. The terms &#x201c;polypeptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used essentially synonymously herein, although the skilled artisan will recognize that peptides generally contain fewer than about fifty to about one hundred amino acid residues, and that proteins often are obtained from a natural source and can contain, for example, post-translational modifications.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A polypeptide or protein can be translated from a polynucleotide, which can include at least a portion of a coding sequence, or a portion of a nucleotide sequence that is not naturally translated due, for example, to it being located in a reading frame other than a coding frame, or it being an intron sequence, a 3&#x2032; or 5&#x2032; untranslated sequence, a regulatory sequence such as a promoter, or the like. A polypeptide also can be chemically synthesized and can be modified by chemical or enzymatic methods following translation or chemical synthesis. A polypeptide can be post-translationally modified by phosphorylation (phosphoproteins), glycosylation (glycoproteins, proteoglycans), and the like, which can be performed in a cell or in a reaction in vitro.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">B. Methods for Preparing Macromolecular Microparticle Compositions</heading>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Provided herein are methods of making microspheres having a high content of a macromolecule, such as a protein. The microspheres provided herein are prepared by controlled precipitation in the presence of a counterion and an organic solvent. The microspheres are suitable for preparing pharmaceutical compositions which can be delivered to a patient by delivery routes including pulmonary, parenteral and oral administration routes. The method also can be performed in a batch or continuous mode, for increased efficiency and production.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The microspheres obtained by the methods provided herein are useful as prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic agents for treating or diagnosing disease states in a subject in vivo or in vitro. The sizes of the microspheres obtained by the methods provided herein can be controlled by adjusting parameters including type and concentration of organic solvent, protein or macromolecule concentration, ionic strength, counterion type and concentration, rate and time of cooling, to provide microspheres in a wide range of sizes, from 0.001 micron to 50 microns or greater, that can deliver therapeutic agents via a desired route including pulmonary (e.g., 1 micron to 5 micron particles for delivery to the throat, trachea and bronchi for treatment of influenza and other respiratory infections), subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and other routes (e.g., using particles of tens of microns in size). render active components of inhalant medicines for human subjects.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The steps of the method provided herein include: combining the a solution containing the macromolecule with a counterion and an organic solvent, and gradually cooling the resulting solution to a temperature whereby microparticles are formed. In one embodiment, the steps can be described as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">1) To a solution containing a macromolecule, such as a protein, nucleic acid, oligosaccharide or lipid, adding a counterion and an organic solvent at concentrations that do not cause precipitation of the macromolecule at ambient temperature;</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">2) Precipitation: cooling the macromolecule/solvent cocktail to initiate formation of microspheres; and</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">3) Dehydration: freezing of the suspension and removal of organic solvent and water by sublimation (freeze-drying, e.g., at a temperature of about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;80&#xb0; C., or about &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;80&#xb0; C., or about &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;80&#xb0; C., or about &#x2212;45&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;80&#xb0; C., or about &#x2212;45&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;75&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The above steps of the method can be performed sequentially, intermittently or simultaneously in any order. In one embodiment, the counterion and the organic solvent are added simultaneously or sequentially in any order to the solution containing the macromolecule, followed by chilling. In other embodiments, the solution containing the macromolecule can be pre-chilled to a temperature suitable for microsphere formation, prior to adding the counterion and organic solvent. For example, a prechilled aqueous solution of a macromolecule, such as a protein, can be combined with ammonium sulfate and acetonitrile to form microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The resulting suspension of microparticles can be converted into a dry powder by further cooling to a temperature below freezing point and subsequent removal of volatiles (water, organic solvent and where possible the counterion) by, for example, sublimation using a standard freeze dryer.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In one embodiment, the microspheres formed by contacting the macromolecule with a counterion and organic solvent and exposed to low temperature, are separated from the suspension by methods including sedimentation or filtration techniques. After separation from the original precipitation mix, the microspheres can be washed and/or combined with other materials that improve and/or modify characteristics of macromolecules and microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In another embodiment, the microspheres prepared by the methods provided herein do not have a direct therapeutic effect, but serve as micro-carriers for other therapeutic agent(s) or active agent(s) including nutritional supplements. Therapeutic agents can be added at the time of precipitation or can be added to the suspension of formed microspheres prior to lyophilization. Alternatively, therapeutic agents can be blended into dry powder consisting of microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Without being bound by any theory, in one aspect, the methods provided herein can permit the formation of microspheres by: (1) neutralization of charges on the surface of macromolecule by the counterion and (2) decreased solubility of the macromolecule caused by the combined effects of added organic solvent and gradual cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">By choosing a suitable pH in the range of about or at pH 2.0 to about or at 10.5 or greater, depending on the macromolecule, counterion, and organic solvent, in the presence of a suitable amount of the counterion, a substantial number of the charged groups, in some embodiment all charged groups, on the surface of the macromolecule can become neutralized. A decrease in the polarity of the solution by adding a suitable organic solvent can then initiate the formation of microspheres by precipitation, phase separation, colloid formation, or other such method.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Alternatively, without being bound by any theory, in some embodiments, the observed phenomenon of the precipitation of microspheres also can be explained by the kosmotropic (structure forming) effect of counterions and organic solvents due to interactions with the water molecules of the aqueous solution containing the macromolecule at low temperatures. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, in the methods provided herein, the addition of relatively small amounts of organic solvent and counterion to an aqueous or other hydrophilic solution containing a macromolecule and cooling of the solution results in the production of compositions containing microspheres of the macromolecule(s).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In one embodiment, gradual cooling chilling of the cocktail solution can be performed by passing the cocktail solution through a heat exchanger. The temperature of the heat exchanger and the flow rate of the cocktail through the heat exchanger can be adjusted so that the cocktail is either prechilled prior to formation of the microspheres, or is chilled to a temperature whereby microspheres are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In another embodiment, the microspheres formed by the methods provided herein are concentrated or separated from the suspension by methods such as sedimentation or filtration techniques. Upon formation of the microspheres, their growth (size) can be controlled by adjusting the ionic strength, polarity, pH, or other parameters of the suspension. The separation of microspheres from the liquid phase of the cocktail solution can be performed by centrifugation, filtration (hollow fiber, tangential flow, etc.), or other techniques. The resulting microspheres or concentrated suspensions thereof can be lyophilized or air dried.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In some embodiments, the microspheres separated from the original precipitation mix or the dried microspheres can be reconstituted prior to administration as a therapeutic agent or a carrier, or can be suspended in solutions that contain agents that modify characteristics of the microspheres. The modifying agents can include but are not limited to bulking agents, excipients, inactive ingredients, stability enhancers, taste and/or odor modifiers or masking agents, vitamins, therapeutic agents, anti-oxidants, immuno-modulators, trans-membrane transport modifiers, anti-caking agents, enteric coating agents, agents that confer acid resistance, such as against the acids of the digestive system, agents that confer protease resistance, chitosans, polymers, and flowability enhancers.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The formation and characteristics of the microspheres produced by the methods provided herein can empirically be determined by varying parameters, including: nature and concentration of the macromolecule, pH of the cocktail solution, nature and concentration of the counterion, nature and concentration of the organic solvent, ionic strength and the cooling rate by which gradual cooling is effected. The steps of the methods provided herein render the method amenable to high-throughput screening, such as in a microplate format, for determining suitable combinations of macromolecule, organic solvent, counterion, pH, ionic strength and cooling ramp for the generation of microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Macromolecules</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Macromolecules that can be used to form microspheres according to the methods provided herein include a variety of therapeutic agents, diagnostic agents, nutritional agents and other active agents. Therapeutic agents include antibiotics, vaccines, hematopoietics, anti-infective agents, antiulcer agents, antiallergic agents, antipyretics, analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, antidementia agents, antiviral agents, antitumoral agents, antidepressants, psychotropic agents, cardiotonics, antiarrythmic agents, vasodilators, antihypertensive agents, antidiabetic agents, anticoagulants, and cholesterol lowering agents. Other examples of suitable macromolecules include proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, protein conjugates, viruses, virus particles, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The macromolecules can be characterized by their ability to interact with the counterion and organic solvent, such as citrate (counterion) and isopropanol (solvent), to form intact, discrete microspheres containing a high content of macromolecule. The content of the macromolecule in the microspheres can vary from about or at 30%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or greater weight/weight (w/w) of the microspheres. In some embodiments, the macromolecule content of microsphere is substantially the same as the amount of macromolecule initially in solution, prior to forming the microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The macromolecules used to prepare microspheres by the methods provided herein can include peptides, including polypeptides and proteins, carbohydrates, including polysaccharides and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA or PNA). In some embodiments, the macromolecules are proteins, including therapeutic proteins such as DAS181 (the sialidase fusion protein having the sequence of amino acid residues set forth in SEQ ID NO:17), alpha1-antitrypsin, PI8, eglin c, Ecotin, aprotinin, recombinant human DNase, insulin, interferons, recombinant human DNAse (rhDNAse, useful, for example, in the treatment of cystic fibrosis as an inhalation therapeutic (Genentech); see also Shak et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:9188-9192 (1990)), human serum albumin, human growth hormone, parathyroid hormone and calcitonin. In some embodiments, the protein is DAS181, the counterion is sodium sulfate or sodium citrate, and the organic solvent is isopropanol.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The methods provided herein can avoid the use of conditions, such as heat, that can denature the protein and reduce its activity. The microspheres provided according to the methods provided herein therefore can be used to prepare vaccines or other therapeutic medications that require proteins or peptides to be present in their native conformation.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The concentration of the macromolecule in solution, used during precipitation of the microspheres, can be between about or at 0.1 mg/ml to about or at 0.2, 05, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 12.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 30.0, 35.0, 40.0, 45.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 80.0, 90.0, 100, or 200 mg/ml. In some embodiments, the concentration is between about or at 1 mg/ml and about or at 20 mg/ml. Depending on the characteristics of the macromolecule (pI, hydrophobicity, solubility, stability, etc.) and other process parameters, the concentration of macromolecule can empirically be determined to achieve formation of microspheres of a desired size. In general, macromolecules with lower solubility in the solvent (generally, aqueous solvent) prior to adding counterion and organic solvent can be used at lower concentrations (0.1-5 mg/ml) to form microspheres according to the methods herein, while macromolecules with higher solubility can be used at 1-20 mg/ml or higher. If the formation of amorphous aggregates or aggregated microspheres is observed, the concentration of the macromolecule generally should be decreased to reduce or prevent such aggregation.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Nature and Concentration of Counterion</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The counterion can be any compound capable of neutralizing one or more oppositely charged groups on the macromolecule at the pH at which the method is performed. Depending on the characteristics of the macromolecule (pK, pI, nature and quantity of charged groups, distribution of charge groups on the surface, solubility and structural stability under different pH conditions), the pH can empirically be determined for microsphere formation. In general, if precipitation is performed at a pH below the pK of the macromolecule, anionic counterions can be used. In general, if precipitation is performed at a pH above the pK of the macromolecule, cationic counterions can be used. The counterion can empirically be selected based on its suitability to initiate microsphere formation. In some embodiments, the counterion can have a molecular weight of 60 Da or greater, or about 75 Da or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The counterions can be anionic, cationic or zwitterionic. Anionic counterions can be inorganic (phosphate, sulphate, thiocyanate, thiosulfate, hypochlorate, nitrate, bromine, iodine, etc.) or organic compounds that carry charge-polarizable groups including enol, hydroxy, &#x2014;SH, carboxylic, carboxymethyl, sulfopropyl, sulfonic, and phosphoric. Organic compounds carrying other anionic groups or having negative charge due to other molecular characteristics also can be used. Compounds that can be used as anionic counterions also include, but are not limited to, the following: oxaloacetate, malate, maleate, oxalate, piruvate, citrate, succinate, fumarate, ketoglutarate, butanetricarboxylic acid, hydromuconic acid, cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid, dimethyl maleate, deoxyribonucleic acid, polyglutamic acid, folic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, carminic acid, sorbic acid, malonic acid, EDTA, MOPS, TES, MES, PIPES, pyridine, tricine, glycine, glycylglycine, betaine, sulfuric acid, thiosulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, adenosine triphosphate, nitric acid, itaconic acid, pivalic acid, dimethylmalonic acid, and perchloric acid. In some embodiments, itaconic, pivalic, dimethylmalonic, and succinic acids are used as counterions in the methods provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Cationic counterions can be inorganic (ammonium, phosphonium, sulfonium, cesium, rubidium, etc.) or organic compounds that carry groups known as amine, amide, imine, imide, guanidine, imidazole, dioxane, aniline. Organic compounds carrying other cationic groups or have positive charge polarizability due to other molecular characteristics also can be used. Compounds that can be used as cationic counterions also include, but are not limited to, the following: Tris, Bis-Tris, Bis-Tris propane, diaminopropane, piperazine, piperadine, pentylamine, diaminobutane, propylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, spermine, spermidine, putrescine, cadaverine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, imidazole, tetramethylammonium, trimethylammonium, ammonium, cesium, rubidium, imidazole, polyethileneimine, DEAE, TEAE, QAE.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Zwitterionic counterions possessing any charged groups in any combination can also be used. Compounds that can be used as zwitterionic counterions include, but are not limited to, the following: HEPES, BICINE, glycine, glycylglycine, 6-aminohexanoic acid, piperidic acid, natural and non-natural amino acids (e.g., histidine, glutamine, arginine, lysine).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The counterions can be used as acids (e.g. sulfuric acid) or bases (e.g. imidazole) or their salts (e.g. sodium sulfate or imidazole-HCl). Counterions that can be used in the methods provided herein include those listed by the National Formulary, United States Pharmacopeia, Japanese Pharmacopeia, or European Pharmacopeia, the clinical safety of which has been demonstrated (citric acid, malic acid, amino acids, sulfate, etc.). In some embodiments, counterions used in the methods provided herein include ones for which safety has been established or as falling into the GRAS (generally regarded as safe) category. The counterions (or their salts) can be solid at room temperature (about 25&#xb0; C.), or at the intended temperature of use and storage). Combinations of two or more counterions also can be used. Volatile and liquid counterions also can be used in the methods provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The concentration of counterion generally is maintained between about 0.1 mM and about 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 80.0, 90.0 and 100.0 mM. In some embodiments, the concentration of the counterion is between about or at 0.5 mM and about or at 20 mM. Depending on the characteristics of macromolecule (pI, hydrophobicity, solubility, stability, etc.) and other process parameters, the concentration of the counterion can empirically be determined using, for example, a high-throughput format as provided herein. In general, the formation of oversized microspheres, amorphous aggregates or aggregated microspheres indicates that the concentration of counterion should be decreased, while failure to form microspheres (broken glass-like crystals or flakes) or formation of microspheres below the desired size indicates that the concentration of counterion should be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Nature and Concentration of Organic Solvent</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">An organic solvent added to the cocktail in the methods provided herein generally can be water miscible and selected from among alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, isopropanol, butanol, tert-butyl alcohol), chloroform, dimethyl chloride, polyhydric sugar alcohols (glycerin, erythriol, arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol), aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers (di-ethyl ether), alkanes (hexane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether), alkenes, conjugated dienes, toluene, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, polyols, polyimids, polyesters, polyaldehydes, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the organic solvent can be volatile. In other embodiments, when incorporation of the organic solvent into the microspheres is desired, non-volatile organic solvents can be used that provide, for example, novel characteristics to the microspheres (e.g., sustained release or added mechanical strength). The concentration of the organic solvent generally can be maintained between about or at 0.1%, to about or at 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40% or 50%, volume/volume (v/v). In some embodiments, the concentration of the organic solvent is between about or at 1% to about or at 30%, v/v. Organic compounds that are partially miscible or completely immiscible with water also can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Organic solvents that can be used in the methods provided herein include alcohols and others listed as Class 3 and 2 solvents in International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline (Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents), safe handling of which has been established in pharmaceutical and food industries.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Depending on the characteristics of the macromolecule (hydrophobicity, solubility, stability, etc.) and other process parameters, the choice and concentration of the organic solvent can be optimized, for example, using high-throughput screening on microtiter plates or similar chips or other device. In general, uncontrolled precipitation before the initiation of cooling, the formation of oversized microspheres, amorphous aggregates, aggregated microspheres or sticky aggregates indicates that the concentration of organic solvent should be decreased, while failure to form microspheres (broken glass-like crystals or flakes) or formation of microspheres below the desired size indicates that the concentration of the organic solvent should be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">pH</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In addition to initiating microsphere formation, the counterion also can serve as a buffer. Alternately, in some embodiments, a buffering compound can be used to obtain the desired pH. In some embodiments, the buffering compound is 60 Da or larger. Depending on the characteristics of the macromolecule (pI, hydrophobicity, solubility and stability at a specific pH, etc.) and other process parameters, the optimal pH can empirically be adjusted to achieve formation of microspheres of desired dimensions and preserve the activity of the macromolecule. In general, failure to form microspheres (broken glass-like crystals or flakes) indicates that the protein may be too soluble under the conditions used. Formation of amorphous aggregates can indicate that precipitation is not well controlled and the protein may not be stable or soluble at the pH used.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">When the macromolecule is a protein, it has been observed that certain protein/counterion combinations can cause immediate and uncontrolled precipitation at certain pH values. The high-throughout screening methods provided herein can be used to empirically determine the appropriate combination of protein, pH and counterion to form microspheres of desired dimensions. his is easily remedied by changing the pH of the cocktail, by using a different counterion or by decreasing concentration of the protein in cocktail. In general, for forming protein-based microspheres, a pH value that is below the pI of the protein provides optimal microsphere formation</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Ionic Strength</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The ionic strength of the cocktail solution can be modulated by the concentration of the counterion or by other salts such as chlorides or acetates. In some embodiments, no additional salt is required to produce microspheres. In certain embodiments, the ionic strength can be adjusted to preserve the structural integrity and activity of the macromolecule. Examples of other applications where the presence of specific salts can be beneficial include formulations of parenteral and other drugs, or foods where specific tonicity or buffering capacity may be required upon reconstitution of microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Cooling Ramp</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The cocktail containing a macromolecule, a counterion and an organic solvent initially is prepared, prior to cooling, at a temperature at which the macromolecule is soluble, generally about &#x2212;15&#xb0; C. to about 30&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the initial temperature, prior to cooling is at ambient temperature (18-25&#xb0; C.). The microspheres are formed by a process such as precipitation, phase separation or colloid formation upon gradual cooling to a temperature below the temperature at which the macromolecule is dissolved and in solution. The rate at which cooling is performed can control the formation and other characteristics such as size of the microspheres. In general, when the macromolecule is protein, flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen does not generate microspheres</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The rate at which cooling and freezing of the cocktail (cooling ramp) is performed can determine the final size of the microspheres. In general, a faster cooling ramp yields smaller microspheres whereas a slower cooling ramp yields larger microspheres. Without being bound by any theory, the cooling rate can determine the rate of: (1) nucleation that produces initial smaller microspheres and (2) a fusion process in which the initial microspheres coalesce (aggregate) and anneal into larger microspheres. Fusion of the smaller particles into larger ones is a time dependent process that can be determined, for example, by the duration for which liquid suspension of microspheres exists prior to freezing. Due to the reversible nature of the bonds between certain macromolecules, such as some proteins, in the microsphere compositions provided herein, smaller microspheres annealing into larger particles can generate microspheres with smooth surfaces. Depending on the size of microparticles desired, the cooling rate can be from about 0.01&#xb0; C./min or 0.01&#xb0; C./min to about 20&#xb0; C./min or 20&#xb0; C./min; from about or at 0.05&#xb0; C./min or about or at 0.1&#xb0; C./min to about or at 10&#xb0; C./min or about or at 15&#xb0; C./min, from about or at 0.2&#xb0; C./min to about or at 5&#xb0; C./min, from about or at 0.5&#xb0; C./min to about or at 2&#xb0; C./min, or about or at 1&#xb0; C./min. In some embodiments, the cooling ramp can be between 0.1&#xb0; C. per minute and about 40&#xb0; C. per minute. In other embodiments, a cooling ramp can be between about 0.5&#xb0; C. per minute and 15&#xb0; C. per minute.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Depending on the specific needs, in some embodiments it can be desirable to adapt the production process to the specific equipment. In some embodiments, a lyophilizer with temperature-controlled shelves can be used for the cooling. if the microspheres produced are larger than desired, other parameters of the process including concentration of macromolecule, organic solvent, counterion, ionic strength and/or pH can be modified to achieve the desired reduction in size of the microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">For a faster cooling ramp (smaller particle size), the cocktail solution can be passed through a heat exchanger, such as that used in a continuous mode. If the size of microspheres needs to be increased, increased concentrations of one of the cocktail ingredients (macromolecule, organic solvent, counterion) can provide the desired increase in the size of microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In general, the cooling should be performed uniformly and at a steady rate to prevent the formation of aggregates and crystal. Depending on the concentration of the organic solvent, the precipitation of the macromolecule into microspheres can occur in several ways. At higher concentrations of organic solvent (about 5%-40%, dependent on the actual components used) the microspheres generally can form when the cocktail solution is still in liquid form. At lower concentrations of organic solvent (2-25%, dependent on the actual components used) ice crystals can form first, following which the expelled macromolecules and organic solvent reach can reach a critical local concentration and precipitate. A further decrease of temperature in the near-bottom layer of the lyophilizer tray can leas to complete solidification of the liquid suspension and further expulsion of the organic solvent into the top layer. An excess of organic solvent in the top layer can cause uncontrolled precipitation of the macromolecule and aggregation of microspheres. This effect usually can be alleviated by selecting appropriate ratios of the components&#x2014;macromolecule, counterion, organic solvent, salts, etc. in the cocktail. In addition, maintaining a thin layer of cocktail in the lyophilization tray or mixing of the cocktail while being chilled can prevent formation of aggregates and crystals and yield uniform microspheres. For example if a relatively low concentration of Isopropanol (e.g. 2-6%) is used, and a thin layer of cocktail (10-20 mm) is filled into the tray, and the tray is placed on a pre-chilled shelf (&#x2212;30-75&#xb0; C.) uniform microspheres can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The methods provided herein can lead to substantially all or all the protein or other macromolecule being incorporated from the solution into the microspheres</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">High-Throughout Screening of Microparticle Formation Conditions and Optimization of Particle Formation</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Depending on the characteristics of the macromolecule, the composition of the cocktail solution used to prepare the microspheres according to the methods provided herein can be optimized. The optimization can rapidly be performed in a medium or high throughput format using, for example microtiter plate(s) or chips where tens to hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands of cocktails can be screened simultaneously. In some embodiments, a number of pH values in conjunction with cationic, anionic or zwitterionic counterions and organic solvents at various concentrations can be screened. For example, the screening can be performed using several identical microtiter plates, to each of which the macromolecule of interest is added at various concentrations. Each set of test conditions can be screened in duplicate. In some embodiments, microplates with flat-bottom well can be used with the skirt of the microtiter plate broken off to permit good heat transfer between the lyophilizer shelf and the bottoms of the wells. The microplates can be placed on the shelves of the lyophilizer and cooled to form microspheres and to subsequently solidify the suspensions. Upon freezing of the contents of the wells, a vacuum can applied. At the end of lyophilization, one of the duplicate plates can be reconstituted with water or a buffer of choice to observe if certain conditions rendered the macromolecule insoluble or reduced its activity. Conditions that resulted in material that can readily be resolubilized or provide microspheres with desirable characteristics can be subjected to further analysis by spectroscopic, chromatographic, enzymatic or other assays to confirm that native structure and activity are preserved. Lyophilized material in a duplicate plate can be used for microscopy to determine whether microspheres are formed. Conditions that produced microspheres can further be modified and fine-tuned to produce microspheres of desirable size and characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Kits for performing high-throughput screens can be provided and can contain all the ingredients used in the methods provided herein including one or more of a macromolecule, such as a protein, buffers, pre-dispensed cocktail of known composition (organic solvent, counterion) and/or salts. Kits can contain 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 or more (typically 96 or more) buffers with predetermined pH, counterion, ionic strength and organic solvent in each microtiter plate. The microtiter plate supplied with the kit can be modified so that bottoms of wells are in direct contact with the shelf of lyophilizer.</p>

<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The macromolecules contained in the microparticle compositions obtained by the methods provided herein are substantially structurally and chemically unchanged by the methods. For example, when the macromolecule is Green Fluorescent Protein or Red Fluorescent Protein, their fluorescence and native conformation and activity of the proteins are retained in the microparticles. The dry microspheres, obtained by volatilizing substantially all of the solvents and/or moisture except for the solvent and other components associated with the microspheres, can be stored and their activity can substantially be recovered upon reconstitution. The relatively low moisture content of the microparticles provided herein, for example, between about or at 0.1% to about or at 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, 4.0%, 5.0%, 5.5%, 6.0%, 6.5%, 7.0%, 7.5%, 8.0%, 8.5%, 9.0%, 9.5%, 10.0%, 10.5%, 11.0%, 11.5%, 12.0%, 12.5%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18% 19%, or 20%, can provide improved stability. The microspheres obtained by the methods provided herein also are homogeneous in size and shape, and can be obtained reproducibly with the desired characteristics. Other techniques traditionally used for preparation of dry formulations (salt precipitation, alcohol or acetone precipitation, lyophilization, e.g.) can result in complete or partial denaturation of the macromolecules, such as proteins.

<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The microparticles obtained by the methods provided herein can be of any shape and can have sizes (mean width or diameters) in the range of from about or at 0.001 micron to about or at 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.02, 0.03, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 30.0, 35.0, 40.0, 45.0, or 50.0 or greater microns. For pulmonary administration to the alveoli, the size can be from about 0.1 micron or less to about 0.5 micron. For pulmonary administration to the throat, trachea and bronchi, the size can be from about or at 0.5 microns to about or at 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5 microns, or in some embodiments from about or at 1.0 micron to about or at 2.0 microns. In some embodiments, the microparticles are substantially spherical in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The macromolecules that can be used to form microparticles according to the methods provided herein can include therapeutic and diagnostic agents, processed foods, dietary supplements and polymers. In some embodiments, cross-linking agents, salts, or other compounds can be included in the formulation cocktail to modify solubility of the microspheres and/or enhance their mechanical strength. In some embodiments, microspheres that are insoluble in most aqueous or organic solvents can be used to manufacture particles such as chromatographic resins and dispersible abrasives. In other embodiments, microspheres with partial solubility in solvents such as pharmaceutical vehicles for delivery can be useful in the manufacture of sustained release active agent or therapeutic formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments, the microparticles provided herein can be used in combination with an inhaler device to deliver a therapeutic dose of macromolecular microspheres to the respiratory airways and lungs of a subject. For example, when the macromolecule is the DAS181 protein (sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 17), microspheres of about 0.5 micron to about 8 microns, or about 1 micron to about 5 micron can be obtained by the methods provided herein, using sodium sulfate as the counterion and isopropanol as the organic solvent. For DAS181 microspheres, which are administered to prevent or treat viral infections that initiate in the respiratory tract, such as influenza, it can be desirable to deposit the microspheres in the throat, trachea or bronchi. The DAS181 fusion protein formulated as microspheres can act by degrading the receptor sialic acids in the throat/trachea/bronchi, thus preventing viral binding and infection at these sites. For optimal delivery of the DAS181 microspheres to sites where respiratory viral infection can be initiated, i.e., in the throat, trachea or bronchi, the microspheres must not be (a) so big that they are trapped at the front end in the mouth (i.e., microspheres are too big, about 8 microns or greater); or (b) so small that they are absorbed deep in the lungs and absorbed systemically into the blood stream through the alveoli where they are not active and/or can be toxic (i.e., 0.5 micron or smaller). For delivery of the DAS181 microspheres to the throat, trachea and bronchi, a size range of about 1 micron to about 5.5-6 microns generally can be suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The inhaler can be used to treat any medical condition in which the protein or other macromolecule can be administered by inhalation therapy. Typical inhaler devices can include dry powder inhalers, metered dose inhalers, and electrostatic delivery devices.

The microsphere formulations for pulmonary delivery generally can be in a size range of about 0.5 micron to about 5-6 microns, while those designed for other types of delivery, such as subcutaneous delivery, parenteral delivery or intramuscular delivery can be in a range of from about or at 10 micron to about or at 30, 40 or 50 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In some embodiments, the microspheres provided herein have no direct therapeutic effect but can serve as micro-carriers for other therapeutic agent(s). Examples of macromolecules useful for preparation of such microspheres include but are not limited to polysaccharides, glycans, proteins, peptides, polymers or combinations thereof. Therapeutic agents or other active agents can be added at the time of microsphere formation or added to the suspension of formed microspheres. Alternatively, therapeutic agents can be blended with the dry microsphere compositions by mixing, tumbling or other techniques practiced in pharmaceutical and food industries.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some embodiments, cross-linking agents, lipophilic substances, salts such as those with poor solubility in aqueous solvents, or combinations thereof or other compounds can be included in the formulation cocktail solution to modify the solubility of the microspheres and/or enhance their mechanical strength. Slow dissolution of the microspheres can be useful in sustained release of therapeutics delivered by oral ingestion, inhalation, intranasally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and by other delivery methods suitable for the delivery of therapeutic molecules. In some embodiments, the microspheres can be delivered by oral ingestion in a form of a pill or capsule with an enteric coating, endocytosed from the duodenum, and the macromolecule released into the blood stream or other site of action.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In some embodiments, the microspheres can be rendered insoluble by partial denaturation of the macromolecule, which upon delivery becomes renatured and bioavailable.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In other embodiments, the microspheres are substantially spherical in shape, and can have mean diameters within the range of from about 0.1 microns to 30.0 microns. In yet other embodiments, the mean diameter of the microspheres can be within the range of from about 0.5 microns to 5.0 microns, or from about 1.0 microns to 2.0 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In yet another aspect, provided herein are devices and methods for delivering the microspheres to a subject, such as an animal or human patient in need of medical treatment. Suitable delivery routes can include parenteral, such as i.m., i.v. and s.c., and non-parenteral, such as oral, buccal, intrathecal, nasal, pulmonary, transdermal, transmucosal, and the like delivery routes. Delivery devices can include syringes, both needleless and needle containing, and inhalers.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The delivery devices can contain a single dose of the microspheres for treating a condition that is treatable by rapid or sustained release of the macromolecule in vivo. The number of microspheres present in the single dose is dependent on the type and activity of the macromolecule. The single dose can be selected to achieve sustained release over a period of time that has been optimized for treating the particular medical condition.

<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Exemplary proteins that can be used to form microparticles by the methods provided herein are described below</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Sialidases</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Sialidases, also referred to as neuraminidases and N-acylneuraminosylglycohydrolases, are a family exoglycosidases that catalyze the removal of terminal sialic acid residues from sialo-glycoconjugates. Sialic acids are a family of a keto acids with 9-carbon backbones that are usually found at the outermost positions of the oligosaccharide chains attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids. These molecules are involved in a variety of biological functions and processes, such as the regulation of innate immunity, cell adhesion, and the interaction between inflammatory cells and target cells, possibly mediated through the binding of various lectins (Varki et al. (1992) Curr Opin Cell Biol 4:257-266). Sialic acids also are excellent sources of carbon, nitrogen, energy, and precursors of cell wall biosynthesis. Further still, sialic acids on eukaryotic cells can be used as receptors or coreceptors for pathogenic microorganisms, including, but not limited to, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, some coronavirus and rotavirus <i>Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moaxella catarrhalis, Helicobacter pylori </i>and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. The most prominent member of the sialic acid family is N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), which is the biosynthetic precursor for most of the other types. Two major linkages between Neu5Ac and the penultimate galactose residues of carbohydrate side chains are found in nature, Neu5Ac &#x3b1;(2,3)-Gal and Neu5Ac &#x3b1;(2,6)-Gal. Both Neu5Ac &#x3b1;(2,3)-Gal and Neu5Ac &#x3b1;(2,6)-Gal molecules can be recognized by influenza viruses and used as the receptor through which the virus binds and initiates infection. Human influenza viruses, however, seem to prefer Neu5Ac &#x3b1;(2,6)-Gal, while avian and equine influenza viruses predominantly recognize Neu5Ac &#x3b1;(2,3)-Gal (Ito et al. (2000) Microobiol Immunol 44:423-730). The human respiratory epithelium expresses both forms of sialic acids, but &#x3b1;(2,6)-linked sialic acid is more abundant than &#x3b1;(2,3)-linked sialic acid. The low abundance of &#x3b1;(2,3)-linked sialic acid is most likely the basis for the species barrier for avian viruses, and indicates that reducing the level of a receptor sialic acid expressed on the airway epithelium would likely reduce the infectivity of an influenza virus. Thus, sialidases, which remove terminal sialic acid residues from sialo-glycoconjugates, present themselves as potential influenza virus therapeutic agents that function to reduce the levels of receptor sialic acids. Sialidases also can act as therapeutic agents for any other pathogen that utilizes sialic acids in the infection process including, but not limited to, <i>M. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, H. pylori, H. influenzae, S. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa</i>, parainfluenza viruses and some coronaviruses and rotaviruses.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Sialidases tend to be highly substrate specific. They can target particular types of complex molecules, such as glycoproteins or glycolipids; specific sugar linkages (e.g. 2-3, 2-6, or 2-8); or can be sensitive to the nature of the linkage sugar itself (e.g. D-galactose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine). Substrate molecules include, but are not limited to, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, gangliosides, and synthetic molecules. For example, a sialidase can cleave bonds having &#x3b1;(2,3)-Gal, &#x3b1;(2,6)-Gal, or &#x3b1;(2,8)-Gal linkages between a sialic acid residue and the remainder of a substrate molecule. A sialidase also can cleave any or all of the linkages between the sialic acid residue and the remainder of the substrate molecule. Many sialidase proteins have been purified from microbes and higher eukaryotes and of these, several have been shown to catalyze the removal of terminal sialic acid residues than can serve as receptors for pathogenic microorganisms. For example, among the large bacterial sialidases are those that that can degrade the influenza receptor sialic acids Neu5Ac &#x3b1;(2,6)-Gal and Neu5Ac &#x3b1;(2,3)-Gal, including sialidases from <i>Clostridium perfringens, Actinomyces viscosus, Arthrobacter ureafaciens</i>, and <i>Micromonospora viridifaciens</i>. Other sialidases that can serve as therapeutic agents include the human sialidases, such as those encoded by the genes NEU2 and NEU4.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Sialidase-GAG Fusion Proteins</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Sialidase-GAG fusion proteins are proteins that are made up of a sialidase protein, or catalytically active portion thereof, fused to a glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding sequence. As such, these proteins effectively contain an anchoring domain (the GAG-binding sequence) and a therapeutic domain (the sialidase protein, or catalytically active portion thereof). The sialidase-GAG fusion proteins are designed to bind to the epithelium and remove the surrounding sialic acids, and can therefore be used as a therapeutic agent against pathogens that utilize sialic acids in the infection process. The ability of the fusion protein to bind to the epithelium increases its retention when the fusion protein is administered, for example, as an inhalant to treat influenza infection. The GAG-binding sequence acts as an epithelium-anchoring domain that tethers the sialidase to the respiratory epithelium and increases its retention and potency.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Heparan sulfate, closely related to heparin, is a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that is ubiquitously present on cell membranes, including the surface of respiratory epithelium. Many proteins specifically bind to heparin/heparan sulfate, and the GAG-binding sequences in these proteins have been identified. For example, the GAG-binding sequences of human platelet factor 4 (PF4) (SEQ ID NO:3), human interleukin 8 (IL8) (SEQ ID NO:4), human antithrombin III (AT III) (SEQ ID NO:5), human apoprotein E (ApoE) (SEQ ID NO:6), human angio-associated migratory cell protein (AAMP) (SEQ ID NO:7), or human amphiregulin (SEQ ID NO:8) have been shown to exhibit high affinity for heparin (Lee et al. (1991) PNAS 88:2768-2772; Goger et al. (2002) Biochem. 41:1640-1646; Witt et al. (1994) Curr Bio 4:394-400; Weisgraber et al. (1986) J Bio Chem 261:2068-2076). The GAG-binding sequences of these proteins are distinct from their receptor-binding sequences, so they do not induce the biological activities associated with the full-length proteins or the receptor-binding domains. These sequences, or other sequences that can bind heparin/heparan sulfate, can be used as epithelium-anchoring-domains in sialidase-GAG fusion proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In the context of a sialidase-GAG fusion protein, the sialidase can include the entire sialidase protein, or a catalytically active portion thereof. For example, sialidase-GAG fusion protein can contain the 901 amino acid sialidase protein from <i>A. viscosus </i>set forth in SEQ ID NO:1. In another example, the sialidase-GAG fusion protein can contain the 394 amino acid catalytically active portion of a sialidase protein from <i>A. viscosus </i>set forth in SEQ ID NO:2. The GAG-binding sequence can be linked to the sialidase by recombinant methods. In some examples, the fusion protein can include an amino acid linker, such as four glycine residues. Furthermore, linkage can be via the N- or C-terminus of the GAG-binding sequence, or the N- or C-terminus of the sialidase. Exemplary examples of sialidase-GAG fusion proteins include those polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 9-13, and 17. In a further example, the sialidase and GAG-binding sequence components can be linked using chemical or peptide linkers, by any method known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Proteinase Inhibitor 8</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Proteinase inhibitor 8 (PI8), also known as Serpin B8, is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) Serpins are a large superfamily of structurally related proteins that are expressed in viruses, insects, plants and higher organisms, but not in bacteria or yeast. Serpins regulate the activity of proteases involved in many biological process, including coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammation, cell migration, and tumorigenesis. They contain a surface-exposed reactive site loop (RSL), which acts as a &#x201c;bait&#x201d; for proteases by mimicking a protease substrate sequence. On binding of the target protease to the serpin, the RSL is cleaved, after which the protease is covalently linked to the serpin. The protease in the newly formed serpin-protease complex is inactive (Huntington et al. (2000) Nature 407:923-926).</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">PI8 is a member of a subfamily of serpins of which chicken ovalbumin is the archtype. Like other serpins that belong to this family, PI8 lacks a typical cleavable N-terminal signal sequence, resulting in a 374 amino acid protein (SEQ ID NO:14) that resides mainly intracellularly. Other members of this human ovalbumin-like subfamily include plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2), monocyte neutrophil elastase inhibitor (MNEI), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA)-1, leupin (SCCA-2) maspin (PI5), protease inhibitor 6 (PI6), protease inhibitor (PI9) and bomapin (PI10). Within this family the serpins PI6, PI8, and PI9 show the highest structural homology (up to 68% amino acid identity) (Sprecher et al. (1995) J Biol Chem 270:29854-29861). PI-8 has been shown to inhibit trypsin, thrombin, factor Xa, subtilisin A, furin, and also chymotrypsin in vitro. It is released by platelets and appears to be involved in the regulation of furin activity and, therefore, platelet aggregation (LeBlond et al. (2006) Thromb Haemost 95:243-252).</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In addition to their role in the regulation of endogenous biological processes, such as coagulation, serine protease inhibitors also can function to inhibit the biological activities of exogenous microorganisms. For example, a number of serine protease inhibitors have been shown to reduce influenza virus activation in cultured cells, chicken embryos and in the lungs of infected mice. The serpins bind to hemagglutinin (HA) molecules on the surface of the influenza virus and inhibit its activity, thus reducing the infectivity of the virus. For example trypsin inhibitors, such as: aprotinin (Zhimov et al. (2002) J Virol 76:8682-8689), leupeptin (Zhimov et al. (2002) J Virol 76:8682-8689; Tashiro et al. (1987) J Gen Virol 68:2039-2043), soybean protease inhibitor (Barbey-Morel et al. (1987) J Infect Dis 155:667-672), e-aminocaproic acid (Zhimov et al. 1982. Arch Virol 73:263-272) and n-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone (TLCK) (Barbey-Morel et al. (1987) J Infect Dis 155:667-672) have all been shown to inhibit influenza virus infection, and are candidate therapeutic agents for use in the treatment of influenza virus infection. Thus, as a related trypsin inhibitor, PI8 also can be used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of influenza virus infection.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Preparation of Microspheres of the Sialidase Fusion Protein, DAS181</heading>
<p id="p-0475" num="0476">A. Purification of DAS181</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0477">DAS181 is a fusion protein containing the heparin (glysosamino glycan, or GAG) binding domain from human amphiregulin fused via its N-terminus to the C-terminus of a catalytic domain of <i>Actinomyces Viscosus </i>(sequence of amino acids set forth in SEQ ID NO:17). The DAS181 protein was purified as described in Malakhov et al., <i>Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., </i>1470-1479, 2006, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. Briefly, the DNA fragment coding for DAS181 was cloned into the plasmid vector pTrc99a (Pharmacia; SEQ ID NO:16) under the control of a IPTG (isopropyl-&#x3b2;-D-thiogalactopyranoside)-inducible promoter. The resulting construct was expressed in the BL21 strain of <i>Escherichia Coli </i>(<i>E. Coli</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0478">The <i>E. Coli </i>cells containing the expressed construct were lysed by sonication in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0; 0.3 M NaCl and 10% glycerol. The clarified lysate was passed through an SP-Sepharose column. Proteins were eluted from the column with lysis buffer that contained 0.8 M NaCl. The fraction eluted from SP-Sepharose was adjusted to 1.9 M ammonium sulfate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), clarified by centrifugation, and loaded onto a butyl-Sepharose column. The column was washed with two volumes of 1.3 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and the DAS181 fusion protein was eluted with 0.65 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0479">For the final step, size exclusion chromatography was performed on Sephacryl S-200 equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The protein purity was determined to be greater than 98% as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with antibodies generated against <i>E. Coli </i>cell proteins. The purified DAS181, molecular weight 44,800 Da, was dialyzed against 2 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0480">B. Activity of DAS181</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0481">The sialidase activity of DAS181 was measured using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-&#x3b1;-D-neuraminic acid (4-MU-NANA; Sigma). One unit of sialidase is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 10 nmol of MU from 4-MU-NANA in 10 minutes at 37&#xb0; C. (50 mM CH<sub>3</sub>COOH&#x2014;NaOH buffer, pH 5.5) in a reaction that contains 20 nmol of 4-MU-NANA in a 0.2 ml volume (Potier et al., <i>Anal. Biochem., </i>94:287-296, 1979). The specific activity of DAS181 was determined to be 1,300 U/mg protein (0.77 &#x3bc;g DAS181 protein per unit of activity).</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0482">C. Preparation of Microspheres Using Purified DAS181</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0483">DAS181 (10 mg/ml), purified and prepared as described under Section A above, was used to form 200 &#x3bc;l cocktails as shown below. The cocktails contained either glycine or citrate as counterions, and isopropanol as organic solvent, as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0484">1) DAS181+5 mM glycine, pH 5.0;</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0485">2) DAS181+5 mM glycine, pH 5.0+10% isopropanol;</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0486">3) DAS181+5 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0;</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0487">4) DAS181+5 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0+10% isopropanol;</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0488">Plastic microcentrifuge tubes containing the cocktails with ingredients as described in 1)-4) above were gradually cooled from:</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0489">(a) ambient temperature (about 25&#xb0; C.) to 4&#xb0; C. by placing the cocktails in a refrigerator, followed by:</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0490">(b) cooling to &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. by placing the resulting cocktail from (a) in a freezer, followed by:</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0491">(c) freezing to &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. by placing the resulting cocktail from b) in a freezer.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0492">Under optimal conditions, microspheres would be expected to form between about 4&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. (generally in the range of about &#x2212;2&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;15&#xb0; C.). Freezing to &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. is carried out to remove ingredients from the cocktail other than the microspheres (e.g., solvent, etc.) by freeze-drying. Cocktail 4) was prepared in triplicate, two aliquots in plastic tubes and one in a glass tube. One aliquot (in a plastic tube) was cooled as described above, while the two other aliquots (one in a plastic tube and one in a glass tube) were subjected to snap cooling/freezing by dipping the tubes into liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0493">Upon freezing, all tubes were placed into the lyophilizer and the volatiles (water and isopropanol) were removed by sublimation, leaving the dry pellets.</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0494">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0495">The dry pellets recovered from the cocktails treated as described above, were tested for the presence of microspheres. Of the above samples, microspheres with good dispersivity characteristics, about 2 microns (&#x3bc;m) in size, were observed only with cocktail 4) containing citrate counterion and isopropanol and subjected to gradual cooling. The counterion glycine did not prove to be optimal for the DAS181 protein (cocktail 2)), showing a mixture of glass-like crystals and agglomerates with only a few microspheres. When no organic solvent was present, a glass-like mass of lyophilized DAS181 protein was obtained and no microspheres were observed (cocktails 1) and 3)). Snap-freezing of cocktail 4) in a glass tube produced glass-like crystals and no microspheres, while snap-freezing of cocktail 4) in a plastic tube (cooling rate is slightly slower due to slower diffusion of heat through plastic than through glass) produced agglomerated microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0496">This example demonstrates that microspheres with narrow size distribution and good dispersivity (minimal agglomeration) can be produced by a combination of appropriate protein, counterion, organic solvent and gradual cooling, using the methods provided herein.</p>

<p id="p-0496" num="0497">DAS181 was purified and used to prepare microspheres as described above in Example 1 (see cocktail 4)), using a combination of DAS181 protein (10 mg/ml), citrate counterion (sodium citrate, 5 mM) and isopropanol organic solvent (10%, 20% or 30%). The resulting cocktail solutions were cooled from ambient temperature (about 25&#xb0; C.) to 4&#xb0; C., followed by cooling to &#x2212;20&#xb0; C., followed by freezing to &#x2212;80&#xb0; C., as described in Example 1. Upon freezing to &#x2212;80&#xb0; C., the tubes are placed in a lyophilizer and the volatiles (water and isopropanol) were removed by sublimation, leaving the dry powder containing microspheres.</p>

The dimensions of the microspheres however varied, depending on the concentration of the organic solvent. The sizes of the microspheres as determined by comparing the particles to a grid on a hemocytometer were estimated to be 2 microns using 10% isopropanol, 4 microns using 20% isopropanol, and 5-6 microns using 30% isopropanol.

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">DAS181 Microspheres Formed in the Presence of Surfactants</heading>
<p id="p-0505" num="0506">The addition of surfactants to macromolecular (e.g., protein) microspheres often can improve characteristics of the microspheres that render them suitable for administration to a subject, such as flowability, dispersivity and disposition for a particular route of administration, such as intranasal or oral inhalation. To test whether surfactants can be incorporated into the methods of manufacturing microspheres as provided herein, the production of DAS181 microspheres was undertaken as described in Example 1 above, except that in addition, a surfactant was added to the solution.</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0507">To a cocktail solution containing 5 mg/ml DAS181, 5 mM sodium citrate, and 20% isopropanol, was added a surfactant (3.5% w/w lecithin, 0.7% w/w Span-85&#xae; (sorbitan trioleate), or 3.5% w/w oleic acid). The microspheres were formed by cooling the solutions to 4&#xb0; C., followed by cooling to &#x2212;20&#xb0; C., followed by freezing to &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for lyophilization as described above in Example 1.

<p id="p-0527" num="0528">As described herein, the methods provided herein can be used to produce microspheres in any desired size range, including a range of about 0.5 micron to about 6-8 microns for delivery via inhalation.</p>
<p id="p-0528" num="0529">A. Preparation of Microspheres</p>
<p id="p-0529" num="0530">To test the aerodynamic particle size distribution of DAS181 dry powder (microspheres) formulated for delivery by inhalation, DAS181 microspheres were prepared using two methods as follows:</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">(a) A DAS181 aqueous solution containing 14 mg/ml DAS181, 5 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0 was spray dried into an air stream at 55&#xb0; C., to produce microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0530" num="0531">(b) Alternately, DAS181 microspheres were produced according to the methods provided herein. To a DAS181 aqueous solution containing 14 mg/ml DAS181, 5 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0, was added 5% isopropanol as organic solvent. The resulting solution was cooled from +20&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. at a freeze ramp of 1&#xb0; C. per minute in a Millrock Lab Series lyophilizer. Volatiles (water and isopropanol) were removed by sublimation at 100 mTorr with primary drying at &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. for 12 hours and secondary drying at 30&#xb0; C. for 3 hours, leaving the dry powder containing microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0532">B. Aerodynamic Particle Size Distribution of Microspheres</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="0533">The microspheres prepared as described in Example 8A were tested by Andersen Cascade Impaction. The deposition of pharmaceuticals in the respiratory tract can be predicted by the aerodynamic behavior of particles (microspheres) on the stages/collection plates of the cascade impactor.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="0534">The cascade impaction experiment was performed using DAS181 microspheres prepared by one of the two alternate methods described in section A above, i.e., either by spray-drying or by the methods provided herein. The microspheres (10 mg) were loaded into gelatin capsules. The gelatin capsules were placed into a CycloHaler (PharmaChemie) dry powder inhaler and subjected to cascade impaction. An 8-stage, non-viable Andersen Cascade Impactor (Thermo Electron, Boston) modified for use at 90 liters per minute of air flow and equipped with a USP throat, induction cone and no preseparator, was used. The collection plates of the impactor representing various areas/stages of deposition post-inhalation (trachea, primary and secondary bronchi, terminal bronchi, alveoli, etc.) were coated with silicon spray to prevent bouncing of the microspheres. The microspheres from the stages and collection plates were recovered into a phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween, and the amount of deposited DAS181 recovered from each stage and collection plate was quantified by measuring absorbance at 280 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="0535">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="0536">The geometric size of microspheres produced by the two methods was assessed by light microscopy and found to be essentially identical (range of 1.5-3.0 microns) for both methods. As shown in Table 3 below, however, the aerodynamic particle size distribution of the two preparations differs significantly between the two methods. For the microspheres produced according to a method as provided herein (i.e., method (b) as set forth in section A above), less than 25% remained trapped in the mouth (throat/cone of the impactor assembly), while greater than 70% of the microspheres were delivered to the trachea and lungs (with greater than 40% in the terminal bronchi and alveoli). In comparison, less than 50% of the DAS181 microspheres formed by spray-drying (method (a) as set forth in section A above) was delivered to the trachea and lungs (less than 20% in the terminal bronchi and alveoli). The results demonstrate that methods provided herein can produce microspheres for delivery into deep lungs, and that the microspheres produced by methods provided herein have superior disagglomeration and flowability properties (provide a higher delivered dose) compared to microspheres produced by a spray-drying method.</p>

<heading id="h-0036" level="1">Large Scale Manufacture of Microspheres</heading>
<p id="p-0537" num="0538">This example demonstrates that the methods provided herein can be scaled for the manufacture of large quantities of DAS181. The Batch Process described herein is suitable for the manufacture of high quality dry powder microspheres in an amount ranging from, for example, milligrams to about a kilogram and is limited by the capacity of the mixing tank and/or lyophilizer shelf space. An alternative &#x201c;continuous&#x201d; process described herein can be used to manufacture amounts ranging from, for example, hundreds of grams to hundred or more kilograms (100 grams to 100 kg and above). Additional advantage of continuous process is a better control over the chilling of the cocktail.</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0539">The large scale manufacture by a batch process or by a continuous process can follow, for example, one or more of the steps described below in any combination of steps or specific alternative methods:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0540">Precipitation of protein into microspheres. This step can be performed in a batch mode by placing the cocktail solution containing the desired concentration of protein, organic solvent and counterion in lyophilization tray(s) and placing the tray(s) onto lyophilizer shelves. Alternatively, trays can be chilled and frozen on a chilled platform or other type of equipment (e.g., a freezer) and stored for a period of time frozen and lyophilized later. Alternatively, the microspheres can be formed by precipitation in a vessel with stirring, wherein the vessel is placed onto a cold surface or a cooling coil is immersed into liquid or while the cocktail is being recirculated through a heat exchanger using a peristaltic pump. Alternatively, the microspheres can be formed by precipitation in a continuous mode, by passing the cocktail solution through a heat exchanger(s) once using a peristaltic pump.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0541">Removal of bulk liquid. The suspension of the microspheres can be concentrated using standard centrifugation, continuous flow centrifugation (e.g., CARR ViaFuge Pilot), or filtration (e.g., on glass fiber, sintered glass, polymer filters, hollow fiber cartridges (e.g., those manufactured by GE Healthcare) or tangential flow filtration cassettes (TFF cassettes, such as those manufactured by Millipore or Sartorius)). The removal of bulk liquid (50% or greater) can result in a faster drying cycle and higher efficiency and throughput.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0542">Drying the microspheres. The recovered microspheres formed by any mode, can be dried by conventional lyophilization. Alternatively, the microspheres can be dried under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, eliminating the use of lyophilizer.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p id="p-0539" num="0543">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0540" num="0544">DAS181 protein was successfully processed into dry powder (microspheres) by a continuous mode as described herein. Cocktail containing 10 mg/ml DAS181, 20% isopropanol, 2 mM sodium sulfate was passed through 35 SERIES heat exchanger (Exergy, Garden City, N.Y.) coupled with a NESLAB circulating cryostat using a peristaltic pump so that during the passage the cocktail was cooled from about 25&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;12&#xb0; C. The resulting suspension of microspheres exiting the heat exchanger was pumped into a prechilled lyophilization tray (&#x2212;40&#xb0; C.), frozen and lyophilized or, alternatively, pumped directly into liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized. The resulting microspheres, which were analyzed by microscopy and cascade impaction, showed uniform microspheres with minimal aggregation and good dispersivity and were similar in dimensions and aerodynamic particle size distribution to the microspheres produced by batch mode. When the formulated DAS181 cocktail solution was not chilled (not passed through heat exchanger, thus no precipitation of microspheres was induced) and poured directly into liquid nitrogen, no microspheres were observed and, instead, glass-like crystals were observed after lyophilization.</p>

<p id="p-0544" num="0548">The terms Drug Substance, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, and API are used interchangeably in this example and refer to the DAS181 protein. Production of DAS181 protein in bulk was conducted as follows. First, bulk amounts of DAS181 were expressed in <i>E. coli </i>(BL21 strain) essentially as described in Example 1. The <i>E. coli </i>cells expressing the DAS181 protein were washed by diafiltration in a fermentation harvest wash step using Toyopearl buffer 1, UFP-500-E55 hollow fiber cartridge (GE Healthcare) and a Watson-Marlow peristaltic pump.</p>
<p id="p-0545" num="0549">The recombinant DAS181 protein was then purified in bulk from the cells. The detailed specifications of the components and buffers used in the bulk purification of DAS181 are provided in Tables 5 and 6 below. The harvested and washed cells were lysed in a homogenization step by passing the cells twice through using Niro-Soave Panda cell disruptor. The homogenate thus obtained was clarified by microfiltration using the Toyopearl buffer 1, Hydrosart 0.2 micron TFF cassette and a Watson Marlow pump. The clarified homogenate was then concentrated by allowing the lysate to recirculate without fresh buffer feed. Next, DAS181 protein was captured from the clarified homogenate on a Toyopearl SP-550C resin which was washed in a series of buffers (see Table 5) before the DAS181 protein was eluted from the resin. The sodium chloride concentration of the eluate was adjusted to 1.0 M in a final buffer of 50 mM phosphate at pH 8.0. The DAS181-containing eluate was then passed through a Toyopearl Hexyl-650C resin for further purification using a Toyopearl Buffer 4. The resin eluate containing DAS181 protein was then buffer-exchanged into 5 mM sodium acetate in a diafiltration step (see step 8 in Table 5). The concentrated protein was next passed through a Sartorius Q SingleSep Filter in order to remove DNA in a flow-through mode. Isopropanol was added to the Q SingleSep filtrate to a final concentration of 20% v/v. The DAS181 protein in the buffer was passed through an Amberchrome CG300M resin equilibrated with an Amberchrom buffer (see step 11 in Table 5). The purified bulk DAS181 protein was then buffer-exchanged into formulation buffer and concentrated by diafiltration (see step 12 of Table 5).</p>

The tumbling was to ensure uniformity of bottle content. Samples for analytical testing were taken and the bottle was recapped and sealed into plastic bags for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="0567">In the DAS181 microsphere bulk manufacturing process as described above, sulfate was demonstrated to be a safe substance for use as a counterion, and reproducibly produced microspheres with a narrow size distribution. Further, the organic solvent isopropanol was a good solvent of choice because (1) a class 3 solvent, (2) it can produce microspheres in a wide range (2-30%, v/v) of concentrations, and (3) it has a relatively high freezing point so its vapors can efficiently be trapped during lyophilization.</p>
<p id="p-0559" num="0568">The protein concentration in the final formulation could be varied (10-14 mg/ml), as could the concentration of counterion (1-5 mM) and isopropanol (2-30% v/v), without substantial impact on the physical properties of the microspheres or the activity of the DAS181 protein in the microspheres. At higher concentrations of isopropanol (15-30%), the microspheres formed while the cocktail was still fully liquid. At lower concentrations (2-15%), ice crystals began to form first, followed by precipitation to form microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0560" num="0569">C. Yield of DAS181 in the Microspheres</p>
<p id="p-0561" num="0570">The theoretical yield of DAS181 in the dry microspheres is calculated according to the following formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Theoretical yield=DAS181 protein, g&#xf7;protein fraction in Dry Powder (microspheres)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0562" num="0571">The protein fraction value (0.866) was established empirically by analysis of several manufactured batches of DAS181 microspheres. The theoretical yield for the amounts as set forth in Table 2 is 64.56 g&#xf7; 0.866=74.55 g. The actual yield of DAS181 Dry Powder was found to be 64 g.</p>
<p id="p-0563" num="0572">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="0573">The suitability of the microspheres prepared as described in section B above for administration by oral inhalation was tested by Andersen Cascade Impaction. The results are summarized in Table 7 below. The deposition of pharmaceuticals in the respiratory tract can be predicted by deposition of particles (microspheres) on the stages/collection plates of the cascade impactor. For a pharmaceutical, e.g., DAS181 microspheres, that is administered to prevent or treat viral infections that initiate in the respiratory tract, such as influenza, it is desirable to deposit the pharmaceutical in the throat, trachea, bronchi (upper and central respiratory airways). The DAS181 fusion protein delivered to upper and central respiratory airways cleaves off the receptor sialic acids from mucous membranes, thus preventing viral binding and infection at these sites. For optimal delivery of the DAS181 microspheres to sites where respiratory viral infection can be initiated, i.e., in the throat, trachea or bronchi, the microspheres must not be (a) so big that they are trapped at the front end in the mouth (i.e., microspheres are too big, about 8 microns or greater); or (b) so small that they are deposited in deep lungs and absorbed systemically into the blood stream (i.e., 0.5 microns or smaller). For delivery of the DAS181 microspheres to the throat, trachea and bronchi, a size range of about 1 micron to about 5.5-6 microns generally is suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0565" num="0574">DAS181 microspheres manufactured as described above were characterized by Andersen cascade impaction and found to be suitable for delivery to upper and central respiratory airways with sufficiently low percentage (&#x3c;5%) deposited in the alveoli.</p>

DAS181 microspheres were further characterized by laser diffraction, which demonstrated, consistent with the cascade impaction results, that the majority of the microspheres produced by the method described in this Example are within a size range of between 1 micron and 5 microns in size. Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEI Quanta 200 Scanning Electron Microscope, Everhart Thornley (ET) detector) of the DAS181 microspheres prepared according to the method described in this Example revealed that the microspheres are present as agglomerates of hundreds and thousands of individual particles approximately 0.5-3 micron in size. The agglomerates however are easily dissipated by air turbulence produced during the actuation through dry powder inhaler (as demonstrated by Andersen Cascade Impaction or laser diffraction). Light microscopy of microspheres dispersed in a liquid surfactant (e.g. Triton X-100 or Tween 20) or non-polar solvent (e.g., alcohol, acetone, or acetonitrile) that does not dissolve the microspheres, confirmed that aggregates are easily dissipated into individual uniform microspheres.

<heading id="h-0045" level="1">EXAMPLE 11</heading>
<heading id="h-0046" level="1">Preparation of DAS181 Microspheres Using Sulfates Other than the Sodium Salt</heading>
<p id="p-0567" num="0576">Studies have shown that in certain instances, e.g., in some asthmatics, the presence of sodium in formulations for pulmonary administration could carry a risk of inducing airway hyperresponsiveness (Agrawal et al., <i>Lung, </i>183:375-387 (2005)). This example therefore tested alternate salts, such as salts of other metals such as potassium, magnesium and calcium.</p>
<p id="p-0568" num="0577">DAS181 microspheres were manufactured as described above in Example 1. Cocktail solutions containing 12 mg/mL DAS181 and 5% (v/v) isopropanol contained as counterions the indicated sulfates at 2 mM concentration, pH 4.5-5.0. The microspheres were formed by cooling the solutions from +25&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;45&#xb0; C. Upon freezing, the volatiles (water and isopropanol) were removed by sublimation, leaving the dry powder containing microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0569" num="0578">The aerodynamic particle size distribution of the dry powder was assessed by Andersen Cascade Impaction, and the amount of DAS181 per stage was determined by UV measurement at 226 nm (A<sub>226</sub>). The results are shown below in Table 8. The results demonstrate that sulfate salts other than the sodium salt can be used as counterion to obtain DAS181 microspheres of a size range such that the majority are delivered to the throat, trachea and bronchi, in an amount that is comparable to the amount delivered when sodium sulfate is used as the counterion.</p>

<p id="p-0579" num="0588">The sialidase activity of DAS181 in the dry powder microsphere formulations containing sugars and in the unlyophilized microsphere formulations stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C., were measured using fluorescent substrate 4-MU-NANA as described in Example 1 and as incorporated by reference herein. The dry powder formulations containing no sugar or various sugars as indicated below in Table 12 were stored at +42&#xb0; C. for 4 weeks (forced degradation). The results are shown in Table 12. Relative to unlyophilized formulations stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C., the formulation containing no sugar retained almost 80% of its activity. The addition of various sugars increase the stability so that about 88-98% of the activity is retained, depending on the sugar.</p>
