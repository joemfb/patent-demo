<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Increasing loop gain is a common practice for reducing lock time of phase locked loops. Very high loop gains, however, often result in increasing the lock time or causing loop instability. For very high loop gains, delaying the feedback clock signal along the feedback path of a phase locked loop decreases lock time and prevents instability. A delay circuit may be used at any location along the feedback path of the phase locked loop.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention is directed toward phase locked loops, and more particularly one or more of the embodiments of this invention relates to reducing lock time in phase locked loops.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A phase locked loop (PLL) is a closed loop frequency control system. The PLL adjusts the frequency of an internal signal until the phase of an internal signal is substantially the same as the phase of a reference signal (e.g., an external clock signal) to which the internal signal is &#x201c;locked.&#x201d; When either the PLL is initially powered or the internal signal or reference signal is first applied to the PLL, the phase of the internal signal generally will be quite different from the phase of the reference signal. The PLL then adjusts the phase of the internal signal until it is aligned with the phase of the reference signal, and the PLL is thus locked with the reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are many types of prior art PLLs available, one of which is a charge pump PLL <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The charge pump PLL <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a phase detector <b>110</b>, a charge pump <b>102</b>, a filter <b>104</b>, a voltage controlled oscillator <b>106</b>, and an N frequency divider circuit <b>108</b> connected to each other as shown. The phase detector <b>110</b> compares the phases of two input signals, an external clock signal <b>112</b> and a feedback clock signal <b>114</b>. The phase detector <b>100</b> then generates an UP_signal <b>120</b> or a DN_signal <b>122</b> depending on the phase difference between the two input signals <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. The UP_signal <b>120</b> and the DN_signal <b>122</b> are applied to a charge pump <b>102</b>, which generates a voltage having a magnitude that changes in one direction in response to the UP_signal <b>120</b> and in the other direction in response to the DN_signal <b>122</b>. The voltage from the charge pump <b>102</b> passes through the filter <b>104</b> to control the dynamic performance of the PLL <b>100</b>. The filter <b>104</b> then outputs a control signal (&#x201c;Vct&#x201d;) <b>124</b>, or a phase error signal, that is applied to the voltage controlled oscillator <b>106</b> (&#x201c;VCO&#x201d;). The VCO <b>106</b> generates a periodic output clock signal having a frequency corresponding to (e.g., that is controlled by) the control signal Vct <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The output signal of the phase detector <b>110</b> causes the charge pump <b>102</b> and filter <b>104</b> to adjust the magnitude of the control signal Vct <b>124</b> to either increase or decrease the frequency of the output clock signal <b>116</b> generated by the voltage control oscillator <b>106</b>. More specifically, the control signal Vct <b>124</b> has a magnitude that increases responsive to the UP_signal <b>120</b> and decreases responsive to the DN_signal <b>122</b>. The control signal Vct <b>124</b> adjusts the frequency of the feedback clock signal <b>114</b> until the phase (which is the integral to the frequency) of the feedback clock signal <b>114</b> is equal to the phase of the external clock signal <b>112</b> so that the PLL <b>100</b> is locked. When the PLL is locked, the frequency of the feedback clock signal <b>114</b> will, of course, be equal to the frequency of the external clock signal <b>112</b>. The feedback clock signal <b>114</b> may go through an N divider circuit <b>108</b> before being fed back into the phase detector <b>110</b> so that the frequency of the output clock signal <b>116</b> will be N times greater than the frequency of the external clock signal <b>112</b>. The output clock signal <b>116</b> is then output from the PLL <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an example signal timing diagram illustrating the various signals that may be generated during a typical operation of the prior art PLL <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At time t<sub>1 </sub>the external clock signal <b>112</b> leads the feedback clock signal <b>114</b> by the difference of t<sub>0 </sub>and t<sub>1</sub>. In response to a rising edge of the external clock signal <b>112</b> at time t<sub>0</sub>, the phase detector <b>110</b> drives the UP_signal <b>120</b> low. At time t<sub>1 </sub>and in response to a rising edge of the feedback clock signal <b>114</b>, the phase detector <b>110</b> drives the UP_signal <b>120</b> high. Therefore, the phase detector <b>110</b> generates the UP_signal <b>120</b> as a negative pulse having a width proportional to the time the feedback clock signal <b>114</b> lags the external clock signal <b>112</b> to increase the frequency of the feedback clock signal <b>114</b>. Conversely, at time t<sub>5 </sub>the external clock signal <b>112</b> lags the feedback clock signal <b>114</b> by the difference of t<sub>4 </sub>and t<sub>5</sub>. In response to a rising edge of the feedback clock signal <b>114</b> at time t<sub>4</sub>, the phase detector <b>110</b> drives the DN_signal <b>122</b> high. At time t<sub>5 </sub>and in response to a rising edge of the external clock signal <b>112</b>, the phase detector <b>110</b> drives the DN_signal <b>122</b> low. Thus, the phase detector <b>110</b> generates the DN_signal <b>122</b> as a positive pulse on the DN_signal <b>122</b> having a width proportional to the time the feedback clock signal <b>114</b> leads the external clock signal <b>112</b> to decrease the frequency of the feedback clock signal <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The PLL <b>100</b> will continue to generate appropriate negative UP_signals <b>120</b> or positive DN_signals <b>122</b> until the feedback clock signal <b>114</b> is in phase and thus at the same frequency as the external clock signal <b>112</b> to keep the PLL <b>100</b> in lock. With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at time t<sub>n </sub>a rising edge of the external clock signal <b>112</b> is at nearly the same time as the rising edge of the feedback clock signal <b>114</b>. Therefore, the PLL <b>100</b> locks.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The time it takes the PLL <b>100</b> to lock is typically an important parameter of the PLL. This is due, in part, to the fact that the PLL is not really usable for its intended purpose until the PLL <b>100</b> is locked. Traditionally, one technique that has been used to reduce the lock time has been to increase the loop gain. Once the loop gain exceeds a certain range, however, increasing the loop gain may increase the lock time, rather than reducing the lock time. In addition to increasing the lock time, very high loop gains often result in loop instability. If a PLL is unstable, the PLL will not lock and will not function properly. An example of instability in PLL occurs when the charge pump continuously overcompensates for the phase difference of the two input signals.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there is a need for a PLL having a relatively short lock time while maintaining stability of the PLL.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the present invention are directed toward, for example, providing a system and method of reducing the lock time of a phase locked loop (PLL). Certain details are set forth below to provide a sufficient understanding of the embodiments of the invention. However, it will be clear to one skilled in the art that various embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these particular details.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a functional block diagram of a PLL <b>300</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. Although the PLL <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a charge pump PLL, any type of PLL may be used. The PLL <b>300</b> includes a phase detector <b>310</b>, a charge pump <b>302</b>, a filter <b>304</b>, a voltage control oscillator <b>306</b>, an N divider circuit <b>308</b> and a delay circuit <b>340</b> connected to each other as shown. Most of the components of the PLL <b>300</b> are used in the PLL <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and they operate in the same manner. Therefore, in the interest of brevity, an explanation of their structure and function will not be repeated. The PLL <b>300</b> differs from the PLL <b>100</b> by placing a delay circuit <b>340</b> between the N divider circuit <b>308</b> and the phase detector <b>310</b> along the feedback path.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The delay circuit <b>340</b> has the effect of increasing the stability of the PLL <b>300</b> so that the gain can be increased to reduce lock time without making the PLL <b>300</b> unstable. The delay circuit <b>340</b> may be any type of delay circuit. In one embodiment, the amount of delay applied to the feedback clock signal <b>314</b> depends on the value of the loop gain. For example, as the loop gain increases, the amount of delay added to the feedback clock signal <b>314</b> also increases. The amount of delay may be defined relative to the external clock signal <b>312</b>. For example, the delay circuit <b>340</b> may delay the period of the feedback clock signal <b>314</b> along the feedback path <b>330</b> between about 20% and about 70% of the external clock signal <b>312</b>, such as between about 30% and about 60% of the external clock signal <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In other embodiments, the amount of delay applied to the feedback clock signal <b>314</b> may remain constant. For example, the delay may remain along the feedback path <b>330</b> even after the PLL <b>300</b> locks. If the amount of delay changes over time, the delay may change before or after the PLL <b>300</b> locks. Examples of the delay changing over time include the delay being added and/or removed from the feedback path <b>330</b>. In addition, the delay amount may be increased and/or decreased. The change to the delay may be gradual or immediate. In one embodiment, the delay may be removed or reduced after the PLL <b>300</b> has locked to reduce jitter. Typically, when the PLL <b>300</b> is locked, the two phases are very closely aligned but not identical. Therefore, as the variation of the static phase offset goes to zero, the jitter is reduced. Thus, the delay may be removed or reduced after the PLL is locked to reduce the static phase offset. This is done with the reduction of charge pump current to help ensure loop stability. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a schematic drawing for reducing the charge pump current. In this embodiment, the delay may be reduced or eliminated while reducing the loop gain. Switch <b>410</b> reduces the amount of current out of the capacitor, which reduces the voltage step. By reducing the voltage step, the charge pump current is reduced, and thus the loop gain is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, the loop gain is increased as the amount of delay is increased. Increasing the loop gain increases the bandwidth of the loop. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, one way to increase loop gain is to increase the charge pump current. Other ways of increasing the loop gain are within the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art, and will not be described herein in the interest of brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The delay circuit <b>340</b> may be located anywhere along the feedback path <b>330</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the delay circuit <b>340</b> after the N divider circuit <b>308</b>, however, the delay circuit <b>340</b> may be located before the N divider circuit <b>308</b>. Furthermore, if no N divider circuit <b>308</b> is provided in the feedback path <b>330</b> of the PLL <b>300</b>, the delay circuit <b>340</b> may be located at any location along the feedback path <b>330</b>. Similarly, if additional circuits are provided along the feedback path <b>330</b>, the delay circuit <b>340</b> may be located in any position relative to the additional circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One embodiment of the delay circuit <b>340</b> that may be used in the PLL <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown in the schematic illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. In both Figures delay circuits <b>340</b>A and <b>340</b>B include a bypass path, such as alternately closed switches <b>341</b>A, <b>342</b>B, which may be a transistor, relay or other device, for turning off and on the delay. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> switch <b>341</b>A is open and switch <b>342</b>A is closed to bypass the delay circuit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows the delay circuit <b>340</b>B with the switch <b>341</b>B closed and the switch <b>342</b>B open so that the delay is applied to the feedback clock signal <b>314</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) along the feedback path <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The simulated lock behavior of a PLL similar to the PLL <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, simulations were conducted on the PLL <b>300</b> without a delay and with a delay, respectively. In both simulations the relevant input parameters were the same, such as cycle time of the external clock and pump current. In addition, both simulated PLLs had very high loop gain. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> did not have a delay applied during the feedback path and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> had a 0.5 period delay relative to the external clock applied to the feedback clock signal along the feedback path. A 0.5 delay is a 180&#xb0; shift of the cycle time of the external clock. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows that the PLL without the delay circuit <b>340</b> cycled about 220 times before locking. In contrast, the diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows that the PLL with the delay circuit <b>340</b> cycled less than 20 times before locking. Therefore, the addition of the delay circuit significantly reduced the lock time of the PLL.</p>
