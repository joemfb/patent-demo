<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The semiconductor industry has experienced rapid growth due to continuous improvements in the integration density of a variety of electronic components (e.g., transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, etc.). For the most part, this improvement in integration density has come from repeated reductions in minimum feature size, which allows more components to be integrated into a given area. As the demand for even smaller electronic devices has grown recently, there has grown a need for low resistance structures such as interconnects to further improve the thermal performance of electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Semiconductor devices may include a variety of semiconductor structures such as transistors, capacitors, resistors and the like formed on a substrate. One or more conductive layers formed of a metal, metal alloy and the like are separated by dielectric layers. There may be a variety of interconnect structures formed between the conductive layers to interconnect the semiconductor structures, provide an electrical connection between a metal layer and its adjacent metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Carbon nanotubes have been employed to form low resistance interconnect structures. A carbon nanotube is a tube structure formed of carbon atoms. Carbon nanotubes are of a variety of unique properties such as high strength, high thermal conductivity, good electrical conductivity, good electro-migration and the like. Carbon nanotubes' electronic properties may vary with the differences in their structures. Carbon nanotubes may be of a metallic property or a semiconducting property depending on their physical parameters such as length, diameter and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">By selecting appropriate physical parameters such as diameters, carbon nanotubes can be a good conductive material. In particular, despite that a single carbon nanotube may be of a high resistance, a plurality of carbon nanotubes grown in parallel can achieve a resistance as low as copper. As such, carbon nanotubes can be a good material for interconnect structures because they can support high current densities. However, the interconnect structures formed by carbon nanotubes may be of high resistance due to a high resistance contact between the carbon nanotubes and their corresponding metal lines.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The making and using of the presently embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present disclosure provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the disclosure, and do not limit the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present disclosure will be described with respect to embodiments in a specific context, a semiconductor device having a carbon nanotube interconnect and a carbon layer between the carbon nanotube interconnect and its adjacent metal layer. The embodiments of the disclosure may also be applied, however, to a variety of structures of semiconductor devices. Hereinafter, various embodiments will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a cross sectional view of a semiconductor device in accordance with an embodiment. The semiconductor device includes a substrate <b>102</b>. A first metal line <b>112</b> is formed over the substrate <b>102</b>. A second metal line <b>116</b> is formed over the first metal line <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there may be a carbon nanotube interconnect structure <b>114</b> formed between the first metal line <b>112</b> and the second metal line <b>116</b>. In addition, there may be a first carbon layer <b>122</b> formed between the bottom of the interconnect structure <b>114</b> and the first metal line <b>112</b>. Likewise, there may be a second carbon layer <b>124</b> formed between the top surface of the interconnect structure <b>114</b> and the second metal line <b>116</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further illustrates the interconnect structure <b>114</b> is surrounded by a carbon ring and the second metal line <b>116</b> is partially surrounded by a carbon layer.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first dielectric layer <b>104</b> is formed over the substrate <b>102</b>. The first metal line <b>112</b> and the interconnect structure <b>114</b> are embedded in the first dielectric layer <b>104</b>. A cap layer <b>132</b> is deposited over the first dielectric layer <b>104</b>. A second dielectric layer <b>126</b> is formed over the cap layer <b>132</b>. The second metal line <b>116</b> is embedded in the second dielectric layer <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The substrate <b>102</b> may be formed of suitable semiconductor materials such as silicon, germanium, diamond, or the like. Alternatively, compound materials such as silicon germanium, silicon carbide, gallium arsenic, indium arsenide, indium phosphide, silicon germanium carbide, gallium arsenic phosphide, gallium indium phosphide, combinations of these, and the like, with other crystal orientations, may also be used. Additionally, the substrate <b>102</b> may comprise a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate.
