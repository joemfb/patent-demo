<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to an amplifier circuit, to an audio circuit, and to an electronic device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Amplifier circuits are generally known in the art and used, for example, to provide amplified signals to the loudspeakers of a headset. For example, amplifier circuits are known which can be connected to a headset via a three or four pole jacket and plug configuration. Between the signal outputs of the amplifier circuit and the headset, large value coupling capacitors are typically present. The large value coupling capacitors are expensive and occupy a relatively large area.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Amplifier circuits in which the need for the large value coupling capacitors is obviated are known. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the accompanying drawings, an amplifier circuit <b>10</b> as is known from the prior art is shown. The amplifier circuit <b>10</b> is connected to a headset <b>20</b> which comprises two loudspeakers <b>210</b>,<b>220</b> each with respective negative and positive contacts <b>211</b>,<b>212</b>;<b>221</b>,<b>222</b>. As shown the negative contacts <b>212</b>,<b>222</b> are both connected to the same common ground contact <b>202</b> and the positive contacts <b>211</b>,<b>221</b> are connected to separate signal contacts <b>200</b>,<b>201</b>. The amplifier circuit <b>10</b> has stereo channel inputs <b>100</b>,<b>101</b> at which a left channel signal and a right channel signal can respectively be received. At shown, the left channel input <b>100</b> is connected to an input <b>121</b> of a left channel amplifier <b>120</b>. The output <b>122</b> of the left channel amplifier <b>120</b> is connected to a left channel output contact <b>110</b> of the amplifier. The right channel input <b>101</b> is connected to an input <b>131</b> of a right channel amplifier <b>130</b>. The output <b>132</b> of the right channel amplifier <b>130</b> is connected to a right channel output contact <b>111</b> of the amplifier circuit <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2C</figref>, at the amplifier outputs <b>122</b>,<b>132</b>, amplified channel signals are outputted which have an amplitude proportional to the amplitude of the left channel signal and the right channel signal respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The left channel output contact <b>110</b> is connected to one signal contact <b>200</b> of the headset <b>20</b> and the right channel output contact <b>111</b> is connected to the other signal contact <b>201</b>. The amplifier circuit <b>10</b> further includes an operational amplifier <b>140</b> which is connected to a ground contact <b>112</b>. The ground contact <b>112</b> is connected to the common ground contact <b>202</b> of the headset <b>20</b>. The operational amplifier <b>140</b> provides a &#x201c;virtual&#x201d; ground voltage equal to the common mode of the left channel signal and the right channel signal. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, at the ground contact a constant voltage is outputted which is equal to the amplifier gain voltage VAG (short for virtual analog ground) set at the positive input of the operational amplifier. Typically, the amplifier gain voltage VAG is set to half the supply voltage Vcc.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, although the shown prior art circuit allows the use of a conventional headset with a three pole plug without requiring coupling capacitors between the amplifier circuit <b>10</b> and the headset <b>20</b>, a disadvantage of the prior art circuit is that the circuit <b>10</b> requires an accurate determination of the common mode in order to set amplifier gain voltage VAG. Furthermore, the circuit <b>10</b> consumes a relatively large amount of power and has a relatively large footprint because of the operational amplifier <b>140</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an example of an embodiment of an amplifier circuit <b>30</b> is shown therein. The amplifier circuit <b>30</b> may, as shown, include a first input <b>300</b> for receiving first input signal and a second input <b>301</b> for receiving a second signal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the amplifier circuit <b>30</b> may include a first amplifier section <b>32</b>, a second amplifier section <b>33</b>, as well as a common mode section <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following, the amplifier circuit <b>30</b> will be elucidated further using the example of a stereo audio signal which comprises a left channel signal which is to be outputted at a loudspeaker at a first side and a right channel signal which is to be outputted at a loudspeaker at a second side. The first input signal will be referred to as the left channel signal, the second input signal as the right channel signal, the first input will be referred to as the left channel input <b>300</b> and the second input will be referred to as the right channel input <b>301</b>. The first amplifier section <b>32</b> will be referred to as the left channel amplifier section <b>32</b> and the second amplifier section will be referred to as the right channel amplifier section <b>33</b>. However, it will be apparent that the amplifier circuit <b>30</b> may be used to amplify other types of signals.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The left channel amplifier section <b>32</b> may be connected to the left channel input <b>300</b> and the right channel input <b>301</b>. The left channel amplifier section <b>32</b> may generate a first combined signal based on a combination of the left channel signal L and the right channel signal R and output the first combined signal at a first output <b>310</b> connected to the left channel amplifier <b>32</b>. The right channel amplifier section <b>33</b> may be connected to the left channel input <b>300</b> and the right channel input <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The right channel amplifier section <b>33</b> may generate a second combined signal based on a combination of the left channel signal L and the right channel signal R and output the second combined signal at a second output <b>311</b> connected to the right channel amplifier <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The common mode section <b>34</b> may be connected to the left channel input and the right channel input. The common mode section <b>34</b> may generate a common mode signal based on a combination of the first signal and the second signal and output the common mode signal at a common output <b>312</b> connected to the common mode amplifier <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first combined signal and the common mode signal may satisfy the condition that combining the first combined signal and the common mode signal results in an amplified left channel signal with an amplitude proportional to the amplitude of the left channel input signal. The second combined signal and the common mode signal may satisfy the condition that combining the second combined signal and the common mode signal results in an amplified right channel signal with an amplitude proportional to the amplitude of the right channel input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, the (amplified) left and right channel signals may be obtained from the outputs <b>310</b>-<b>312</b> of the amplifier circuit <b>10</b>. Thereby, the need to provide a virtual ground and to provide an operational amplifier connected to the common mode output is obviated. Accordingly, the power consumption and size of the amplifier circuit <b>10</b> may be reduced. Furthermore, a good isolation between the right channel and left channel can be obtained. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the amplifier circuit <b>30</b> may be used with existing audio systems, e.g. headphones, for example those in which the loudspeakers are connected with a three wire cable and a three pole plug.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first combined signal s<sub>1 </sub>and the common mode signal s<sub>common </sub>may for example satisfy the mathematical relationship:
