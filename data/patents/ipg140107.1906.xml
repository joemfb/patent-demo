<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A spine disc prosthesis mimics a natural human spine disc through use of a structure that duplicates a natural Annulus Fibrosis of the disc to provide translation, extension, flexion, and axial support in like manner to a natural disc. The present spine disc prosthesis achieves this through the use of a first and second disk connected to one another via a flexible annulus fibrosis structure. The flexible annulus fibrosis structure or core is characterized by a plurality of compressible (pliant) strands that are affixed to and extend between the first and second disks. The strands are preferably, but not necessarily, situated on and extend about an outer perimeter of inside surfaces of the two end disks so as to mimic natural contours of an annulus fibrosis of a natural spinal disc. The strands may be formed by various types of biocompatible fibers, braids, cords, bundles or the like and may have a hollow core or a solid core (e.g. PEEK [polyetheretherketone] cores/core strands may also be used). The strands may be situated on the vertical, crossed or in other configurations. The end disks may be formed as to promote fusion with adjoining vertebrae when implanted. The end plate may also include a keel and/or installation structure to allow for implanting the spine disc prosthesis.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to spinal disc prostheses to replace a damaged, degenerated or otherwise defective spinal disc in a spinal column of a human.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The prior art is replete with various types of prosthetic or artificial spinal discs designed to replicate a spinal disc and thus replace a damaged, degenerated or otherwise defective spinal disc in a spinal column of a human. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,071,437 and 5,534,030 disclose spinal disc prostheses that are typical of the prior art. The discs disclosed in these US patents include a pair of rigid plates adhered to opposite surfaces of a body of elastomeric material. Many other variations have since been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disc prosthesis when in use is positioned between adjacent vertebrae. The rigid plates may have bone in-growth material for enabling bone to adhere or fuse to the rigid plates. The disc prosthesis is subject to forces that act in the spine including compression forces due to loads on the spine, shear forces due to bending of the spine, and torsion forces due to twisting of the spine. These application forces may cause disc component failure. For example, such application forces may cause the rigid plates to separate from the body of elastomeric material in the disc prostheses of the '437 and '030 patents. Such separation would be detrimental to the proper functioning of the disc prosthesis. Moreover, these application forces have a tendency to squeeze the elastomeric body out from between the two plates. This, again, is detrimental to the proper functioning of the disc prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When a visco-elastic material is used for the prosthetic disc body between two plates, the application forces and their attendant problems are especially true. Particularly, such spine application forces can compress a portion or more of a visco-elastic spinal disc prosthesis body from between the two plates thereof. Moreover, the application forces tend to rotate the disc body. Excess rotation can cause stress on the disc body. Such stress can lead to disc body failure in all types of prior art discs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is apparent from the above that prior art spinal disc prostheses fall short of providing a reliable artificial disc.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the above, it is desirable to provide spinal disc prostheses that alleviate the shortcomings of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Spine disc prostheses are presented that imitate the Annulus Fibrosis of a natural spine disc and so provide natural translation, extension, flexion and axial support within an artificial spine disc. The present spine disc prosthesis has first and second disks that are connected to one another via a flexible core. The flexible core is characterized by a plurality of compressible and/or flexible (pliant) strands extending between the upper and lower plates. The flexible core preferably, but not necessarily, extends from annular peripheries or perimeters of adjacent sides of the first and second disks in like relationship as the Annulus Fibrosis of a natural spine disc is to adjacent vertebrae of a spine. The strands may be formed as a mesh, a web, in rows, or in other configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one form, the pliant strands extend substantially perpendicular to the first and second disks. In another form, the pliant strands extend skew to the first and second disks. In this form, the pliant strands may be crisscrossed or skewed according to any number of manners or patterns. The strands are formed of a compressible and/or flexible, biocompatible material. Moreover, the strands forming the flexible core may all be of the same type or may consist of two or more types of strands as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The pliant strands are preferably, but not necessarily, situated on and extend from the periphery of an upper side of the second disk and a lower side of the first disk. In one form, the strands are situated in a single row about the disk geometry. The disk geometry preferably mimics natural contours of a human spinal disc. The strands may be formed by various types of biocompatible fibers, braids, cords, bundles or the like and may have a hollow core or a solid core. PEEK (polyetheretherketone) cores/core strands may also be used. The strands may be situated on the vertical, crossed or in other configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The end disks are preferably, but not necessarily, formed to promote fusion with adjoining vertebrae when implanted. In one form, the end disks have oval or annular frames supporting a grill or grillwork. Strands of the grillwork extend across the frame and provide openings that allow for fusion between the grillwork/frame and an adjacent vertebra when implanted. In another form, the end disks have plates shaped preferably, but not necessarily, like spine discs. Ports or openings in the end plates allow for fusion between the end plate and an adjacent vertebra when implanted. The ports, being for bone growth, may be either blind or blind with undercut. The end plate may also include a keel and/or installation structure to allow for implanting the spine disc prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In all cases, the spinal disc prostheses may be formed in various sizes as well as be sized for lateral introduction (implantation) into a spine.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present invention provides artificial or prosthetic spinal or spine discs (collectively, spinal disc prostheses) such as to replace damaged, degenerated, or otherwise defective or undesirable spinal discs in a spinal column of a human. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a spinal disc prosthesis, i.e. spinal disc <b>10</b>. The spinal disc <b>10</b> is fashioned from suitable biocompatible materials such as are known in the art. The disc <b>10</b> comprises a first end <b>12</b>, a second end <b>14</b> and a middle or core <b>16</b>. The nomenclature first and second is arbitrary. The first end <b>12</b> may be considered a first vertebral contacting portion while the second end <b>14</b> may be considered a second vertebral contacting portion. The core <b>16</b> may be considered an annulus fibrosis portion or hub of the spinal disc <b>10</b>. The first vertebral contacting portion <b>12</b>, the second vertebral contacting portion <b>14</b> and the core <b>16</b> simulates, duplicates or mimics a vertebral disc and especially the annulus fibrosis portion preferably, but not necessarily, without the nucleus pulposus (nucleus) of a disc. The first vertebral contacting portion <b>12</b> provides disc annulus fibrosis emulation and thus functions and/or provides for contact or abutment with a surface of a vertebra. The second vertebral contacting portion <b>14</b> provides disc core emulation and thus functions and/or provides for contact or abutment with a surface of an adjacent vertebra. The core <b>16</b> thus provides disc core emulation and thus functions and/or provides cushioning between the adjacent vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first vertebral contacting portion <b>12</b> is characterized by a preferably, but not necessarily, elliptical, oval or ovoid end, ring, frame, disk or body <b>20</b> defining an upper surface <b>21</b>, an inner surface <b>22</b> and a curved lower surface <b>23</b>. The elliptical body <b>20</b> supports and/or incorporates a grill, grillwork or grill structure <b>24</b> that allows for the disk top to fuse into an adjacent vertebral body (i.e. vertebra&#x2014;not shown). The grill structure <b>24</b> is formed of a plurality of rods <b>26</b>. The rods <b>26</b> extend between sides of the inner elliptical surface <b>22</b> of the ring <b>20</b> and therethrough (see, e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The second vertebral contacting portion <b>14</b> is characterized by a preferably, but not necessarily, elliptical, oval or ovoid end, ring, frame, disk or body <b>30</b> defining a lower surface <b>31</b>, an inner surface (not seen in the figures but like inner surface <b>22</b> of body <b>20</b>) and a curved upper surface <b>33</b>. The elliptical body <b>30</b> supports and/or incorporates a grill, grillwork or grill structure <b>34</b> (not seen in the figures but like grill structure <b>24</b> of the first end <b>12</b>) that allows for the disc top to fuse into an adjacent vertebral body (i.e. vertebra&#x2014;not shown). The grill structure is formed of a plurality of rods (not seen in the figures but like grill rods <b>26</b> of the grill structure <b>24</b> of the first end <b>12</b>). The rods extend between sides of the inner elliptical surface of the body <b>30</b> and therethrough (see, e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The middle, annulus fibrosis portion or core <b>16</b> has a plurality of strands, cords, braids, rope or the like (akin in one form to carpet strands) <b>36</b> that connect and extend between inner surfaces of the ends <b>12</b>, <b>24</b>. The end <b>12</b> or frame <b>20</b> has an elliptical opening <b>28</b>. In like manner, the end <b>14</b> or frame <b>30</b> has an elliptical opening <b>38</b>. The strands <b>36</b> extend about an inner periphery or diameter of the first and second rings <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> of the first and second ends <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the strands <b>36</b> are preferably formed of twisted filaments, fibers or individual smaller strands <b>38</b> of the same. The number of strands and their thickness may be varied, both relative to other sizes of discs <b>10</b> or with respect to other strands of the same disc <b>10</b>. The strands <b>36</b> function and/or act like a natural disc. Various exemplary strands are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-J</figref> encompassing strand portions <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>900</b>, <b>1000</b> and <b>1100</b>.</p>
