<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In embodiments of the present invention, improved capabilities are described for powering, controlling, and operating a home audio visual system using a mesh network that includes an energy savings mode based at least in part on intermittently powered mesh network nodes that are associated with the home audio-visual system. In embodiments, the intermittently powered mesh network nodes may periodically wake up, listen for wake up calls and/or initiate a full power mode in the home audio visual system when a intermittently power mesh network node is awakened and receives a subsequent full power instruction. Intermittently powered mesh network nodes may be further associated with instruction routing that utilizes silent acknowledgement.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention herein disclosed generally refers to wireless networks, and specifically to methods and systems used at least in part to operate audio-visual equipment in an energy savings mode.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Wireless communication networks have limitations when used for building automation. Structural barriers that deflect or cause the radio frequency signals of wireless networks can prevent timely transmission on the network. Introduction of noise sources from other radio frequency sources contribute to a reduction in quality and reliability. However, wiring building automation devices is very costly and intrusive, while severely limiting in flexibility and expandability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore there exists a need for a robust communication network for building automation that overcomes the problems associated with wireless networks without the high costs and inconvenience of wired networks.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present invention relates to a reliable and low-cost control and monitoring technology which enables embedded intelligence and wireless communication for a variety of residential and light commercial applications such as lighting and appliance control, automated meter reading, thermostat and ventilation control, security, and residential gateway connectivity. In embodiments, a mesh network node may transform any stand-alone device into an intelligent networked device that may be controlled and monitored wirelessly. The mesh network delivers high reliability networking at a fraction of the cost of other technologies by focusing on narrow bandwidth applications and substituting costly hardware with innovative software solutions such as frame acknowledgement, retransmission, collision avoidance, frame checksum, and sophisticated routing algorithms to assure full home coverage.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">One of the key features of the mesh network technology is the routing capability of all the nodes in the network. The mesh network automatically routes the signal from one node to the next thereby extending the range. Rather than depending solely on line-of-sight communications like other technologies, the mesh network is able to get around obstacles by routing commands through other device-nodes in the network when required. The mesh network technology also minimizes noise and distortion problems caused by architectural obstacles and radio dead spots using innovative transmission techniques such as 2-way acknowledgement and alternative route seeking.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a mesh network <b>100</b> which includes a number of network nodes. The user may command a light associated with Node<b>1</b> <b>100</b>A in a garage to turn off from Node<b>4</b> <b>100</b>F in a master bedroom. If the direct transmission to Node<b>1</b> <b>100</b>A is blocked by some Radio Frequency (RF) obstruction <b>102</b> (e.g. a stainless steel refrigerator in a kitchen) Node<b>4</b> <b>100</b>F automatically selects an alternate route, such as through Node<b>3</b> <b>100</b>C (e.g. a thermostat in a hallway), rerouting as many times as is necessary to complete delivery of a command. An acknowledgement is then sent back to Node<b>4</b> <b>100</b>F confirming that the command has been executed by Node<b>1</b> <b>100</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The mesh network infrastructure is decentralized, with nodes running as both client and as repeater to avoid central points of failure and control. Every new component that is added to the network increases path redundancy and reliability, with the degree of redundancy and signal strength increasing as a function of node density. If the distance between nodes is decreased by a factor of two, the resulting signal is at least four times more powerful at the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A mesh network is also self-organizing and doesn't require manual configuration. Because of this, adding new equipment or relocating existing equipment may be as simple as plugging it in and turning it on. The network discovers the new node and may automatically incorporate it into the existing system. The mesh network technology may provide vastly improved area coverage and reliability with virtually unlimited range.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, mesh network software <b>200</b> may be designed on polling of functions, command complete callback function calls, and delayed function calls. Software <b>200</b> may be split into two groups of program modules: basis software and application software. Basis software may include system startup code, low-level poll function <b>222</b>, main poll loop <b>202</b>, protocol layers <b>204</b>, and memory and timer <b>224</b> service functions. Application software may include application hardware initialization <b>210</b> and software initialization <b>212</b> functions, application state machine <b>214</b>, command complete callback functions <b>218</b>, and a received command handler <b>220</b> function. The application software may also include hardware drivers.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Main loop <b>202</b> may call a list of protocol functions. Functions may be designed to return to the caller as fast as possible to allow the Central Processing Unit (CPU) to do other tasks. It is possible to receive data, transfer data via the Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit (UART) and check user-activated buttons simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the application layer <b>208</b> requests a transmission of data to another node in network <b>100</b>, the protocol layer may add a frame header and a checksum to the data before transmission. The protocol layer may also handle frame retransmissions, as well as routing of frames through repeater nodes to nodes that are not within direct RF reach. When the frame transmission is completed an application specified transmit complete callback function <b>218</b> may be called. The transmission complete callback function <b>218</b> may include a parameter that indicates the transmission result.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Application layer <b>208</b> may provide the interface to the communications environment which is used by the application process. The application software may consist of the following functions: the hardware initialization function <b>210</b>, software initialization function <b>212</b>, application state machine <b>214</b>, command complete callback functions <b>218</b>, and a receive command handler function <b>220</b>. The application implements communication on the application level with other nodes in network <b>100</b>. At the application level may be a framework defined of device and command classes to obtain interoperability between mesh network enabled products from different vendors. The basic structure of these commands may provide the capability to set parameters in a node and to request parameters from a node responding with a report containing the requested parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Wireless communication is by nature unreliable because a well defined coverage area simply does not exist since propagation characteristics are dynamic and unpredictable. The mesh network protocol may minimize noise and distortion problems by using a transmission mechanism that may include two re-transmissions to ensure reliable communication. In addition, single casts are acknowledged by a receiving node so the application is notified about how the transmission went.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show examples of this type of re-transmission hand shaking. The mesh network protocol may be designed to trade low latency at the expense of handling simultaneously communication to a number of nodes in the network. To obtain this the number of random backoff values is limited to 4 (0, 1, 2, and 3).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows how simultaneous communication to even a small number of nodes <b>100</b> may block the communication completely. Simultaneous communication to nodes in the network which require a response from the nodes in question should therefore be avoided in the application.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">From a protocol point of view there may be many different types of nodes, for example: Control nodes, Static Controller nodes, Installer Controller nodes, Controller bridge nodes, Slave nodes, Routing Slave nodes, and Enhanced Slave nodes. Controller nodes may store information about other nodes in the network. The node information includes the nodes each of the nodes can communication with (routing information). The Installation node may present itself as a Controller node, which may include extra functionality to help a professional installer setup, configure, and troubleshoot a network. The Controller bridge node may store information about the nodes in the network and in addition it may generate Virtual Slave nodes. A virtual Slave node is a node residing on another network accessible through the bridge.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A network may consist of slaves, a primary controller, and secondary controllers. New nodes may be added and removed to or from the network by using the primary controller. This may cause secondary controllers and routing slaves to malfunction if, for instance, a preferred repeater node is removed. Without automatic network updating a new replication has to be made from the primary controller to all secondary controllers, routing slaves should also be manually updated with the changes. In networks with several controller and routing slave nodes, this could cause difficulties the process is not automated. To automate the process, an automatic network update scheme may be included in the network protocol. To use this scheme a static controller could be available in the network. This static controller may be dedicated to hold a copy of the network topology and the latest changes that have occurred to the network. The static controller used in the automatic update scheme is called the Static Update Controller (SUC).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Each time a node is added, deleted or a routing change occurs, the primary controller may send the node information to the SUC. Secondary controllers may then ask the SUC if any updates are pending. The SUC may then in turn respond with any changes since last time this controller asked for updates. On the controller requesting an update may be called to notify the application that a new node may have been added or removed in the network. The SUC may hold a large number of changes of the network. If a secondary controller requests an updated after more than the maximum changes occurred, then it may not get updates and the request may fail. In this situation a manual replication from the primary controller may be necessary to update information on the secondary controller. Routing slaves may have the ability to request updates for its known destination nodes. If any changes have occurred to the network, the SUC may send updated route information for the destination nodes to the Routing slave that requested the update. The Routing slave application may be notified when the process is done, but may not get information about changes to its routes. Routing slaves may have the ability to request updates for its known destination nodes. If any changes have occurred to the network, the SUC may send updated route information for the designation nodes to the Routing slave that requested the update. The Routing slave application may be notified when the process is done.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A network can optionally have a SUC with enabled node ID server functionality (SIS). The SIS enables other controllers to include/exclude nodes in the network on its behalf. This makes it easier to install complex networks because multiple controllers support inclusion of nodes instead of one dedicated primary controller.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The SIS is the primary controller in the network and it has the latest update of the network topology and capability to include/exclude nodes in the network. Further, it is safer to keep the latest network topology on the SIS (static controller) than a portable primary controller used extensively during network installation. In embodiments, a network may contain only one SIS. A primary controller can instruct a SUC to enable the node ID server functionality (SIS). In case the SUC is primary then the SUC application can enable the node ID server functionality locally.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When including additional controllers to a network containing a SIS they may become inclusion controllers and as such they may obtain the capability to include/exclude nodes in the network on behalf of the SIS. Both portable and static controllers can be inclusion controllers. The inclusion controller's network topology data may be dated from last time a node was included or the last time it requested a network update from the SIS and therefore it may not be classified as a primary controller.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows an inclusion controller <b>510</b> used to include a new slave node <b>520</b> on behalf of an SIS <b>530</b>. Inclusion controller <b>510</b> performing the inclusion may first request the latest network topology changes <b>540</b> and a free node ID <b>550</b> from SIS <b>530</b>. Inclusion controller <b>510</b> may receive node information and range information <b>560</b> from newly included slave <b>520</b> and may forward such information <b>570</b> onto SIS <b>530</b>. In embodiments, inclusion controller <b>510</b> may be within direct range of the node to include.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A failing node may be replaced with a node inheriting the node ID from the failed node. Thereby the user avoids updating nodes having associations to the failed node. Associations within the failed node may be re-established in the new node.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Software components of a system according to the present invention may allow a routing slave to extend to a particular number of destinations (e.g. five) having return routes in very low latency applications. In embodiments a routing slave may need to support more than the particular number of destinations and this may require the controller to support favoring return routes for destinations out of direct range with the routing slave. In embodiments, software components may enable a controller to determine if two nodes are within direct range. A routing slave can request new return route destinations from the SUC/SIS node in case the available return routes fails. Furthermore the routing slave can check if a node ID is within direct range in any of the existing return routes.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A software component may be used to cancel ongoing routing attempts. This software component can be used to abort a transmission to a malfunctioning node, thereby eliminating a large amount of routing attempts in a large network.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The software components of a mesh network controller may be split into the controller application and the controller basis software, which may include the mesh network protocol layers and control of the various data stored into memory. Controller nodes may include an external memory in which the application data area may be placed. The controller node may have a unique home ID number assigned, which may be stored in the basis area of memory. When the new slave nodes are registered to the mesh network, the controller node may assign the home ID and a unique node ID to the slave node. The slave node may store the home ID and the node ID. When a controller is primary, it may send any network changes from the SUC node. The use of macros while developing application software may allow adjustments to the interface without changing the application source files.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The software components of a mesh network static controller node may be split into a static controller application and the static controller basis software, which may include the mesh network protocol layers and control of the various data stored into memory. The difference between the Static Controller Node and the Controller Node is that the static controller may not be powered down, that is it may not be used for battery-operated devices. The static controller may have the ability to look for neighbors when requested by a controller. This ability may make it possible for a primary controller to assign static routes from a routing slave to a static controller. The static controller may be set as a SUC node, so it may send network topology updates to any requesting secondary controller. A secondary static controller not functioning as SUC may also request network topology updates.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The software components of a mesh network installer controller may be split into an installer controller application and static controller basis software, which includes the mesh network protocol layer. The installer controller may be a mesh network controller node, which incorporates extra functionality that may be used to implement controllers especially targeted towards professional installers who support and setup a large number of networks.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The software components of a mesh network controller bridge node may be split into a controller bridge application and basis software, which may include the mesh network protocol layer. The controller bridge node may be a mesh network static controller node, which incorporates extra functionality targeted for bridging between the mesh network and other networks.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The software components of a mesh network slave node may be split into a slave application and basis software, which may include the mesh network protocol layer. Slave nodes may have a block of memory reserved for storing data, and may have limited direct access to the block. The home ID and node ID of a new node may be zero. When registering a slave node to a mesh network the slave node may receive home and node ID from the networks primary controller node. These ID's may be stored in the basis data area in memory. The slave may send unsolicited broadcasts and non-routed singlecasts. Further it may be able to respond with a routed singlecast (response route) in case another node has requested this by sending a routed singlecast to it. A received multicast or broadcast may result in a response route without routing.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows how the software components of a mesh network routing slave node may be split into a slave application and basis software, which may include the mesh network protocol layer. Routing slave nodes have a block of memory reserved for storing data, and may have limited direct access to the block. The mesh network basis software may reserve the first part of this area, and the last part of the area may be reserved for the application data. The home ID and node ID of a new node may be zero. When registering a slave node to a mesh network the slave node may receive home and node ID from the network's primary controller node. These ID's may be stored in the mesh network basis data area in memory. The routing slave may send unsolicited broadcasts and single casts (routed or non-routed). Further it may respond with a routed singlecast (response route) in case another node has requested this by sending a routed singlecast to it. A received multicast or broadcast results in a response route without routing.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows how the enhanced slave node may have the same basic functionality as a routing slave node, but because it may have more features on the hardware, more software components may be available.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">An internal ring oscillator is used as a base for a wake up timer. The oscillator has a very low power consumption but is highly dependant on temperature, supply voltage and process variation. In order to compensate for the high variation a calibration circuit is built into the chip. The calibration circuit measures the oscillation frequency against the system clock and derives a calibration constant. As the ring oscillator runs at several kHz the calibration is as fast compared to wake up period. The calibration is performed automatically before entering WUT mode (wake up timer mode).</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a transceiver <b>802</b> may be able to transmit and receive Manchester coded data 9.6 kbits. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the invention communicating NRZ coded data at approximately 40 kb/s. RF transceiver <b>802</b> may handle all the RF related functions such as Manchester encoding/decoding <b>900</b>, pre-ample detection and serialization/deserialization. The output power of the transmitter Power Amplifier <b>902</b> may be adjustable in steps of 2 dB. The different parts of the RF transceiver <b>802</b> may be powered up and down so only the required circuits may be powered at a time. The RF transceiver <b>802</b> may only need external components for input and output matching. A block diagram of the Transceiver <b>802</b> including RF modem <b>842</b> is given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Transceiver <b>802</b> includes multiple parallel receive demodulators, each for detecting a different received communication signal frequency, enabling the single chip embodiment to operate in an environment with a plurality of communication signal frequencies as may occur in networks of current and older technology devices, and/or different types of devices. The multiple demodulators are configured to receive output signals from RF transceiver <b>802</b> interface, allowing the first demodulator that detects a valid signal to take control, thus transparently receiving a signal at any of a plurality of supported data rates, without prior negotiation with an external device. No communication overhead results from supporting multiple receive data frequencies, allowing fast reception of unsolicited transmissions from unknown sources.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">An auto-speed receiver may include feeding the output of one radio front-end to multiple demodulators, each for a different data rate, and then allowing the first demodulator detecting a valid signal to take control, thus transparently receiving a signal at any of the supported data rates without prior negotiation. This results in benefits including no overhead from using multiple data rates, and fast reception of unsolicited transmissions from unknown source without overhead of data rate negotiation.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The solution provides seamless installation of nodes only supporting multi-speed nodes (e.g. 9.6 kbps and 9.6/40 kbps) in the same network. The transceiver <b>802</b> is used to detect speed (e.g. 9.6/40 kbps) of the frames received to make a speed independent receiver. In embodiments, an optimal speed (e.g. fastest speed) to the destination node may be known (e.g. through testing and storing of information in association with a routing table) and a transmitting node may transmit at the optimal speed.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The transmitter side may use a method where the highest known speed that can be used to reach the end destination will be used. In embodiments, a controller may send a multicast frame using the optimal speed. For example, if a transmitter knows all destination nodes of a multicast frame supports 40 kbps, the transmitter will transmit the multicast at 40 kps. As a further example, to ensure all nodes within direct range of a transmitter receive a broadcast frame, a transmitter will send a the broadcast frame at 9.6 kbps</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A transmitting controller may select a specific route of nodes for a single cast or a routed single cast frame based on the route comprising only nodes which support a preferred transmission speed. For example, if a transmission controller can determine a route of nodes in which all the nodes support 40 kbps, the controller may select this route for a routed single cast frame. Alternatively if such a route cannot be determined, the controller will transmit at the optimal speed for any route. Continuing the example of above, in such a route the controller would transmit a single cast or routed single cast frame at 9.6 kbps.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Likewise the controller may try to achieve the highest possible speed when assigning return routes to a routing slave. Since a routing slave may store the speed for each route to a destination, a routing slave can have a mixed set of stored speeds (e.g. 40 kbps and 9.6 kbps) for routes to each destination.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A node information frame or a transfer presentation frame may be sent out at a low speed (for example 9.6 kbps) to allow nodes that support only the low speed, or nodes that support a plurality of speeds, to be included/excluded by the controller.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In embodiments, channel selection may be dynamically performed locally on each node without need of distributing network information, nor requiring user intervention. Dynamic channel selection may not require additional installation steps. The dynamic nature may also enable the network to maximize the usage of free communications slots on the available channels. The nodes in the network may listen on the available channels based at least in part on a predefined algorithm (e.g., limited to round robin). A node may select a next communication channel, and stay on each selected channel for a predefined duration. The node may stay on the selected communication channel and receive messages. Once the node is ready to receive new frames, it may once again select a next communication channel and repeat the process.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In embodiments, a communication channel may have multi-speed capabilities within a single carrier frequency, and/or it may have multi-speed capabilities across multiple carrier frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In embodiments, a node in a mesh network may be used to perceive a plurality of channels within a mesh network. A node may select a first channel from the plurality of channels within the mesh network and remain on the first channel for a predefined duration. If during the predefined duration, a signal is not detected, the node may select a second channel and remain on the second channel for predefined duration in order to detect a signal. If during the predefined duration of remaining on the first channel a signal is detected, the node may remain on that channel beyond the predefined duration in order to receive a message. The node may then select a second channel once the message on the first channel is received. This process of channel selection may include a plurality of nodes and or a plurality of channels within a mesh network.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">An aspect of the present invention relates to a portable node (e.g. portable mesh node) where the portable node may be associated with a user interface or other device. The portable node may be similar to other nodes as described herein and it may communicate to and from the network either directly to a master controller or through other nodes in the mesh network. The portable node may be discoverable as other nodes are discoverable. For example, the portable node may be located by other nodes sending &#x2018;find&#x2019; requests to the portable node. Once the portable node receives a find request, it may respond and a communication link and hand-offs to other nodes in the network may then be completed. In other embodiments, the portable node may be programmed to send &#x2018;find&#x2019; identifiers periodically. For example, the portable node may send a data packet to all nodes in the area (i.e. within its range) and the nearby nodes may identify that they can communicate with the portable node. In other embodiments, the surrounding nodes may be used to physically locate the portable node through triangulation techniques or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Software components of a system according to the present invention may involve interfacing with or otherwise controlling streaming data within a network. For example, a user interface may be associated with the portable node and it may be adapted to scan through a set of entertainment titles (e.g. music titles, video titles, movie titles) to select a title to play on an entertainment device (e.g. audio/video equipment) controlled by another node in the network. The entertainment system may provide functionality similar to known high end mp3 players for example. In embodiments, an entertainment device may be a television, a signal conversion device, a DVR, a networked device, a UPnP networked device, a satellite receiver, a cable converter, a VCR, a digital video disc player, a video accessory, an audio amplifier, an audio tuner, an audio amplifier-tuner combination, a CD player, a DVD player, a high definition DVD player, an audio cassette player, a digital audio tape player, an audio equipment, an equalizer, a phonograph player, a video component, a streaming media player, an mp3 player, an audio file player, and audio component, an audio-visual component, or some other entertainment device.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In embodiments, information relating to entertainment devices and/or entertainment media may be distributed through a mesh network in a data structure.

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In embodiments, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, a media server <b>3000</b> may provide entertainment content (e.g., video, song, image, etc.) and may provide the content to a media renderer <b>3002</b>. A media renderer <b>3002</b> may be capable of rendering entertainment content provided by a media server <b>3000</b>. A media renderer <b>3002</b> may be identified with an endpoint identifier that is unique to a media renderer <b>3002</b>. A control point <b>3004</b> may coordinate the operation of a media server and media renderer <b>3002</b>. For example, through a control point, an end-user may be able to select what they want to view and/or hear, and where they want to hear and/or view it. Content that is available on a media server <b>3000</b> may be accessed through a control point's <b>3004</b> content directory functionality. This directory may comprise a hierarchical organization of content categories in which a superhierarchy is &#x201c;Music,&#x201d; a sub-category within Music is &#x201c;Artist,&#x201d; a sub-category within Artist is &#x201c;Album 1,&#x201d; and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In embodiments, to cite one example among many potential embodiments, a media server <b>3000</b>, media renderer <b>3002</b>, and control point <b>3004</b> combination may be used to control a home audio visual system such as one including a compact disc player <b>3100</b>, DVD player <b>3102</b> and a projection screen <b>3104</b>. In this home audio-visual example, a remote controller <b>3108</b> may be used to communicate with a plurality of control points <b>3004</b>, each of which is associated with a device within the audio-visual system. For example, the remote controller <b>3108</b> may communicate with a control point <b>3004</b> associated with a compact disc player <b>3100</b>. The compact disc player <b>3100</b> may relay data to a media server <b>3000</b> that, in turn, relays the data to the media renderer <b>3002</b> and on to the control point <b>3004</b>. Similarly, a DVD player <b>3102</b> and screen <b>3104</b> may be controlled by a remote controller using a media server <b>3000</b>, media renderer <b>3002</b>, and control point <b>3004</b> combination.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In embodiments, the portable node may be associated with a user interface for controlling other aspects of the entertainment system. For example, a user may be able to control output channels, input channels, volume, pitch, balance, treble, bass, brightness, sharpness, HDTV functions and the like. A portable node with a user interface may be adapted as a controller/receiver for other devices, sensors and the like in the network.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">A Subscriber Identity/Information Module (SIM) may uniquely identify a connected mobile device and permit a mobile communication device to interface with a mesh network. A SIM card may also provide configurable storage for additional information related to a subscriber. As an example, a SIM card may provide storage for subscriber personal information such as address books, preferences, telephone numbers, network passwords, and such other information that may be beneficial or useful for a mobile user for accessing a wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Additionally, the SIM may facilitate accessing a mobile network. In an example, the SIM may contain unique information that a GSM mobile device network may detect when the SIM is installed in a GSM compatible phone and operated in a GSM network coverage area. Therefore when a mobile communication device, such as a mobile phone, is operating with a SIM in the range of a wireless network, such as a wireless mesh network, the mobile device may be detected by the network. In this way a SIM may facilitate making a mobile or portable device discoverable by a mesh network. Additionally, subscriber and/or network node identification information on the SIM may be used in an authentication process prior to allowing the mobile phone to join the wireless mesh network.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In embodiments, a mobile communication device equipped with a SIM card may facilitate a user of the mobile device gaining authorized access to a mesh network and further access facilities on the mesh network. For example, an authenticated user of a mobile device on a mesh network may download to the configurable memory of the SIM a list of movies stored on a digital video recorder connected to the network. The mobile device may then use the downloaded list along with display format information stored in the SIM to display the list in a user interface on the mobile device display. In another example, the user may upload digital content such as photos or a video on the mobile device (e.g. a camera phone with video capability) to a home entertainment system for presentation to a user viewing the display of the home entertainment system. Such an example may be used by an international traveler wishing to show images from their travels, or an Emergency Medical Technician providing images of an emergency patient in the field to an emergency room doctor.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Because a SIM may provide both access to a wireless network and may provide authentication for access to a mesh network, a SIM based mobile device, such as a cell phone, may be used to access the facilities of a mesh network from a location that may be far outside the range of nodes on the wireless mesh network by accessing the mesh network through a portal from the mesh network to the cell phone network.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">A portable or mobile node may be discoverable through information contained in the SIM, as other nodes are discoverable. For example, the portable node may be located by other nodes sending &#x2018;find&#x2019; requests to the portable node. Once the portable node configured with a SIM card receives a find request, it may respond and a communication link that hand-offs to other nodes in the network may then be completed. In other embodiments, the SIM card may include configured storage information that directs the mobile device or portable node to send &#x2018;find&#x2019; identifiers periodically. For example, the mobile device may send a broadcast type data packet such that the nearby nodes that receive the data may identify that they can communicate with the SIM based mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">An aspect of the present invention relates to streaming data (e.g. entertainment data) through the mesh network. Streaming data may be adapted such that control frames can be transmitted over the mesh network while streaming data is transmitted. In embodiments, a software component supporting streaming data may include a minimum delay of 35 ms after each frame carrying streaming data for example.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In embodiments, streaming data is preferably performed at a high transmission rate (e.g. a 40 kbps transmission rate). A controller streaming the data may determine and select the optimal speed, preferably high speed (e.g. 40 kbps, or the highest speed available), for the stream transmission. Depending on the network topology, a slave may not check communication speed of routed streaming data, and therefore the controller may preferably select a low speed (for example 9.6 kbps) for a routed data stream. In embodiments, a master controller and/or the nodes in the mesh network that are handling the streaming information may select the highest speed path available for transmission of the streaming data. For example, the streaming data may reach a node and the node may have the ability to pass the information to anyone of a plurality of nodes because the plurality is in range. The node may determine that one of the plurality is a high speed node and select that node for receiving the next data transmission. Once a high speed path from source to ultimate receiver is determined, the routing information for the high speed path may be saved and used for later transmissions requiring high speed transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In embodiments, a number of methods and systems may be used for large data file transmission. For example, large data files, such as text files, audio files, video files, and like, may be transferred in a single block of data for an end-processing element to utilize when a transfer is complete. A large file may also be transferred in such a way that the end-processing element buffers the incoming data, and after a short delay, begins to utilize the data before the transfer is complete. A large data file may also be transferred in such a way that the data is sent to the user in real-time, or near real-time.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Transferring a large data file, which may not be used immediately by the end-processing element, may be transferred as a single block of data. An example of this may be a television guide that is distributed to end-processing elements once a day for subsequent use. The lack of immediacy of this task may allow the sending unit to schedule the transfer when bandwidth is available, transfer the data with or without data compression, and data may only need to be stored, reducing processing requirements. This method of transferring a large data file may be the least burdensome for the processing elements, but may not be the best choice for large data files that may require immediate action, such as real-time audio and video files.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In embodiments, a large data file may be transferred for immediate use based at least in part on buffering the data at the receiving end of the transfer. This method is often referred to as progressive downloading or pseudo-streaming, and may not be fundamentally different from other methods for transferring data for subsequent use. As a result, the same data transfer protocols that the sending processing element uses for small data transfers may be utilized for progressive downloading. The data file may also be retained after transfer to the end-processing element. One addition to the end-processing element, in order to aid in the immediate use of the data by the user, is the addition of a data-buffering layer between the input from the source and the output to the user. As long as the available bandwidth during data transfer between processing elements is not less than the required data rate to the user, the user may not be aware that the data transfer is still ongoing while the initial data is being used. When available bandwidth during transfer is predicted to be less than that of the user, data compression may be employed to reduce the throughput requirement. Data compression rates may vary from low, for lossless data compression schemes, through high, for lossy data compression schemes. In general, the receiving data buffer may also be expanded as an alternative to the need for lossy data compression. This method generally maintains a high quality of file transfer, while allowing the user to begin using a file prior to it's completed download.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Another method for transferring a large data file for immediate use may involve the real-time transfer of data between the source and the user. This method is often referred to as streaming data. The process of transferring data in real-time may require unique data transfer protocols from those used in non-real-time file transfers. Data transferred in real-time may have to conform to predetermined data transfer rates. Audio and video are both examples where the real-time data rates are predetermined. In addition, when these predetermined data rates cannot be met by the source, data may have to be sacrificed in order to maintain the real-time data steam rate. For example, lossy data compression rates may have to be varied as bandwidth in the transfer medium becomes reduced. The increased data compression rates may reduce the quality of the real-time data, such as reduced quality audio or and increased graininess of a video file output. Another example may be the dropping of short portions of an audio stream, the reduction of the size of a video output, or the momentary freezing of a web-cast. These issues with streaming may be offset by the advantages of being able to skip around in a video file without waiting for a download to complete, or having the ability to monitor a scene real-time. In addition, since the data rates are known, being either predetermined or through communication between the send and receive processing elements, the sending processor element may be able to more effectively utilize available bandwidth. The end-processor element may also have no need to store the data it is receiving, and so memory storage may be reduced. This method is generally utilized when real-time data is a higher priority than the quality of the data transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">RF transceiver <b>802</b> benefits with improved sensitivity by employing a demodulator correlation function. The demodulator detects the frequency of the FSK input signal by counting clock pulses between zero-crosses. In order to separate the two input frequencies an average filter is run on the input signal. The DC is subtracted from the input signal and the result is sampled into a delay chain of registers. The demodulator then correlates this signal history to the pattern of the known NRZ/Manchester symbols. For NRZ the correlation value is computed as the sum of the sampled input signal over one NRZ bit period. For Manchester the correlation value is computed at the sum of the first half Manchester bit period minus the sum of the second half bit period. The bit slicing is performed by checking the sign of the correlation function at the rising edge of the recovered clock. This results in improved sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In embodiments, a demodulator, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, may be designed so that it can detect Manchester (MCH) code at 9.6 kbit/s <b>2902</b> and NRZ code at 40 kbit/s <b>2904</b> and 100 kbps <b>2908</b>. It may be set in three different modes: (i) to detect and receive only MCH data (9.6 kbit/s) <b>2902</b>; (ii) to detect and receive only NRZ data (40 kbit/s) <b>2904</b>; or to detect and receive only NRZ data (100 kbit/s) <b>2908</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In embodiments, when a demodulator is in an auto mode, both MCH and NRZ data may be detected. Once a frame is detected as either MCH or NRZ, the demodulator may switch to this mode and start receiving data in an auto mode. In the auto mode the demodulator must listen for Manchester (MCH) code at 9.6 kbit/s <b>2902</b> and NRZ code at 40 kbit/s <b>2904</b> and 100 kbps <b>2908</b>. In order to do this the demodulator may contain three detectors, one for MCH and two for NRZ. However some part of the demodulator may be common for both detectors, such as the IF detection <b>2900</b>, filtering <b>2900</b>, and the control of the demodulator <b>2910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">RF communication error detection may be improved by the use of CRC <b>16</b>, or other similar robust error detection techniques, on elements of the communication signal including Z-wave frames.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, transceiver <b>802</b> may transmit using a modulation frequency that is asymmetrical to a reference carrier/local oscillator frequency, resulting in a transmit frequency that is not supported by the reference frequency synthesizer.

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a waveform diagram representing selection of asymmetric modulation, if offset control <b>910</b> is set at its center frequency <b>920</b> during settling of PLL <b>930</b>, modulation <b>940</b> will go to both sides of PLL <b>930</b> frequency.

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, if offset control <b>910</b> is set at the zero symbol setting <b>950</b> during settling of PLL <b>930</b> then modulation <b>940</b> will only go to an upper side of PLL <b>930</b> frequency.

Benefits of asymmetric modulation include the ability to transmit on a frequency not supported by the frequency synthesizer.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">RF transceiver <b>802</b> may include a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) which may be synchronized while the system is powering up. Such synchronization may reduce locking time, afford faster RF turn-on, and lower power consumption</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">PLL divider synchronization at start-up to reduces locking time. The VCO frequency is divided by a circuit denoted as the PLL divider, into a signal that matches a well defined reference signal. The reference signal is generated from the system clock and can be optionally 100 kHz or 200 kHz. During calibration, the center frequency of a Voltage Controlled Oscillator is adjusted so that the divided frequency after calibration is very close to the reference frequency. After calibration a PLL fine-tunes the divided VCO signal so that it locks completely onto the reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In order to minimize VCO lock settling time, the PLL and the reference signal are disabled and then released simultaneously after calibration. The result of simultaneous release is a synchronization action where both signals start at the beginning of their high period. The synchronization between the signals minimizes the PLL settling time, resulting in faster turn-on of radio, and lower power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">RF transceiver <b>802</b> includes an RF transmitter including a transmitter digital to analog converter which delivers the benefit of reduced cost. The transmitter chain contains a D/A converter which has two functions. The first is to convert the digital encoded bit symbols to analog signals, and the second is to set the transmission power of the transmitted RF signal, since the D/A converter is followed by a fixed gain PA amplifier. The D/A converter is a digital symbol to sine-voltage converter. Each output voltage of the D/A is a discrete step on a sine-curve which is selected by the digital value on the input. A thermometer coded signal is applied, and each value of the input signal selects a step on the sine wave. Counting from 0 to 31 and back again is therefore generating a full sine-period. The advantage of having sine-sized D/A steps is, that a low number of control-bits can generate a high resolution sine-wave. Further more, the amplitude of the sine-wave is controllable, which means, that the transmission strength of the RF signal is set in the D/A.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, VCO frequency calibration ensures that an analogue control voltage <b>9110</b> input to VCO <b>9120</b> is preferably within a narrow range and compensates for variation of on-chip capacitance which affects VCO <b>9120</b>. During calibration, PLL loop filter <b>9130</b> is opened and Cal block <b>9140</b> sets VCO control voltage <b>9110</b> to a predetermined value. A calibration control block <b>9150</b> may adjust the frequency of VCO <b>9120</b> by changing capacitance values internal to VCO <b>9120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, for various cal control <b>9150</b> settings of VCO <b>9120</b> capacitors, output frequency of VCO <b>9120</b> is measured by using a lock detector <b>9160</b>. After resetting of the different dividers to synchronize all blocks, lock detector <b>9160</b> may compare a subdivided version <b>9122</b> of VCO <b>9120</b> output frequency to a reference clock <b>9180</b>. By using a successive approximation approach the correct calibration setting can be determined in very few reference clock <b>9180</b> cycles. FREQ High and FREQ Low bits generated by lock detector <b>9160</b> are used in calibration control circuit <b>9150</b> to indicate if VCO <b>9120</b> frequency is too high or too low.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">To ensure the PLL locks precisely onto a predetermined frequency, reference clock <b>9180</b> and subdivided VCO output <b>9122</b> are preferably synchronously released. In embodiments, reset circuit <b>9190</b> may automatically issue synchronous reset signal <b>9192</b> upon receiving a signal from calibration control <b>9150</b>. Alternatively, a software accessible control register can be used to signal reset circuit <b>9190</b> to issue synchronous reset signal <b>9192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> illustrates a calibration sequence wherein 4 bits of calibration control information <b>9210</b> is passed from calibration control circuit <b>9150</b> to VCO <b>9120</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>). For each calibration information <b>9210</b> setting, freq high signal <b>9220</b> may respond on a rising edge of reference clock <b>9180</b>, further enabling a change in calibration information <b>9210</b> setting. This sequence repeats until PLL frequency <b>9230</b> is substantially close to a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref>, in receive mode during periods when no preamble or SOF has been detected and no data is currently being received, calibration control <b>9150</b> may adjust calibration setting whenever VCO control voltage <b>9110</b> has changed significantly. This function is done by sense block <b>9105</b> by comparing VCO control voltage <b>9110</b> with an upper limit <b>9310</b>, and a lower limit <b>9320</b>. As illustrated in the diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref>, VCO control voltage <b>9110</b> may be monitored continuously such that when it falls outside sense block <b>9105</b> limits, calibration control <b>9150</b> adjusts calibration information setting <b>9210</b>. In embodiments, a sudden change in calibration control <b>9150</b> output will result in PLL <b>9230</b> loosing lock, therefore calibration control <b>9150</b> may be disabled until lock detector <b>9160</b> indicates that PLL <b>9230</b> has settled again.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Additionally, voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) calibration may use portions of the PLL, thereby reducing hardware resources and cost. Additionally cost is reduced by IF calibration. In order to counteract the natural variation in resistors and capacitors, the IF filters of the ZW0201 has programmable resistors, which are set during a calibration process. This calibration process is able to reduce the variation of the IF filter center frequency, and this helps relax the requirements to the system clock. The calibration is performed using the components of the IF filter. The procedure is like this One capacitor is discharged and another is charged. The voltages across the capacitors are compared, and when they cross each other, the charge/discharge time is recorded (as being the time from start of the process until the voltages cross each other). The two capacitors are reset, the programmable resistors of the IF filter is changed, and another charge/discharge sequence is done. Four charge/discharge periods are performed, and resistors are changed during each period, which results in a resistor setting that has a optimal charge/discharge period.</p>

<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The 8-bit part of the ADC is tested for missing codes, mismatch and missing connections in a simple and fast way. The precision of the test is better than &#xbd; LSB. The 8 bit part of the LSB is made of 9 capacitors, 8 capacitors having an individual size ratio which is binary and 1 capacitor having the unit size.

<p id="p-0155" num="0154">A software programmable interface (SPI) <b>824</b> may be included in the implementation. Two examples of how SPI <b>824</b> may be used are: 1) to provide external access to the flash memory <b>828</b> and 2) to allow mesh network node <b>100</b> to communicate with an external memory. The SPI may act as a master or slave when interfacing to memory. For example, network node <b>100</b> acts as a master when accessing external Electrically Erasable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) and as a slave when accessing the flash memory <b>828</b>. External flash memory may also be accessible by MCU <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The mesh network node embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may contain a UART <b>814</b> and may operate independent of MCU <b>830</b>. UART <b>814</b> may support full duplex and may operate with the following three baud rates: 9.6 kbaud, 38.4 kbaud, or 115.2 kbaud.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Power Control Block <b>838</b> controls node <b>100</b>'s different power saving modes. For example two power saving modes are: Normal Mode and Sleep Mode/Power Down Mode. In Normal Mode MCU <b>830</b> is running and the RF circuits and ADC <b>822</b> may be powered up or down. Sleep Mode/Power Down Mode may be the lowest power mode, with everything shut down except the RAM's brown-out detection and low power timer. In addition ADC <b>822</b> may be powered up or down. In Sleep mode it is possible to wake MCU <b>830</b> up using an external interrupt source. The source may be active low or active high. MCU <b>830</b> may also be woken by the wake up timer <b>838</b>, a reset, or by power cycling.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">It is also possible to power down MCU <b>830</b> while keeping RF transceiver <b>802</b> operating, by automatically stopping MCU <b>830</b> before powering up RF transceiver <b>802</b>. Additionally, it is possible to restart MCU <b>830</b> when transmission has completed and RF transmitter <b>802</b> has been powered down. This sequence of powering up and down these elements reduces power consumption and cuts peak current demand.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Two examples of how this may be executed is: automatically stopping the MCU before powering up the radio and transmitting, and restarting it when transmission has completed and the radio powered down; and automatically stopping the MCU before powering up the radio for reception and automatically powering up the MCU when a signal is received</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Depending on information frames contained within a signal received by RF transceiver <b>802</b>, MCU <b>830</b> can be automatically powered up.

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">This embodiment also has general purpose I/O interfaces <b>808</b>. For example, the ZW0201 has 10 configurable General Purpose I/O (GPIO) pins with optional weak internal pull-up. The GPIO pins may be organized as two ports. The GPIO pins may have dual or even triple functionality, user programmable from MCU and some special hardware functions (for instance SPI <b>824</b>, ADC <b>822</b>, UART <b>814</b>, TRIAC controller <b>820</b>, etc.). In this implementation four of the GPIO pins may be either analogue (for ADC) or configured for digital interfacing as an input, or output. Reset I/O may also be available. Two examples of reset I/O are 1) External reset and 2) Enable programming mode. For example, when the reset pin is pulled low a master reset is generated. If the reset is held low for an extended period then the chip accepts programming commands on SPI <b>824</b>. The chip may not go into actual programming mode until an SPI <b>824</b> Programming Enable command is received. As an example five dedicated analogue pins are used for RF interface <b>802</b> and crystal connections <b>810</b>. GPIO pins may be set as inputs during reset. This pin configuration may be maintained after the reset is released until the software changes the setting.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">By using one or more of the invention interface circuits, an RC-oscillator may be used as a temperature sensor, lowering cost by reusing existing interface circuits for the additional function of sensing temperature. The Wake-up timer internal ring oscillator is designed in a way so the calibration value has a near linear temperature dependency. The calibration depends on temperature, supply voltage and process variation. Fortunately the supply voltage variation can be take into account by using the built in battery monitoring circuit. The impact of process variation is mostly on the offset value. Consequently if the calibration value is known at a given temperature then the temperature can be estimated at another temperature. This results in the benefit of low cost from reuse of existing circuit as temperature sensor.</p>

The reset may be an asynchronous input with internal pull-up, schmitt trigger, and glitch protection. The signal may be synchronized internally so that the reset may be asserted and deasserted asynchronously. The POR circuit may also contain a low pass filter <b>1304</b> for glitch protection and hysteresis <b>1308</b> for noise and transient stability. In Sleep mode the POR may go into a low power mode that protects the circuit against brown-out while keeping the power consumption at an absolute minimum.

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">UART <b>814</b> interfaces with external components. For example UART <b>814</b> interfaces with a data rate of 9.6 kbaud, 38.4 kbaud, or 115.2 kbaud, with 8-bit words, one start bit, one stop bit and no parity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a typical RS232 UART application circuit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> gives a waveform of a serial byte. UART <b>814</b> shifts data in and out in the following order: start bit <b>1600</b>, data bits <b>1602</b> (LSB first) and stop bit <b>1604</b>. For noise rejection, the serial port may establish the content of each received bit by a majority voting on the sampled input. This is especially true for the start bit. If the falling edge on R&#xd7;D is not verified by the majority voting over the start bit then the serial port stops reception and waits for another falling edge on R&#xd7;D. After &#x2154; of the stop bit time, the serial port waits for another high-to-low transition (start bit) on the R&#xd7;D pin.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Single chip embodiment of network node <b>100</b> supports external interrupts <b>818</b> to MCU <b>830</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. For example, Interrupts <b>1700</b> may be programmed to be either level-triggered (high/low) or edge-triggered (rising/falling). Also, interrupt(s) to Power Management <b>838</b> may enable wake up from sleep mode. Interrupts may be used to wake up the chip from sleep mode. The interrupts to the Power Management <b>838</b> may be level-triggered (high/low). When the chip wakes up from Sleep mode the clock oscillator may start up before program execution starts.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">This implementation may have a Triac Controller <b>820</b> which uses phase control for power regulation of resistive loads <b>1800</b> and to some degree non-resistive loads. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a simplified application circuit. The phase control method may conduct power during a specific time period in each half of the AC power cycle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows typical Triac waveforms. A Triac is commonly used to switch on and off the power to the load in the AC power system application. A gate voltage <b>1900</b> may be required to turn on the Triac (fire pulse). Once &#x201c;on&#x201d;, the Triac may stay &#x201c;on&#x201d; until the AC sine wave reaches zero <b>1902</b> current regardless of the gate voltage. The power regulation is performed by controlling the fire angle (turn on start time). The Triac may deliver the power to the load after the fire angle and turn off at the zero-crossing point. The fire pulse must be of a certain duration in order to 1) provide sufficient charge for the Triac to turn on and 2) ensure that is does not subsequently switch off due to potential noise. The duration of the fire pulse may be programmed in SW. The zero cross detection may be disturbed by noise <b>2000</b> on the AC line. In case this noise is strong enough it could worst case cause additional triggering <b>2002</b> on the ZEROX as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In order to avoid these extra zero crossing triggers a noise mask <b>2100</b> has been implemented in the Triac Controller. The mask masks out zero crossings from the true zero cross until a period before the next true zero cross, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The zero cross detector may either be programmed to use both the rising edge and the falling edge of the zero cross signal <b>1900</b> (like the ZEROX signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) or it may be programmed to only use the rising edge of the zero cross signal <b>2200</b> (like the ZEROX signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). The Triac Controller may be programmed to generate an interrupt request to the MCU whenever it detects a zero cross. When detecting zero crosses on both rising and falling edges then the detection moments may be offset <b>2300</b> due to the threshold level of the ZEROX input, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Because of this offset the Triac fire pulse may not be fired at the same distance from the beginning of the positive period and from the beginning of the negative period. It means that the AC load, which the Triac controls, may have a DC voltage different from 0V. To make this DC voltage negligible, the Triac Controller may be programmed with a variable correction <b>2400</b> period to correct for the offset, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In order to control a Triac, two signals are important. The ZEROX signal, which reflects the zero crossing of the mains signal, and the TRIAC signal, which is used to fire the Triac. The ZEROX signal is used to generate a fire pulse (TRIAC signal) for every half period, that is, both the rising edge and the falling edge are used as time base for generating the fire pulse. The zero-cross detection logic isn't toggling exactly on the zero cross because of the threshold level of the input buffer of the ZEROX pin. Therefore the fire pulse in the &#x201c;negative&#x201d; half period will be slightly earlier than the fire pulse in the &#x201c;positive&#x201d; half period. This difference generates an unwanted DC current in the connected appliance. To correct for this difference; a programming register, TRICOR, can be used to skew the time for the generation of the fire pulse in the negative half period, thus removing the difference and avoid DC in the controlled load. A benefit of this Triac control functionality is avoiding DC in the controlled load (specifically a problem for inductive loads).</p>

The ADC input signal may be loaded by an internal sampling capacitor. In 8-bit mode the sampling time may be configured to fit the source impedance and frequency contents of the input signal. Alternatively an internal buffer may be switched in between the external source and the ADC to reduce capacitive loading of the input.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">SPI <b>824</b> may be used for synchronous data transfer between the single chip <b>100</b> device and an external memory, used by some node types, or between a programming unit and the device. The SPI may not be available to the external application. Mater mode <b>2600</b> is activated when interfacing to an external EEPROM and slave <b>2602</b> during programming mode. The programming mode may be enabled by setting Reset low for an extended period. The SCK may be the clock output in master mode and is the clock input in slave mode. During data transmission the SCK may clock the data from a slave register into a master register. At the same time data may be clocked in the opposite direction from master to the slave connection. Consequently the two registers <b>2604</b> may be considered as one distributed circular shift register as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. After 8 clock cycles the two registers will have swapped contents. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows a typical interface application to an EEPROM.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">An embodiment may contain a function for programming external memory, such as external Flash memory. In flash programming mode an external master may control the SPI bus causing node <b>100</b> to act as slave. In programming mode the flash may be erased, read, and/or written. Moreover it is possible to read a signature byte identifying the chip, enable/disable read/write protection, and/or read/write the Home ID. Flash programming mode may be entered by setting and keeping the Reset pin low. When the Reset has been held low for two XTAL periods then the SPI may accept a Programming Enable command. The chip may not enter programming mode until the two first bytes of the Programming Enable has been accepted. After the chip has entered programming mode the device may stay in programming mode as long as the Reset pin is held. When the Reset pin is set high the chip may generate an internal master reset pulse and normal program execution may start up. The watchdog function may be disabled as long as the chip is in programming mode and all other GPIO's <b>808</b> than the SPI <b>824</b> interface may be tri-stated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> gives a simplified block diagram of a typical interface to programming equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the present invention may include a method and system for silently acknowledging a successful transmission of a single case frame from a first node to a second node.

As the second node <b>3202</b> sends the single cast frame <b>3209</b> that it received from the first node <b>3200</b> onto the third node <b>3204</b>, the first node <b>3200</b> may be able to detect the single cast frame <b>3209</b> sent from the second node <b>3202</b> to the third node <b>3204</b> and interpret this single cast frame <b>3209</b> as an acknowledgement of success in sending the single cast frame <b>3208</b> from the first node <b>3200</b> to the second node <b>3202</b>.

The first node <b>3200</b> may then send an acknowledgement <b>3212</b> to node two <b>3202</b> that it received the routed acknowledgement frame <b>3211</b> from node two <b>3202</b>. This process may be repeated throughout a single cast frame transmission sequence, with subsequent nodes (e.g. the fourth or sixtieth node in a transmission sequence, etc.) wherein a sending node detects a transmission from a receiving node to a third node, and interprets this as acknowledgement that the receiving node successfully received a transmission from the sending node</p>

<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In embodiments, node communication within a mesh network may be based at least in part on a distributed routing method and system. In a distributed routing system, each node in the network may store at least two types of routing tables, a forward routing table and a reverse routing table. Routing tables may be used to indicate the route through which a given node within the network may transmit data. Routing tables may be based upon data that is obtained through the use of an explore frame, or a plurality of explore frames.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In an example, a user of a mesh network containing a Node <b>1</b>, Node <b>2</b>, Node <b>3</b>, Node <b>4</b>, and Node <b>5</b> may wish to transmit data from Node <b>1</b> to Node <b>5</b>. In this example, Node <b>1</b> has not previously communicated directly with Node <b>5</b>. Thus, Node <b>1</b> does not know the route to Node <b>5</b> (i.e. it does not have the route stored in its routing tables). As a result, Node <b>1</b> may broadcast an explore frame. Upon receipt of the explore frame from Node <b>1</b>, Node <b>2</b> may update its reverse routing table to include information regarding the source of the explore frame (Node <b>1</b>), the next &#x201c;hop&#x201d; (Node <b>1</b>). Upon receipt of the explore frame from Node <b>1</b>, Node <b>3</b> may update its reverse routing table to include information regarding the source of the explore frame (Node <b>1</b>), the next &#x201c;hop&#x201d; (Node <b>2</b>) and the destination node (Node <b>5</b>). Upon receipt of the explore frame from Node <b>1</b>, Node <b>4</b> may update its reverse routing table to include information regarding the source of the explore frame (Node <b>1</b>), the next &#x201c;hop&#x201d; (Node <b>3</b>) and the destination node (Node <b>5</b>). Upon receipt of the explore frame from Node <b>1</b>, Node <b>5</b> may update its reverse routing table to include information regarding the source of the explore frame (Node <b>1</b>), the next &#x201c;hop&#x201d; (Node <b>4</b>) and the destination node (Node <b>5</b>). Continuing the example, next, Node <b>5</b> may transmit a report frame to Node <b>1</b> through Node <b>4</b>; Node <b>4</b> may transmit a report frame to Node <b>1</b> through Node <b>3</b>; Node <b>3</b> may transmit a report frame to Node <b>1</b> through Node <b>2</b>; and, Node <b>2</b> may transmit a report frame to Node <b>1</b>. Following receipt of the report frames from Nodes <b>2</b> through <b>4</b>, Node <b>1</b> may update its routing table to include Node <b>5</b> as a destination, and Node <b>2</b> as the next hop node.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In embodiments, an algorithm may be used in a distributed routing system in which there is a local prioritization that determines which of the next hops are to be stored in a given routing table based at least in part on a metric. In an example, such an algorithm and its associated metric may be used to determine which of a plurality of received report nodes is to be stored in a node's routing table. For example, the metric employed by the algorithm may require that the node receiving more than one report frame store only the report frame having the lowest metric value, thus storing that data that is associated with the best available route.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In embodiments, the initiation of a node transmission within a distributed routing system may originate with a user request (e.g., a human operating a remote control), with a device initiated request (e.g. a smoke alarm activated during a fire), or some other origin.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In embodiments, a node may experience an error in transmission within a distributed routing method and system. For example, if Node <b>3</b> cannot communicate with Node <b>4</b> when forwarding a frame to Node <b>5</b> on behalf of Node <b>1</b>, it may issue an explore frame for Node <b>5</b>. This may have the effect of repairing the remaining communication path to Node <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In embodiments of the present invention, node communication within a mesh network may be based at least in part on a source routing method and system. A source routing method may be preferable to a distributed routing method and system, in certain embodiments, insofar as a source routing system does not require distributed memory and the storage of routing data at the node level. In embodiments, a mesh network using a source routing methodology may be associated with a central network topology server from which any node in the network may request network topology updates. A node may request network topology updates on a fixed time interval, upon the receipt of a type of transmission, or based upon some other criterion. The receipt of the network topology update data may enable a node to continuously ensure that its network awareness is accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In embodiments, the network topology data that is stored within a central network topology server may not be accurate. As a result of the outdated network topology data, a node in the mesh network may have to use an alternate method and system for obtaining current network topology and routing data.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In embodiments, route resolution through explore frames may be used to obtain current routing information in mesh network. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, in an example, a Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> may attempt to communicate with a destination node, Node <b>5</b> <b>3410</b>, in a mesh network using the network topology data obtained from a central network topology data server <b>3414</b>, a source data master controller, or some other source of network topology data residing apart from the node itself. Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> may as part of its algorithm have a preferred Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> to Node <b>5</b> <b>3410</b> route consisting of &#x201c;Node <b>1</b> to Node <b>2</b> to Node <b>5</b>.&#x201d; Upon failure of the transmission to the dead Node <b>2</b> <b>3402</b> (e.g., the failure of Node <b>1</b> to receive an acknowledgement frame from Node <b>2</b> <b>3402</b> indicating transmission success) Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> may request a network topology update from the central network topology server <b>3414</b>. Next, Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> may again attempt to transmit to the destination node, Node <b>5</b> <b>3410</b>, this time using the updated network topology data. In this example, the second attempt of Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> also fails due to inaccurate network topology data regarding the status of Node <b>2</b> <b>3402</b> that is received from the central network topology server <b>3414</b>. As a result, Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> may broadcast explore frames using a flooding algorithm in which an explore frame is distributed to all of the nodes in the mesh network with which Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> may communicate (for the example embodied in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> it is presumed that Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> is unable to directly communicate with Node <b>5</b> <b>3410</b> due to too great a physical separation between the nodes). Thus, Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> sends an explore frame that's picked up by Node <b>3</b> <b>3404</b> and Node <b>4</b> <b>3408</b>. Node <b>3</b> <b>3404</b> in turn forwards a copy of the explore frame from Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> which is picked up by Node <b>4</b> <b>3408</b> and Node <b>5</b> <b>3410</b>. Similarly, Node <b>4</b> <b>3408</b> forwards a copy of the explore frame which is picked up by Node <b>3</b> <b>3404</b> and Node <b>5</b> <b>3408</b>. Upon receipt of the explore frames, Node <b>5</b> <b>3410</b> transmits a frame back through Node <b>3</b> <b>3404</b> and Node <b>4</b> <b>3408</b>, which in turn transmit to the nodes with which each has contact: Node <b>4</b>/Node <b>3</b>, and Node<b>3</b>/Node <b>1</b>, respectively. During each transmission between nodes, a node ID is appended to the message header indicating its origin. As a result, the report frames received by Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> each indicates the route traveled from Node <b>5</b> <b>3410</b> to Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b>. In an embodiment, this data may be used to confirm the presence of an available route that Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> may use in transmitting data from Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> to Node <b>5</b> <b>3410</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the available routes are:</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Route <b>1</b>: Node <b>1</b> to Node <b>3</b> to Node <b>5</b>;</p>

<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In embodiments, an algorithm may be associated with Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> and used to distinguish among the routes that are available for transmitting between Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> and Node <b>5</b> <b>3410</b>. For example, the algorithm may include information on traffic density over each route and select the least busy route for transmission. Alternatively, the order in which the report frames are received may be used as a proxy by the algorithm for determining which of the routes is associated with the faster transmission. Alternatively, the algorithm may use some other network information as a basis for selecting which of the available routes to use in transmitting from Node <b>1</b> <b>3400</b> to Node <b>5</b> <b>3410</b>.</p>

In an embodiment, the central network topology server <b>3414</b> may then broadcast the network topology update to all nodes in the mesh network in order to inform each of Node <b>2</b>'s <b>3402</b> demise.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">In embodiments, the initiation of a node transmission within a source routing system may originate with a user request (e.g., a human operating a remote control) <b>3418</b>, with a device initiated request (e.g. a smoke alarm activated during a fire) <b>3420</b>, or some other origin.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, in embodiments, a mesh network node, including but not limited to a battery-powered node, may cycle through &#x201c;asleep&#x201d; periods during which time the node is unable to receive a message, and &#x201c;awake&#x201d; periods <b>3514</b> when the node is powered and enabled to receive a transmitted message <b>3512</b>. The time interval between the awake periods <b>3514</b> of node may be varied across nodes within a network. For example, one node may operate at an interval of 0.25 seconds, and another within the same mesh network may have an awake period <b>3514</b> interval of 1.0 seconds. The time interval between the awake periods <b>3514</b> may be node-specific, may be the same across a mesh network, or the same for only a subset of nodes within a mesh network.</p>

In the example, the source node <b>3500</b> seeks to transmit a message <b>3512</b> to the destination node <b>3504</b> by using the repeater node <b>3502</b> as an independent relay.

The asleep periods of the nodes may enable the nodes to conserve their electrical usage, as compared to a node that is fully powered at all times. This may enable a battery powered node to conserve its electrical storage and provide a longer battery life to the nodes in the network. This may minimize maintenance, user operator interaction, cost, or some other variable.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> example, the source node <b>3500</b> seeks to transmit a message <b>3512</b> first to the repeater node <b>3502</b>.

This may ensure that no matter when the source node <b>3500</b> initiates transmission of the beam there will be at least one awake period <b>3514</b> during which time the repeater node <b>3502</b> may receive it. Once the repeater node <b>3502</b> is in an awake period <b>3514</b> that temporally overlaps transmission of the beam <b>3510</b>, it is instructed to remain active (as opposed to its standard procedure of cycling back into the asleep mode) and the repeater node continues to remain powered and enable to receive a transmitted message <b>3512</b>.

<p id="p-0318" num="0317">In an embodiment, a monitoring system is provided to monitor an inhabitant of a living space. The monitoring may be performed by analyzing actions associated with actuators associated with the living space. The living space may, for example, have actuators such as those associated with light switches, audio visual equipment (e.g. on/off switches, control switches), kitchen appliances (e.g. on/off switches, control switches) or other such devices and each of them or many of them may be monitored to predict or infer behaviors of the inhabitants. The actuators may be associated with a network such that actuator interactivity may be monitored. Patterns of interaction may be monitored and compared with standard patterns to predict or infer a behavior of the inhabitant. For example, generally speaking, the inhabitant may typically go to bed at 8:00 p.m. Patterns of actuator interaction and actuator performance may be stored in a database. One of the patterns may be indicative of a sleeping inhabitant or an inhabitant preparing for sleep. A sleeping pattern may indicate, for example, that the light actuators in a particular room (e.g. the living room) are off during sleeping hours and that the kitchen appliances are all off. If the realtime actuator performance at 1:00 a.m. shows lights on or appliances on, an inference may be drawn that indicates the inhabitant is in trouble because of lack of compliance with the standard pattern. Of course, this is a very basic example, and the inference system may monitor several actuators and draw inferences on more complicated combinations of actual actuator performance versus standard patterns. The living space may be a home, a nursing home, a hospital, a daycare, a school, a business office, or some other space. For example, a user may monitor the activities of an elderly person residing at a distant location. Thus, an unattended elderly person can be remotely monitored for an unusual pattern in an otherwise normal routine.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">In this embodiment, the method of monitoring may involve associating an actuator with a device within the living space; activating the actuator upon a status change of the device; transmitting data from the actuator to a data facility based at least in part on the activation of the actuator; comparing the transmitted data to a device standard using the data facility; and generating a message based at least in part on the data comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">The actuator may be associated with an electrical, electronic, or a mechanical device within the living space. The actuator may be associated with a mesh network node. The node may employ any or all of the node technologies as described herein. For example, the node may use speed control, silent acknowledgment, channel selections, or other technologies described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-37</figref>. Moreover, the device may be a light switch, a door lock, a window lock, a thermostat, a motion detector, or any other device described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-37</figref>. Also, the device may be a weight sensor, wherein the weight sensor is associated with a bed, a chair, a floor, or any other area where the inhabitant of the living space is likely to apply weight on.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">The actuator may be activated upon status change of the associated device. Referring to the example mentioned above, the actuator may be activated when the elderly person switches on a light in the living space. Once activated, the actuator may transmit data related to the status change of the device to a data facility. In an embodiment the actuator transmits the data through a mesh network. The transmission through the mesh network may employ any or all of the transmission technologies as described herein. For example, the transmission may involve mesh channel manipulation, silent acknowledgement, transmitting through a battery operated node, repairing a node in the network to effect the transmission, or other technologies described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-37</figref>. Moreover, the transmission could be local to the living space, external to the living space, or broadcast locally and external to the living space.</p>

In our example, normal routine of the elderly person may involve all the lights at the residence to be switched off after 8:00 p.m. In this case, lights being switched off after 8:00 p.m. may be a personal norm for the light switches. Moreover, the comparison may result in generation of a message for the user, where the user may be a person attempting to monitor the inhabitant, the inhabitant, or other person involved in the monitoring process. In the example mentioned above, a message may be generated for the user in case the light is switched on after 8:00 p.m. in the evening. Switching the light on at this time does not match the personal norm and could imply an unusual activity that may require immediate attention. The message generated for the user may be in the form of an alarm, a phone call, a text message, an email, an instant message, a beeper message, or any other message to a user accessible interface.</p>
