<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention generally relates to electronic memories, and more particularly to a sense amplifier of a series of memory cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional sense amplifier generally addresses about 256 to 1,024 memory cells via a line, a so-called bitline. The conventional sense amplifier is more specifically a differential amplifier operating with a bitline and a complementary bitline which is used as a reference line.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional technique for increasing the performances of dynamic DRAM memory consists in reducing the number of cells addressed by a sense amplifier (reference is also made to a reduction in the length of the bitline). However, a larger number of sense amplifiers has to be provided in order to address the whole of the cells making up the memory, which is expressed by a loss of global efficiency insofar that management of the memory consumes useful surface area to the detriment of the actual memory.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to react to this loss of efficiency, the article &#x201c;A 500 MHz Random Cycle, 1.5 ns Latency, SOI Embedded DRAM Macro Featuring a Three-Transistor Micro Sense Amplifier&#x201d;, J Barth et al., ISSCC (2007), Pages: 486-487 shows an architectural hierarchy based on sense amplifiers, so-called micro-sense amplifiers, addressing via a local bitline, few cells (32 typically) but consisting of very few (typically three) transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This article proposes an architecture in which the different memory cells are made on a silicon-on-insulator substrate (SOI). The different micro-sense amplifiers are, as for them, formed either on a bulk substrate or a SOI substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each micro-sense amplifier has two input terminals connected to two main bitlines RBL (Read Bitline) and WBL (Write Bitline) which will control the read/write operations of the cells addressed in parallel via the local bitline LBL connected to the output terminal of the micro-sense amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Resorting to two main bitlines proves to be a problem in that the architecture proposed by this article cannot be transposed for producing standalone memories and thus remains limited to the production of embedded memories.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, each micro-sense amplifier can only address a reduced number of memory cells (16 to 32 typically) so that a relatively large number of micro-sense amplifiers (from 64 k to 128 k for a 2 Mbit memory) has to be resorted to. In spite of the relatively reduced size of the micro-amplifier (only 3 transistors), the drawback mentioned earlier of significant surface consumption for the sense amplification function, to the detriment of the memory function, therefore partly remains.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a technique and system which overcomes the drawbacks of the architectural hierarchy proposed in the aforementioned article.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For this purpose, the invention provides, according to a first aspect, a sense amplifier for a series of cells of a rewritable memory, including a writing stage comprising a CMOS inverter, the input of which is directly or indirectly connected to an input terminal of the sense amplifier, and the output of which is connected to an output terminal of the sense amplifier intended to be connected to a local bitline addressing the cells of said series; and a reading stage comprising a sense transistor, the gate of which is connected to the output of the inverter and the drain of which is connected to the input of the inverter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first embodiment, the input of the writing stage is directly connected to the input terminal of the inverter, said input terminal being intended to be connected to a main bitline which will address a plurality of sense amplifiers in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a second embodiment, the reading stage comprises an additional transistor, complementary to the sense transistor, the additional transistor and the sense transistor forming a CMOS inverter, the input of which is connected to the output of the writing stage and the output of which is connected to the input of the inverter of the writing stage.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this second embodiment, the input of the writing stage may be indirectly connected to the input terminal of the inverter via a decoding stage comprising a transistor, the drain of which is connected to the input terminal of the sense amplifier and the source of which is connected to the input of the writing stage.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One or more transistors of the sense amplifier are multigate transistors. The biasing of one of the gates of the multigate transistors can be modified during operations for writing, reading and retaining data in the cells of said series.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The sense amplifier according to the first aspect of the invention is preferentially made on a semiconductor-on-insulator substrate comprising a thin layer of semiconducting material separated from a base substrate by an insulating layer, and each of the transistors has a back control gate formed in the base substrate below the channel and capable of being biased for modulating the threshold voltage of the transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a second aspect, the invention relates to a method for controlling a sense amplifier according to the first aspect of the invention made on a SeOI substrate, in which the bias of the back control gates is modified during operations for writing, reading and retaining data in the cells of said series.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">During a reading operation, the threshold voltage of the transistors of the writing stage may be increased and the threshold voltage of the transistor(s) of the reading stage may be decreased by controlling the bias of their back control gates.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">During a writing operation, the threshold voltage of the transistors of the writing stage may be decreased and the threshold voltage of the transistor(s) of the reading stage may be increased by controlling the bias of their back control gates.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">During a retention operation, the local bitline may be discharged via one of the transistors of the writing stage, for which the bias of the back control gate is controlled so as to lower its threshold voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to still another aspect, the invention relates to a matrix array of cells connected to local bitlines and to word lines, characterized in that it includes sense amplifiers according to the first aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the matrix array of cells, the sense amplifiers can be arranged in one or more sense amplifier banks and the matrix array can further comprise a column decoder placed next to each bank and configured to drive said bank directly. Further logic circuits can be placed next to the sense amplifier banks or the column decoder.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another aspect, the invention relates to a memory including a matrix array of cells.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The memory cells and the sense amplifiers of the memory are preferentially made on a semiconductor-on-insulator substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to still another aspect, the invention relates to a main sense amplifier intended to be connected via a main bitline to a plurality of sense amplifiers according to the first embodiment of the first aspect of the invention, characterized in that it comprises a stage for amplifying the signal delivered by a cell during a reading operation, and a switchable high impedance inverter stage for sending back the amplified signal onto the main bitline following the reading operation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a further aspect, the invention relates to sense amplifier including a writing stage comprising a CMOS inverter, the input of which is directly or indirectly connected to an input terminal of the sense amplifier, and the output of which is connected to an output terminal of the sense amplifier intended to be connected to a local line; and a reading stage comprising a sense transistor, the gate of which is connected to the output of the inverter and the drain of which is connected to the input of the inverter. Advantageously, one or more transistors of the writing stage and of the reading stage are independent double gate transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Yet according to another aspect, the invention relates to a matrix array of cells comprising sense amplifiers and column decoders, wherein the sense amplifiers are arranged in a non-staggered fashion in one or more sense amplifier banks and wherein a column decoder is placed next to each bank and configured to drive said bank directly.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The invention according to a first aspect relates to a sense amplifier (called a nano-sense amplifier) of a series of cells of a memory.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An architectural hierarchy applied in a first embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and according to which a nano-sense amplifier nSA covers a series of memory cells via a local bitline LBL, typically between 128 and 512 memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The nano-sense amplifier nSA transfers data towards/from a main sense amplifier MSA via a main bitline MBL. The main bitline MBL covers a series of nano-sense amplifiers nSA, typically between 16 and 32 nano-sense amplifiers nSA.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The main sense amplifier MSA is moreover connected to a line, a so-called dataline DL, on which read/written data circulate in the memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It will be understood from the description which follows of the first embodiment of the invention that a nano-sense amplifier nSA provides the reading and writing functions, while the refreshing function is achieved by the main sense amplifier MSA which forms the interface between the nano-sense amplifier nSA and the peripheral circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It will be noted from now on that the nano-sense amplifier nSA has a single connection (the main bitline MBL) with the main sense amplifier MSA, with which it is possible to meet the constraints in terms of metallization width both in the field of embedded memories and in that of standalone memories.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a nano-sense amplifier nSA according to the first embodiment of the invention only includes three transistors T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The nano-sense amplifier nSA more specifically comprises an input terminal E connected to the main bitline MBL and an output terminal S connected to the local bitline LBL via the input terminal E.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The nano-sense amplifier nSA comprises a writing stage comprising a CMOS inverter, the input of which is directly connected to the input terminal E and the output of which is connected to the output terminal S.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The CMOS inverter comprises, between two terminals for applying power supply potentials, VDD and GND respectively, a transistor with a first type of channel in series with a transistor with a second type of channel.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the illustrated embodiment, the inverter comprises a P channel transistor T<b>1</b>, the source of which is connected to the potential VDD (high state) and a N channel transistor T<b>2</b>, the source of which is connected to the potential GND (low state). The gates of the transistors of the inverter are connected together and connected to the main bitline MBL. The middle point of the serial combination of the transistors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> (the output of the inverter) is as for it connected to the local bitline LBL.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The nano-sense amplifier nSA further comprises a reading stage formed by a transistor T<b>3</b>, here an N channel transistor, the gate of which is connected to the output of the inverter and to the local bitline LBL, the drain of which is connected to the input of the inverter and to the main bitline MBL, and the source of which is connected to a terminal for applying a power supply potential PGND.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the invention, the nano-sense amplifier nSA is made on a semiconductor-on-insulator substrate comprising a thin layer of semiconducting material separated from a base substrate by an insulating layer. Each of the transistors has a back control gate formed in the base substrate below the channel and capable of being biased in order to modulate the threshold voltage of the transistor. The bias respectively applied to the back control gate of transistors T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b> is illustrated on the figure by references Vbg<b>1</b>, Vbg<b>2</b> and Vbg<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It will be noted that the modulation of the threshold voltage is particularly advantageous in that it allows the operation of a transistor to be forced so as to ensure, depending on the circumstances, that it is actually blocked or conducting. With this, the operation of the nano-sense amplifier nSA may be made more secure, and therefore the operation margin thereof may be increased (which allows association of a larger number of memory cells with the nano-sense amplifier nSA).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, a P channel transistor is illustrated, having a back control gate BG<sub>P </sub>arranged in the base substrate under the BOX insulating layer so as to be positioned facing the front control gate G. The back control gate BG<sub>P </sub>is formed here by a P type doped region isolated from the base substrate by an N conductivity well C<sub>N</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, an N channel transistor is illustrated, having a back control gate BG<sub>N </sub>arranged in the base substrate under the insulating layer so as to be positioned facing the front control gate G. The back control gate BG<sub>N </sub>is formed here by an N type doped region insulated from the base substrate by a P conductivity well C<sub>p</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the transistors are fully depleted SeOI transistors defined by a channel/body region that is thin enough to allow the field induced by the top control gate (under usual voltage conditions) to reach the buried oxide layer BOX.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A transistor for which the channel has a conductivity of type N and a back control gate of P conductivity, has a very high threshold voltage. This threshold voltage may then be reduced by applying a positive voltage on the back control gate. A transistor for which the channel has a conductivity of type N and a back control gate of conductivity N as for it has a nominal threshold voltage which may be reduced by applying a positive voltage on the back control gate.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">This variation of the threshold voltage of the transistor via the back control gate may be formulated according to V<sub>th</sub>=V<sub>t0</sub>&#x2212;&#x3b1;.V<sub>BG</sub>, wherein V<sub>th </sub>represents the threshold voltage of the transistor, V<sub>BG </sub>the voltage applied to the back control gate, V<sub>t0 </sub>the nominal threshold voltage (which may be shifted by the work function depending on whether a back control gate of type N or P is used), and &#x3b1; is a coefficient related to the geometry of the transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The different writing, reading and retention operations which may be applied by the nano-sense amplifier of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are described hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Reading</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">During an operation for reading the datum stored in a memory cell Ci, Cj connected to the local bitline LBL, and selected by means of a line, a so-called wordline (not shown), the transistor T<b>3</b> of the reading stage is the sensor, while the transistors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> of the reading stage are blocked in order to avoid any corruption of the signal from the selected cell.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The inverter has a voltage of VDD/2 (potentially floating voltage) on its input E.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A high voltage is applied to the back control gate of the P channel transistor T<b>1</b> (Vbg<b>1</b> is for example in the high state VDD) so as to set its threshold voltage above VDD/2 and to thereby block the transistor T<b>1</b>. If this does not prove to be sufficient, it is also possible to reduce the power supply potential VDD of the transistor T<b>2</b> during this reading operation, by typically using a voltage already existing in the circuit such as VDD/2.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Moreover, a low voltage is applied to the back control gate of the N channel transistor T<b>2</b> (Vbg<b>2</b> is for example in the low state GND) so as to set its threshold voltage above VDD/2 and to thereby block the transistor T<b>1</b>. If this does not prove to be sufficient, it is also possible to increase the power supply potential GND of the transistor T<b>1</b> during this operation, for example by a few hundred millivolts, typically by using a voltage already existing in the circuit, such as VDD/2.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The selected cell to be read typically provides 200-300 mV if it contains a &#x201c;1&#x201d; and 0 mV if it contains a &#x201c;0&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A high voltage is applied to the back control gate of the N channel sense transistor T<b>3</b> (Vbg<b>3</b> is for example in the high state VDD), in order to lower its threshold voltage below the level provided at its gate by the local bitline LBL. The power supply potential PGND of the transistor T<b>3</b> is here in the low state, for example GND.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If a &#x201c;1&#x201d; is present on the local bitline LBL, the sense transistor T<b>3</b> is conducting, and the main sense amplifier MSA may then either detect the current flowing in the main bitline MBL through the transistor T<b>3</b>, or sense a voltage level change on the main bitline MBL (which drops since T<b>3</b> is conducting) if the node was initially floating.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">If a &#x201c;0&#x201d; is present on the local bitline LBL, the sense transistor T<b>3</b> is blocked and the main sense amplifier MSA may then either detect zero current on the main bitline MBL, or sense a non-modified voltage level on the main bitline MBL.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Writing</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">During an operation for writing a datum stored in a memory cell Ci, Cj connected to the local bitline LBL, and selected by means of word line, the transistor T<b>3</b> of the reading stage is blocked in order to avoid any corruption of the signal from the main sense amplifier MSA via the main bitline MBL, while the transistors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> of the reading stage conduct as efficiently as possible this signal from the main bitline MBL towards the local bitline LBL.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the following, a distinction is made between writing a &#x201c;0&#x201d; (Write 0 operation), and writing a &#x201c;1&#x201d; (Write 1 operation).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Write 0</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The inverter stage has, via the main bitline MBL, a &#x201c;1&#x201d; at its input.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A low state is applied to the back control gate <b>1</b> of the P channel transistor T<b>1</b> (Vbg<b>1</b> is for example at GND) in order to lower its threshold voltage as much as possible (preferably below VDD/2, for example around 100-200 mV in absolute value). The transistor T<b>1</b> is blocked insofar that it receives a high state on its front control gate. The power supply potential of the transistor T<b>1</b> is maintained at VDD, so that other nano-sense amplifiers in parallel (i.e. sharing the same power supply potential) may perform writing of a &#x201c;1&#x201d; at the same time.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The width of the nano-sense amplifier corresponds to two metal lines or two columns of cells in the case of a DRAM.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The memory cell, as for it, requires a Metal<b>1</b> line for attaching it to the local bitline and a Metal<b>2</b> line for attaching it to the word line. This leaves the Metal<b>3</b> line free for letting through the main bitline MBL.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Insofar that each column of the memory matrix requires a nano-sense amplifier, a possible organization may consist of arranging the nano-sense amplifiers head-to-tail as this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, a first nano-sense amplifier having on its input terminal the signal MBL<sub>E </sub>and addressing via its local bitline a series of cells along a first (even) column, the other nano-sense amplifier having on its input terminal the signal MBL<sub>O </sub>and addressing via its local bitline a series of cells along a second (odd) column directly following adjacent to the first column in the memory matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Preferential conditions for the operation of the nano-sense amplifier of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are threshold voltages of the transistors, close to VDD/2 and a variation of these threshold voltages by biasing the back control gates in a range approximately comprised between 100 mV and VDD/2+150 mV.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">These conditions involve lithography levels beginning at 55-45 nm (VDD of the order of 1 V, threshold voltage of the order of 350 mV and which decreases with the scale effect; the node 45 nm having been attained in 2007-2008), and thicknesses of the order of 2-20 nm for the thin layer of the SeOI substrate and of the order of 5-50 nm for the buried insulating layer of the SeOI substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It will be noted that the nano-sense amplifier is mainly developed for DRAM memories. However, it operates with any type of RAM memory (SRAM, PCRAM, CBRAM, ZRAM), as well as with flash memories (with, in this case, the requirement of maintaining relatively high voltages during the writing and deleting (erasing) operations; this may for example be achieved by using two transistors in series rather than a single one for the transistors T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As this was seen earlier, in the case of the DRAM, the nano-sense amplifier performs reading and writing operations but does not perform the refreshing/restoring operation; the latter being performed by the main sense amplifier MSA, a possible embodiment of which is described hereafter in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A DRAM cell actually requires being periodically refreshed in order to compensate charge losses and being restored after each read access.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The main sense amplifier MSA is connected to nano-sense amplifiers via a main bitline MBL on the one hand, and to the peripheral circuits via a data line DL on the other hand. The amplifier MSA comprises, in series between the potentials VDD and GND, three transistors T<b>6</b>-T<b>8</b>. Transistor T<b>6</b> is a P channel transistor, the front control gate of which is controlled by a signal &#x3a6;<b>2</b>. Transistor T<b>7</b> is an N channel transistor, the front control gate of which is connected to the main bitline MBL. Transistor T<b>8</b> is a P channel transistor, the front control gate of which is controlled by a signal &#x3a6;<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The amplifier MSA further comprises an N channel transistor T<b>10</b> between the main bitline MBL and a power supply potential at VDD/2 and the front control gate of which is controlled by a signal &#x3a6;<b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As this will be explained in more detail subsequently, the whole of the transistors T<b>6</b>-T<b>10</b> forms a stage for amplifying the signal delivered by a cell (on the local bitline LBL towards a nano-amplifier) during a reading operation.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The node A is connected to a high impedance inverter HZ<b>1</b>, the application of the inversion function of which is controlled by a control signal &#x3a6;<b>4</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, &#x3a6;<b>4</b>B designates the complementary of &#x3a6;<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The output of the high impedance inverter HZ<b>1</b> is looped back onto the main bitline MBL.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As this will be detailed subsequently, the inverter HZ<b>1</b> thus forms a switchable high impedance inverter stage for sending back the amplified signal on the main bitline following a reading operation.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">An operation for reading a &#x201c;1&#x201d; and for restoring this &#x201c;1&#x201d; implemented by the MSA amplifier is the following.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The read cell delivers a &#x201c;1&#x201d; on the local bitline LBL. The transistor T<b>3</b> of the nano-sense amplifier nSA discharges the main bitline MBL to the low state GND. Transistor T<b>7</b> is then blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The power supply potential V+ of the transistor T<b>9</b> is increased from VDD/2 to VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The control signal &#x3a6;<b>3</b> of the gate of the transistor T<b>8</b> is set to the high state VDD, so as to make the transistor T<b>8</b> conducting. As the transistor T<b>7</b> is blocked, it will cut the path towards the node A.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The control signal &#x3a6;<b>2</b> of the gate of the transistor T<b>6</b> is set to the low state GND, so as to make the transistor T<b>6</b> conducting. The potential of the node A then increases to VDD, which causes blocking of the transistor T<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The control signal &#x3a6;<b>4</b> will make the HZ<b>1</b> stage conducting. The latter conducts the main bitline MBL to the low state GND (by inversion of the high state of the node A), and sends back this low state to the nano-amplifier nSA, which will then rewrite a &#x201c;1&#x201d; (cf. previous discussion of a Write 1 writing operation by the nano-amplifier nSA).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The control signal &#x3a6;<b>5</b> will make the HZ<b>2</b> stage conducting.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">An operation for reading a &#x201c;0&#x201d; and for restoring this &#x201c;0&#x201d; performed by the amplifier MS A is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The cell read delivers a &#x201c;0&#x201d; on the local bitline LBL. The transistor T<b>3</b> of the nano-sense amplifier nSA remains blocked and the main bitline MBL remains at VDD/2. Transistor T<b>7</b> is then conducting.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The potential V+ of the transistor T<b>9</b> is increased from VDD/2 to VDD.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The transistor T<b>6</b> is a weak transistor as compared with the serial association of transistors T<b>7</b> and T<b>8</b>, the potential of the node A drops to &#x201c;0&#x201d;. This leads the transistor T<b>9</b> to a conducting (also weak) state, this has the consequence of leading the local bitline to VDD (from V+). Next, the transistor T<b>7</b> will lead the node A closer to the low state GND.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The control signal &#x3a6;<b>4</b> will make the stage HZ<b>1</b> conducting.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">A writing operation performed by the MSA amplifier is the following. From the point of view of the MSA amplifier, this operation is similar to a reading operation. The only difference stems from the initial conduction of the main bitline MBL because of its powering from the data line via the HZ<b>2</b> stage.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The following steps are the same, except with regard to the last point (transfer to the data line) which is out of context for a writing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">It will be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the different transistors T<b>6</b>-T<b>10</b> were illustrated with back control gates, each being respectively connected to the corresponding front control gate.

<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As examples, the back control gates of transistors T<b>7</b> and T<b>9</b> may be biased so that these transistors have relatively high threshold voltages and are thus weaker than the other transistors.</p>

It will be retained that because of problems of noise and of variability encountered with SRAM memories, the MSA amplifier described earlier may advantageously be used therein for reinforcing the quality of the signal and for increasing the security of such circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">An MSA amplifier of the same type may be used with RAM memories (PCRAM, CBRAM, FBC-DRAM, etc.). It may also be used with flash memories, while bringing attention to the requirement of supporting the relatively high voltages required by the memory cell.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">This second embodiment proves to be advantageous in that, in addition to the writing and reading operations, the nano-sense amplifier nSA is also capable of ensuring refreshing/restoring operations. It is therefore not necessary to resort to a main sense amplifier MSA, which is notably expressed by a gain in surface area.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Further, the metal (Metal<b>3</b>), which is used as a main bitline MBL within the scope of the first embodiment, may under certain circumstances prove to be too wide relatively to the dimensions of the memory cell.

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In the case where the datum to be read is a &#x201c;1&#x201d;, the local bitline LBL is initially in the low state. In this case indeed, upon opening the word line, the balance is not attained. Charges will then circulate between the cell and the local bitline LBL so as to equalize the voltages. The final voltage corresponds to a ratio between the capacitances of the local bitline LBL and of the cell (the longer the local bitline LBL, the weaker will be the signal). This voltage will be read by the nano-sense amplifier nSA.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The power supply potential V<b>1</b> is in the low state, while the back control gate of the transistor T<b>1</b> is in the high state. The threshold voltage of the transistor T<b>1</b> is then increased, the transistor T<b>1</b> then being blocked. The power supply potential V<b>2</b> is in the high state, while the back control gate of the transistor T<b>2</b> is in the low state. The threshold voltage of transistor T<b>2</b> is then increased, the transistor T<b>2</b> then being blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The power supply potential V<b>3</b> is in the low state (0 V), while the back control gate of the transistor T<b>3</b> is in the high state. The threshold voltage of the transistor T<b>3</b> is then lowered, while the transistor T<b>3</b> is conducting since its gate, connected to the local bitline LBL, has a greater potential than the threshold voltage of T<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The power supply potential V<b>4</b> is increased up to VDD, while the back control gate of the transistor T<b>4</b> is in the low state. The threshold voltage of the transistor T<b>4</b> is then increased. The result is that the node N<b>1</b> is led to 0 V.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Next, V<b>1</b> is increased, while Vbg<b>1</b> is brought to the low state. The threshold voltage of the transistor T<b>1</b> is lowered; T<b>1</b> being conducting insofar that its gate is connected to the node N<b>1</b> which is at 0 V. The transistor T<b>2</b>, the gate of which is also connected to the node N<b>1</b> at 0 V, is, as for it, blocked. The local bitline LBL is then led to VDD so that the datum may be refreshed.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The transistor T<b>5</b> is, as for it, blocked insofar that no decoder is yet active. The transistor T<b>5</b> is then made conducting when the potential of the node N<b>1</b> is stable at 0 V. The signal present on the N<b>1</b> node is then transferred onto the main bitline MBL.</p>

<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The main bitline MBL is in the high state.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The transistor T<b>5</b> is conducting, bringing the node N<b>1</b> to the high state.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">It will be noted that the transistor T<b>5</b> may however have a substrate effect and not pass the whole of the signal on N<b>1</b>. This however is not very important insofar that the 4 transistors T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> will amplify and restore the signal to &#x201c;clean&#x201d; logic levels.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">V<b>4</b> is brought from VDD/2 or more to the low state. The transistor T<b>4</b> is then blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">V<b>1</b> is brought from the low state to VDD, while Vbg<b>1</b> is brought from the high state to the low state. The threshold voltage of T<b>1</b> is low: T<b>1</b> is blocked (N<b>1</b> gate in the high state). Transistor T<b>2</b> is conducting, while transistor T<b>3</b> is blocked which allows the local bitline LBL to be brought to 0 V.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Next, V<b>4</b> is brought from the low state to VDD. The information is now stable in the amplifier formed by the transistors T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0179">V<b>1</b> is brought from the low state to VDD, while Vbg<b>1</b> is brought to the low state. The threshold voltage of T<b>1</b> is low: T<b>1</b> is conducting which allows the local bitline LBL to be brought to VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The transistor T<b>2</b> is blocked, while the transistor T<b>3</b> is conducting.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Next, V<b>4</b> is brought from the low state to VDD. T<b>4</b> is then blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Various physical considerations are presented hereafter as regards the nano-sense amplifier of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">As shown earlier, the local bitline LBL is pre-charged to GND while the main bitline LBL is pre-charged to VDD (or to the same level as V<b>4</b> during a reading operation).</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The transistors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> are as small as possible, their performances may be increased by virtue of their back control gate, and this both when they are conducting and when they are blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The transistor T<b>3</b> should drive the node N<b>1</b> and then the main bitline MBL during a reading operation; T<b>3</b> is as small as possible in order to minimize the charge of its front gate on the local bitline NBL and its performances may be increased by its back control gate for rapidly conducting N<b>1</b> and MBL.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">With the transistor T<b>4</b>, it is possible to secure the refreshing operations and to override the body effect of the transistor T<b>5</b>. It is selected to be as small as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The transistor T<b>5</b> should approximately have the same size as the transistor T<b>3</b>, if necessary with the same choices as regards the back control gate. The transistor T<b>5</b> is not critical per se but requires about 8 to 128 buses in order to be able to operate as a decoder.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Eventually, the nano-sense amplifier of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is wider than that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, essentially because of the decoding bus YDEC. This bus may however be shared between two adjacent matrices if these matrices store different data bits.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The nano-sense amplifier of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> however does not require any main sense amplifier, by which the increase in size may be compensated, as far as the YDEC bus has a reasonable size.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">With it, it is further possible to override the limitations due to possible congestion of the Metal<b>3</b> in the case of the first embodiment, insofar that the main bitline is decoded.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">It has to be noted that that the nano-sense amplifier according to the first embodiment presented on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is based on a &#x201c;half latch&#x201d; structure, while the nano-sense amplifier according to the second embodiment presented on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is constructed on the &#x201c;full latch&#x201d; structure. The proposed schematics are the preferred schematics but it is clear that these structures can be built on other schematics comprising more transistors either in the latching part or in the decoder or precharged parts.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The performance of the nano-sense amplifiers (both embodiments) is obtained through the use of a back gate on SeOI. However, it is clear that the principle can be also applied on any type of double-gate transistors having a second gate such as the multi-gate finFets for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">It has furthermore to be noted that the simplification of the schematics, through the reduction in number of devices and in their reduced sizes, makes the application of the nano-sense amplifier according to the invention very attractive to other (e.g. matrix array like) circuits than memories such as imagers or analogue converters for instance. In another application, the nano-sense amplifier can be used as a bus regenerator.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">As indicated earlier, the nano-sense amplifier provides its own reference (threshold voltage of transistor T<b>3</b>) and therefore it does not need the presence of a second matrix to serve as a reference like on a conventional architecture represented on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (indeed, conventional systems need a reference Matrix for compensation of unknown offset values that are due to irregularities in the fabrication process).</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In addition, as it will discussed in further details below, since the nano-sense amplifier is very compact, it can be arranged in a periodicity meeting the minimum pitch of memory arrays that can be attained with state of the art lithographic techniques. The additional area between adjacent memory arrays can further be used for other circuits, on-pitch or non-pitched circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The nano-sense amplifier having a reduced width, there is no need resorting to a stacking technique, a so-called &#x201c;staggering&#x201d; technique, for several conventional sense amplifier circuits behind each other in order to address several adjacent columns of memory cells while taking into account the pitch difference in between the sense amplifier and the cells).</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As shown on the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>, rather than making use of a single bank of 128 staggered conventional sense amplifiers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), it is possible to make use of two banks of nano-sense amplifiers (here the nano-sense amplifiers are said to be effectively &#x201c;on-pitch&#x201d; in that they may be as large as 2 times the pitch of the cells; it may also be possible to provide perfectly &#x201c;on-pitch&#x201d; nano-sense amplifiers, as large as the cells).</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">It further becomes possible to locally decode these nano-sense amplifiers by placing the logic of the column decoder on the &#x201c;free&#x201d; edge of a bank of nano-sense amplifiers bank as it is represented on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>. For instance, if the architecture of the conventional circuit initially required 128 busses to decode each sense amplifier within the bank like on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, then the new organization of the nano-sense amplifier and its decoder requires only 16 busses (8 most significant bits&#x2014;MSB&#x2014;and 8 least significant bits&#x2014;LSB) to fulfil the same functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">This feature is particularly advantageous as the nano-sense amplifier occupies significantly less area than the conventional sense amplifier and therefore needs only few metal busses over its area to decode the bank. Most of the column decoder circuit can be integrated into the on-pitch area and no longer need to be in the periphery of the memory, i.e. becomes an on-pitch circuit and thus becomes itself very small in area and has a much lower power consumption and a higher speed.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The integration of other circuit blocks into the on-pitch area, next to nano-sense amplifier banks can be extended for instance to the address buffers themselves as shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>. The address buffers can be distributed under the column decoder and the requirement for busses decreases to two groups of 3 addresses in the given example. This second row of function may be not &#x201c;on pitch&#x201d; as the number of circuits does not correspond to the array pitch.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Other functionalities can also be placed in a similar manner next to the nano-sense amplifiers banks, such as, for example voltage generators, pumps, analog functions, or redundancy control. There is virtually no constraint and the absence of bitline reference in the nano-sense amplifier provides flexibility to optimize all the peripheral functions of the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">It has been shown that placing the column decoder next to the nano-sense amplifier bank decreases the amount of busses needed by a factor 4. Furthermore, the remaining busses are shorter as they are integrated in the on-pitch area. The immediate consequence of a local decoding approach is a gain in area as the number of bus drivers (buffers) may be reduced thanks to the proximity, and they are smaller as well as less loaded. The power consumption is also reduced for the same reasons. Speed can be increased at no extra cost because of less parasitics.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Placing other circuits can be also beneficiary for the circuit. For instance, having this opportunity to place the different voltage generators next to their load (Vplate, VBLH, etc. . . ) reduces or cancels most of the sources of disturbances (ohmic losses, capacitive couplings) for these functions.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">It is clear that the organization shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>b </i>and <b>9</b><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>b </i>are examples, and the person skilled in the art would contemplate that other block organizations are possible. In particular the sense amplifiers could be organized on only one side of the array, or two blocks can be disposed on either side of the array to address the odd and even bitlines, respectively.</p>
