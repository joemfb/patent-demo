<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Japanese Application No. 2009-068739, filed Mar. 19, 2009.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a disk drive device that drives a recording disk.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, disk drive devices such as HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) are required to be further small in size. With such background, in a disk drive device that record data, for example, magnetically, data are recorded/reproduced with a magnetic head flying above a recording disk such that a slight gap between both is maintained while the recording disk is being rotated at a high speed. In order to miniaturize such a disk drive device, there is a demand that data are recorded/reproduced with the gap between the magnetic head and the recording disk being extremely narrow, for example, less than or equal to 10 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to miniaturize disk drive devices, a magnetoresistive effect element (hereinafter, referred to as an &#x201c;MR element&#x201d;) is used for the magnetic head. Due to the use of the MR element in such a narrow gap, there is a fear that a thermal asperity failure (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;TA failure&#x201d;) or a head crash failure may occur in the magnetic head. Specifically, the TA failure means that: minor foreign substances on the surface of the recording disk are in contact with the MR element while the magnetic head is flying to trace the recording tracks, and therefore heat is momentarily caused in the MR element due to kinetic energy of the foreign substances; and the resistance value of the MR element momentarily varies with the MR element being momentary heated followed by being cooled, resulting in superimposition of the varied resistance value on a reproduced signal as a noise such that correct reading of the reproduced signal is interfered.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Hei 11-120533 discloses a disk drive device in which a groove is provided near the record/reproduction element of the magnetic head in order to collect minor dust or foreign substances in the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a result of an investigation by the present inventor, the flowing knowledge has been acquired that the TA failure is caused with foreign substances (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;particles&#x201d;) that adhere to a disk drive device, having a size of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to approximately several &#x3bc;m, adhering to the surface of a recording disk due to a vibration or a flow of air.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disk drive device is provided with a member that forms a closed clean air space filled with clean air, and further provided with a recording disk and a hub that drives the recording disk mounted thereon in the clean air space, a bearing unit that rotatably supports the hub, a spindle drive unit that rotatably drives the hub, and a drive unit that drives the magnetic head in a fluctuating manner.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Particles sometimes occur from the member that forms the clean air space. The particles enter the clean air space and adhere to the recording disk. As more particles adhere to the recording disk, the probability of an occurrence of TA failure is increased. In addition, if more particles exist in the clean air space when the gap between the magnetic head and the recording disk is narrower, the probability of an occurrence of TA failure is increased. Thereby, correct reading of a reproduced signal may be interfered.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been made in view of these situations, and a purpose of the invention is to provide a technique in which occurrence of particles from a member that forms a clean air space in a disk drive device is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to solve the aforementioned problem, a disk drive device according to an embodiment of the present invention comprises: a base, a hub on which a recording disk is to be mounted, a bearing unit arranged on the base and configured to rotatably support the hub, and a spindle drive unit configured to rotatably drive the hub. The disk drive device has a circumferential ring wall portion, formed of a plastic, on the outer circumference of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the embodiment, particles due to rust do not occur from the circumferential ring wall portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another embodiment of the present invention also relates to a disk drive device. The device comprises: a base, a hub on which a recording disk is to be mounted, a bearing unit arranged on the base and configured to rotatably support the hub, a spindle drive unit configured to rotatably drive the hub, and a dust collecting filter provided on the outer circumference of the base. The base comprises a guide groove on the surface thereof, facing the mounted recording disk, so that air flows into a suction port for the dust collecting filter when the recording disk is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the embodiment, particles are guided to the dust collecting filter by the guide groove to which the particles have been brought by the flow of air generated with the rotation of the recording disk, thereby allowing the particles to be collected by the dust collecting filter.</p>

The doughnut-shaped recording disk <b>5</b> is mounted on an outward extension portion <b>24</b> of the hub <b>4</b>, the outward extension portion being flange-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The bearing unit <b>10</b> has a radial dynamic pressure groove and a thrust dynamic pressure groove. The bearing unit <b>10</b> may be configured to include the shaft <b>3</b> and the sleeve <b>2</b>, and is arranged on the base <b>1</b>. The radial dynamic pressure groove and the thrust dynamic pressure groove serve as a bearing that rotatably supports the hub <b>4</b>. Two herringbone-shaped radial dynamic pressure grooves are formed on the inner circumferential surface of the sleeve <b>2</b> so as to be vertically spaced apart from each other. The herringbone-shaped or spiral-shaped thrust dynamic pressure grooves are formed on the surface of the flange <b>9</b>, facing the lower surface of the sleeve <b>2</b>, and on the surface of the flange <b>9</b>, facing the plate <b>12</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The spindle drive unit <b>14</b> has the stator core <b>8</b>, the coil <b>6</b>, and the magnet <b>7</b>. The coil <b>6</b> is formed by winding a predetermined wire around the salient pole of the stator core <b>8</b>, starting from the lower side of the salient pole, until a predetermined number of wirings are performed; and thereafter by winding the predetermined wire around the successively adjacent salient pole of the stator core <b>8</b>, starting from the upper side of the salient pole. As stated above, after a predetermined number of wirings have been performed around the salient poles of the stator core <b>8</b> in succession, the end of the wire where the winding has ended is pulled out toward the lower side of the salient pole of the stator core <b>8</b>. The end of the wire is further pulled out toward the opposite side of the base <b>1</b> thorough the hole provided in the base <b>1</b> so as to be electrically connected to a wiring member wired on the lower surface of the opposite side of the base <b>1</b>. The end of the wire thus pulled out is fixed with an adhesive so as not to unlay. Such fixation of the wire is performed such that disconnection of the wire, due to a vibration of a large amplitude created by a resonance of the wire during an ultrasonic wave cleaning, is prevented. When a three-phase current having an approximate sine wave shape is applied to the coil <b>6</b> through the wiring member by a predetermined drive circuit, the coil <b>6</b> generates a rotating magnetic field. A rotating drive force is generated by the interaction of the driving magnetic poles of the magnet <b>7</b> with the rotating magnetic field generated by the coil <b>6</b>, which rotates the rotating body portion <b>18</b>. That is, the spindle drive unit <b>14</b> rotationally drives the rotating body portion <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The head drive unit <b>20</b> comprises a magnetic head <b>42</b>, a head suspension <b>44</b>, a swing arm <b>50</b>, a pivot assembly <b>46</b>, and a voice coil motor <b>48</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Herein, the problem recognized by the present inventor will be described based on the structure according to the comparative technique. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a top view of a disk drive device <b>200</b> according to the comparative technique, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the disk drive device <b>200</b> according to the comparative technique. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line A&#x2032;-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A base <b>51</b> and a circumferential ring wall portion <b>59</b> on the outer circumference of the base <b>51</b>, in the disk drive device <b>200</b> according to the comparative technique, are formed by cutting a base material integrally molded by the aluminum die-casting. The circumferential ring wall portion <b>59</b> is provided with a plurality of screw holes <b>58</b> for fixing a top cover <b>54</b> with a screw <b>56</b>. The screw holes <b>58</b> are formed by drilling the base material formed by the aluminum die-casting and thereafter by tapping. Subsequently, the base <b>51</b> and the circumferential ring wall portion <b>59</b> are cleaned with water to remove foreign substances such as particles on the surfaces of both. However, a slight amount of the cleaning water remains in the screw holes <b>58</b> after the cleaning. The remaining cleaning water reacts with the aluminum material, which causes rust. There has been a problem that the rust becomes particles and enter the clean air space <b>52</b> then adhere to the recording disk, which increases the probability of an occurrence of TA failure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> according to the embodiment is formed by the plastic molding in order to deal with this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As a result, no particles from the rust caused in the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> are located and hence less particles adhere to the recording disk <b>5</b>, accordingly allowing the occurrences of TA failure to be reduced. As a plastic for molding the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b>, various materials such as a thermosetting plastic and a thermoplastic, can be used. For example, SUMIKA SUPER&#xae; LCP (Liquid Crystal Polymer) made by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.&#xae; that is an LCP, C-600 SG made by Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd.&#xae; that is a PPS (Polyphenylene Sulfide), or ULTEM made by Nippon Polypenco Ltd.&#xae; that is a PEI (Polyetherimide), are preferable in terms of easily ensuring the accuracy. When conductivity is needed in order to deal with static electricity, carbon fibers may be added in the plastic for molding the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b>. In addition, glass fibers may be added in the plastic for molding the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> in order to enhance its mechanical strength.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> according to the embodiment is formed by filling a mold with a plastic in a state where the base <b>1</b> is placed in the mold. Thereby, there is no space in the boundary portion between the base <b>1</b> and the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b>, allowing the airtightness of the clean air space <b>52</b> to be enhanced. As a method of filling a mold with a plastic, various methods can be adopted. For example, the injection molding or the compression molding is preferable in terms of easily ensuring the accuracy. In addition, the base <b>1</b> may be formed in advance by the following-described method.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> according to the embodiment may be formed by filling a mold with a plastic material with the use of a side gate method, a pin gate method, or a film gate method. Thereby, a desired shape of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> can be formed stably and accurately, and hence the space in the boundary portion between the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> and the top cover <b>34</b> is nearly zero even when the top cover <b>34</b> is fixed to the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b>, allowing the airtightness of the clean air space <b>52</b> to be enhanced. In the side gate method, the plastic material is injected into the wall portion on the outer circumference side of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b>. As a result, partial unevenness of its density in the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> is eliminated, allowing the desired shape of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> to be obtained stably. In the pin gate method, the plastic material is injected into the upper end surface of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b>, which is in contact with the top cover <b>34</b>. As a result, unevenness of its density in the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> is eliminated, allowing the desired shape of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> to be obtained stably. In the film gate method, the plastic material is injected into the wall portion on the outer circumference side of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b>. As a result, the density of the plastic material is further evened out, allowing the desired shape of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> to be obtained stably. In addition, the surface of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> becomes flatter in the use temperature range, thereby the space in the boundary portion between the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> and the top cover <b>34</b> is nearly zero even when the top cover <b>34</b> is fixed to the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b>, allowing the airtightness of the clean air space <b>52</b> to be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A holes-including area <b>60</b> of the base <b>1</b> may be formed integrally. Specifically, the holes-including area, having the pivot hole <b>30</b> through which the rotational axis of the head drive unit <b>20</b> for driving the magnetic head <b>42</b> is inserted and the bearing hole <b>31</b> through which the bearing unit <b>10</b> is inserted, may be integrated when the pivot hole <b>30</b> and the bearing hole <b>31</b> are formed. The holes-including area <b>60</b> includes the area where the pivot hole <b>30</b> and the bearing hole <b>31</b> are formed and the area where the pivot hole <b>30</b> and the bearing hole <b>31</b> are connected together. Alternatively, the holes-including area <b>60</b> may be the entire base <b>1</b>. The integral formation of the holes-including area <b>60</b> means that the holes-including area <b>60</b> is composed of one member. Accordingly, the integral formation of the holes-including area <b>60</b> does not include the case where, for example, the area of the base <b>1</b> where the pivot hole <b>30</b> and the bearing hole <b>31</b> are connected together is in advance separate from the base <b>1</b>, and the base <b>1</b> is formed by fixing respective members, respectively necessary for the pivot hole <b>30</b> and the bearing hole <b>31</b>, to both holes and subsequently by connecting the separate area to the base <b>1</b>. For example, the pivot hole <b>30</b> and the bearing hole <b>31</b>, included in the holes-including area <b>60</b>, are simultaneously formed in the same process. For example, in the disk drive device <b>100</b>, the positional relationship between the rotational center of the head drive unit <b>20</b> and that of the recording disk <b>5</b> sometimes varies over time due to the error in joining both or temperature. If such positional relationship varies, the magnetic head <b>42</b> cannot trace a desired recording track, causing an error rate in reading/writing data to be increased. By integrally forming the holes-including area <b>60</b>, the variation in the positional relationship can be smaller, allowing the error rate in reading/writing data to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The holes-including area <b>60</b> of the base <b>1</b> may be formed of an aluminum alloy and integrally formed by the die-casting (hereinafter, referred to as the &#x201c;aluminum die-casting&#x201d;). For example, the pivot hole <b>30</b> and the bearing hole <b>31</b> are integrally formed in the holes-including area <b>60</b> of the base <b>1</b> by the same machining process after a cation electrodeposition coating (hereinafter, referred to as an &#x201c;ED coat&#x201d;) is performed on the base material formed by the aluminum die-casting molding. Thereby, a variation in the positional relationship on the base <b>1</b> between the rotational center of the head drive unit <b>20</b> and that of the recording disk <b>5</b> is smaller, allowing the error rate in reading/writing data to be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Alternatively, the holes-including area <b>60</b> may be integrally formed by pressing a metal plate material. Thereby, efforts in processing the holes-including area <b>60</b> of the base <b>1</b> is reduced, allowing the productivity of the disk drive device <b>100</b> to be improved. As a metal plate material, the following materials may be used. For example, the metal plate whose major element is aluminum is preferable in terms of being lightweight and rust-resistant. The metal plate obtained by the press-molding of a cold rolled plate and then by performing an electroless nickel plating has strong magnetism, and therefore preferable in terms of stabilizing the rotational accuracy of the rotating body portion <b>18</b> by drawing the magnet <b>7</b> even if a vibration moment is applied to the disk drive device <b>100</b> and in terms of having a high strength. A stainless metal plate is preferable in terms of having a high strength and being rust-resistant. In particular, a stainless steel having strong magnetism, such as a ferritic stainless steel (SUS430), is preferable in terms of stabilizing the rotational accuracy of the rotating body portion <b>18</b> by drawing the magnet <b>7</b> even if a vibration moment is applied to the disk drive device <b>100</b> and in terms of having a high strength and being rust-resistant. As a process of the metal plate, the following process may be used. For example, the metal plate is formed by pressing with the use of a progressive mold or a transfer mold. In the process, the pivot hole <b>30</b> and the bearing hole <b>31</b> may be formed in the same process.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A plurality of joint holes <b>72</b> are formed in the area of the base <b>64</b>, covered with the cover portion <b>68</b>. The cover portion <b>68</b> on the upper side of the base <b>64</b> and that on the lower side of the base <b>64</b> are joined together via the joint holes <b>72</b>. Thereby, the degree of adhesion between the base <b>64</b> and the cover portion <b>68</b> is enhanced, allowing for the horizontal rigidity of the chassis <b>66</b> to be enhanced.</p>

The manufacturing cost of the disk drive device <b>100</b> can be suppressed and the disk drive device <b>100</b> can be lightweight, by increasing the ratio of the plastic contained in the chassis <b>66</b>. Machining of portions having a complicated shape can be reduced by replacing part of the surface of the base <b>64</b> with a plastic, the molding of which is easily performed, allowing the productivity of the disk drive device <b>100</b> to be improved. The cover portion <b>68</b> and the circumferential ring wall portion <b>70</b> may be formed by filling a mold with a plastic in a state where the base <b>64</b> is placed in the mold. Thereby, the productivity can be expected to be more improved. In the pin gate method, a plastic material may be injected into the circumferential ring wall portion <b>70</b> of the base <b>64</b> and into the upper surface of the cover portion <b>68</b>. The material of the cover portion <b>68</b> may be the same as that of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b>.</p>

A chassis <b>84</b> further comprises the cover portion <b>74</b> in addition to the base <b>78</b> and the circumferential ring wall portion <b>70</b> of the outer frame of the chassis <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The base <b>78</b> may have a hole <b>76</b> around the bearing hole <b>31</b> through which the bearing unit <b>10</b> is inserted.

The hole <b>76</b> is sealed by the cover portion <b>74</b> such that the airtightness of the clean air space <b>52</b> is maintained, preventing particles from entering the clean air space <b>52</b>. The disk drive device <b>100</b> can be lightweight by providing the hole <b>76</b> in the metal base <b>78</b>. The circumferential ring wall portion <b>70</b> and the cover portion <b>74</b> may be formed by filling a mold with a plastic in a state where the base <b>78</b> is placed in the mold.

The guide groove <b>96</b> has a first guide surface <b>92</b> and a second guide surface <b>93</b>, which form the inner wall of the guide groove <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The first guide surface <b>92</b> is provided in the area between the place <b>98</b> where the rectangular portion and the annular portion of the inner circumference of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b> are connected together, and the suction port <b>95</b>, along the annular portion of the inner circumference of the circumferential ring wall portion <b>40</b>. The second guide surface <b>93</b> is lineally provided in the place between the vicinity of the outer circumference of the hub <b>4</b> and the suction port <b>95</b>. The suction port <b>95</b> is connectively arranged at the end of the guide groove <b>96</b>, where the width between the first guide surface <b>92</b> and the second guide surface <b>93</b> is narrowed. The suction port <b>95</b> is located at the vicinity of the outer circumference of the recording disk <b>5</b>. A flow of air, generated by the rotation of the recording disk <b>5</b>, is controlled by the first guide surface <b>92</b> and the second guide surface <b>93</b> such that the controlled air is guided to the dust collecting filter <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Herein, when the recording disk <b>5</b> is rotated, air flows toward the rotating direction of the recording disk <b>5</b> in an annular space in the clean air space <b>52</b>. When the clean air space <b>52</b> in the concaved portion of the chassis <b>32</b> is divided into two (up and down) by the straight line connecting the pivot hole <b>30</b> and the bearing hole <b>31</b>, as illustrated in this drawing, air flows from a rectangular space into the annular space on the upper side due to the rotation of the recording disk <b>5</b>, whereas air flows out from the annular space on the lower side into the rectangular space. Therefore, the suction port <b>95</b> and the guide groove <b>96</b> are arranged on the side where air flows from the rectangular space into the annular space in the clean air space <b>52</b> at the time of the rotation of the recording disk <b>5</b>, when the chassis <b>32</b> is divided into two on the basis of the line connecting the bearing hole <b>31</b> and the pivot hole <b>30</b>. Thereby, particles can be collected efficiently. When the rotating direction of the recording disk <b>5</b> is clockwise, the dust collecting filter <b>94</b>, the suction port <b>95</b>, and the guide groove <b>96</b> are to be provided at the symmetric positions with respect to the line connecting the bearing hole <b>31</b> and the pivot hole <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A guide portion <b>97</b> is provided between the suction port <b>95</b> and the dust collecting filter <b>94</b> in order to prevent particles from leaking into the annular space in the clean air space <b>52</b>. The particles, detached by the rotation of the rotating body portion <b>18</b> and the recording disk <b>5</b>, are guided to the dust collecting filter <b>94</b> by the guide groove <b>96</b> to which the particles are brought by the flow of air generated with the rotation of the recording disk <b>5</b>, eventually being collected by the dust collecting filter <b>94</b>. Thereby, the attachment of the particles to the recording disk <b>5</b> can be suppressed, allowing an occurrence of TA failure to be suppressed. The embodiment in which the dust collecting filter <b>94</b> and the guide groove <b>96</b> are provided may be combined with the aforementioned embodiment in which part of the chassis is formed of a plastic, thereby TA failure can be expected to be more improved.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The present invention should not be limited to the aforementioned each embodiment, and various modifications, such as design modifications, can be made with respect to the above embodiments based on the knowledge of those skilled in the art. The structure illustrated in each drawing is intended to exemplify an example, and the structure can be appropriately modified to a structure having a similar function, which can provide similar effects.</p>
