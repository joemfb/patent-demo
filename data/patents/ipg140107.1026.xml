Alternatively, one or more of the side panels <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> could be free from fold lines such that the side panels are substantially planar when the carrier <b>5</b> is assembled, or the side panels could be otherwise shaped, arranged, and/or configured without departing from the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, in one exemplary method of erection, the carrier <b>5</b> may be erected from the blank <b>3</b> by first folding the reinforcement flaps <b>82</b>, <b>86</b> about respective fold lines <b>87</b>, <b>89</b> to be in face-to-face relationship with the upper portion <b>28</b> of the second top panel <b>26</b>. The interior surface of the reinforcement flaps <b>82</b>, <b>86</b> can be secured to the interior surface of the top portion <b>28</b> of the second top panel <b>26</b> with adhesive (not shown) placed between the reinforcement flaps and the second top panel prior to positioning the reinforcement flaps and the second top panel in face-to-face contact as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, glue <b>158</b> can be applied to the exterior surface of the inwardly-folded reinforcement flaps <b>82</b>, <b>86</b> for securing the top portion <b>28</b> of the first top panel <b>24</b> to the reinforcement flaps. The retention portion <b>93</b> is in face-to-face contact with the retention flap <b>72</b> of the second top panel <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the first side panel <b>10</b> is folded at fold line <b>107</b> to place the back panel <b>8</b> in face-to-face relationship with the front panel <b>6</b> and the second top panel <b>26</b>, with inwardly-folded reinforcement flaps <b>82</b>, <b>86</b>, in face-to-face relationship with the first top panel <b>24</b>. The adhesive <b>158</b> applied to the exterior surface of the reinforcement flaps <b>82</b>, <b>86</b> can adhesively secure the upper portion <b>28</b> of the first top panel <b>24</b> to the reinforcement flaps when the reinforcement flaps and the first top panel are placed in face-to-face contact. When the upper portion <b>28</b> of the first top panel <b>24</b> is secured to the reinforcement flaps <b>82</b>, <b>86</b>, the retention flap <b>72</b> of the first top panel is in face-to-face contact with the retention portion <b>93</b> of the reinforcement flap <b>82</b>, which has already been placed in face-to-face contact with the retention flap <b>72</b> of the second top panel <b>26</b>. Therefore, the retention portion <b>93</b> is sandwiched between the two retention flaps <b>72</b> and the two combined retention flaps and intervening retention portion are adjacent a respective middle opening <b>50</b>. The second side panel <b>12</b> is positioned to partially overlap the third side panel <b>14</b> and is attached to the third side panel. The blank <b>3</b> is further erected into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wherein the blank comprises a sleeve <b>150</b> having an open-ended bottom <b>153</b> for inserting the containers C. In the partially assembled position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the top portions <b>28</b> of the top panels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are adhered together by attachment to the reinforcement flaps <b>82</b>, <b>86</b>, and the bottom portions <b>30</b> of the top panels are independently positionable relative to the top portions at fold lines <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. Alternatively, the reinforcement flaps <b>82</b>, <b>86</b> can be omitted and the top panels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> can be in face-to-face contact and adhered directly to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, the containers C can be inserted through the open bottom <b>153</b> of the sleeve <b>150</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Alternatively, the sleeve <b>150</b> could be lowered onto a grouping of six containers C without departing from the scope of this disclosure. The caps CP of the containers are moved through the openings <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> in the top panels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. As the containers are placed in the sleeve <b>150</b>, the bottom portions <b>30</b> of the top panels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are folded upward at fold lines <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and are positioned to extend outward from the upper portions <b>28</b> of the top panels. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the upper portions <b>28</b> of the top panels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are generally perpendicular to the bottom portions <b>30</b> of the top panels. Further, in the illustrated embodiment, the bottom portions <b>30</b> have a generally arcuate cross-sectional shape, such that the bottom portions of the top panels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> extend upward from the upper portions <b>28</b> of the top panels at fold lines <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and then downward to the fold lines <b>23</b>, <b>25</b> connecting the front or back panels <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>. As the middle containers C are positioned in the carrier <b>5</b>, the middle container of each of the front and back side of the carrier (e.g., the container C received in a respective opening <b>50</b>) is positioned to contact the overlapped retention flaps <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, the first bottom flap <b>16</b> is secured to the second bottom flap <b>18</b> by first respectively engaging the primary male locking tabs <b>100</b> with the primary female locking edges <b>90</b>. The secondary male locking flaps <b>102</b> are respectively inserted through, and cooperatively interact with, the slits <b>92</b> to further secure the first bottom flap <b>16</b> to the second bottom flap <b>18</b>. The third bottom flap <b>19</b> is upwardly folded at fold line <b>21</b> prior to securing the first bottom flap <b>16</b> to the second bottom flap <b>18</b>. The secured together bottom flaps <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and the third bottom flap <b>19</b> cooperate to form a bottom panel <b>160</b> of the carrier <b>5</b>. Alternatively, the carrier <b>5</b> could have other bottom closure flap arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the carrier <b>5</b> with a portion of the carrier cut-away to show the two retention flaps <b>72</b> positioned between the middle containers C and in contact with a respective middle container at a front and back side of the carrier. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when the containers C are loaded into the carrier <b>5</b>, the wide bottoms B of each of the two middle containers C contact a respective retention flap <b>72</b> which is connected to respective upper portions <b>28</b> of the top panels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. The middle containers C apply a contact/compression force to hold the retention flaps <b>72</b> in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The compression force applied by the two middle containers C keeps the retention flaps <b>72</b> in the lowered position with the handle <b>27</b> in the lowered position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>. If one of the two middle containers C are removed, the compression force is eliminated and the retention flaps <b>72</b> (and the upper portion <b>28</b> of the top panels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>) are released and are free to raise upward from the lowered or loaded position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref> to the raised position generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The containers C and features (e.g., retention flaps <b>72</b>, retention portion <b>93</b>, handle <b>27</b>, etc.) of the carrier <b>5</b> may be otherwise positioned, shaped, and/or arranged without departing from this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The carrier <b>5</b> may be carried at openings <b>31</b>, <b>33</b> of the handle <b>27</b> by pushing the handle flaps <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> from either side of the carrier and grasping the top portion <b>28</b> of the top panels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, containers C can be removed from the carrier by removing the dispenser panels <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. The dispenser panels <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> can be removed by grasping a respective actuating tab <b>62</b>, <b>63</b> and tearing the dispenser panel at a respective tear line <b>61</b>, <b>63</b>. Once a dispenser panel <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> is removed, a container C can be removed from the carrier <b>5</b>. As noted above, if a middle container C is removed from the carrier <b>5</b>, the holding force acting on the retention flaps <b>72</b> will be eliminated, causing the upper portion <b>28</b> of the top panels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> with the handle <b>27</b> to be released and moved to the raised position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The containers C can be removed from the carrier by other tearing or dispensing features without departing from the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The exemplary carrier embodiment discussed above accommodates six containers C arranged in two rows, but the present disclosure is not limited to these numbers. As one example, additional containers may be accommodated by increasing the size of the blank <b>3</b> (e.g., in the longitudinal direction L<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and forming additional container-receiving spaces therein. Also, the blank <b>3</b> could have less than six container-receiving spaces without departing from the disclosure. Further, the retention flaps <b>72</b> could be otherwise positioned (e.g., adjacent opening <b>46</b> and/or <b>48</b>) without departing from the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In general, the blank may be constructed from paperboard having a caliper so that it is heavier and more rigid than ordinary paper. The blank can also be constructed of other materials, such as cardboard, or any other material having properties suitable for enabling the carton to function at least generally as described above. The blank can be coated with, for example, a clay coating. The clay coating may then be printed over with product, advertising, and other information or images. The blanks may then be coated with a varnish to protect information printed on the blanks. The blanks may also be coated with, for example, a moisture barrier layer, on either or both sides of the blanks. The blanks can also be laminated to or coated with one or more sheet-like materials at selected panels or panel sections.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As an example, a tear line can include: a slit that extends partially into the material along the desired line of weakness, and/or a series of spaced apart slits that extend partially into and/or completely through the material along the desired line of weakness, or various combinations of these features. As a more specific example, one type of tear line is in the form of a series of spaced apart slits that extend completely through the material, with adjacent slits being spaced apart slightly so that a nick (e.g., a small somewhat bridging-like piece of the material) is defined between the adjacent slits for typically temporarily connecting the material across the tear line. The nicks are broken during tearing along the tear line. The nicks typically are a relatively small percentage of the tear line, and alternatively the nicks can be omitted from or torn in a tear line such that the tear line is a continuous cut line. That is, it is within the scope of the present disclosure for each of the tear lines to be replaced with a continuous slit, or the like. For example, a cut line can be a continuous slit or could be wider than a slit without departing from the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with the exemplary embodiments, a fold line can be any substantially linear, although not necessarily straight, form of weakening that facilitates folding therealong. More specifically, but not for the purpose of narrowing the scope of the present disclosure, fold lines include: a score line, such as lines formed with a blunt scoring knife, or the like, which creates a crushed or depressed portion in the material along the desired line of weakness; a cut that extends partially into a material along the desired line of weakness, and/or a series of cuts that extend partially into and/or completely through the material along the desired line of weakness; and various combinations of these features. In situations where cutting is used to create a fold line, typically the cutting will not be overly extensive in a manner that might cause a reasonable user to incorrectly consider the fold line to be a tear line.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The above embodiments may be described as having one or more panels adhered together by glue during erection of the carrier embodiments. The term &#x201c;glue&#x201d; is intended to encompass all manner of adhesives commonly used to secure carton panels in place.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The foregoing description of the disclosure illustrates and describes various embodiments. As various changes could be made in the above construction without departing from the scope of the disclosure, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. Furthermore, the scope of the present disclosure covers various modifications, combinations, alterations, etc., of the above-described embodiments.
