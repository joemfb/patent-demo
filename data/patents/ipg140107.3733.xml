<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An illumination unit includes: one or more light sources, an optical member, and an optical device. The optical member includes an integrator having a first fly-eye lens on which light from a solid-state light-emitting device is incident and a second fly-eye lens on which the light from the first fly-eye lens is incident. The integrator uniformalizes an illuminance distribution of light in a predetermined illumination region illuminated by the light incident from the solid-state light-emitting device. The optical device is disposed on an optical path between the first fly-eye lens and one or more light sources including one or more chips configured by the laser diode, and allows a shape of a luminance distribution of incidence light on an incidence plane of the first fly-eye lens to be expanded along a minor axis direction of the shape of the luminance distribution.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates to an illumination unit that uses a solid-state light-emitting device such as a laser diode (LD), and to a projection display unit and a direct view display unit each of which includes the same.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, a projector which projects a picture onto a screen has been used widely not only in offices but also in households. The projector modulates, using a light bulb, light derived from a light source to generate image light, and project the thus-generated image light onto the screen to perform displaying (for reference, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-134324). Nowadays, a palm-size microprojector, a mobile phone incorporating the microprojector, etc., have gradually been in widespread use.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a light source used in a projector, a high-luminance discharge lamp is the mainstream. The discharge lamp, however, has a comparatively large size and a large power consumption. Hence, a solid-state light-emitting device such as a light-emitting diode (LED), a laser diode (LD), and an organic EL (OLED) attracts attention recently as a light source substitute for the discharge lamp. These solid-state light-emitting devices are more advantageous over the discharge lamp not only in size and power consumption but also in high reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a projector generally uses an integrator including such as a fly-eye lens to achieve reduction in luminance non-uniformity of illumination light (i.e., to uniformalize the luminance of the illumination light). In some cases, however, the luminance non-uniformity of the illumination light may not be reduced enough even when the integrator is used. Further improvement is thus desired.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is desirable to provide an illumination unit capable of reducing luminance non-uniformity of illumination light, and a projection display unit and a direct view display unit each of which uses the illumination light.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the coupling lens <b>20</b>A, for example, may turn the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>A into substantially parallel light, and may convert a traveling-direction-angle (&#x3b8;<sub>H</sub>, &#x3b8;<sub>V</sub>) of the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>A to be equal to a traveling-direction-angle of the parallel light, or to allow the traveling-direction-angle (&#x3b8;<sub>H</sub>, &#x3b8;<sub>V</sub>) of the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>A to be approximate to the traveling-direction-angle of the parallel light. The coupling lens <b>20</b>A is disposed at a position where light within the traveling-direction-angle of the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>A is incident. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the coupling lens <b>20</b>B, for example, may turn the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>B into substantially parallel light, and may convert a traveling-direction-angle (&#x3b8;<sub>H</sub>, &#x3b8;<sub>V</sub>) of the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>B to be equal to a traveling-direction-angle of the parallel light, or to allow the traveling-direction-angle (&#x3b8;<sub>H</sub>, &#x3b8;<sub>V</sub>) of the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>B to be approximate to the traveling-direction-angle of the parallel light. The coupling lens <b>20</b>B is disposed at a position where light within the traveling-direction-angle of the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>B is incident. The coupling lens <b>20</b>C, for example, may turn the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>C into substantially parallel light, and may convert a traveling-direction-angle (&#x3b8;<sub>H</sub>, &#x3b8;<sub>V</sub>) of the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>C to be equal to a traveling-direction-angle of the parallel light, or to allow the traveling-direction-angle (&#x3b8;<sub>H</sub>, &#x3b8;<sub>V</sub>) of the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>C to be approximate to the traveling-direction-angle of the parallel light, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The coupling lens <b>20</b>C is disposed at a position where light within the traveling-direction-angle of the light emitted from the light source <b>10</b>C is incident. In other words, the coupling lenses <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, and <b>20</b>C are arranged for the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C, respectively, in a one by one fashion (i.e., arranged for the packages, respectively). It is to be noted that each of the coupling lenses <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, and <b>20</b>C may include a single lens, or may include a plurality of lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Each of the dichroic mirrors <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B may include one mirror having a wavelength selective property. This mirror may be configured by, for example, depositing plural layers of interference films. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the dichroic mirror <b>30</b>A may allow light incident from a back surface of the mirror (the light entered from the light source <b>10</b>A) to transmit toward a front surface of the mirror, and may allow light incident from the front surface of the mirror (the light entered from the light source <b>10</b>B) to be reflected from the mirror, for example. On the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the dichroic mirror <b>30</b>B may allow light incident from a back surface of the mirror (the light of each of the light sources <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B entered from the dichroic mirror <b>30</b>A) to transmit toward a front surface of the mirror, and may allow light incident from the front surface of the mirror (the light entered from the light source <b>10</b>C) to be reflected from the mirror, for example. Thus, the optical path unifying device <b>30</b> unifies each individual light flux emitted from the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C into a single light flux.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, each of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A and the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B is configured by a plurality of lenses (for example, cells) arranged in a predetermined array state (in one embodiment, in a form of a matrix having five rows and five columns). In other words, the cells in each of the fly-eye lenses <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B are arranged along each direction (array directions) of the horizontal direction (for example, the x-axis direction or a first direction) and the vertical direction (for example, the y-axis direction or a second direction) which intersect (or are orthogonal to) each other. The plurality of cells <b>42</b> included in the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B are disposed to face, in one-by-one fashion, the plurality of cells <b>41</b> included in the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B. The fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A (for example, a first fly-eye lens) is disposed at a focal position (or disposed in the focal position substantially) of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B, and the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B (for example, a second fly-eye lens) is disposed at a focal position (or disposed in the focal position substantially) of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A. Thus, the integrator <b>40</b> allows the light fluxes divided and formed in the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A to be focused on locations near a lens face of the fly-eye lens <b>10</b>B on an image side thereof, and forms a secondary light source face (a light source image) thereat. This secondary light source face is located at a position of a face which is conjugate with an entrance pupil of the projection optical system <b>70</b>. However, it is not necessary for the secondary light source face to be located strictly at the position of the face conjugate with the entrance pupil of the projection optical system <b>70</b>. The secondary light source face may be located at a position within an allowable range of design. Also, the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A and the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B may be formed integrally (for example, may be an integrated member).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In general, a light flux exited from each of light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C has an intensity distribution (for example, a luminance distribution) which is non-uniform in a plane perpendicular to a direction of travel thereof. Thus, an illuminance distribution (for example, a luminance distribution) in the illumination region <b>60</b>A (the irradiated surface) is non-uniform when those light fluxes are directed as they are to the illumination region <b>60</b>A. However, dividing each of the light fluxes exited from the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C into the plurality of light fluxes with the integrator <b>40</b> as described above and guiding those thus-divided plurality of light fluxes in a superimposed fashion to the illumination region <b>60</b>A allow the illuminance distribution on the illumination region <b>60</b>A to be uniform (for example, make it possible to reduce non-uniformity of the illuminance distribution).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The condenser lens <b>50</b> condenses the light fluxes, derived from multiple light sources (such as the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C) and generated by the integrator <b>40</b>, to illuminate in a superimposed fashion the illumination region <b>60</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The spatial modulation device <b>60</b> two-dimensionally modulates, based on a color image signal corresponding to a wavelength component of each of the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C, the light flux derived from the illumination optical system <b>1</b>A, to thereby generate the image light. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the spatial modulation device <b>60</b> in one embodiment may be a device of a transmission type, and may be configured by a transmissive liquid crystal panel, for example.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">[Detailed Configuration of Projector <b>1</b>]</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A detailed configuration of the projector <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">[First Part]</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the first embodiment, at least one of the chips <b>11</b>A in the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C as a whole is configured by the LD (such as a semiconductor laser, for example). Hence, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a laser beam emitted from the light-emitting spots <b>11</b>B of the chip <b>11</b>A configured such as by the LD, shows a luminance distribution shape in which a far-field pattern (FFP) is sharp, for example. In other words, a shape of the FFP in the laser beam is anisotropic (for example, oval in one embodiment) rather than circle (for example, isotropic), as denoted by P<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Further, in the first embodiment, a major axis direction of a shape of a luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; (the luminance distribution shape) of the incidence light in an incidence face (a light incidence face) of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A differs from the array direction of the respective cells <b>41</b> in the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, for example. More specifically, the major axis direction and a minor axis direction of the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; in the incidence light differ from both the array directions (for example, the horizontal direction (the x-axis direction) and the vertical direction (the y-axis direction)) of the respective cells <b>41</b>. In other words, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, the major axis direction in the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; and the array directions of the respective cells <b>41</b> (here, the x-axis direction of the array directions, for example) do not coincide with each other, and form a predetermined angle &#x3b8; (such as an inclination angle and a rotation angle, for example) relative to each other. As will be described later in detail, this thereby makes it easier to reduce a luminance non-uniformity of the incidence light in the integrator <b>40</b>. Also, it is preferable that the angle &#x3b8; be an angle by which a length (a pitch) in the horizontal direction as a whole of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A coincides substantially (or preferably coincides) with a size h<sub>FEL1V </sub>of the cells in the vertical direction. That is, it is preferable that a relational expression as follows be satisfied for the angle &#x3b8;. One reason is that this thereby makes it easier to reduce the luminance non-uniformity of the incidence light in the integrator <b>40</b>, as will be described later in detail. Note that the shape of the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; (the luminance distribution shape) of the incidence light described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, etc. refers to a shape of a contour line (an isoluminance line) that shows a predetermined intensity value (a luminance value), as will be described later in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref>, which applies to the description given in the following as well.

Hence, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the laser beam emitted from the light-emitting spots <b>11</b>B of the chip <b>11</b>A configured such as by the LD shows the luminance distribution shape (for example, oval in one embodiment) in which the FFP is sharp (for example, anisotropic), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Also, in the first embodiment, the major axis direction of the shape of the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; of the incidence light, in the light incidence face of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A, differs from the array direction of the respective cells <b>41</b> in the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, for example. More specifically, the major axis direction and the minor axis direction of the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; in the incidence light differ from both the array directions (for example, the horizontal direction (the x-axis direction) and the vertical direction (the y-axis direction)) of the respective cells <b>41</b>. In this embodiment, the inclined arrangement (the rotated arrangement) between the major axis direction of the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; and the array directions of the respective cells <b>41</b> described above is achieved by the inclined arrangement (the rotated arrangement) of such as the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, for example. More specifically, the chip <b>11</b>A configured by the LD is so arranged to be inclined or rotated (i.e., the inclined arrangement or the rotated arrangement) as to allow the major axis direction (and the minor axis direction) of the FFP in the laser beam emitted from the light-emitting spot <b>11</b>B of the chip <b>11</b>A configured by the LD to be different from both the horizontal and the vertical directions of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In contrast, in a projector according to a comparative example, a major axis direction of a shape of a luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; of incidence light in an incidence face of a fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A coincides with an array direction (in this example, the horizontal direction (x-axis direction)) of respective cells <b>41</b> in the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, for example. In other words, unlike the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, the major axis direction in the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; and the array directions of the respective cells <b>41</b> (here, the x-axis direction of the array directions) do not form a predetermined angle &#x3b8; relative to each other (i.e., establish a relation of &#x3b8;=0 degrees). As used herein, the wording such as &#x201c;the shape of the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; (the luminance distribution shape) of the incidence light&#x201d; described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> etc. refers to a shape of a contour line (an isoluminance line) that shows a predetermined intensity value (a luminance value). More specifically, the shape of the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; (the luminance distribution shape) is equivalent to a shape of the isoluminance line having the luminance value denoted by P<b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, when the laser beam emitted from the light-emitting spot <b>11</b>B of the chip <b>11</b>A configured by the LD shows a sharp luminance distribution such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The projector according to the comparative example described above may be disadvantageous as follows, due to the sharp luminance distribution shown by the laser beam emitted from the light-emitting spot <b>11</b>B of the chip <b>11</b>A configured by the LD (for example, due to the shape of the FFP not being a circle (isotropic) such as a shape of oval). For example, luminance non-uniformity of illumination light (for example, incidence light) may not be reduced enough (i.e., a luminance distribution fails to become uniform) even with a function of the integrator <b>40</b>, when the laser beam shows overly sharp luminance distribution shape (for example, when the luminance distribution shape is sharper than the sizes of the respective cells <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> of the fly-eye lenses <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B). In this case, the luminance non-uniformity in the illumination light and picture light (display light) occurs on the illumination region <b>60</b>A and on the screen <b>2</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, thus leading to degradation of displaying quality.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In contrast, according to the first embodiment, the major axis direction of the shape of the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; of the incidence light, in the light incidence face of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A, differs from the array direction of the respective cells <b>41</b> in the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A as described above. This thereby makes it easier to reduce the luminance non-uniformity of the incidence light in the integrator <b>40</b>, even when the laser beam emitted from the light-emitting spot <b>11</b>B of the chip <b>11</b>A configured such as by the LD shows the sharp luminance distribution (for example, even when the shape of the FFP is not a circle (isotropic) such as a shape of oval). More specifically, as a result of the effect by which the light beams in the plurality of cells <b>41</b> each including the shape of the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; of the incidence light are overlapped (or superimposed) in the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A as illustrated in Part (A) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the luminance non-uniformity in the illumination light and the display light is effectively reduced as illustrated in Part (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, for example. In other words, the luminance non-uniformity in the illumination light and the display light is reduced (for example, the generation of the luminance non-uniformity is avoided) as compared with the comparative example described above. Hence, the first embodiment makes it possible to improve the displaying quality.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In particular, the luminance non-uniformity in the illumination light and the display light is reduced further effectively when the angle &#x3b8; between the major axis direction in the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; of the incidence light and the array directions of the respective cells <b>41</b> (here, the x-axis direction of the array directions, for example) satisfies the relational expression: &#x3b8;=tan<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>[h<sub>FEL1V</sub>/(h<sub>FEL1H</sub>&#xd7;n<sub>H</sub>)]. One reason is that a repetition of an identical pattern of a luminance distribution is generated and thus the effect of reducing the luminance non-uniformity may not be shown to the utmost level, when the luminance distribution &#x201c;Lind&#x201d; of the incidence light strides the plurality of cells <b>41</b> along the vertical direction in the length (the pitch) in the horizontal direction as a whole of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates an example of various characteristics in Example according to the first embodiment, in which a relationship between the aspect ratio in the illumination region <b>60</b>A and various parameters including n<sub>H</sub>, h<sub>FEL1H</sub>, h<sub>FEL1Y</sub>, and &#x3b8; are represented. It can be seen from the Example that the effect of reducing the luminance non-uniformity in the integrator <b>40</b> is shown at the utmost level when the angle &#x3b8; is about 2.7 degrees to about 7.1 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Also, in the first embodiment, functions and effects described below are achieved when the following configuration is employed in one embodiment where the plurality of light-emitting spots <b>11</b>B are provided in the chip <b>11</b>A configured by the LD in at least one (a first light source) of the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>. That is, when each of the minor axis directions of the FFPs in the light beams emitted from the respective light-emitting spots <b>11</b>B coincides substantially (or preferably coincides) with the minor axis direction in the plane which intersects (or orthogonal to) the optical axis of the integrator <b>40</b>, each of the minor axis directions of the FFPs coincides substantially (or preferably coincides) with the minor axis direction of an outer shape of the projector <b>1</b>, thus making it possible to reduce a size of the projector <b>1</b> as a whole. Also, when each of the major axis directions of the FFPs in light beams emitted from the respective light-emitting spots <b>11</b>B is allowed to coincide substantially (or preferably coincide) with one another between the two or more wavelength bands in one embodiment where the first light source described above is the light source that emits the light beams having two or more wavelength bands different from one another, a loss of light is reduced such as when a lens cut into a shape of letter &#x201c;I&#x201d; (I-cut-shaped lens) is used. More specifically, although an optical effective range may be sacrificed in a portion subjected to &#x201c;I-cut&#x201d;, the use of the I-cut-shaped lens makes it possible to reduce the loss of light by allowing a major axis direction of an emission angle of the LD to match with a direction to which the &#x201c;I-cut&#x201d; is performed (in a direction in which an effective diameter is wide).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Further, in the first embodiment, functions and effects described below are achieved when the focal distances f<sub>CL1</sub>, f<sub>CL2</sub>, and f<sub>CL3 </sub>of the coupling lenses <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, and <b>20</b>C as well as the focal distances f<sub>FEL </sub>of the fly-eye lenses <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B are so set as to allow each of the light source images S, formed on the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B by the respective cells <b>41</b> of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A, to have the size not exceeding the size of the single cell <b>42</b> in the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B. Namely, in this embodiment, the solid-state light-emitting device <b>11</b> emits the light from the light emission region that includes the single or the plurality of light-emitting spots in a shape of a dot or in a non-dot shape, and is configured by one or more light-emitting diodes (LED), one or more organic EL light-emitting devices (OLED), one or more laser diodes (LD), or one or more other suitable light emitting devices. Thus, even when the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B is arranged in the focal position of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A, each of the light source images S formed on the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B by the respective cells of the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>A is not in a shape of a dot but has a size to a certain degree (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). However, in the first embodiment, it is unlikely that the single light source image S is formed across the plurality of cells, thus allowing the light incident on the fly-eye lens <b>40</b>B to reach the illumination region efficiently. Hence, it is possible to improve a light-use efficiency in the illumination optical system <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Moreover, in the first embodiment, the light-use efficiency in the illumination optical system <b>1</b>A further improves when, in one embodiment where each of the cells in the fly-eye lenses <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B has the aspect ratio other than 1 (one), the focal distances f<sub>CL1H</sub>, f<sub>CL2H</sub>, f<sub>CL3H</sub>, f<sub>CL1V</sub>, f<sub>CL2V</sub>, and f<sub>CL3V </sub>of the coupling lenses <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, and <b>20</b>C and the focal distances f<sub>FELH </sub>and f<sub>FELV </sub>of the fly-eye lenses <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B are set in view of that aspect ratio. Also, in the first embodiment, the light-use efficiency in the illumination optical system <b>1</b>A further improves when, in one embodiment where each of the coupling lenses <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, and <b>20</b>C has the aspect ratio other than 1 (one), the focal distances f<sub>CL1H</sub>, f<sub>CL2H</sub>, f<sub>CL3H</sub>, f<sub>CL1V</sub>, f<sub>CL2V</sub>, and f<sub>CL3V </sub>and the numerical apertures NA<sub>1H</sub>, NA<sub>2H</sub>, NA<sub>3H</sub>, NA<sub>1V</sub>, NA<sub>2V</sub>, and NA<sub>3V </sub>of the coupling lenses <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, and <b>20</b>C are set in view of that aspect ratio. Further, in the first embodiment, the light-use efficiency in the illumination optical system <b>1</b>A further improves when, in one embodiment where the traveling-direction-angles of the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C are different from one another, the focal distances f<sub>CL1H</sub>, f<sub>CL2H</sub>, f<sub>CL3H</sub>, f<sub>CL1V</sub>, f<sub>CL2V</sub>, and f<sub>CL3V </sub>and the numerical apertures NA<sub>1H</sub>, NA<sub>2H</sub>, NA<sub>3H</sub>, NA<sub>1V</sub>, NA<sub>2V</sub>, and NA<sub>3V </sub>of the coupling lenses <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, and <b>20</b>C are set in view of those respective traveling-direction-angles.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The second embodiment having the configuration discussed above makes it easier to reduce the luminance non-uniformity of the incidence light in the integrator <b>43</b> even when the laser beam emitted from the light source including the chip <b>11</b>A configured such as by the LD shows the sharp luminance distribution shape as in the first embodiment described above.

However, the following modifications are applicable to the projectors <b>3</b> to <b>6</b> (the illumination optical systems <b>3</b>A, <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b>A, and <b>6</b>A) according to other embodiments (the second to the fifth embodiments).</p>
<p id="h-0044" num="0000">[First Modification]</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A and 39B</figref> each illustrate a schematic configuration of a projector (a projector <b>7</b>) according to the first modification. It is to be noted that the projector <b>7</b> corresponds to a concrete (but not limitative) example of the &#x201c;projection display unit&#x201d; in one embodiment of the technology. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</figref> illustrates a configuration example in which the projector <b>7</b> is viewed from above (in the y-axis direction), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39B</figref> illustrates a configuration example in which the projector <b>7</b> is viewed from a lateral side (in the x-axis direction).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The projector <b>7</b> according to the first modification differs from the projector <b>1</b> provided with the illumination optical system <b>1</b>A, in that a configuration of the projector <b>7</b> includes an illumination optical system <b>7</b>A and that a reflection-type device is used for the spatial modulation device <b>60</b>. In the following, description is given mainly on a difference between the projector <b>7</b> and the projector <b>1</b>, and elements common to the projector <b>1</b> will not be described in detail. It is to be noted that the illumination optical system <b>7</b>A corresponds to a concrete (but not limitative) example of the &#x201c;illumination unit&#x201d; in one embodiment of the technology.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The illumination optical system <b>7</b>A has a configuration in which, in the illumination optical system <b>1</b>A, a condenser lens <b>50</b>A is provided in place of the condenser lens <b>50</b>. The condenser lens <b>50</b>A is configured to turn the light fluxes, derived from multiple light sources (such as the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C) and formed by the integrator <b>40</b>, into parallel light fluxes, to illuminate a condenser lens <b>50</b>B through a polarization beam splitter <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Also, in the first modification, the spatial modulation device <b>60</b> is configured by the reflection-type device as described above, which can be such as a reflection-type liquid crystal panel, for example. Hence, in comparison to the projector <b>1</b>, the projector <b>7</b> is further provided with the condenser lens <b>50</b>B and the polarization beam splitter <b>51</b>. The polarization beam splitter <b>51</b> is an optical member that allows a specific polarized light (for example, p-polarized light) to transmit therethrough selectively, and allows other polarized light (for example, s-polarized light) to be reflected therefrom selectively. The spatial modulation device <b>60</b> modulates the light while so reflecting the light therefrom as to allow the polarized light at the time of incidence thereon and the polarized light at the time of exit therefrom (for example, the s-polarized light or the p-polarized light) to be different from each other. Thereby, the light (for example, the s-polarized light) incident from the illumination optical system <b>7</b>A is selectively reflected from the polarization beam splitter <b>51</b> to enter the spatial modulation device <b>60</b>, and the image light (for example, the p-polarized light) exited from the spatial modulation device <b>60</b> is allowed to pass through the polarization beam splitter <b>51</b> selectively to enter the projection optical system <b>70</b>. The condenser lens <b>50</b>B condenses the light fluxes formed by the integrator <b>40</b> and entered from the multiple light sources (such as the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C) through the condenser lens <b>50</b>A and the polarization beam splitter <b>51</b>, to illuminate in a superimposed fashion the illumination region <b>60</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The projector <b>7</b> according to the first modification having the configuration described above also achieves effects similar to those of such as the projector <b>1</b> according to such as the first embodiment described above by virtue of functions similar thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Also, especially in the first modification, the length in the x-axis direction is particularly increased in the plane (xy plane) orthogonal to the optical axis of the integrator <b>40</b>. Hence, there is a great advantage, especially in the first modification, of allowing a minor axis direction (for example, the y-axis direction) of an outer shape of the projector <b>7</b> to coincide substantially (or preferably coincide) with each of the minor axis directions of the FFPs in the light beams emitted from the respective light-emitting spots <b>11</b>B to thereby achieve reduction in size of the projector <b>7</b> as a whole.</p>

The light sources in the third modification, unlike the light sources described in the foregoing, have a configuration in which at least one of the plurality of chips <b>11</b>A which are configured by the LD in the first light source (for example, in at least one of the light sources <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>C, and <b>10</b>D) described above has the inclined arrangement relative to an optical axis Z<b>1</b>.

The third modification thus makes it possible to allow an intensity peak of each laser light following the light path conversion (the light path unification) to be aligned with the direction of the optical axis Z<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Also, it is preferable, in the third modification as well, that the minor axis directions of the FFPs in the laser light beams emitted from light-emitting spots <b>11</b>B-<b>1</b>, <b>11</b>B-<b>2</b>, and <b>11</b>B-<b>3</b> in the chips <b>11</b>A-<b>1</b>, <b>11</b>A-<b>2</b>, and <b>11</b>A-<b>3</b> each coincide substantially (or preferably coincide) with the minor axis direction (here, in the y-axis direction, for example) in the plane orthogonal to the optical axis of the integrator <b>40</b>.
