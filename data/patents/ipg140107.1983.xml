<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0063651, filed on Jun. 29, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a substrate sealing apparatus having a simple structure and a method of sealing a substrate using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Among flat panel displays (FPD), organic light emitting displays having small power consumption and excellent display quality are replacing liquid crystal displays (LCD).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, an organic light emitting display includes organic light emitting diodes (OLED) included in pixel regions, wherein the OLED includes a cathode electrode, an anode electrode, and an organic light emitting layer disposed between the two electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A deposition method or a laser induced thermal imaging (LITI) method is widely employed in forming the organic light emitting layer on a substrate. In the LITI method, at a vacuum atmosphere, a donor film on which an organic light emitting layer is formed is laminated on the substrate and heat is applied to the donor film to transfer the organic light emitting layer from the donor film to the substrate. Therefore, in order to correctly transfer the organic light emitting layer of the donor film to the pixel region of the substrate, before applying heat to the donor film, the substrate may be sealed with the donor film.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is important to seal the substrate with the donor film so that the sealed part is not opened to the outside. Therefore, the donor film may be compressed using a closed loop shaped heating bar heated to a predetermined temperature. However, since the heating bar must be maintained at the predetermined temperature, an alien substance may be fixed to the heating bar so that sealing quality may deteriorate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to solve the above-described problem during processes, an impulse sealing method of instantaneously making a large capacity of current flow through the bar including a high resistance material such as nichrome to generate heat has been suggested. However, the bar used for the impulse sealing method is not easily bent so that it is hard to manufacture the bar in the form of a closed loop. Therefore, many researches and developments for methods of solving the problem are conducted.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF CERTAIN INVENTIVE ASPECTS</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention provide a substrate sealing apparatus for sealing a substrate with a simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments also provide a method of easily sealing a substrate using the substrate sealing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to achieve the foregoing and/or other aspects of the present invention, there is provided a substrate sealing apparatus including: a chamber; at least one lower compressing member; and an upper compressing member. The lower compressing member includes a lower compressing surface for emitting heat, is configured to be elevated up and lowered down in a vertical direction with respect to the compressing surface, and rotates about the vertical direction. The upper compressing member includes an upper compressing surface for emitting heat, and is configured to be elevated up and lowered down in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to achieve the foregoing and/or other aspects of the present invention, there is provided a method of sealing a substrate using a lower compressing member provided in a chamber and an upper compressing member provided on the lower compressing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method includes: providing a primary sealed substrate in the chamber; lowering the lower compressing member to compress the primary sealed substrate primarily; elevating the lower compressing member; rotating the lower compressing member about an axis up which the lower compressing member is elevated so as to space the lower compressing member apart from the upper compressing member in the plane; and lowering the upper compressing member to secondarily compress the primary sealed substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to embodiments of the present invention, the structure of the substrate sealing apparatus is simplified so that it is possible to reduce the number of driving shafts that pass through the chamber to drive the upper compressing member and the lower compressing member and that the chamber may be easily maintained at vacuum atmosphere.</p>

The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described hereinafter but various modifications may exist. The following embodiments are provided to clarify the spirit disclosed by the present invention and to fully transmit the spirit of the present invention to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the claims of the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the following embodiments. The drawings disclosed together with the following embodiments are simplified or exaggerated for clarity and the same reference numerals generally denote the same elements.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating an embodiment of a substrate sealing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a substrate sealing apparatus <b>200</b> seals a substrate with a film. In some embodiments, the substrate sealing apparatus <b>200</b> may be used in processes of manufacturing an organic light emitting display. During processes of manufacturing organic light emitting displays, when an organic light emitting layer formed in a donor film is transferred to the substrate using a laser induced thermal imaging (LITI) method, the substrate sealing apparatus <b>200</b> may be used for sealing the substrate with the donor film.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The substrate sealing apparatus <b>200</b> includes a chamber <b>5</b>, a lower compressing member, and an upper compressing member provided on the lower compressing member. The lower compressing member includes a first compressing unit <b>10</b> and a second compressing unit <b>20</b>. The upper compressing member includes a third compressing unit <b>30</b> and a fourth compressing unit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The chamber <b>5</b> has a vacuum internal space isolated from the outside. A work table <b>8</b> on which a sealed object <b>9</b> is placed may be provided in the chamber <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the first to fourth compressing units <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> includes a metal, such as, for example, nichrome, that has high resistance and that is not oxidized at a high temperature and may be heated by the current supplied from the outside. Therefore, when the first to fourth compressing units <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> are lowered in the vertical direction D<b>0</b> while being heated, the first to fourth compressing units <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> may heat and compress the sealed object <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, each of the first to fourth compressing units <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> has an elongated bar shape. In such embodiments, each of the rear surfaces of the first to fourth compressing units <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> may be defined as a compressing surface <b>19</b> that compresses the sealed object <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When sealing patterns in which the sealed object <b>9</b> is sealed by the substrate sealing apparatus <b>200</b> are opened to the outside, the effect of sealing the sealed object <b>9</b> may deteriorate. Therefore, according to some embodiments, the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are positioned under the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>, while the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are overlapped with the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> when viewing above so that the sealing patterns may form a closed loop.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each of the first to fourth compressing units <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> is elevated up and lowered down in the vertical direction D<b>0</b> perpendicular to the compressing surface <b>19</b> in the chamber <b>5</b>. In addition, the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may not only move up and down in the vertical direction D<b>0</b> but may rotate about the vertical direction D<b>0</b>. This is described in detail as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first compressing unit <b>10</b> is coupled with a first driving shaft <b>11</b> that passes through the chamber <b>5</b> and that extends to the outside of the chamber <b>5</b>. The first driving shaft <b>11</b> is coupled with a first linear driving unit <b>15</b> and the first rotation driving unit <b>18</b> at the outside of the chamber <b>5</b>. Then, the first compressing unit <b>10</b> may be linearly moved in the vertical direction D<b>0</b> by driving the first linear driving unit <b>15</b>. The first rotation driving unit <b>18</b> may be driven to rotate the first compressing unit <b>10</b> about the vertical direction D<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In various embodiments, the first linear driving unit <b>15</b> may be implemented by a ball screw, a linear motor, or a hydraulic/pneumatic cylinder while the first rotation driving unit <b>18</b> may be implemented by a motor.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second compressing unit <b>20</b> is coupled with a second driving shaft <b>21</b> that passes through the chamber <b>5</b> and that extends to the outside of the chamber <b>5</b>. In addition, the second driving shaft <b>21</b> is coupled with a second linear driving unit <b>25</b> and a second rotation driving unit <b>28</b> at the outside of the chamber <b>5</b>. Like the driving of the first compressing unit <b>10</b>, the second compressing unit <b>20</b> may linearly move in the vertical direction D<b>0</b> and may also rotate about the vertical direction D<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The third compressing unit <b>30</b> is coupled with a third driving shaft <b>31</b> that passes through the chamber <b>5</b> and that extends to the outside of the chamber <b>5</b>. In addition, the third driving shaft <b>31</b> is coupled with a third linear driving unit <b>35</b> at the outside of the chamber <b>5</b> so that the third compressing unit <b>30</b> may be linearly moved in the vertical direction D<b>0</b> by the third linear driving unit <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, the fourth compressing unit <b>40</b> is coupled with a fourth driving shaft <b>41</b> that passes through the chamber <b>5</b> and that extends to the outside of the chamber <b>5</b>. In addition, the fourth driving shaft <b>41</b> is coupled with a fourth linear driving unit <b>45</b> at the outside of the chamber <b>5</b>. Then, the fourth compressing unit <b>40</b> may be linearly moved in the vertical direction D<b>0</b> by the fourth linear driving unit <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Operations of the substrate sealing apparatus <b>200</b> having the first to fourth compressing units <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> in detail as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> are views illustrating the operations of the embodiment of a substrate sealing apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the first compressing unit <b>10</b> and the second compressing unit <b>20</b> are lowered down in the vertical direction D<b>0</b> by which the first linear driving unit <b>15</b> and the second linear driving unit <b>25</b> are driven. Therefore, the first compressing unit <b>10</b> and the second compressing unit <b>20</b> may compress the sealed object <b>9</b> so that the sealing patterns parallel to a first direction D<b>1</b> may be formed on the sealed object <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the first compressing unit <b>10</b> and the second compressing unit <b>20</b> are lowered down, since the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are positioned on the lower side of the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> even though the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are partially overlapped with the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> in the plane, the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> do not interfere with the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the first compressing unit <b>10</b> and the second compressing unit <b>20</b> rotate about the vertical direction D<b>0</b> by the first rotation driving unit <b>18</b> and the second rotation driving unit <b>28</b>. As a result, the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are disposed parallel to the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> and are spaced apart from the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> in the plane.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the third compressing unit <b>30</b> and the fourth compressing unit <b>40</b> are lowered down by the third linear driving unit <b>35</b> and the fourth linear driving unit <b>45</b>. Therefore, the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> may compress the sealed object <b>9</b> so that the sealing patterns parallel to a second direction D<b>2</b> may be formed on the sealed object <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Before the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> are lowered down, the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, rotate to be parallel to the third compressing unit <b>30</b> and the fourth compressing unit <b>40</b>. Therefore, the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> are lowered down and do not interfere with the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> during the lowering of the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> again, in order for the sealing patterns formed on the sealed object <b>9</b> by the first to fourth compressing units <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> not to have a shape opened to the outside, the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may be placed on a position to be partially overlapped with the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>. In this case, the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are separated from the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> such that the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> do not interfere with the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> during the lowering of the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>. Therefore, in some embodiments, the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> rotate and are spaced apart from the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>. In such embodiments, it may be convenient to prevent the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> from interfering with the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> during the lowering of the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> regardless of moving the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> to both sides of the chamber <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In apparatuses where the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are moved to the sides of the chamber <b>5</b> so as to prevent interfering with the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>, two horizontal driving shafts that are coupled with the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and two vertical driving shafts that are coupled with the third and fourth compressing units <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> are needed. Such apparatuses may be complicated. In addition, since the number of the driving shafts passing through the chamber <b>5</b> increases, it may not be easy to maintain the vacuum atmosphere of the chamber <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to embodiments disclosed herein, since each of the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may be driven using a single driving shaft with a vertical driving unit and a rotation driving unit connected to the driving shaft, the chamber <b>5</b> has a simpler structure. In addition, the reduced number of driving shafts that pass through the chamber <b>5</b> enables to more easily maintain the vacuum atmosphere of the chamber <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view illustrating another embodiment of a substrate sealing apparatus. In the description for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the description of elements with reference numerals identical to the elements described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>C is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a substrate sealing apparatus <b>201</b> includes a chamber <b>5</b>, a lower compressing member, and an upper compressing member provided on the lower compressing member. The lower compressing member includes a first compressing unit <b>10</b> and a second compressing unit <b>20</b>. The upper compressing member includes a third compressing unit <b>30</b> and a fourth compressing unit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the substrate sealing apparatus <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the third compressing unit <b>30</b> and the fourth compressing unit <b>40</b> are interconnected to each other by a connecting unit <b>32</b>, and the connecting unit <b>32</b> is connected to a third driving shaft <b>33</b>. The third driving shaft <b>33</b> is penetrates out of the chamber <b>5</b> and is coupled with a third linear driving unit <b>37</b> at the outside of the chamber <b>5</b>. Therefore, the third compressing unit <b>30</b> and the fourth compressing unit <b>40</b> may be moved linearly in the vertical direction D<b>0</b> simultaneously by the third linear driving unit <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the above-described structure, since the third compressing unit <b>30</b> and the fourth compressing unit <b>40</b> are linearly moved simultaneously using the third driving shaft <b>33</b>, the number of driving shafts passing through the chamber <b>5</b> may be further reduced. Therefore, the structure of the substrate sealing apparatus <b>201</b> may be further simplified and the vacuum atmosphere in the chamber <b>5</b> may be more easily obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, a primary sealed substrate <b>150</b> is provided on a work table <b>8</b> in the chamber <b>5</b> that maintains the vacuum atmosphere. The primary sealed substrate <b>150</b> may be formed by laminating a sealing film <b>110</b> and a donor film <b>130</b> such that the sealing film <b>110</b> is under the substrate <b>120</b> and that a donor film <b>130</b> is on the substrate <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the sealing film <b>110</b> may be a plastic-based flexible film. In some embodiments, while forming the organic light emitting layer (not shown) on the substrate <b>120</b> using the LITI method, a transferring layer (not shown) including an organic light emitting layer (not shown) may be formed on the donor film <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Before the sealing film <b>110</b> and the donor film <b>130</b> are compressed, the lateral sides of the donor film <b>130</b> may be drawn by a drawing device that is provided in a tray <b>140</b>. Then, the donor film <b>130</b> is maintained flat so that the alignment between the donor film <b>130</b>, the substrate <b>120</b>, and the sealing film <b>110</b> may be stable.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Current is supplied to the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> such that the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are heated, and the first linear driving unit <b>15</b> and the second linear driving unit <b>25</b> are driven to lower the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> in the vertical direction D<b>0</b> so that the upper surface of the donor film <b>130</b> is compressed. As a result, heat and pressure supplied from the first and second compressing units <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> couple the donor film <b>130</b> and the sealing film <b>110</b> with each other so that first two sealing patterns S<b>1</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) parallel to the first direction D<b>1</b> are formed.</p>
