<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2007-0015631 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Feb. 14, 2007, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">(a) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">(b) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A liquid crystal display (LCD) is one of the most widely used flat panel displays (FPD), and it is composed of two display panels on which field generating electrodes such as pixel electrodes and a common electrode are formed, and a liquid crystal layer interposed between the two display panels. A voltage is applied to the field generating electrodes to generate an electric field in the liquid crystal layer, and the orientation of liquid crystal molecules of the liquid crystal layer is determined and the polarization of incident light is controlled through the generated electric field to display an image.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The liquid crystal display includes switching elements each connected to pixel electrodes, and a plurality of signal lines such as data lines and gate lines for applying voltages to the pixel electrodes by controlling the switching elements. Each gate line transfers a gate signal generated from a gate driving circuit, and each data line transfers a data voltage generated from a data driving circuit. The switching element transfers a data voltage to a pixel electrode according to the gate signal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The gate driving circuit and data driving circuit are typically directly mounted on a display panel in the form of a plurality of IC chips. Alternatively, the gate driving circuit and data driving circuit are mounted on a flexible circuit layer and the flexible circuit layer is attached on a display panel. Such IC chips are responsible for a large percentage of the manufacturing cost of a liquid crystal display. Particularly, since the data driver IC chips are much more expensive than the gate driving circuit IC chips, it is necessary to reduce the number of data driver IC chips for a high resolution and large liquid crystal display. The manufacturing cost of the gate driving circuit can be reduced by integrating the gate driving circuit to the display panel with a gate line, a data line, and a switching element. However, it is very difficult to integrate the data driving circuit to the display panel because the data driving circuit has a complicated structure. Therefore, a reduction of the number of data driver ICs is required.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. As those skilled in the art would realize, the described embodiments may be modified in various different ways, all without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the drawings, the thickness of layers, films, panels, regions, etc., are exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals designate like elements throughout the specification. It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, film, region, or substrate is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A liquid crystal display according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of the liquid crystal display according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of one pixel of the liquid crystal display according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the liquid crystal display according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b>, a gate driver <b>400</b> coupled to the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b>, a data driver <b>500</b>, a gray voltage generator <b>800</b> coupled to the data driver <b>500</b>, and a signal controller <b>600</b> for controlling them.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a view of an equivalent circuit, the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b> includes a plurality of display signal lines and a plurality of pixels PX<b>1</b>, PX<b>2</b>, and PX<b>3</b> connected to the display signal lines and arranged in a matrix format. In the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b> includes lower and upper panels <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> that face each other and a liquid crystal layer <b>3</b> interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The signal lines includes a plurality of gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n </sub>for transmitting a gate signal (also referred to as a &#x201c;scanning signal&#x201d;) and a plurality of data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>for transmitting a data voltage. The gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n </sub>extend basically in a row direction to run almost parallel to each other, while the data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>extend basically in a column direction to run almost parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each of the pixels PX<b>1</b>, PX<b>2</b>, and PX<b>3</b> has a longitudinal structure in a row direction. For example, the pixels PX<b>1</b>, PX<b>2</b>, and PX<b>3</b> connected to the gate line (GL) and the data line (DL) include a switching element Q connected to the signal lines (GL, DL) and a liquid crystal capacitor C<b>1</b><i>c </i>and a storage capacitor Cst connected thereto. The storage capacitor Cst may be omitted if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The switching element Q is a three-terminal element such as a thin film transistor disposed at the lower panel <b>100</b>. The switching element Q includes a control terminal connected to a gate line (GL), an input terminal connected to a data line (DL), and an output terminal connected to a liquid crystal capacitor C<b>1</b><i>c </i>and a storage capacitor Cst. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each pixel line is adjacent to two data lines, and the pixels PX<b>1</b>, PX<b>2</b>, and PX<b>3</b> in each pixel line are alternately connected to two data lines. In other words, a switching element Q of respective neighboring pixels PX<b>1</b>, PX<b>2</b>, and PX<b>3</b> in each pixel line is connected to the different data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The liquid crystal capacitor C<b>1</b><i>c </i>uses a pixel electrode <b>191</b> at a lower panel <b>100</b> and a common electrode <b>270</b> of an upper panel <b>200</b> as two terminals, and a liquid crystal layer <b>3</b> between two electrodes <b>191</b> and <b>270</b> functions as a dielectric material. The pixel electrode <b>191</b> is connected to the switching element Q. The common electrode <b>270</b> is formed on the entire surface of the upper panel <b>200</b> and receives a common voltage Vcom. Unlike in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the common electrode <b>270</b> can be formed at the lower panel <b>100</b>. In this case, at least one of the two electrodes <b>191</b> and <b>270</b> can be made in a line shape or a rod shape.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An additional signal line (not shown) provided to the lower panel <b>100</b> and the pixel electrode <b>191</b> are overlapped while providing an insulator between the additional signal line and the pixel electrode <b>191</b> to form the storage capacitor Cst that acts as a subsidiary capacitor of the liquid crystal capacitor C<b>1</b><i>c, </i>and the additional signal line receives predetermined voltages, such as the common voltage Vcom. Further, the pixel electrode <b>191</b> and a previous gate line Gi&#x2212;1 are overlapped while providing the insulator between the pixel electrode <b>191</b> and a previous gate line G<sub>i&#x2212;1 </sub>to form the storage capacitor Cst.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Meanwhile, in order to perform color display, each pixel PX specifically displays one of the primary colors (spatial division), or the pixels PX alternately display the primary colors over time (temporal division), which causes the primary colors to be spatially or temporally synthesized, thereby displaying a desired color. The primary colors may include red, green, and blue. As an example of the spatial division, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that each pixel PX has a color filter <b>230</b> for displaying one of the primary colors in a region of the upper display panel <b>200</b> corresponding to the pixel electrode <b>191</b>. Unlike the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the color filter <b>230</b> may be provided above or below the pixel electrode <b>191</b> of the lower display panel <b>100</b>. Color filters <b>230</b> of pixels PX<b>1</b>-PX<b>3</b> adjacent in a row direction lengthily extend in a row direction and are connected to one another, and color filters <b>230</b> for different colors are alternately arranged in a column direction.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is assumed that each color filter <b>230</b> displays a unique color of red, green, and blue throughout the specification. A red pixel is a pixel with a red color filter <b>230</b>, a green pixel is a pixel with a green color filter <b>230</b>, and a blue pixel is a pixel with a blue color filter <b>230</b>. The red pixel, blue pixel, and green pixel are sequentially and alternately arranged in a column direction.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As described above, the pixels PX<b>1</b>-PX<b>3</b> of three primary colors form one dot (DT) as a basic unit of image display.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gate driver <b>400</b> includes first and second gate drivers <b>400</b><i>a </i>and <b>400</b><i>b </i>respectively provided on left and right sides of the pixels PX<b>1</b> to PX<b>3</b>. The gate driver <b>400</b> along with the signal lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n </sub>and D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>and the thin film transistor switching element Q is integrated to the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b>. The gate drivers <b>400</b><i>a </i>and <b>400</b><i>b </i>are alternately connected to an odd-numbered gate line and an even-numbered gate line, and apply a gate signal formed by a combination of a gate-on voltage Von and a gate-off voltage Voff to the gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n</sub>. In addition, the gate driver <b>400</b> may be provided on one side of the assembly <b>300</b>. Further, the gate driver <b>400</b> may be directly mounted on the assembly <b>300</b> as an IC chip, may be mounted on a flexible printed circuit film (not shown) to be attached on the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b> in a tape carrier package (TCP) type, or may be mounted on an additional printed circuit board (PCB).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At least one polarizer (not shown) is provided on an outer surface of the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The gray voltage generator <b>800</b> generates two sets of gray voltages related to transmittance of the pixels PX. One of the two sets of gray voltages has a positive value and the other has a negative value with respect to the common voltage Vcom.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The data driver <b>500</b> is coupled to the data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>of the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b>, and it selects the gray voltage received from the gray voltage generator <b>800</b> and applies the selected gray voltage as a data voltage to the data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>. However, when the gray voltage generator <b>800</b> does not provide all the gray voltages but provides the limited number of reference gray voltages, the data driver <b>500</b> divides the reference gray voltage and selects a desired data voltage therefrom. The data driver <b>500</b> may be directly mounted on the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b> as an IC chip. Alternatively, the data driver <b>500</b> may be attached on the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b> as the tape carrier package (TCP) by being mounted on the flexible printed circuit film (not shown), or mounted on the additional printed circuit board (PCB). Alternatively, the data driver <b>500</b> can be integrated with the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b> with the signal lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n </sub>and D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>and the thin film transistor switching element Q.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As described above, a horizontal length of the pixel PX is greater than a vertical length thereof, and the horizontal length is three times the vertical length. Accordingly, compared to when the horizontal length is less than the vertical length, the number of the pixel electrodes <b>191</b> positioned on each row is small, and the number of the pixel electrodes <b>191</b> positioned on each column is large. Since the number of the data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>is reduced, the number of IC chips for the data driver <b>500</b> is reduced, and the cost for materials may be reduced. Here, since the gate driver along with the gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n</sub>, the data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>, and the thin film transistor may be integrated to the assembly <b>300</b> while the number of gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n </sub>is increased, a resolution problem is not caused by the increase of the number of the gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n</sub>. In addition, even though the gate driver <b>400</b> is mounted as an IC chip, because the cost of the IC chip for the gate driver <b>400</b> is less than that of the IC chip for the data driver <b>500</b>, and it is better to reduce the number of IC chips for the data driver <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The signal controller <b>600</b> controls the gate driver <b>400</b> and the data driver <b>500</b>. The signal controller <b>600</b> includes a temporary storage device <b>601</b> and an output unit <b>602</b> connected to the temporary storage device <b>601</b>. The output unit <b>602</b> includes a first output unit <b>610</b>, a second output unit <b>620</b>, a third output unit <b>630</b>, and a fourth output unit <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An operation of the liquid crystal display will now be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The signal controller <b>600</b> receives input image signals R, G, and B, and input control signals for controlling the input image signals R, G, and B from an external graphics controller (not shown). The input image signals R, G, and B include luminance information of each pixel PX, and the luminance has a predetermined number of grays (e.g., 1024(=2<sup>10</sup>), 256(=2<sup>8</sup>), or 64(=2<sup>6</sup>)). The input control signals may include a vertical synchronization signal Vsync, a horizontal synchronization signal Hsync, a main clock signal MCLK, and a data enable signal DE.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The signal controller <b>600</b> appropriately processes the input image signals R, G, and B according to an operating conditions of the liquid crystal panel assembly <b>300</b> based on the input control signal and the input image signals R, G, and B, and generates preliminary image signals R&#x2032;, G&#x2032;, and B&#x2032;. In addition, the signal controller <b>600</b> generates a gate control signal CONT<b>1</b> and a data control signal CONT<b>2</b>, and then transmits the gate control signal CONT<b>1</b> to the gate driver <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this case, preliminary image signals R&#x2032;, G&#x2032;, and B&#x2032; are stored in the temporary storage device <b>601</b>, and outputted as an output image signal DAT through the output unit <b>602</b>. The output unit <b>602</b> selectively outputs the preliminary image signals R&#x2032;, G&#x2032;, and B&#x2032; stored in the temporary storage device <b>601</b> to rearrange the preliminary image signals R&#x2032;, G&#x2032;, and B&#x2032; according to the arrangement of the pixel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The gate control signal CONT<b>1</b> includes a scanning start signal STV and at least one clock signal for controlling an output cycle of the gate-on voltage Von. Further, the gate control signal CONT<b>1</b> may include an output enable signal OE for defining the duration of the gate-on voltage Von.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The data control signal CONT<b>2</b> includes a horizontal synchronizing start signal STH for informing transmission start of the digital image signal DAT for the pixel of one row, and a load signal TP and a data clock signal HCLK for applying an analog data voltage to the data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>. Further, the data control signal CONT<b>2</b> may include an inversion signal REV for inverting data voltage polarity with respect to the common voltage Vcom (hereinafter, the data voltage polarity with respect to the common voltage Vcom will be referred to as a &#x201c;data voltage polarity&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to the data control signal CONT<b>2</b> from the signal controller <b>600</b>, the data driver <b>500</b> receives the output image signal DAT for the pixel of one row, selects a gray voltage corresponding to each output image signal DAT, and converts the digital output image signal DAT to an analog data voltage and applies it to the corresponding data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The gate driver <b>400</b> applies the gate-on voltage Von to the gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n </sub>according to the gate control signal CONT<b>1</b> from the signal controller <b>600</b> to turn on the switching element Q coupled to the gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n</sub>. Thereby, the data voltage applied to the data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>is applied to the corresponding pixel PX through the turned on switching element Q.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A difference between the data voltage applied to the pixel PX and the common voltage Vcom is expressed as a charged voltage of the liquid crystal capacitor C<b>1</b><i>c </i>(i.e., a pixel voltage). An arrangement of liquid crystal molecules varies according to the intensity of the pixel voltage, and therefore polarized light penetrating the liquid crystal layer <b>3</b> varies. The variation of the polarized light is expressed as a transmittance variance of the light, and therefore the pixel PX expresses the luminance expressed by the gray of the image signals DAT.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The above operation is repeatedly performed for every 1/3 horizontal period (which is referred to as &#x201c;1/3 H&#x201d; where 1 H is equal to one period of the horizontal synchronization signal Hsync). In this way, the gate-on voltage Von is sequentially applied to all the gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n</sub>, and the data signals are supplied to all the pixels PX, thereby displaying one frame of an image.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">After one frame ends, a subsequent frame is started, and a state of the inversion signal REV applied to the data driver <b>500</b> to invert the polarity of the data voltage applied to each pixel PX from the polarity of a previous frame is controlled, which is referred to as &#x201c;frame inversion&#x201d;. In this case, in one frame, the polarity of the data voltage flowing through one data line may be periodically changed according to characteristics of the inversion signal REV (e.g., row inversion and dot inversion), or the polarities of the data voltage applied to one pixel row may be different.

For better comprehension and ease of description, the gate lines and the switching elements are not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this case, the second data line D<sub>2 </sub>to the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>data line D<sub>m&#x2212;1 </sub>are respectively connected to the pixels of both sides about the data line D<sub>2 </sub>to D<sub>m&#x2212;1 </sub>in every row.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Accordingly, the data voltage corresponding to each pixel PX is sequentially applied to the second data line D<sub>2 </sub>to the (m&#x2212;1)<sup>th </sup>data line D<sub>m&#x2212;1 </sub>for each predetermined period (e.g., 1/3 H). However, the data voltage may not be applied to the first data line D<sub>1 </sub>and the last data line D<sub>m </sub>for a time corresponding to the row that is not connected to the pixel PX.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the gate signals g<sub>1</sub>, g<sub>2</sub>, and g<sub>3 </sub>of the liquid crystal display according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention respectively include the gate-on voltage Von and the gate-off voltage Voff. As described above, the switching element Q is turned on during a gate-on voltage Von time, and the data voltage applied to the data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>is applied to the corresponding pixel PX through the turned on switching element Q to charge the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">However, in the liquid crystal display according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the horizontal length is three times the vertical length.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Accordingly, compared to when the horizontal length is less than the vertical length, the number of pixel electrodes <b>191</b> positioned in each row is small, and the number of pixel electrodes <b>191</b> positioned in each column is large. Accordingly, the number of data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>is reduced, and the number of gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n </sub>is increased to three times the number of data lines D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>. That is, three gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n </sub>are disposed for every one dot DT row (i.e., a row including one dot DT). Accordingly, a time for applying the gate-on voltage Von of the gate signal to the gate lines G<sub>1 </sub>to G<sub>n </sub>is reduced by 1/3. However, when the time of the gate-on voltage Von is reduced by 1/3, a time for charging the pixel is not sufficiently obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Therefore, in the liquid crystal display according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the duration of the gate-on voltage Von of the respective gate signals g<b>1</b>, g<b>2</b>, and g<b>3</b> is set to be 2/3 H as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a pre-charging is performed during a former half 1/3 H of the 2/3 H, and a main-charging is performed during a latter half 1/3 H of the 2/3 H. In this case, a voltage for pre-charging the pixel (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;pre-charging voltage&#x201d;) is a data voltage applied to the pixel PX connected to a previous row of the corresponding data line D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>, and a voltage for main-charging the pixel (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;main-charging voltage&#x201d;) is a data voltage applied to the corresponding pixel PX.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pixel PX<b>21</b> arranged in a second row and a first column is referred to as a first pixel, the pixel PX<b>31</b> arranged in a third row and the first column is referred to as a second pixel, and the pixel PX<b>12</b> arranged in a first row and a second column is referred to as a third pixel.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Since the second pixel PX<b>31</b> is connected to the first data line D<b>1</b>, it receives the data voltage flowing through the first data line D<sub>1</sub>. However, since the first data line D<sub>1 </sub>is not connected to the pixel in the second row, the second pixel PX<b>31</b> may not be pre-charged. Accordingly, the luminance after the second pixel PX<b>31</b> is main-charged is less than the luminance of the first pixel PX<b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Therefore, even though the first data line D<sub>1 </sub>is not connected to a pixel in even rows in the liquid crystal display according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a predetermined data voltage is applied.

For example, a voltage corresponding to an intermediate gray among all grays may be applied to the DX<b>21</b>, DX<b>41</b>, . . . , and DXn<b>1</b> of the first data line D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In addition, the data voltage corresponding to the first pixel PX<b>21</b> (i.e., a pixel neighboring the part of the first data line D<sub>1 </sub>that is not connected to the pixel) may be applied to the first data line D<sub>1 </sub>in addition to the second data line D<sub>2</sub>. That is, the pre-charging voltage of the second pixel PX<b>31</b> is set to be the same as the main-charging voltage of the first pixel PX<b>21</b>. The data voltages DX<b>21</b>, DX<b>41</b>, . . . , and DXn<b>1</b> applied to the parts of the first data line D<sub>1 </sub>that are not connected to the pixel are the same as the main-charging voltages of the neighboring pixels PX<b>21</b>, PX<b>41</b>, . . . , and PXn<b>1</b>. Thereby, since all the pixels PX in the first column are sufficiently pre-charged, a luminance difference between the respective pixels may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">While the description has been given based on the first data line D<sub>1</sub>, the last data line D<sub>m </sub>may be applied in a like manner of the first data line D<sub>1</sub>.
