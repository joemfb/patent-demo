<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/141,235, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling a pump, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for controlling a pump by monitoring indications of the fluid condition within the pump.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In material transfer systems such as fluid transfer systems, it is often desired to assess the level of material in a vessel in order to determine when to initiate a control event. These control events could include turning on or off a pump, opening valves or drains, or adding material to the vessel. In the field of fluid transfer, as the fluid level in a reservoir becomes too high, the fluid is often transferred from the reservoir and discharged at another location such as another reservoir or into the environment. In sump pump applications, a basin is used to collect wastewater. When the level of wastewater rises to a pre-determined high point, the pump is switched on to drain the basin.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A number of devices, including ultrasonic sensors, capacitive sensors, thermal sensors, and float switches, are used to determine the water level in the vessel and to initiate a control event based on the water level. A float switch has moving parts which are prone to hanging up on solids in the wastewater or on other parts in the pump system, often causing the pump to malfunction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One method to eliminate issues with moving parts in a pump system is to sense the overall electrical current that a pump uses to determine when the pump begins to take on air instead of wastewater, which would indicate a low water level in the basin. In a typical sump pump application, the pump draws a normal running current while pumping wastewater. When a large amount of air gets into the pump, the running current drops to a lower level. However, the same current drop can occur in any situation where the pump is pumping against a total head pressure and that pressure goes up. For example, a current drop may occur when a solid is caught in the discharge line or when the discharge line is being moved to a point of higher elevation. Because a number of events can affect the current drawn by the pump, relying on a current drop to detect a low fluid level in the basin may lead to a misdiagnosis of the fluid level and, consequently, an unreliable pump system.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, an electrically powered fluid transfer system is provided. The system comprises a pump having a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet in fluid communication with the fluid inlet. The pump moves fluid from the fluid inlet through an interior of the pump and onto the fluid outlet when power is provided to a motor of the pump. The system further comprises a controller operatively coupled to the pump to control when power is provided to the pump, the controller monitoring at least one characteristic of a frequency response of the pump while the pump is powered to determine a fluid condition within the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of controlling an electrically powered fluid transfer system is provided. The method comprises the steps of providing a pump configured to displace a fluid, monitoring at least one characteristic of a frequency response of the pump while the pump is powered, determining a fluid condition within the pump based on the at least one characteristic of the frequency response of the pump, and altering an operation of the pump when the fluid condition within the pump is a first fluid condition.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The pump system of the present disclosure may be implemented in a variety of flowable material transfer applications, such as for transferring wastewater, sewage, effluent, surface water, fluids with suspended solids, or other suitable flowable materials in residential, commercial, agricultural, or industrial settings. In one embodiment, the pump system is used in residential applications for collecting and diverting surface drainage away from structures, erosion-prone landscapes, and poor drainage areas. In another embodiment, the pump system is used as a sump pump for collecting and removing water from a basement or crawl space pit. In another embodiment, the pump system is used as a bilge pump for removing water from a vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary pump system <b>10</b> is shown. Pump system <b>10</b> includes a pump <b>12</b> positioned in a reservoir <b>22</b> for pumping a flowable material out of reservoir <b>22</b>. As described throughout this disclosure, pump <b>12</b> is configured to pump a fluid <b>34</b>, illustratively a liquid such as water, from reservoir <b>22</b> to an outlet conduit <b>36</b>. Other exemplary fluids may include gases, liquids, gels, liquids with suspended solids, and any other flowable materials displaceable by a pump. Reservoir <b>22</b> may be an aboveground or underground tank, a basin, a well casing, or any other suitable fluid containment device or fluid collection device. In the illustrated embodiment described herein, pump system <b>10</b> is a sump pump for pumping water collected in a reservoir positioned in the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Fluid <b>34</b> is discharged into reservoir <b>22</b> from a fluid supply <b>21</b>. Fluid supply <b>21</b> may be any fluid source that provides fluid to reservoir <b>22</b>. Exemplary fluid supplies <b>21</b> include groundwater, condensate from an air conditioning system, condensate from a gas furnace, rainwater runoff, a municipal water supply, and any other system which provides fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Pump <b>12</b> illustratively includes a motor <b>14</b> for driving pump <b>12</b>. Motor <b>14</b> may be an alternating current (AC) or a direct current (DC) motor. In the illustrated embodiment described herein, pump <b>12</b> is a conventional centrifugal pump and motor <b>14</b> is a conventional AC induction motor, although any suitable pump and motor may be used. Motor <b>14</b> is coupled to a pumping portion <b>16</b> which includes an inlet <b>18</b> in fluid communication with an outlet <b>20</b>. Pump <b>12</b> moves fluid received at inlet <b>18</b> through an interior of pumping portion <b>16</b> and out through outlet <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, pumping portion <b>16</b> comprises a volute and an impeller in a centrifugal pump. Outlet conduit <b>36</b> is illustratively coupled to outlet <b>20</b> of pumping portion <b>16</b> to divert and discharge fluid <b>34</b> to a desired location outside of reservoir <b>22</b>, such as to another reservoir or into the environment. A conventional one-way check valve <b>37</b> may be provided in outlet conduit <b>36</b> to prevent backflow of fluid <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated embodiment, pump system <b>10</b> further includes a sensor module <b>30</b> positioned in reservoir <b>22</b> for detecting a top level <b>35</b> of fluid <b>34</b> and providing feedback to a controller <b>24</b>. In one embodiment, sensor module <b>30</b> sends feedback to controller <b>24</b> to indicate detection of a high fluid level in reservoir <b>22</b>. In response, controller <b>24</b> sends a control signal to activate pump <b>12</b> to thereby displace fluid <b>34</b> from reservoir <b>22</b> and lower top level <b>35</b> of fluid <b>34</b> in reservoir <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, sensor module <b>30</b> may be used to detect a low fluid level in reservoir <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, sensor module <b>30</b> may be positioned outside of reservoir <b>22</b> while still being able to detect top level <b>35</b> of fluid <b>34</b> in reservoir <b>22</b>. For example, sensor module <b>30</b> may be placed near the outer wall of reservoir <b>22</b> and detect top level <b>35</b> through the outer wall of reservoir <b>22</b>. Sensor module <b>30</b> is illustratively a capacitive sensor, although an ultrasonic sensor, a thermal sensor, a float switch, or any other suitable sensor may be used. Exemplary sensor modules are disclosed in further detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/645,137, filed Dec. 22, 2009, entitled &#x201c;METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CAPACITIVE SENSING THE TOP LEVEL OF A MATERIAL IN A VESSEL&#x201d;, which is incorporated by reference herein. Although only one sensor is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, any number of sensors may be used to detect top level <b>35</b> of fluid <b>34</b>, thus providing the potential to detect the top level at various heights within reservoir <b>22</b> and/or providing redundant sensors to detect the top level at the same height within reservoir <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Controller <b>24</b> is configured to monitor and control pump <b>12</b>. Controller <b>24</b> illustratively receives power via a power cable <b>26</b> from a power source <b>27</b>. In one embodiment, power source <b>27</b> is an AC power supply, but may alternatively be a DC power supply. Controller <b>24</b> is operatively coupled to pump <b>12</b> via a motor cable <b>28</b> for providing controls and power to motor <b>14</b>. Controller <b>24</b> is operatively coupled to sensor module <b>30</b> via sensor cable <b>32</b> for receiving feedback from sensor module <b>30</b>. Alternatively, controller <b>24</b> may be operatively coupled to pump <b>12</b> and sensor module <b>30</b> using wireless communication. In the illustrated embodiment, controller <b>24</b> is positioned outside of reservoir <b>22</b> but may alternatively be positioned inside reservoir <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, in one embodiment, pump <b>12</b> includes legs <b>52</b> which are mounted to a floor <b>50</b> of reservoir <b>22</b> to secure pump <b>12</b> within reservoir <b>22</b>. Reservoir <b>22</b> further includes a removably attached lid <b>48</b> which provides access to pump <b>12</b>. Motor <b>14</b> is enclosed in a protective rigid housing <b>38</b> which protects motor <b>14</b> from the surrounding environment, such as from fluid <b>34</b> in reservoir <b>22</b>. Pumping portion <b>16</b> of pump <b>12</b> includes a volute <b>40</b> having an upper portion <b>45</b> and a lower portion <b>47</b>. Volute <b>40</b> further includes an interior portion <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) for receiving fluid <b>34</b> through inlet <b>18</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an impeller <b>42</b> is positioned within interior portion <b>41</b> of volute <b>40</b> and near inlet <b>18</b>. Motor <b>14</b> includes a shaft <b>44</b> coupled to impeller <b>42</b> for rotatably driving impeller <b>42</b> about an axis <b>43</b>. In one embodiment, rigid housing <b>38</b>, volute <b>40</b>, and impeller <b>42</b> are each made of cast iron and have a protective epoxy coating to guard against corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the illustrated embodiment, fluid <b>34</b> is water which is displaceable by pump <b>12</b>. During operation, the rotation of impeller <b>42</b> draws the water into volute <b>40</b> through fluid inlet <b>18</b> near the rotating axis <b>43</b> of impeller <b>42</b>. Using centrifugal acceleration, the rotation of impeller <b>42</b> accelerates the water radially outward to a wall <b>46</b> of volute <b>40</b>. The velocity of the water decreases as the water is forced from volute <b>40</b> through the smaller cross-sectional area of fluid outlet <b>20</b>, which results in an increase in water pressure inside volute <b>40</b> as the kinetic energy of the water in volute <b>40</b> is converted into potential energy. This increased water pressure forces the water through fluid outlet <b>20</b> and into outlet conduit <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">During operation of pump <b>12</b>, motor <b>14</b> draws electrical power from power supply <b>27</b> and produces a torque on shaft <b>44</b> to rotate impeller <b>42</b> about axis <b>43</b>. The electrical power supplied to the motor may be represented as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i><sub>e</sub><i>=V&#xd7;I</i>&#xd7;PF&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
wherein P<sub>e</sub>=electrical power, V=voltage applied across the winding of the motor, I=current drawn through the winding of the motor, and PF=power factor. The rotational mechanical power of the motor, which is output by the motor through the rotation of the motor shaft, may be represented as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i><sub>m</sub><i>=T&#xd7;</i>2<i>&#x3bc;&#xd7;S</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
wherein P<sub>m</sub>=mechanical power, T=torque applied by motor, and S=angular speed of motor. Since a motor is not 100% efficient in converting electrical power into mechanical power, an efficiency factor must be used to relate the input of the motor (i.e. electrical power) to the output of the motor (i.e. mechanical power), as represented by the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i><sub>m</sub><i>=P</i><sub>e</sub><i>&#xd7;n</i><sub>eff</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
wherein n<sub>eff</sub>=the efficiency of the motor. Substituting the above equations for P<sub>m </sub>and P<sub>e</sub>, the governing equation for the transfer of electrical to mechanical power in the motor is:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>T&#xd7;</i>2&#x3bc;&#xd7;<i>S=V&#xd7;I</i>&#xd7;PF&#xd7;<i>n</i><sub>eff</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(4)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The torque from motor <b>14</b> is applied to impeller <b>42</b> via shaft <b>44</b>. As shown by the above equation (4), the torque applied by motor <b>14</b> is proportional to the current and voltage levels of motor <b>14</b>. Impeller <b>42</b> physically transfers the torque to the water during the rotation of impeller <b>42</b>. The efficiency of this torque transfer depends on the condition of the fluid in pump <b>12</b>. As different ratios of compressible and incompressible fluids, such as a mixture of water and air, are drawn into volute <b>40</b>, the torque applied by motor <b>14</b> and the current drawn by motor <b>14</b> changes.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the water level in reservoir <b>22</b> is at a high level, such as the top level <b>35</b> of fluid <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, pump <b>12</b> operates in a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; state and water from reservoir <b>22</b> is drawn into volute <b>40</b> at full or substantially full flow. Since water is generally incompressible, the torque transfer from impeller <b>42</b> to the water entering volute <b>40</b> increases the water pressure inside volute <b>40</b> and forces the water in volute <b>40</b> through fluid outlet <b>20</b> to outlet conduit <b>36</b>. In one embodiment, as water is pumped out of reservoir <b>22</b> by pump <b>12</b>, air from the atmosphere enters reservoir <b>22</b> through an opening or vent <b>49</b> to replace the water displaced by pump <b>12</b>. Vent <b>49</b> is illustratively located in lid <b>48</b>, but may alternatively be in any suitable location to allow air to enter reservoir <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As pump <b>12</b> continues to pump water from reservoir <b>22</b> through outlet <b>20</b>, the water level in reservoir <b>22</b> steadily decreases and eventually drops below inlet <b>18</b> of pump <b>12</b>, as illustrated by the top level <b>35</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. As pump <b>12</b> continues to operate, varying amounts of air from reservoir <b>22</b> are drawn into volute <b>40</b>. As a result, pump <b>12</b> begins to operate in a &#x201c;starved&#x201d; state by drawing a mixture of air and water into volute <b>40</b>. Air has a smaller mass density than water and is a compressible fluid. Accordingly, the torque transferred from impeller <b>42</b> to the air/water mixture in volute <b>40</b> works to both compress the air in volute <b>40</b> and change the velocity of the water entering volute <b>40</b>. As a result, the torque transfer to the water is reduced, and the pressure in volute <b>40</b> decreases. In addition, the current drawn by motor <b>14</b> is reduced. In one embodiment, pump <b>12</b> operates in a starved state when air comprises anywhere from at least about 5% of the fluid in volute <b>40</b> to about 100% of the fluid in volute <b>40</b>, but pump <b>12</b> may operate in a starved state when a lesser amount of air is in volute <b>40</b> depending on the mechanical and structural characteristics of pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, pump <b>12</b> may be initially powered on when the water in reservoir <b>22</b> is at a low level. The low water level may include reservoir <b>22</b> being substantially empty or at any level at or below inlet <b>18</b>. With the water at a low level, pump <b>12</b> immediately operates in a starved state upon receiving power as air comprises about 100% of the fluid in volute <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">By examining the current or voltage supplied to motor <b>14</b> of pump <b>12</b>, motor <b>14</b> may be used as a feedback sensor to controller <b>24</b> for indicating a condition of the fluid surrounding impeller <b>42</b> within volute <b>40</b>. However, monitoring the overall motor current level to detect the fluid condition in volute <b>40</b> may lead to false results as a plurality of different events can cause the same amount of current to be drawn by pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the frequency response of the power supplied to motor <b>14</b> is monitored by controller <b>24</b>. The frequency response measures the output frequency spectrum of pump <b>12</b> in response to a sinusoidal power signal supplied to motor <b>14</b>. Controller <b>24</b> monitors characteristics of the frequency response of the voltage or current levels to detect a change in the operating condition of pump <b>12</b>, as described herein. Exemplary characteristics of the frequency response include the magnitude at select frequencies and the phase angle at select frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A &#x201c;signature&#x201d; of the frequency response of pump <b>12</b> indicates certain frequencies, certain magnitudes, certain phase angles, the magnitude of the response over a range of frequencies, the phase angle of the response over a range of frequencies, and other characteristics of the frequency response of pump <b>12</b>. By examining the differences in the signature during a normal operating state and a starved operating state of pump <b>12</b>, controller <b>24</b> may identify a frequency range of interest where the magnitude or phase are most affected by a change in the condition of the fluid in pump <b>12</b>. Controller <b>24</b> then monitors the current or voltage levels over the frequency range of interest to detect a change in the magnitude or phase of the power signal which indicates the fluid condition in the pump, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, controller <b>24</b> is an analog circuit configured to monitor the current signal of motor <b>14</b> and to compare a relative value of the current signal to a threshold value for detection of the fluid condition in pump <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the analog circuit monitors the current signal of motor <b>14</b> at a given frequency range, as explained herein. Alternatively, the analog circuit may be used to monitor any suitable electrical parameter of pump <b>12</b> which indicates the condition of the fluid being displaced by pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, controller <b>24</b> may include a microprocessor <b>70</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) configured to perform some or all of the functions of the analog circuit. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, microprocessor <b>70</b> includes fluid detection software <b>72</b> provided on a memory <b>74</b> accessible by microprocessor <b>70</b>. In one embodiment, fluid detection software <b>72</b> includes instructions which cause microprocessor <b>70</b> to monitor and analyze characteristics of the frequency response of pump <b>12</b> to detect the fluid condition in pump <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, fluid detection software <b>72</b> includes instructions which cause microprocessor <b>70</b> to apply a fast Fourier transform (&#x201c;FFT&#x201d;) to the power signal of pump <b>12</b> to obtain the frequency response of pump <b>12</b>, as explained herein.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the illustrated embodiment, controller <b>24</b> first obtains the frequency response of pump <b>12</b> and analyzes a frequency range of interest based on deviations in the signature of the frequency response, as described herein. The frequency response of the voltage supplied to motor <b>14</b> or the current drawn by motor <b>14</b> is obtained by applying a FFT to the power signal. The FFT extracts both the magnitude and phase components of the frequency response of the power signal. The FFT is a mathematical approximation of any given group of data points using a series of sine and cosine functions with different amplitudes.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">By applying the FFT to the current signal drawn by motor <b>14</b>, the magnitude and phase angle of the pump's frequency response may be obtained for any given frequency. In one embodiment, microprocessor <b>70</b> applies the FFT to the current signal. Software <b>72</b> includes instructions which cause microprocessor <b>70</b> to run a digital algorithm to apply the FFT to the current signal and extract the frequency response of the current signal. Alternatively, any other suitable method for extracting the frequency response of the current signal may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the magnitude and phase angle of an exemplary frequency response of the current drawn by motor <b>14</b> is shown. The magnitude is shown in decibels and the phase angle in degrees. The graphs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are illustrative of the frequency response of one exemplary pump system having a unique set of characteristics and conditions. Different pump systems will have different frequency responses.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the frequency response of pump <b>12</b> varies depending on whether pump <b>12</b> is operating in a normal or a starved state. While in a normal operating state, pump <b>12</b> is operating at or near full water flow, as described above. The frequency response while pump <b>12</b> is in the normal state is indicated by a normal response <b>80</b>. When pump <b>12</b> is operating in a starved state, a mixture of air and water is present in interior portion <b>41</b> of volute <b>40</b>, as described above. The frequency response while pump <b>12</b> is in the starved state is represented by a starved response <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The deviation in the normal response <b>80</b> and starved response <b>82</b> provide indication of the fluid condition in pump <b>12</b>. A frequency range of interest is selected where the magnitude of normal response <b>80</b> substantially deviates from the magnitude of starved response <b>82</b>. In the illustrated embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a frequency range of interest is selected between a low cutoff <b>84</b> of 180 Hz and a high cutoff <b>86</b> of 240 Hz. Between low cutoff <b>84</b> and high cutoff <b>86</b>, starved response <b>82</b> has a greater magnitude than normal response <b>80</b>. Other suitable frequency ranges may be selected to capture the differences in the normal response <b>80</b> and starved response <b>82</b>. Once one or more frequencies or frequency ranges of interest are identified, controller <b>24</b> may be configured to analyze these frequencies or frequency ranges to detect the fluid condition in pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Several factors contribute to the frequency response of the current signal or of any electrical parameter of pump <b>12</b>. These factors include the harmonics and magnitude of the current signal, the natural or &#x201c;structural&#x201d; frequencies of the physical parts of the pump system, and the overall &#x201c;white noise&#x201d; from various noise sources that defines the noise floor of pump <b>12</b>. The noise floor is defined by the sum of all of the noise sources in pump <b>12</b>, including the noise resulting from the excitation of the parts of pump <b>12</b> at their natural frequencies and the random introduction of air pockets into volute <b>40</b> as pump <b>12</b> moves from a normal to a starved operating state. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and described herein, the noise floor of the starved response is higher at certain frequencies than the noise floor of the normal response.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The introduction of fluid into pump <b>12</b> results in the excitation of the parts of pump <b>12</b>, such as volute <b>40</b> or impeller <b>42</b>, at their natural frequencies, which changes the signature of the frequency response of the current signal drawn by motor <b>14</b>. In particular, the excitation of the parts of pump <b>12</b> at their natural frequencies creates additional &#x201c;noise&#x201d; in pump <b>12</b> and increases the magnitude of the frequency response at those natural frequencies. The magnitude of vibration of the parts at their natural frequencies depends on the condition of the fluid present in pump <b>12</b>. In particular, the presence of air in pump <b>12</b> causes the parts of pump <b>12</b> to resonate at their natural frequencies at a greater magnitude than the presence of water in pump <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the operation of pump <b>12</b> in a starved state may result in a greater magnitude at any natural frequency peak in the response. This greater magnitude in the signature of the frequency response may be observed to detect the presence of air in pump <b>12</b>. In addition, the excitation of the parts of pump <b>12</b> may also cause a phase shift in the phase response, as described below and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The natural frequencies of the parts of pump <b>12</b> depend on the physical properties of the parts such as their mass and structural stiffness. The natural frequency for an undamped free vibration of a single degree of freedom system may be represented as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>w</i><sub>n</sub><i>=&#x221a;{square root over (k/m)}</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(5)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
wherein w<sub>n</sub>=the natural frequency, k=the stiffness of the pump structure, and m=the mass of the pump structure. As such, the natural frequency of a structural part of pump <b>12</b> is proportional to the stiffness of the structural part and inversely proportional to the mass of the structural part. A part with a solid or rigid structure will have a higher natural frequency than a part with a more flexible structure.
</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, changes in the level of damping in pump'12 result in a change in the noise floor of the frequency response. In general, a damped system has a greater resistance or impedance to vibration than an undamped system. As such, the frequency response of a damped system typically has a lower noise floor than the frequency response of an undamped system due to the smaller magnitude of noise sources detected in the frequency response. For pump system <b>10</b>, the level of damping in pump <b>12</b> is dependent on the amount of compressible gas, such as air, in pump <b>12</b> and the effective mass of the fluid in pump <b>12</b>. The introduction of air in pump <b>12</b> results in a decrease in the damping level of pump <b>12</b> and a lower mass density of the fluid mixture in pump <b>12</b>. As a result, the noise floor of the frequency response increases.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In particular, as pump <b>12</b> changes operating states from pumping a liquid, such as water, to pumping a mixture of liquid and compressible gas, such as water and air, the &#x201c;stiffness&#x201d; and mass of the fluid mixture surrounding impeller <b>42</b> continuously changes due to the compressibility of the air, the varying damping level in pump <b>12</b>, and the varying mass transfer through pump <b>12</b>. As a result, the force transferred to the air/water mixture and the resultant torque in pump shaft <b>44</b> changes as varying amounts of air enter pump <b>12</b>. The randomness of the size, the quantity, and the timing of entry of air pockets in pump <b>12</b> results in random changes to the compressibility of the fluid surrounding impeller <b>42</b> and to the damping of oscillations in pump <b>12</b>. As a result, the noise floor of the frequency response increases over a certain frequency range as these air pockets enter pump <b>12</b>, as illustrated by normal response <b>80</b> and starved response <b>82</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The noise floor increases particularly at lower frequencies as most noise due to the introduction of air in pump <b>12</b>, including the vibration of the structural parts of pump <b>12</b>, occurs at these lower frequencies. Thus, the difference in magnitude of the frequency response between low cutoff <b>84</b> and high cutoff <b>86</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) provides an indication that air is in pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A change in the damping level in pump <b>12</b> may also cause a frequency shift in some peaks in the frequency response, such as a shift in a lower or &#x201c;anti-resonance&#x201d; peak of the response. An anti-resonance peak illustrates the frequency or frequencies at which the system has a large resistance or impedance to vibration. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an anti-resonance peak <b>90</b> of normal response <b>80</b> at about 70 Hz shifts to an anti-resonance peak <b>92</b> of starved response <b>82</b> at about 105 Hz due to the introduction of air into pump <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the frequency shift in the anti-resonance peak of the frequency response may be observed to detect the fluid condition in pump <b>12</b>. Using microprocessor <b>70</b>, the location of the anti-resonance peak may be identified to detect a frequency shift and distinguish a normal operating state from a starved operating state.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, motor <b>14</b> is an AC motor operating at 60 Hz, but AC motor may operate at 50 Hz or any other suitable frequency. The frequencies of the harmonics of the current signal drawn by motor <b>14</b> are therefore 60 Hz, 120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz, etc. As such, the contribution of the current signal to the magnitude of the frequency response is greatest at each 60 Hz interval, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by peaks <b>85</b> at each 60 Hz interval. In one embodiment, the 60 Hz harmonics may be filtered out of the signal either through digital processing with microprocessor <b>70</b> or by an analog circuit. Filtering out the 60 Hz harmonics of the current signal increases the sensitivity of controller <b>24</b> in the detection of the specific structural frequencies in pump <b>12</b> and the noise floor of intermediate frequencies in pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the phase angle response of the current signal is shown when pump <b>12</b> is operating in both a normal state and a starved state. The phase response while pump <b>12</b> is in the normal state is indicated by normal response <b>94</b>, and the phase response while pump <b>12</b> is in the starved state is indicated by starved response <b>96</b>. By selecting a specific frequency range where the phase angle of normal response <b>94</b> differs from the phase angle of starved response <b>96</b>, the phase angle may be monitored over that frequency range to detect a starved operating state of pump <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, microprocessor <b>70</b> monitors the phase angle over the frequency range to detect the operating state of pump <b>12</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, normal response <b>94</b> has a lower peak <b>95</b> at about 68 Hz, while starved response <b>96</b> has a lower peak <b>97</b> at about 54 Hz. Microprocessor <b>70</b> may monitor the phase angle of the current signal over a range of about 50 to 70 Hz to detect this phase shift.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Upon observing the frequency response of the motor current signal, or of any other suitable electrical parameter of pump <b>12</b>, and selecting a frequency range of interest based on the frequency response, controller <b>24</b> is configured to monitor the current signal within the frequency range of interest. In one embodiment, controller <b>24</b> monitors a relative value of the magnitude of the current within the selected frequency range of interest and compares the relative value to a threshold value to detect a change in the fluid condition in pump <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, controller <b>24</b> initiates a control event upon detection of the change in fluid condition. An exemplary control event is the deactivation of pump <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an analog circuit <b>100</b> is shown as an exemplary controller <b>24</b>. During operation of pump <b>12</b>, motor <b>14</b> draws current from a power source <b>110</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, power source <b>110</b> is an AC power supply, and controller <b>24</b> delivers power from power source <b>110</b> to motor <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, power source <b>110</b> corresponds to power source <b>27</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A current sensor <b>112</b> is connected in series with motor <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, current sensor <b>112</b> is a sense resistor, but other suitable current sensors may be used. Circuit <b>100</b> includes several circuit stages, including an amplifier <b>102</b> configured to amplify a signal, a filter <b>104</b> configured to filter a signal to a specific frequency range, an integrator <b>106</b> configured to average the magnitude of a signal over a period of time, a comparator <b>108</b> configured to compare the relative magnitude of a signal to a threshold value <b>111</b>, and a controller <b>120</b> configured to communicate a control signal <b>121</b> to motor <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, filter <b>104</b> and integrator <b>106</b> are tunable to account for the unique characteristics and properties of each pump system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The relative value of the current signal is dependent on the magnitude of the current being drawn by pump <b>12</b>. For example, an increase in the magnitude of the current signal at a frequency within the frequency range of interest will result in a corresponding increase in the observed relative value of the current signal, and vice versa. The threshold value is selected such that when pump <b>12</b> is operating in a normal condition, the relative value is less than the threshold value. When pump <b>12</b> is operating in a starved condition, the relative value exceeds the threshold value as a result of the increased magnitude of the current signal at frequencies within the frequency range of interest. Alternatively, the relative value of the current signal may, be monitored such that the relative value dropping below the threshold value would indicate that pump <b>12</b> is operating in a starved condition.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the operation of pump system <b>10</b> according to one embodiment. Reference is made to analog circuit <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> throughout the following description of the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As represented by blocks <b>200</b> and <b>202</b>, top level <b>35</b> of fluid <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), illustratively water, in reservoir <b>22</b> is continuously monitored by sensor module <b>30</b>.

As represented by block <b>204</b>, controller <b>120</b> turns on pump <b>12</b> upon the detection of a high water level in reservoir <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In block <b>206</b>, the current drawn by motor <b>14</b>, illustratively a current signal <b>122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is fed through current sensor <b>112</b> of circuit <b>100</b> which is monitored by amplifier <b>102</b> of circuit <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, motor <b>14</b> is an AC motor and current signal <b>122</b> is a sinusoid. Amplifier <b>102</b> multiplies the voltage difference across current sensor <b>112</b> by the gain of amplifier <b>102</b>, as represented by block <b>208</b>. As a result, the output of amplifier <b>102</b> is a sinusoidal signal dependent on the amplitude of current signal <b>122</b> as detected by current sensor <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As represented by block <b>210</b>, filter <b>104</b> filters out certain frequencies from pump system <b>10</b> that are present in the output of amplifier <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, filter <b>104</b> is a band pass filter configured to pass a range of frequencies as defined by its bandwidth, although one or more low or high pass filters may also be used. The bandwidth of filter <b>104</b> is set to the frequency range of interest which, as described above, is based on the physical properties of the pump structure and is determined from the observation of the frequency response of the current signal for known states of the pump. In one embodiment, filter <b>104</b> is tuned to have a bandwidth defined between low cutoff <b>84</b> and high cutoff <b>86</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to capture the increased noise floor of the frequency response of pump <b>12</b> that results from the presence of air in pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As represented by block <b>212</b>, integrator <b>106</b> integrates the filtered output of filter <b>104</b> and outputs a response variable <b>109</b> to a control circuit, illustratively comparator <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In one embodiment, integrator <b>106</b> is a simple first order integrator. Response variable <b>109</b> is an average of the magnitude of the sinusoidal output of filter <b>104</b> over a specific pre-determined time period. In one embodiment, response variable <b>109</b> is an average of the sinusoidal voltage output of filter <b>104</b>. Response variable <b>109</b> represents a relative value of the current signal drawn by motor <b>14</b> and is dependent on the magnitude of the current signal and the frequencies present in pump system <b>10</b>. For example, with the bandwidth of filter <b>104</b> set between low cutoff <b>84</b> and high cutoff <b>86</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), filter <b>104</b> captures at least some of the frequencies at which the introduction of air into volute <b>40</b> affects the magnitude of the frequency response. As the amount of air in the air/water mixture in pump <b>12</b> increases, the magnitude of response variable <b>109</b> correspondingly increases.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the illustrated embodiment, the time period over which integrator <b>106</b> calculates response variable <b>109</b> is set by tuning at least one parameter of integrator <b>106</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a graph is provided illustrating the change in magnitude of response variable <b>109</b> over a time period between time T<sub>1 </sub>and time T<sub>2 </sub>depending on the operating state of pump <b>12</b>. T<sub>1 </sub>corresponds to the onset of air being drawn into pump <b>12</b>. T<sub>2 </sub>corresponds to a time subsequent to the detection of a starved state. Both T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2 </sub>are arbitrary times which may vary depending on the amount of fluid in reservoir <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the illustrated embodiment, pump <b>12</b> is initially turned on at time T<sub>0</sub>, and integrator <b>106</b> calculates response variable <b>109</b> over the time period defined between T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>. In a normal state of pump <b>12</b>, the magnitude of response variable <b>109</b>, as represented by normal curve <b>105</b>, initially gradually increases due to the presence of some frequencies in the output of filter <b>104</b> before settling at a level below threshold <b>111</b>. In one embodiment, pump <b>12</b> operates in a normal state between time T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>. Response variable <b>109</b> does not cross threshold <b>111</b> while pump <b>12</b> is in a normal state due to at least substantially full water flow in volute <b>40</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one embodiment, air begins to be drawn into volute <b>40</b> of pump <b>12</b> at time T<sub>1</sub>.

Starved curve <b>107</b> represents the magnitude of response variable <b>109</b> when air is drawn into volute <b>40</b> of pump <b>12</b> at time T<sub>1</sub>. Between time T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>, the vibration of the parts of pump <b>12</b> and the noise in pump <b>12</b> begins to increase as more air is drawn into pump <b>12</b>. As such, the magnitude of response variable <b>109</b>, as represented by starved curve <b>107</b>, rapidly increases after time T<sub>1 </sub>and crosses threshold <b>111</b> before reaching time T<sub>2</sub>. When the magnitude of response variable <b>109</b> reaches threshold value <b>111</b>, pump <b>12</b> is in a starved state as defined by controller <b>24</b> and pump <b>12</b> is shut down.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment, the comparison of response variable <b>109</b> to threshold value <b>111</b> serves to distinguish the normal operating state and the starved operating state of pump <b>12</b> for the pump system. In particular, when response variable <b>109</b> is less than threshold value <b>111</b>, the amount of air, if any, detected in volute <b>40</b> is insufficient to indicate that pump <b>12</b> is running dry. Pump <b>12</b> therefore is in a normal state and continues to run. When response variable <b>109</b> exceeds threshold value <b>111</b>, the amount of air detected in pump <b>12</b> is substantial enough to indicate that pump <b>12</b> is running dry or in a starved state. Accordingly, controller <b>24</b> turns off pump <b>12</b> based on the output of comparator <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one embodiment, the starved state of pump <b>12</b> may be determined by running experiments with an intended mechanical configuration of pump <b>12</b> and determining what volume of air in volute <b>40</b> effects an observable change in the frequency response of pump <b>12</b>. Such experiments may include injecting air into pump <b>12</b> in varying amounts while pump <b>12</b> is pumping water, adjusting the parameters of filter <b>104</b> and/or integrator <b>106</b>, and measuring the output of comparator <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the starved state corresponds to a fluid condition when air makes up at least about 5% of the fluid in volute <b>40</b>. In one embodiment, the starved state corresponds to a fluid condition when air makes up at least about 15% of the fluid in volute <b>40</b>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> provides an alternative embodiment for detecting the fluid condition in pump <b>12</b> of pump system <b>10</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a pressure transducer <b>66</b> is mounted to wall <b>46</b> of volute <b>40</b> and is configured to measure the pressure of the fluid within volute <b>40</b>. Alternatively, pressure transducer <b>66</b> may be mounted at any suitable location in pump <b>12</b> for detecting fluid pressure within volute <b>40</b>. Pressure transducer <b>66</b> outputs an electrical signal to controller <b>24</b> based on the detected fluid pressure. Rather than monitoring the frequency response of the motor current as described above, the frequency response of the output of pressure transducer <b>66</b> is used to detect the fluid condition in pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Similar to the embodiment using the frequency response of motor current described above, the frequency response of the output of pressure transducer <b>66</b> is obtained and observed when the pump is operating in a starved state and in a normal state. As with the motor current embodiment, a frequency range of interest is determined based on the frequency response of the output of pressure transducer <b>66</b>. The output of pressure transducer <b>66</b> is monitored within the selected frequency range of interest and compared with a threshold value to detect the presence of air or other fluid inside volute <b>40</b> of pump <b>12</b>. Upon detection of a certain amount of air in volute <b>40</b>, controller <b>24</b> initiates a control event and illustratively turns off pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one embodiment, pressure transducer <b>66</b> is operated from low voltage power and is not interfaced with the higher voltage main power, illustratively power supply <b>27</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, controller <b>24</b> provides the low voltage power to pressure transducer <b>66</b>. As a result, pressure transducer <b>66</b> does not require isolation from the primary power line and thus more easily interfaces with the control electronics of controller <b>24</b>. An exemplary pressure transducer <b>66</b> is Model No. MPX5700DP from Freescale Semiconductor that operates on 5 VDC. Another exemplary pressure transducer <b>66</b> is Model No. XPX100DT from Honeywell that Operates on 12 VDC.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for determining a condition of a pump is provided. The method may comprise sensing an electrical parameter of the pump, passing the signal from the sensor through an electrical filter circuit, and evaluating the output from the filter to determine whether the pump is operating correctly. The electrical parameter may be the current passing though the windings of a motor in the pump. The electrical parameter may be the voltage across the windings of a motor in the pump. The method may include evaluating the result over a period of time to distinguish change events.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, an apparatus for determining a condition of a pump is provided. The apparatus may comprise a sensor in communication with the windings of the motor of the pump, an amplifier to add a gain factor to the sensor signal, a filter for identifying the contribution to the signal within a frequency range, and means for controlling the pump based on the filtered output.

The filter may be a low pass filter, a high pass filter, or a band pass filter.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">While this invention has been described as having an exemplary design, the present invention may be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains.</p>
