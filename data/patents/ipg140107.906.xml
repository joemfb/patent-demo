<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art that may be related to various aspects of the present invention, which are described and/or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present invention. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Natural resources, such as oil and gas, are used as fuel to power vehicles, heat homes, and generate electricity, in addition to myriad other uses. Once a desired resource is discovered below the surface of the earth, drilling and production systems are often employed to access and extract the resource. These systems may be located onshore or offshore depending on the location of a desired resource.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, such systems generally include a wellhead assembly through which the resource is extracted. These wellhead assemblies may include a wide variety of components and/or conduits, such as various control lines, casings, valves, and the like, that control drilling and/or extraction operations. As will be appreciated, various control lines or other components of a production or transport system are typically coupled to one another to provide a path for hydraulic control fluid, chemical injections, or the like to be passed through the wellhead assembly. Such control lines are often disposed in various passages through components of the wellhead assembly, such as a tubing spool, a tubing hanger, a christmas tree, and/or a running tool.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The control lines may be surrounded in the passage by heavy drilling fluid, which is used to facilitate the drilling and removal of cuttings from a drill bore. When the control lines are disengaged, for example, to remove the running tool, the christmas tree, or the tubing hanger, it is desirable to keep the control lines relatively clear of contaminants, such as the heavy drilling fluid, so that downhole controls are not compromised due to clogs or damaged valves. Additionally, any fluid surrounding the coupling may be pressurized as a result of hydrostatic head pressure or pressure applied during well control or testing operations, and it is desirable to block that pressure from entering the fluid control system or downhole control lines if the control lines are engaged or disengaged.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One or more specific embodiments of the present invention will be described below. These described embodiments are only exemplary of the present invention. Additionally, in an effort to provide a concise description of these exemplary embodiments, all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As discussed above, it is desirable to block heavy drilling fluid or pressurized fluid from entering hydraulic fluid control lines, particularly when the lines are disengaged. These hydraulic fluid lines may be used to control various valves in the wellhead, such as, for example, a surface controlled subsurface safety valve (SCSSV). In the event of temperature increase or line failure, where a pressure build-up of hydraulic fluid in the control line may open the safety valve, it is desirable for the hydraulic fluid controlling the safety valve to be relieved in order for the valve to close. Accordingly, an embodiment of the present invention provides a coupling which automatically blocks heavy drilling fluid or pressurized fluid from entering the hydraulic fluid control line when the coupling is disengaged while enabling the hydraulic fluid to escape in the event of a pressure build-up. It should be appreciated that, while this application describes embodiments in the context of a safety control valve, the disclosed coupling could be used in other hydraulic fluid lines. For example, hydraulic fluid lines may exist in a subsea control system, an umbilical, a manifold, an annulus closure, or any other well component.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The generally cylindrical body <b>54</b> may be screwed into or otherwise disposed within the running tool <b>46</b>. A continuous bore <b>92</b> having varying diameters runs through the length of the body <b>54</b>. The bore <b>92</b> may be divided into two general regions having dissimilar diameters, namely, a valve cavity <b>60</b> and a shaft cavity <b>62</b>. Within each region, the diameter of the cavities <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> are generally similar. Situated within the valve cavity <b>60</b> is a valve <b>64</b> configured to automatically close upon separation of the female stab <b>42</b> from the male stab <b>44</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the valve <b>64</b> includes a poppet <b>66</b> and a sealing plug <b>68</b> with a spring <b>70</b> disposed therebetween. The poppet <b>66</b> has a diameter greater than that of the shaft cavity <b>62</b> and is therefore blocked from advancing all the way into the shaft cavity <b>62</b>. An angled surface <b>72</b> of the poppet <b>66</b> corresponds to an angled surface <b>74</b> of an opening <b>76</b> between the valve cavity <b>60</b> and the shaft cavity <b>62</b>. The angled surfaces <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> may press together to form a metal seal. At the other end of the valve cavity <b>60</b>, the sealing plug <b>68</b> may be secured within the bore <b>92</b> by a fastener <b>78</b>, such as, for example, a hex socket set screw. Furthermore, in the illustrated embodiment, a shoulder <b>80</b> on the sealing plug <b>68</b> blocks the sealing plug <b>68</b> from moving within the valve cavity <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The poppet <b>66</b> is also coupled to a shaft <b>82</b> which extends through the shaft cavity <b>62</b> into a reception area <b>84</b> for receiving the male stab <b>44</b>. The shaft <b>82</b> may be depressed to compress the spring <b>70</b> and displace the poppet <b>66</b>, as described in more detail below. A seal <b>86</b>, such as an o-ring, may be disposed around a portion of the shaft <b>82</b> or housed in the shaft cavity <b>62</b>. The seal <b>86</b> and shaft <b>82</b> remain in the shaft cavity <b>62</b> as the shaft <b>82</b> is depressed and released. The seal <b>86</b> may block fluid disposed in the shaft cavity <b>62</b> between the poppet <b>66</b> and the seal <b>86</b> from seeping into the reception area <b>84</b> and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In use, the female stab <b>42</b> may be exposed to applied pressure or pressure from heavy well fluids. The described structures are configured such that the heavy well fluid is automatically blocked from entering and contaminating the hydraulic fluid passages when the female stab <b>42</b> is disengaged from the male stab <b>44</b>. Hydraulic fluid may enter the female stab <b>42</b> through the line <b>48</b>. A coupling cavity <b>88</b> is defined between the body <b>54</b> and the running tool <b>46</b>. Hydraulic fluid may enter the coupling cavity <b>88</b> and flow through holes <b>90</b> to the shaft cavity <b>62</b>.

Multiple holes <b>90</b> and bores <b>92</b> may be disposed around the axis <b>56</b> of the generally cylindrical body <b>54</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.

Furthermore, the cross section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is taken along angle line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> to better illustrate the bores <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the shaft <b>82</b> is not depressed, such as when the female stab <b>42</b> is disengaged from the male stab <b>44</b>, the spring <b>70</b> automatically biases the poppet <b>66</b> into the opening <b>76</b>. The heavy well fluids in the valve cavity <b>60</b> further apply pressure to the poppet <b>66</b>, thereby creating a metal seal between the angled surface <b>72</b> of the poppet <b>66</b> and the angled surface <b>74</b> of the opening <b>76</b>. Counter pressure may also be applied to the poppet <b>66</b> from the hydraulic fluid in the shaft cavity <b>62</b>; however this pressure is generally less than the pressure on the poppet <b>66</b> from the heavy drilling fluid and the spring <b>70</b>. The pressure from the hydraulic fluid may build up enough to overcome the pressure from the heavy drilling fluid and the spring <b>70</b>, for example, if the hydraulic fluid source is turned on to flush the heavy drilling fluid from the female stab <b>42</b> before it is coupled to the male stab <b>44</b>. If the pressure of the hydraulic fluid in the shaft cavity <b>62</b> becomes great enough, the poppet <b>66</b> may be displaced from the opening <b>76</b> to alleviate the pressure in the hydraulic fluid. If the pressure in the hydraulic fluid decreases, the poppet <b>66</b> is again automatically biased into the opening <b>76</b> by the spring <b>70</b> and the pressure of the fluid in the valve cavity <b>60</b> to create the metal seal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, the female stab <b>42</b> includes a seal <b>94</b> configured to block leakage of the hydraulic fluid during use. The seal <b>94</b> may, for instance, be an elastomeric seal with metal caps (e.g., a metal endcap seal). A shoulder <b>96</b> holds the seal <b>94</b> in place in the body <b>54</b>. A one-directional seal <b>98</b> is disposed below the seal <b>94</b> to allow escape of the heavy drilling fluid from the coupler <b>40</b> during coupling engagement, as described in more detail below. A nut <b>100</b> secures the one-directional seal <b>98</b> to the body <b>54</b> and holds the shoulder <b>96</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the male stab <b>44</b>, which includes many of the same features described in the female stab <b>42</b>. The male stab <b>44</b> includes a generally cylindrical body <b>102</b> made of metal, such as corrosion resistant stainless steel. The body <b>102</b> may be secured to the tubing hanger <b>50</b> via a nut <b>104</b>. A continuous bore <b>106</b> having varying diameters runs through the length of the body <b>102</b>. The bore <b>106</b> may be divided into a valve cavity <b>108</b> and a shaft cavity <b>110</b> having dissimilar diameters. Within each region, the diameter of the cavities <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> are generally similar. Disposed within the valve cavity <b>108</b> is a valve <b>112</b> including a poppet <b>114</b> and a sealing plug <b>116</b> having a spring <b>118</b> disposed therebetween. The poppet <b>114</b> has a diameter greater than that of the shaft cavity <b>110</b> and is therefore blocked from advancing all the way into the shaft cavity <b>110</b>. An angled surface <b>120</b> of the poppet <b>114</b> corresponds to an angled surface <b>122</b> of an opening <b>124</b> between the valve cavity <b>108</b> and the shaft cavity <b>110</b>. The angled surfaces <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> may press together to form a metal seal. At the other end of the valve cavity <b>108</b>, a fastener <b>126</b>, such as a hex socket set screw, secures the sealing plug <b>116</b> within the bore <b>106</b>, while a shoulder <b>128</b> may block the sealing plug <b>116</b> from moving within the valve cavity <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The poppet <b>114</b> is coupled to a shaft <b>130</b> which extends through the shaft cavity <b>110</b> and out the body <b>102</b>. The shaft <b>130</b> may be depressed to compress the spring <b>118</b> and displace the poppet <b>114</b>, as described in more detail below. A seal <b>132</b>, such as an o-ring, may be disposed around a portion of the shaft <b>130</b>. The seal <b>132</b> and the shaft <b>130</b> remain in the shaft cavity <b>110</b> as the shaft <b>130</b> is depressed and released.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As with the female stab <b>42</b>, the male stab <b>44</b> may be exposed to applied pressure or pressure from heavy well fluids. Furthermore, the tubing hanger <b>50</b> to which the male stab <b>44</b> is coupled may supply hydraulic fluid to various valves, such as the SCSSV. In order to protect the safety valve from being damaged due to a pressure build-up in the hydraulic control line, the male stab <b>44</b> is configured such that the pressure in the hydraulic tubing <b>22</b> may be released automatically, as with the female stab <b>42</b>. Generally, during use, hydraulic fluid flows through the coupler <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) before the male stab <b>44</b> is disengaged from the female stab <b>42</b>. Accordingly, cavities and passages in the male stab <b>44</b> may contain hydraulic fluid before the male stab <b>44</b> is exposed to heavy well fluids. For example, hydraulic fluid may be present in a bore <b>134</b> and the valve cavity <b>108</b>. As with the female stab <b>42</b>, the male stab <b>44</b> may include multiple bores <b>134</b> disposed around an axis <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the male stab <b>44</b> is disengaged from the female stab <b>42</b>, the described components operate to automatically seal the hydraulic fluid line <b>52</b> from contamination by heavy drilling fluids. That is, the spring <b>118</b> automatically biases the poppet <b>114</b> into the opening <b>124</b> when the shaft <b>130</b> is not depressed. Furthermore, pressure applied to the poppet <b>114</b> from fluids in the valve cavity <b>108</b> supplement the spring <b>118</b> to create the metal seal between the angled surface <b>120</b> of the poppet <b>114</b> and the angled surface <b>122</b> of the opening <b>124</b>. Pressure is conveyed from the heavy drilling fluid outside the male stab <b>44</b> to the poppet <b>114</b> by compression of the hydraulic fluid within the male stab <b>44</b>. Heavy drilling fluid is generally impeded from entering the male stab <b>44</b> by a fluid trap <b>138</b>. Within an indent <b>140</b>, a hole <b>142</b> provides access to the bore <b>134</b>. A cover <b>144</b> substantially covers the indent <b>140</b>, leading heavy drilling fluid to enter the indent <b>140</b> below the hole <b>142</b>, thereby creating the fluid trap <b>138</b>. That is, the heavy drilling fluid remains at the bottom of the indent <b>140</b>, while the hydraulic fluid remains in the hole <b>142</b> and the bore <b>134</b>. In addition to impeding entrance of heavy drilling fluid into the male stab <b>44</b>, the fluid trap <b>138</b> reduces displacement of the hydraulic fluid by the heavy drilling fluid; therefore, any heavy drilling fluid that enters the male stab <b>44</b> merely compresses the hydraulic fluid in the bore <b>134</b> and the valve cavity <b>108</b>. Pressure on the poppet <b>114</b> from the compressed hydraulic fluid automatically presses the poppet <b>114</b> into the opening <b>124</b>, thus supplementing the spring <b>118</b> to form the metal seal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As with the female stab <b>42</b> described above, in addition to automatically sealing the hydraulic fluid lines from contamination, the male stab <b>44</b> enables the release of pressure in the hydraulic fluid line to protect the valves, such as the surface controlled subsurface safety valve. Pressure in the hydraulic fluid from the SCSSV may be conveyed through a coupling cavity <b>146</b> and one or more holes <b>148</b> to the shaft cavity <b>110</b>. Multiple holes <b>148</b> may also be disposed around the axis <b>136</b>. Generally, the pressure on the poppet <b>114</b> from the fluid in the valve cavity <b>108</b> is greater than the pressure from the hydraulic fluid in the shaft cavity <b>110</b>, and the metal seal remains closed. However, if the pressure from the SCSSV becomes too great, hydraulic fluid in the shaft cavity <b>110</b> may displace the poppet <b>114</b> to relieve the pressure. Once the pressure has been relieved, the poppet <b>114</b> is again automatically pressed into the opening <b>124</b> by the spring <b>118</b> and the pressure from the fluid in the valve cavity <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The design of the female stab <b>42</b> and the male stab <b>44</b> enables automatic operation of the valves <b>64</b> and <b>112</b>, such as the poppets <b>66</b> and <b>114</b> in the illustrated embodiment. Merely disengaging the female stab <b>42</b> from the male stab <b>44</b> closes the valves <b>64</b> and <b>112</b>. That is, no further controls must be implemented to close the fluid pathways in the coupling members. Furthermore, the forces on the valves <b>64</b> and <b>112</b> from the surrounding fluids (e.g., heavy drilling fluids) ensure that they remain closed, even under very high pressure. Indeed, the valves <b>64</b> and <b>112</b> close tighter as more pressure is applied from surrounding fluids, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the female stab <b>42</b> and male stab <b>44</b> are illustrated in a partially coupled state. In this partially coupled state, the female shaft <b>80</b> is in contact with the male shaft <b>130</b>, however neither shaft is displaced, as evidenced by the metal seals between the bodies <b>54</b> and <b>102</b> and the poppets <b>66</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively. Prior to coupling engagement, the reception area <b>82</b> is initially filled with heavy drilling fluid. As the female stab <b>42</b> and the male stab <b>44</b> are pushed together, heavy drilling fluid may be displaced from the reception area <b>82</b> by flowing out through the space between the seal <b>92</b> and the male body <b>102</b> past the one-directional seal <b>98</b>. The reception area <b>82</b> may be flushed or purged by applying fluid through the hydraulic fluid line <b>48</b>, thereby increasing the pressure enough to displace the poppet <b>64</b> and enable flow of hydraulic fluid through the female stab <b>42</b>, as described above in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Differential pressure or heavy drilling fluid is blocked from entering the reception area <b>82</b> during coupling by the one-directional seal <b>98</b>. Additionally, the one-directional seal <b>98</b> allows trapped fluid to vent, or escape the reception area <b>82</b>, until the female stab <b>42</b> and the male stab <b>44</b> are engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As the female stab <b>42</b> and the male stab <b>44</b> are pushed together, contact force on the shafts <b>82</b> and <b>130</b> displaces the poppets <b>66</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this illustration, hydraulic fluid may flow from the fluid source to the SCSSV via the following path: hydraulic line <b>48</b>; coupling cavity <b>88</b>; holes <b>90</b>; shaft cavity <b>62</b>; opening <b>76</b>; valve cavity <b>60</b>; bore <b>92</b>; reception area <b>84</b>; fluid trap <b>138</b>; bore <b>134</b>; valve cavity <b>108</b>; opening <b>124</b>; shaft cavity <b>110</b>; holes <b>148</b>; coupling cavity <b>146</b>; and hydraulic line <b>52</b>. Furthermore, the seal <b>94</b> blocks hydraulic fluid from leaking out of the coupling and heavy drilling fluid from entering the assembly.</p>

The male stab <b>154</b> includes a generally cylindrical body <b>218</b> made of metal, such as corrosion resistant stainless steel. The body <b>218</b> may be secured to the tubing hanger <b>160</b> via a nut <b>220</b>. A continuous bore <b>222</b> having varying diameters runs through the length of the body <b>218</b>. The bore <b>222</b> may be divided into a spring cavity <b>224</b> and a seal cavity <b>226</b> having dissimilar diameters. Situated within the bore <b>222</b> is a valve <b>228</b> configured to automatically close upon separation of the female stab <b>152</b> from the male stab <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the illustrated embodiment, the valve <b>228</b> includes a shaft <b>230</b> and a sealing plug <b>232</b> having a spring <b>234</b> disposed therebetween in the spring cavity <b>224</b>. A portion of the shaft <b>230</b> near a first end <b>236</b> may have a plurality of axial bores <b>238</b> disposed therethrough similar to the axial bores <b>180</b> in the shaft <b>174</b> of the female stab <b>152</b>. The bores <b>238</b> may be generally disposed about an axis <b>240</b> running through the center of the shaft <b>230</b>. At the first end <b>236</b> of the shaft <b>230</b>, the bores <b>238</b> may be in fluid communication with the spring cavity <b>224</b>. In addition, radial holes <b>242</b> may provide further pathways from the bores <b>238</b> to the outer circumference of the shaft <b>230</b>. A portion of the shaft <b>230</b> near a second end <b>244</b> may include notches <b>246</b> to facilitate fluid flow around the shaft <b>230</b> through the bore <b>222</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a cross-section of the shaft <b>230</b> along a line <b>12</b>-<b>12</b>. The notches <b>246</b> may be semi-circular, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, or may be any other shape which provides fluid passages <b>248</b> between the shaft <b>230</b> and the bore <b>222</b>. Fluid exterior to the male stab <b>154</b> may enter through a fluid trap <b>250</b>. Within an indent <b>252</b>, a hole <b>254</b> provides access to the fluid passages <b>248</b>. A cover <b>256</b> substantially covers the indent <b>252</b>, leading fluid to enter the indent <b>252</b> below the hole <b>254</b>, thereby creating the fluid trap <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The portion of the shaft <b>230</b> containing the bores <b>238</b> may have a larger diameter than the portion of the shaft <b>230</b> having the notches <b>246</b>. Accordingly, the continuous bore <b>222</b> through which the shaft <b>230</b> is disposed may have an indentation <b>258</b> around the shaft <b>230</b> where the shaft configuration transitions from the notches <b>246</b> to the bores <b>238</b>. Holes <b>260</b> provide a pathway for fluid communication between the bores <b>238</b> and the indentation <b>258</b>. A seal <b>262</b> blocks seepage of fluids between the indentation <b>258</b> and the seal cavity <b>226</b>. The seal <b>262</b> may be disposed within the seal cavity <b>226</b>, as illustrated in the present embodiment, or may be disposed around the shaft <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, a metal seal <b>264</b> may block fluid from seeping between the spring cavity <b>224</b> and the seal cavity <b>226</b> when the valve <b>228</b> is closed. The shaft <b>230</b> may have a varying diameter including an angled surface <b>266</b>. The angled surface <b>266</b> corresponds to an angled surface <b>268</b> of an opening <b>270</b> between the spring cavity <b>224</b> and the seal cavity <b>226</b>. The angled surfaces <b>266</b> and <b>268</b> may press together to form the metal seal <b>264</b>. The shaft <b>230</b> may be depressed to compress the spring <b>234</b> and open the valve <b>228</b>, as described in more detail below. At the other end of the spring cavity <b>224</b>, the sealing plug <b>232</b> may be secured within the bore <b>222</b> by a fastener <b>272</b>, such as, for example, a hex socket set screw. Furthermore, in the illustrated embodiment, a shoulder <b>274</b> on the sealing plug <b>232</b> blocks the sealing plug <b>232</b> from moving within the spring cavity <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As with the female stab <b>152</b>, the male stab <b>154</b> may be exposed to applied pressure or pressure from heavy well fluids. Furthermore, the tubing hanger <b>160</b> to which the male stab <b>154</b> is coupled may supply hydraulic fluid to various valves, such as the SCSSV. In order to protect the safety valve from being damaged due to a pressure build-up in the hydraulic control line, the male stab <b>154</b> is configured such that the pressure in the hydraulic tubing <b>162</b> may be released automatically, as with the female stab <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Generally, during use, hydraulic fluid flows through the coupler <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) before the male stab <b>154</b> is disengaged from the female stab <b>152</b>. Accordingly, cavities and passages in the male stab <b>154</b> may contain hydraulic fluid before the male stab <b>154</b> is exposed to heavy well fluids. For example, hydraulic fluid may be present in the fluid trap <b>250</b>, the fluid passages <b>248</b>, the bores <b>238</b>, and the spring cavity <b>224</b>, and intervening areas. When the male stab <b>154</b> is disengaged from the female stab <b>152</b>, the described components operate to automatically seal the hydraulic fluid line <b>162</b> from contamination by heavy drilling fluids. That is, the spring <b>234</b> automatically biases the valve <b>228</b> closed when the shaft <b>230</b> is not depressed. Furthermore, pressure applied to the shaft <b>230</b> from fluids in the spring cavity <b>224</b> supplement the spring <b>234</b> to create the metal seal <b>264</b> between the angled surface <b>266</b> of the shaft <b>230</b> and the angled surface <b>268</b> of the opening <b>270</b>. Pressure is conveyed from the heavy drilling fluid outside the male stab <b>154</b> to the shaft <b>230</b> by compression of the hydraulic fluid within the male stab <b>154</b>. That is, the external heavy drilling fluid attempts to enter the male stab <b>154</b> through the fluid trap <b>250</b>. The heavy fluid remains at the bottom of the indent <b>252</b>, while the hydraulic fluid remains in the holes <b>254</b> and the fluid passages <b>248</b>. In addition to impeding entrance of heavy drilling fluid into the male stab <b>154</b>, the fluid trap <b>250</b> blocks displacement of the hydraulic fluid by the heavy drilling fluid; therefore, any heavy drilling fluid that enters the male stab <b>154</b> merely compresses the hydraulic fluid in the fluid passages <b>248</b>, the bores <b>238</b>, and the spring cavity <b>224</b>. Pressure on the shaft <b>230</b> from the compressed hydraulic fluid automatically supplements pressure from the spring <b>234</b> to form the metal seal <b>264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As with the female stab <b>152</b> described above, in addition to automatically sealing the hydraulic fluid lines from contamination, the male stab <b>154</b> enables the release of pressure in the hydraulic fluid line to protect the valves, such as the surface controlled subsurface safety valve. Pressure in the hydraulic fluid from the SCSSV may be conveyed through a coupling cavity <b>276</b> and one or more holes <b>278</b> to the seal cavity <b>226</b>. The holes <b>278</b> may also be disposed around the axis <b>240</b>. Generally, the pressure on the shaft <b>230</b> from the fluid in the spring cavity <b>224</b> is greater than the pressure from the hydraulic fluid in the seal cavity <b>226</b>, and the metal seal <b>264</b> remains closed. However, if the pressure from the SCSSV becomes too great, hydraulic fluid in the seal cavity <b>226</b> may open the valve <b>228</b> to relieve the pressure. Once the pressure has been relieved, the valve <b>228</b> is again automatically closed by the spring <b>234</b> and the pressure from the fluid in the spring cavity <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The design of the female stab <b>152</b> and the male stab <b>154</b> enables automatic operation of the valves <b>172</b> and <b>228</b>. Merely disengaging the female stab <b>152</b> from the male stab <b>154</b> closes the valves <b>172</b> and <b>228</b>. That is, no further controls must be implemented to close the fluid pathways in the coupling members. Furthermore, the forces on the valves <b>172</b> and <b>228</b> from the surrounding fluids (e.g., heavy drilling fluids) ensure that they remain closed, even under very high pressure. Indeed, the valves <b>172</b> and <b>228</b> close tighter as more pressure is applied from surrounding fluids, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates the female stab <b>152</b> and the male stab <b>154</b> in a partially coupled state. In this partially coupled state, the female shaft <b>174</b> is in contact with the male shaft <b>230</b>, however neither shaft is displaced, as evidenced by the metal seals between the bodies <b>164</b> and <b>218</b> and the shafts <b>174</b> and <b>230</b>, respectively. Prior to engagement of the coupler, the reception area <b>188</b> may be filled with heavy drilling fluid. As the female stab <b>152</b> and the male stab <b>154</b> are pushed together, heavy drilling fluid may be displaced from the reception area <b>188</b> by flowing out through the space between the seal <b>210</b> and the male body <b>218</b> past the one-directional seal <b>214</b>. The reception area <b>188</b> may be flushed or purged by applying fluid through the hydraulic fluid line <b>158</b>, thereby increasing the pressure enough to displace the shaft <b>230</b> and enable flow of hydraulic fluid through the female stab <b>152</b>, as described above in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Differential pressure or heavy drilling fluid is blocked from entering the reception area <b>188</b> during coupling by the one-directional seal <b>214</b>. Additionally, the one-directional seal <b>214</b> allows trapped fluid to vent, or escape the reception area <b>188</b>, until the female stab <b>152</b> and the male stab <b>154</b> are engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As the female stab <b>152</b> and the male stab <b>154</b> are pushed together, contact force on the shafts <b>174</b> and <b>230</b> opens the valves <b>172</b> and <b>228</b>, respectively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In this illustration, hydraulic fluid may flow from the fluid source to the SCSSV via the following path: hydraulic line <b>158</b>; coupling cavity <b>204</b>; holes <b>206</b>; seal cavity <b>170</b>; opening <b>198</b>; spring cavity <b>168</b>; holes <b>208</b> and bores <b>180</b>; reception area <b>188</b>; fluid trap <b>250</b>; fluids passages <b>248</b>; indentation <b>258</b>; holes <b>260</b>; bores <b>238</b> and holes <b>242</b>; spring cavity <b>224</b>; opening <b>270</b>; seal cavity <b>226</b>; holes <b>278</b>; coupling cavity <b>276</b>; and hydraulic line <b>162</b>. Furthermore, the seal <b>210</b> blocks hydraulic fluid from leaking out of the coupling and heavy drilling fluid from entering the assembly.</p>
