<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to, but not limited to, a pair of hairdressing scissors, in particular a pair of hairdressing scissors characterized in a joint structure between a blade member and a finger ring member of a blade body constituting the pair of hairdressing scissors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A pair of hairdressing scissors is constituted of two blade bodies coupled with each other in a pivotal manner. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, a blade body is constituted of a blade member <b>11</b> and a finger ring member <b>12</b> as a semi-finished product <b>10</b>. Both blade member <b>11</b> and the finger ring member <b>12</b> are made of materials such as metal and/or ceramic, which provide functional features required for the respective component members. After being separately manufactured by means of forging, casting or the like, both member <b>11</b> and the finger ring member <b>12</b> are joined to each other. The surface is polished and the blade is sharpened to be completed into a finished product.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As joint means to join the blade member and the finger ring member to each other, conventionally, in addition to welding, tacking, screw cramping and the like, are known (For reference, Please note Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication Nos. 4-14048 and 6-53767). However, generally welding is employed in view of aspects of stability, accuracy, strength and design features of the joint (For reference, Please note International Publication No. 02/326431).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hairdressing scissors have many kinds including hair cutting scissors having straight blades, carding scissors with a blade of which is formed in a comb-like shape. Also, the blade portion and the finger ring portion have a variety of shapes to accommodate the preferences of hairdressers/beauticians as the users.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, in order to provide hairdressing scissors that respond to various needs of hairdressers/beauticians as the customers; makers of hairdressing scissors, blade members and finger ring members having various shapes and configurations are previously prepared in a state of semi-finished products. After receiving an order from a customer, a blade member and a finger ring member are selected corresponding to the order; and welded to join each other. After being subjected to various processes, a pair of hairdressing scissors is completed into a finished product and delivered to the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, to produce a finished product, a considerably long time is required for carrying out processes such as welding, polishing and the like. As a result, the customer has to wait for a considerably long time from the order to the delivery of the pair of hairdressing scissors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, as a user of a pair of hairdressing scissors, hairdressers/beauticians want to always use his/her own hairdressing scissors that have been used for a long time and that fit to his/her hand.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In spite of the above-mentioned situation, for example, when cutting performance of a pair of hairdressing scissors becomes poor, a hairdresser/beautician has to place an order for sharpening the hairdressing scissors with the maker. Even when the blade members only have to be sharpened, since being joined with each other by means of welding, the blade members and the finger ring members cannot be separated. As a result, the pair of hairdressing scissors has to be handed over to the maker. Therefore, hairdressers/beauticians have to prepare spare hairdressing scissors to use the spare hairdressing scissors until the sharpening is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, some hairdressers/beauticians want to have a pair of hairdressing scissors where the uniqueness of the hairdressing scissors is enhanced by designs or arrangement of jewels, etc on the finger ring portions and/or blade portions of a pair of hairdressing scissors. However, when the blade member and the finger ring member cannot be separated from each other, for example, in the case where, it is impossible to recover the cutting performance even after sharpening, the entire pair of hairdressing scissors has to be replaced with a new one. In such a case, when a pair of decorated hairdressing scissors is replaced with a new one, the new hairdressing scissors has to be worked in order to be decorated the same again. The request of a user, who wants to have a pair of hairdressing scissors where the uniqueness of the hairdressing scissors is enhanced, fails to be satisfied.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To solve the above-described problems, it is necessary to employ a method other than welding, in which a blade member and a finger ring member can be joined to each other easily and firmly as well as, after being joined each other, the blade member and the finger ring member can be separated from each other. That is, by employing a joint method other than welding, it is possible for a maker thereof to previously carry out various processes such as sharpening on blade members and finger ring members. And receiving an order from a customer, the maker has to only join blade members and finger ring members to each other. Thus, the time from receiving order to delivery thereof can be reduced and the manufacturing cost is therefore reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">On the other hand, when ordering with the maker for, for example, maintenance or repairs such as sharpening, it is possible for a hairdresser/beautician to disassemble the blade member and the finger ring member to separate from each other, and to hand over only a component member that requires maintenance and/or repairs from to the maker. Therefore, it is possible for the hairdresser/beautician to attach a spare component member to the remaining component member and continue using of the pair of hairdressing scissors.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, conventional joint methods other than welding are largely inferior to welding in stability, strength, accuracy and design features of the joint portion as described above. Therefore, they are hardly employed for actual use.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, an embodiment of the present invention may, solve the problems mentioned above, and may provide a pair of hairdressing scissors having a joint structure of a blade body constituting the pair of hairdressing scissors with which a blade member and a finger ring member can be easily joined to each other, and even after being joined each other, the both can be separated from each other, and provide satisfactory joint stability, joint strength, joint accuracy and excellent design features.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with embodiment, there is provided a pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b>, which comprises: a pair of blade bodies <b>100</b>,<b>100</b>, each of the blade bodies <b>100</b>,<b>100</b> including a blade member <b>200</b> and a finger ring member <b>300</b> being joined to each other, two blade bodies <b>100</b>,<b>100</b> being coupled in a pivotal manner, wherein the blade member <b>200</b> has an engagement concave portion <b>220</b> formed as an open plane in a base portion <b>200</b>A thereof, the finger ring member <b>300</b> has an engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> that protrudes from a base portion <b>300</b>A thereof being arranged so as to engage with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> is formed with a pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> each inclined in a longitudinal direction of the blade member <b>200</b>, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is formed with a pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> each corresponding to the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b>, the pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b> is arranged so that, when the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into close contact with each other, the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> slide on each other in a direction that the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> come into close contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b> is arranged so that the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> are joined to each other by, basically, engaging the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> formed on the blade member <b>200</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> formed on the finger ring member <b>300</b>. However, unless the portions relevant to the joint are formed with extremely high accuracy, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are hardly joined to each other in a close contact state by means of a simple engagement. As a result, poor fitting or misalignment may result in poor stability of the joint. However, since not only a high degree of skill is required for forming the joint portion with such high accuracy but also, a considerably large cost and long time are required, mass production of the pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b> is extremely difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Therefore, the embodiment of the present invention employs an engagement joint structure, and in order to ensure satisfactory joint stability and strength by a close contact between the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b>, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> is formed with the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> therein and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is formed with the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> each corresponding to the since first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">That is, when the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are engaged with each other, the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> come into contact with each other. When the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into further close contact with each other, the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> slide on each other. With this, a force that causes the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> to come closer to each other in a longitudinal direction (a direction indicated with arrows &#x201c;I&#x201d; and &#x201c;I&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>); and thereby the both are brought into close contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with at least an embodiment, there is provided a pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b>, which comprises: a pair of blade bodies <b>100</b>,<b>100</b>, each of the blade bodies <b>100</b>,<b>100</b> including a blade member <b>200</b> and a finger ring member <b>300</b> being joined to each other, two blade bodies <b>100</b>,<b>100</b> being coupled in a pivotal manner, wherein the blade member <b>200</b> has an engagement concave portion <b>220</b> formed as an open plane in a base portion <b>200</b>A thereof, the finger ring member <b>300</b> has an engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> that protrudes from a base portion <b>300</b>A thereof being arranged so as to engage with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> is formed with a pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> each inclined in a width direction thereof, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is formed with a pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> each corresponding to the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b>, the pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b> is arranged so that, when the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into close contact with each other, the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> slide on each other, thereby the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are positioned and oriented properly as viewed in the width direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The engagement concave portion <b>220</b> is formed with the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b>; and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is formed with the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b>. With this arrangement, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is prevented from moving in the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> in the width direction (the direction indicated with arrows &#x201c;J&#x201d;, &#x201c;J&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). At the time, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is positioned to be parallel with respect to the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>; thus a stable joint state is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">To describe in more detail, when the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is engaged with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>, the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> come into contact with each other. When the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into further close contact with each other, the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> slide on each other. And the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is imparted with a force to move the same toward the center of the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> from the both sides thereof as viewed in the width direction. As a result, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is prevented from moving in the width direction and fixed at the center position of the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>, and at the same time, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is disposed to be parallel with respect to the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As described above, by disposing the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b>, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are fixed at a predetermined position as viewed in the width direction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with at least an embodiment, there is a pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b>, which comprises: a pair of blade bodies <b>100</b>,<b>100</b>, each of the blade bodies <b>100</b>,<b>100</b> including a blade member <b>200</b> and a finger ring member <b>300</b> being joined to each other, two blade bodies <b>100</b>,<b>100</b> being coupled in a pivotal manner, wherein the blade member <b>200</b> has an engagement concave portion <b>220</b> formed as an open plane in a base portion <b>200</b>A thereof, the finger ring member <b>300</b> has an engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> that protrudes from a base portion <b>300</b>A thereof being arranged so as to engage with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> is formed with a pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> each inclined in a longitudinal direction of the blade member and a pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> each inclined in a width direction thereof, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is formed with a pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> each corresponding to the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and a pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> each corresponding to the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b>, the pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b> is arranged so that, when the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into close contact with each other, the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> slide on each other in a direction that the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> are brought into close contact with each other, at the same time the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> slide on each other, thereby the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are positioned and oriented properly as viewed in the width direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b> set forth in the third aspect of the embodiment has the structures set forth in the first aspect and the second aspect in combination thereof. That is, in the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> formed in the blade member <b>200</b>, the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> are formed. And in the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> formed in the finger ring member <b>300</b>, the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> are formed. With this arrangement, the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> can be joined to each other in a close contact state as well as fixed at a predetermined position as viewed in the width direction. Thus, the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> are joined to each other so as to be separated from each other, at the same time the joint stability is ensured more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The pair of hairdressing scissors according to the embodiment includes not only the one used for cutting human hair but also the one used for cutting hair of animals. In the specification, the wording &#x201c;join/joint&#x201d; means to integrate the blade member (engagement concave portion) and the finger ring member (engagement-protruding piece) in a separable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In accordance with at least an embodiment, there is the pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b> set forth in the first to third aspects of the invention, wherein the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into close contact with each other by means of a screw <b>400</b> screwed into screw holes <b>223</b>, <b>333</b> formed in the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into close contact with each other by means of the screw. With this arrangement, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are held in a close contact state. At the same time, the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> can be easily separated from each other and joined to each other any time.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A solution employed in the fifth aspect of the embodiment is the pair of hairdressing scissors <b>10</b> set forth in the first to fourth aspects of the embodiment, wherein, a pair of protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> is formed on an end face of the base portion <b>200</b>A of the blade member <b>200</b> or in the vicinity of the base portion of the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> formed on the finger ring member <b>300</b>, and on the counterpart thereof, a pair of insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b> is formed for allowing the pair of protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> to be inserted thereinto.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With the pair of protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> formed at the both sides of the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b>, which are inserted into the pair of insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b> formed in the end face of the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>, the joint portion is prevented from twisting. That is, by inserting the pair of protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> into the pair of insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b>, in addition to the above-described prevention of movement in a longitudinal direction by the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the pair of second Vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> and prevention of movement in the width direction by the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b>, the joint portion is secured from three dimensional directions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, the pair of protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> abuts on the inner surfaces of the pair of insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b>. The abutting portions function as fulcrum when the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into close contact with each other; thereby the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into close contact with each other more firmly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A solution employed in the sixth aspect of the embodiment is the pair of hairdressing scissors set forth in any one of the first to fifth aspects, wherein a contact point <b>240</b> is formed on the pair of blade members <b>200</b>, <b>200</b> only.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The wording &#x201c;contact point&#x201d; means a portion having a circular shape round the hole through which a bolt is inserted and functions as a fulcrum axle of the a pair of opening/closing blade bodies. When cutting something with the pair of hairdressing scissors, due to cutting resistance, the rear faces of the pair of blade bodies tends to separate away from each other. However, at the same time, a cutting resistance large enough to reduce the smoothness of opening/closing operation of the pair of blade bodies is applied to the contact point.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When a force larger than the cutting resistance is applied to the pair of hairdressing scissors, due to the applied force, the contact points slide on each other in a close contact state. Thus, the pair of blade bodies opens and closes to cut the object in a close contact state without separating from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described above, the contact point largely affects in the cutting performance of the pair of hairdressing scissors. According to the invention set forth in the sixth aspect, the contact point is formed on the pair of blade members <b>200</b>, <b>200</b> only. That is, since the contact point <b>240</b> is formed on the pair of blade members <b>200</b>, <b>200</b> only, when either the pair of blade members <b>200</b>, <b>200</b> or the pair finger ring members <b>300</b> is replaced with a new one, the function of the contact point is not reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the first aspect of the embodiment, in the pair of hairdressing scissors, each of the blade members is formed with the engagement concave portion having the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions, the finger ring member is formed with engagement-protruding piece having the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions each corresponding to the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portion. When the blade member and the finger ring member are engaged and brought into close contact with each other, the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions and the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions slide on each other. Thus, the blade member and the finger ring member are brought into close contact with each other and joined with each other. With this arrangement, superior joint stability can be ensured while allowing the blade member and the finger ring member to be separated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the second aspect of the embodiment, in the pair of hairdressing scissors, each of the blade members is formed with the engagement concave portion having the pair of first width-direction tapered portions and the finger ring member is formed with the engagement-protruding piece having the pair of second width-direction tapered portions each corresponding to the pair of first width-direction tapered portions. When the blade member and the finger ring member are engaged and brought into close contact with each other, the pair of first width-direction tapered portions and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions are slide on each other and the engagement-protruding piece is prevented from moving in the width direction thereof in the engagement concave portion; thereby the blade member and the finger ring member are positioned and joined with each other. With this arrangement, superior joint stability can be ensured while allowing the blade member and the finger ring member to be separated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the third aspect of the embodiment, in the pair of hairdressing scissors, the blade members is formed with engagement concave portion having the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions and the pair of first width-direction tapered portions, while the finger ring member is formed with the engagement-protruding piece having the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions each corresponding to the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions each corresponding to the pair of first width-direction tapered portions. When the blade members and the engagement-protruding piece are engaged and brought into close contact with each other, satisfactory joint stability can be ensured while allowing the blade member and the finger ring member to be separated from each other. That is, when the engagement concave portion and the engagement-protruding piece are brought into close contact with each other, the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions and the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions slide on each other; thereby the joint end of the blade member and the joint end of the finger ring member can be brought into close contact and joined with each other. At the same time, the pair of first width-direction tapered portions and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions slide on each other; thereby the engagement-protruding piece is prevented from moving in the width direction and positioned properly in the engagement concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, as a common effect provided by the pair of hairdressing scissors according to claims <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>, since joining the blade member and the finger ring member so as to be separated, for example, even when the surface of the finger ring member is decorated with a design with a laser beam radiation or by arranging jewels and/or ornament articles such as beads, by replacing the blade member only with a new one, the finger ring member can be repeatedly used. Therefore, the user can obtain an original pair of hairdressing scissors.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the fourth aspect of the embodiment, in addition to the effect of the pair of the hairdressing scissors set forth in any one of the first to third aspects, in the pair of hairdressing scissors, the engagement concave portion and the engagement-protruding piece are held in a close contact state by means of the screw screwed into the screw holes formed in the engagement concave portion and the engagement protruding portion. Thereby, both of the engagement concave portion and the engagement-protruding piece are firmly held in the close contact state while the blade member and the finger ring member are allowed to be separated from each other anytime and joined with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the fifth aspect of the embodiment, in addition to the effect of the pair of hairdressing scissors set forth in any one of the first to fourth aspects, in the pair of hairdressing scissors, the protruding portions are formed on the end face of the blade member or in the vicinity of the base of the engagement-protruding piece formed on the finger ring member; and on the other part thereof, the insertion portions, into which the protruding portions are inserted, are formed. With this arrangement, the joint portions are prevented from moving in a twisting direction or separating away from each other in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the sixth aspect of the embodiment, in addition to the effect of the pair of hairdressing scissors set forth in any one of the first to fifth aspects, in the pair of hairdressing scissors, the contact point is formed on the blade members only. Therefore, even when either one of the pair of blade members or the pair of finger ring members is replaced with another one, since the position of the contact point is unchanged, stable cutting performance is always ensured. Also, the contact state between the contact points can be adjusted on the blade members only. Therefore, for example, in order for maintenance such as sharpening by the maker, when the pair of blade members are disassembled and handed over the maker, it is possible for the maker to adjust the contact point and to return the same to the customer. Moreover, conventionally, the contact point has to be formed after welding the respective blade members and finger ring members. On the other hand, since the contact point can be formed on the blade members only before joining the blade member and the finger ring member. Accordingly, the manufacturing process can be simplified.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0102">Furthermore, the blade member <b>200</b> is formed with a pair of insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b> in the end face of the base portion <b>200</b>A into which a pair of protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> formed on the finger ring member <b>300</b> are inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrate a finger ring member <b>300</b> constituting the blade body <b>100</b>. The finger ring member <b>300</b> is constituted of a finger ring portion <b>310</b> and a shaft portion <b>320</b>. Formed being protruding from a base portion <b>300</b>A of the shaft portion <b>320</b> is an engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> that engages with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> formed on the blade member <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> are enlarged views of the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is formed with a pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> and a pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> and a screw hole <b>333</b> on the rear face <b>330</b>A of the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b>. Each of the second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> are formed being inclined downward from the front end of the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> toward the base portion thereof. With this arrangement, when the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is engaged with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> formed in the blade member <b>200</b>, each of the second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> fit with each of the first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> formed in the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0105">Each of the second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> is formed at the outer side of each of the second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b>. Each of the second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> is formed being inclined downward toward the outer side of the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> so that, when the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is engaged with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>, each of the second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> fits with each of the first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0106">The screw hole <b>333</b> is formed to fix the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> to each other with the screw <b>400</b> that is screwed thereinto. Furthermore, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is formed with a counter cavity <b>334</b> for receiving a head of the screw <b>400</b> in the front side <b>330</b>B thereof. At the both sides of the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b>, a pair of protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> extends from the base portion <b>300</b>A of the shaft portion <b>320</b>. The pair of protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> is inserted into the pair of insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b> formed in the blade member <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0107">As describe above, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> formed in the blade member <b>200</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> formed on the finger ring member <b>300</b> are engaged with each other; thereby the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> are joined with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrate a state that the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are engaged with each other. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is engaged with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> in a state that the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is received entirely by the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>; and both are secured by the screw <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0109">Now, assembly process that the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> are joined to each other will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrate the process that the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are engaged with each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> show a sectional view of the joint portion along a line F-F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0110">Here, the operation of the first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b>, which are formed on the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>, and the second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b>, which are formed on the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b>, will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0111">First of all, the finger ring member <b>300</b> and the blade member <b>200</b> are hold being opposed to each other at an angle with respect to each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. From this state, the protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b>, which are formed on the finger ring member <b>300</b> are inserted into the insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b>, which are formed in the blade member <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0112">Then, while maintaining a state that the protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> are inserted into the insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is engaged with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>. At this time, the pair of the second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> formed on the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> comes into contact with the pair of the first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> formed on the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0113">Subsequently, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is made to be closer to the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> to be received therein as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> and the screw <b>400</b> is screwed into the screw holes. On contact points between inside portions of the insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b> and the protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> as a fulcrum, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are pressed on each other in a vertical direction (directions indicated with arrows &#x201c;H&#x201d;, &#x201c;H&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). At the same time, the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b> comes into contact with the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and slides thereon. With this, between the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b>, a force works on the both to pull each other in a longitudinal direction (a direction indicated with arrows &#x201c;I&#x201d;, &#x201c;I&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). As a result, the end face of the blade member <b>200</b> and the end face of the finger ring member <b>300</b> are caused to come into closed contact with each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0114">That is, as the engagement concave portion <b>200</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are forcibly caused to contact with each other, the close contact between the end face of the blade member <b>200</b> and the end face of the finger ring member <b>300</b> is further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0115">Here, even after the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into a complete contact, to prevent the bottom of the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> from coming into contact with the bottom of the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> is formed so that the depth thereof is larger than the thickness of the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> to ensure a clearance between the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b>. With this arrangement, when the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> and the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> are strongly tightened, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> may be further proceeded into the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> resulting in a step between the surface of the blade member <b>200</b> and the surface of the finger ring member <b>300</b>. However, even when such a step is generated, since the step is extremely small, no adverse affect is given to the design features of the blade body.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0116">Thus, with the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the pair of the second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b>, the blade member <b>200</b> and the surface of the finger ring member <b>300</b> are fixed not to move in a longitudinal direction as well as in a vertical direction by tightening the screw <b>400</b>. Furthermore, with the pair of insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b> and the pair of protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b> twisting movement and separation in the vertical direction are prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0117">Now, the operation of the first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> formed in the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> formed in the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> will be described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-29</figref> illustrate a state that the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is engaged with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref> illustrate a sectional view as viewed along a line G-G in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-29</figref> illustrate a state as viewed from the top.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0118">First of all, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is engaged with the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. At this time, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are overlapped with each other at a small angle with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0119">Subsequently, when the screw <b>400</b> is screwed into the screw holes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are brought into close contact with each other, and the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> slide on each other. Here, accompanying this sliding movement, two forces act on the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> from the both sides thereof as viewed in the width direction (directions indicated with arrows &#x201c;J&#x201d; and &#x201c;J&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). With this, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is forced to move toward the center of the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>. Thus, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is positioned at the center of the engagement concave portion <b>220</b>, and the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are oriented properly so as to be parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0120">When the sliding movement of the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b> is completed, the forces acting on the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> from the both sides as viewed in the width direction get balanced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. Thus, the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is fixed to a predetermined position in the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> as viewed in the width direction, and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> is oriented properly so as to align with engagement concave portion <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0121">As described above, when the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> formed on the blade member <b>200</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> formed on the finger ring member <b>300</b> are engaged with each other, the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> are firmly joined to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0122">That is, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are secured in a vertical direction by fastening the screw <b>400</b>. At the same time, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are secured in a longitudinal direction with the sliding movement of the pair of first vertical-direction tapered portions <b>221</b>, <b>221</b> and the pair of second vertical-direction tapered portions <b>331</b>, <b>331</b>. Further, the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> are positioned in the width direction and oriented properly with the pair of first width-direction tapered portions <b>222</b>, <b>222</b> and the pair of second width-direction tapered portions <b>332</b>, <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0123">Furthermore, with the pair of insertion portions <b>230</b>, <b>230</b> and the pair of protruding portions <b>340</b>, <b>340</b>, the movement in a twisting direction is eliminated. Thus, the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> are completely secured in three-dimensional directions.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0124">On the other hand, the blade member <b>200</b> and the finger ring member <b>300</b> can be easily separated by unfastening the screw <b>400</b> that holds the engagement concave portion <b>220</b> and the engagement-protruding piece <b>330</b> in close contact with each other.</p>
