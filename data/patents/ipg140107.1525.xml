<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority of European Patent Office application No. 09011070.1 EP filed Aug. 28, 2009, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention refers to a stator blade for a turbomachine which is exposable to axial throughflow, comprising a blade root, having two sides disposed opposite each other, with a platform and at least one blade airfoil which is arranged thereupon. In addition, the invention refers to a stator blade arrangement with a carrier structure, on the inner generated surface of which provision is made for a circumferential groove in which stator blades, which are retained by means of a form fit, are seated in a butt-mounted manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a stator blade and stator blade arrangement for a compressor are known for example from US 2005/0191177 A1. In the compressor casing, which is formed by two halves of an annulus, provision is made for a circumferential groove for each stator blade ring of a compressor stage. The sidewalls of the circumferential groove have undercuts in order to retain in this groove, in a form-fitting manner by correspondingly formed inverted T-shaped blade roots, stator blades which are inserted therein. Two abutting stator blades in the circumferential groove have a hole in each case in their oppositely disposed side faces. A tensioning sleeve, for the mechanical coupling of the two directly adjacent blade roots, is inserted into the aligning holes. As a result of the coupling, blade vibrations are expected to be damped and blade root movements reduced or prevented, which as a result avoids wear on the blade roots.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, a tensioned seating of rotor blades in an inverted T-shaped circumferential groove is known from U.S. Pat. No. 6,761,538 B2. For applying a tensioning force which acts upon the rotor blades in the radial direction, an encompassing channel is formed in the bottom of the circumferential groove, in which is inserted a spring ring which acts upon the rotor blade. The spring ring is designed in the form of a curved tensioning sleeve which, in addition to the customary longitudinal slot, also has a multiplicity of slots which extend in its circumferential direction, as a result of which free-ending spring arms, which are arranged in between them, are created, by means of which the rotor blades, which are inserted in the circumferential groove, are fastened in a tensioned manner in the radial direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the invention is the disclosure of an alternative stator blade arrangement and the provision of a stator blade which is suitable for it.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object which is focused upon the stator blade is achieved with a stator blade for a turbomachine which is exposable to axial throughflow, which comprises a blade root, having two oppositely disposed sides, with a platform and at least one blade airfoil which is arranged thereupon, wherein the blade root on one of the two sides has at least one projecting shaped piece in which provision is made for at least one threaded hole for the radial tensioning of the stator blade in a circumferential groove of a carrier structure of a turbomachine by means of a tensioning screw which is screwed in the threaded hole and supported on the bottom of the circumferential groove, and in which the blade root on the other of the two sides has at least one recess for accommodating at least one shaped piece of an adjacent stator blade, including a tensioning screw which is screwed into it.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object which is focused upon the stator blade arrangement is achieved with an annular carrier structure, on the inner generated surface of which provision is made for a circumferential groove, in which stator blades according to the aforesaid development, which are retained by means of a form fit, are seated in an butt-mounted manner, wherein each such stator blade is tensioned in the circumferential groove by means of a tensioning screw which is screwed in the threaded hole of its shaped piece and supported on the bottom of the circumferential groove, and the shaped piece, including the tensioning screw, is fully covered by the platform of that stator blade which is directly adjacent to the stator blade in question.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a result of the stator blade arrangement according to the invention, a fixed clamping in the radial direction of the stator blade in the carrier structure of a turbomachine which is exposable to axial throughflow can be achieved. Since the tensioning force is first created when screwing in and tightening up the tensioning screw, the stator blade, and particularly its blade root, can be produced with comparatively large tolerances and with comparatively low fitting accuracy in relation to the contour of the circumferential groove. On the one hand, this facilitates the positioning, i.e. inserting and displacing the stator blade in the circumferential groove. On the other hand, the gaps which are required for thermal expansion can be provided in sufficient size as a result, which makes the stator blade arrangement insensitive to thermal influences.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since the assembly clearances and therefore the manufacturing tolerances can be increased on account of the compensating of the larger clearances by means of the tensioning screw, a cost advantage also results in the manufacture of the corresponding components.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, as a result of the tensioning of the stator blade on the carrier structure, relative movements of the stator blades are blocked and consequently possible wear is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, the stator blades, on account of their clearance-free fastening, have a defined radial position, as a result of which the radial gaps between the free-standing airfoil tips of the stator blades and the rotor which lies opposite these airfoil tips can be set and produced narrower than previously. This reduces the radial gap losses, which occur in the flow medium, at the airfoil tips of free-standing stator blades during operation of the turbomachine, which increases the efficiency of the turbomachine.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">So that the tensioning screw which is required for tensioning the stator blade does not project into the flow passage of the turbomachine, on one of the two oppositely disposed sides of the blade root, a shaped piece is arranged, which projects therefrom. The shaped piece in this case is arranged considerably closer to the underside of the blade root than to the surface of the platform. Provision is made in the shaped piece for a threaded hole in which the tensioning screw can be screwed. Since the shaped piece projects to the side, the threaded hole and the tensioning screw are particularly easily accessible for installation operations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to provide a flow passage boundary of the turbomachine with as few component edges as possible, it is provided that the platform of that stator blade which is arranged directly adjacent to a stator blade in question covers the shaped piece, including the tensioning screw, of the stator blade in question. For this purpose, provision is made on the other of the two oppositely disposed sides of the blade root for at least one recess in a size which corresponds at least to the installation space of the shaped piece, including the tensioning screw which is screwed into it. By means of this measure, a flow passage boundary can locally be achieved by means of the top surfaces of the platforms of the blade root alone without additional components being required in the circumferential groove for covering the shaped piece, including the tensioning screw. Moreover, the tensioning screws are shielded from the flow medium by means of the platform of the adjacent stator blade and are therefore protected against its influences. This prevents corrosion and seizing of the tensioning screws in the thread of the hole.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further advantageous developments are disclosed in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The stator blade root is expediently of an inverted T-shaped design. According to a further advantageous development, the stator blade comprises two shaped pieces on the one side, with a threaded hole in each case. As a result of this, a tensioning of the stator blade can be carried out in which the tensioning force is created in each case close to the sidewalls of the circumferential groove and not in the middle between them, as in the case of a stator blade with only one shaped piece. This increases the security of the tensioning. Naturally, it is also conceivable for two threaded holes to be provided, with comparable spacing, in a correspondingly large shaped piece.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Naturally, the stator blade can also be formed as a stator blade segment which has two or more blade airfoils.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The turbomachine is preferably a compressor which is exposable to axial throughflow so that the stator blade is formed as a compressor stator blade or as a compressor stator blade segment.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an advantageous development of the stator blade arrangement, at least one of the stator blades has a locking device for absorbing blade root reaction forces in the circumferential direction. Previously each stator blade was customarily locked in such a way. On account of the now reliable stator blade which is tensioned with a comparatively large force, the number of previously used locking devices for absorbing blade root reaction forces can be reduced so that for example only every fourth or every third stator blade has to be locked for absorbing such forces.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another advantageous development, the carrier structure is formed as a stator blade carrier or as a turbomachine casing which can be split in half along its axial extent. This facilitates the insertion of stator blades in the circumferential groove. Also, the provision of a stator blade lock is avoided which otherwise in the case of a one-piece carrier structure would be necessary with a circumferential groove which would then be endless.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> show in perspective view, from different directions of view, a stator blade <b>10</b> according to the invention for a turbomachine. The stator blade <b>10</b> comprises a blade root <b>12</b> which has two oppositely disposed sides <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. Between the two oppositely disposed sides <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, a platform <b>18</b> is arranged, from the top surface <b>20</b> of which an aerodynamically curved blade airfoil <b>22</b>, which extends transversely to it, projects in a free-standing manner.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">On one (<b>16</b>) of the two sides <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, a projecting shaped piece <b>24</b> is formed in the manner of a lug. The shaped piece <b>24</b> in this case is arranged in the middle close to an underside <b>25</b> of the blade root. In the shaped piece <b>24</b>, there is a threaded hole <b>26</b>, the thread axis of which is oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the top surface <b>20</b> of the platform <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">On the other (<b>14</b>) of the two sides <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, provision is made for a recess <b>29</b>. The recess <b>29</b> of the stator blade <b>10</b> in question in this case is selected in its position and its size so that in the case of stator blades <b>10</b> abutting in a ring the shaped piece <b>24</b>, or each shaped piece&#x2014;including a tensioning screw which is arranged therein but not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and FIG. <b>2</b>&#x2014;of a stator blade <b>10</b> which is directly adjacent to the stator blade <b>10</b> in question can be fully accommodated.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The stator blade <b>10</b>, moreover, has two hooks <b>27</b> which project on a web <b>23</b> which connects the two sides <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. Consequently, between hook <b>27</b> and platform <b>18</b>, there is a slot <b>28</b> in each case for accommodating projections of the circumferential groove into which the stator blade <b>10</b> is to be inserted. The web <b>23</b> and the hooks <b>27</b> have an inverted T-shaped impression, whereupon the blade root <b>12</b> is also described as being an inverted T-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The stator blades <b>10</b>, which are butt-mounted in the circumferential groove, always butt against each other in such a way that the one side <b>16</b> of a first stator blade <b>10</b> lies opposite the other side <b>14</b> of a second stator blade <b>10</b> in a gapless manner as far as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the longitudinal section through an annular carrier structure <b>30</b> which is part of a stator blade carrier or of a casing of the turbomachine which is exposable to axial throughflow. On its inner generated surface <b>32</b>, provision is made for a circumferential groove <b>34</b> which extends in the circumferential direction. The circumferential groove <b>34</b> has two oppositely disposed sidewalls <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> on which provision is made for projections <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> for the form-fitting retention of the stator blade <b>10</b>. The stator blade <b>10</b> which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> differs from the stator blade <b>10</b> which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in that the shaped piece <b>24</b> which is arranged on the one side <b>16</b> extends almost over the entire width of the blade root <b>12</b> or of the circumferential groove <b>34</b> and in that provision is made for altogether two threaded holes <b>26</b> which are not arranged in the middle between the sidewalls <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> of the circumferential groove <b>34</b>, but close to the sidewall.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A tensioning screw <b>44</b> is screwed in the threaded holes <b>26</b> in each case. The tensioning screw <b>44</b> can be formed for example as a grub screw or even as a common screw with a screw head. The end of the tensioning screw <b>44</b> is supported on the bottom <b>35</b> of the circumferential groove <b>34</b> and at the same time presses the hooks <b>27</b> which are arranged on the blade root <b>12</b> onto the projections <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the circumferential groove <b>34</b>, as a result of which the stator blade <b>10</b> lies in a fixed pretensioned state in the radial direction of the turbomachine which is exposable to axial throughflow.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the cross section through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> according to the line of intersection IV-IV, wherein identical features in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are also provided with identical designations. It clearly emerges from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that the shaped piece <b>24</b> projects on the side <b>16</b> and in this case is a part of the underside <b>25</b> of the blade root. Also to be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is the recess <b>29</b> which is on the opposite side <b>14</b> for accommodating a shaped piece <b>24</b> of an adjacent stator blade <b>10</b>, including a tensioning screw <b>44</b> which is screwed into it. The recess <b>29</b> is also arranged on the underside <b>25</b> of the blade root, corresponding to the shaped piece <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a part of the development of a stator blade arrangement <b>50</b> with carrier structure <b>30</b> and circumferential groove <b>34</b>. In the following figure description and in this figure, the designations of the features which are associated with a first stator blade <b>10</b><i>a </i>are expanded by the suffix a, the designations of the features which are associated with a second stator blade <b>10</b><i>b </i>are expanded by the suffix b, and the designations of the features which are associated with a third stator blade <b>10</b><i>c </i>are expanded by the suffix c. The first stator blade <b>10</b><i>a </i>is already positioned at its specified location and by means of two grub screw-like tensioning screws <b>44</b><i>a </i>is tensioned in a fixed manner in the circumferential groove <b>34</b>. For the further equipping of the stator blade arrangement <b>50</b> with stator blades, two second and third stator blades <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c </i>are already threaded in the circumferential groove <b>34</b>. After tensioning the first stator blade <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the second stator blade <b>10</b><i>b</i>, which is directly adjacent to it, is displaced in the circumferential direction, i.e. in the direction of the arrow <b>52</b>, until its platforms <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>butt against each other. In the process, the shaped piece <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the first stator blade <b>10</b><i>a </i>is then arranged in the recess <b>29</b><i>b </i>of the second stator blade <b>10</b><i>b </i>so that from the flow passage point of view the platform <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the second stator blade <b>10</b><i>b </i>completely covers the shaped piece <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the first stator blade <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Strictly speaking, the top surface <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the platform <b>18</b><i>b </i>covers the recess <b>29</b><i>b </i>in radial projection. Next, the second stator blade <b>10</b><i>b </i>is fastened in the corresponding position by means of further tensioning screws. Consequently, the third stator blade <b>10</b><i>c </i>can be slid over the shaped piece <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the second stator blade <b>10</b><i>b </i>so that its tensioning screws are also concealed by the platform <b>18</b><i>c </i>of the third stator blade <b>10</b><i>c</i>. By continued threading and tensioning of further stator blades <b>10</b> of the stator blade ring, a complete stator blade ring for a turbomachine which is exposable to axial throughflow can be assembled, wherein all the stator blades <b>10</b> are then pressed with a defined pretension on the projections <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the retaining groove <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The stator blades <b>10</b>, moreover, are further secured for absorbing blade root reaction forces according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the bottom <b>35</b> of the retaining groove <b>34</b>, there is a through-hole for this purpose, into which a further screw <b>54</b>, with a dog point, can be screwed from the rear side of the carrier structure <b>30</b>, the dog point engaging in a recess, which corresponds to it, on the underside of the blade root <b>12</b> of the stator blade <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The invention is not limited to the developments of stator blades <b>10</b> which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. Naturally, it is possible to also provide on the one side <b>16</b> two shaped pieces <b>24</b>, these then being off-center, with a threaded hole <b>26</b> in each case. The other side <b>14</b> of such a stator blade <b>10</b> then has one or two recesses <b>29</b> for accommodating the corresponding shaped pieces <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In all, with the invention a stator blade <b>10</b> and a stator blade arrangement <b>50</b> for a turbomachine which is exposable to axial throughflow, especially a compressor, is disclosed, in which each stator blade <b>10</b> is retained via a fixed clamping in a circumferential groove <b>34</b>. For the fixed clamping, provision is made on one side <b>16</b> of the blade root <b>12</b> for a projecting shaped piece <b>24</b> with a threaded hole <b>26</b> into which a tensioning screw <b>44</b>, which is supported on the bottom <b>35</b> of the circumferential groove <b>34</b>, can be screwed. A particular advantage of the invention is that in the stator blade ring both the shaped piece <b>24</b> and the tensioning screw <b>44</b> which is screwed into it are completely covered by the platform <b>18</b> of a stator blade <b>10</b> which is adjacent thereto, so that the inter-engaging thread of threaded hole <b>26</b> and tensioning screw <b>44</b> is shielded by the top surface <b>20</b> of the platform <b>18</b> against the operating medium which flows in the flow passage of the turbomachine. The shielding prevents corrosion and seizing of the tensioning screw <b>44</b>, which reliably ensures removal of the stator blades <b>10</b> from the circumferential groove <b>34</b> even after longer periods of operation.</p>
