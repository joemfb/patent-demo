<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to polypeptides having xylanase activity and polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides. The invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs, vectors, and host cells comprising the polynucleotides as well as methods of producing and using the polypeptides.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Cellulose is a polymer of the simple sugar glucose covalently linked by beta-1,4-bonds. Many microorganisms produce enzymes that hydrolyze beta-linked glucans. These enzymes include endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and beta-glucosidases. Endoglucanases digest the cellulose polymer at random locations, opening it to attack by cellobiohydrolases. Cellobiohydrolases sequentially release molecules of cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water-soluble beta-1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Beta-glucosidases hydrolyze cellobiose to glucose.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks into ethanol has the advantages of the ready availability of large amounts of feedstock, the desirability of avoiding burning or land filling the materials, and the cleanliness of the ethanol fuel. Wood, agricultural residues, herbaceous crops, and municipal solid wastes have been considered as feedstocks for ethanol production. These materials primarily consist of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Once the lignocellulose is converted to fermentable sugars, e.g., glucose, the fermentable sugars are easily fermented by yeast into ethanol.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a need in the art for new polypeptides having xylanase activity for use in the degradation of cellulosic and xylan-containing materials.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides polypeptides having xylanase activity and polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention relates to isolated polypeptides having xylanase activity selected from the group consisting of:</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">(a) a polypeptide having at least 85% sequence identity to the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or at least 75% sequence identity to the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 4;</p>

The predominant polysaccharide in the primary cell wall of biomass is cellulose, the second most abundant is hemicellulose, and the third is pectin. The secondary cell wall, produced after the cell has stopped growing, also contains polysaccharides and is strengthened by polymeric lignin covalently cross-linked to hemicellulose. Cellulose is a homopolymer of anhydrocellobiose and thus a linear beta-(1-4)-D-glucan, while hemicelluloses include a variety of compounds, such as xylans, xyloglucans, arabinoxylans, and mannans in complex branched structures with a spectrum of substituents. Although generally polymorphous, cellulose is found in plant tissue primarily as an insoluble crystalline matrix of parallel glucan chains. Hemicelluloses usually hydrogen bond to cellulose, as well as to other hemicelluloses, which help stabilize the cell wall matrix.</p>

The boundaries of the coding sequence are generally determined by an open reading frame, which begins with a start codon such as ATG, GTG, or TTG and ends with a stop codon such as TAA, TAG, or TGA. The coding sequence may be a genomic DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Control sequences: The term &#x201c;control sequences&#x201d; means nucleic acid sequences necessary for expression of a polynucleotide encoding a mature polypeptide of the present invention. Each control sequence may be native (i.e., from the same gene) or foreign (i.e., from a different gene) to the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide or native or foreign to each other.

The enzymes in this family were originally classified as a glycoside hydrolase family based on measurement of very weak endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase activity in one family member. The structure and mode of action of these enzymes are non-canonical and they cannot be considered as bona fide glycosidases. However, they are kept in the CAZy classification on the basis of their capacity to enhance the breakdown of lignocellulose when used in conjunction with a cellulase or a mixture of cellulases.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Feruloyl esterase: The term &#x201c;feruloyl esterase&#x201d; means a 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamoyl-sugar hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.73) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamoyl (feruloyl) groups from esterified sugar, which is usually arabinose in &#x201c;natural&#x201d; substrates, to produce ferulate (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamate). Feruloyl esterase is also known as ferulic acid esterase, hydroxycinnamoyl esterase, FAE-III, cinnamoyl ester hydrolase, FAEA, cinnAE, FAE-I, or FAE-II. For purposes of the present invention, feruloyl esterase activity is determined using 0.5 mM p-nitrophenylferulate as substrate in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0. One unit of feruloyl esterase equals the amount of enzyme capable of releasing 1 &#x3bc;mole of p-nitrophenolate anion per minute at pH 5, 25&#xb0; C.</p>

See, for example, Shallom, D. and Shoham, Y. Microbial hemicellulases. <i>Current Opinion In Microbiology, </i>2003, 6(3): 219-228). Hemicellulases are key components in the degradation of plant biomass. Examples of hemicellulases include, but are not limited to, an acetylmannan esterase, an acetylxylan esterase, an arabinanase, an arabinofuranosidase, a coumaric acid esterase, a feruloyl esterase, a galactosidase, a glucuronidase, a glucuronoyl esterase, a mannanase, a mannosidase, a xylanase, and a xylosidase. The substrates of these enzymes, the hemicelluloses, are a heterogeneous group of branched and linear polysaccharides that are bound via hydrogen bonds to the cellulose microfibrils in the plant cell wall, crosslinking them into a robust network. Hemicelluloses are also covalently attached to lignin, forming together with cellulose a highly complex structure. The variable structure and organization of hemicelluloses require the concerted action of many enzymes for its complete degradation. The catalytic modules of hemicellulases are either glycoside hydrolases (GHs) that hydrolyze glycosidic bonds, or carbohydrate esterases (CEs), which hydrolyze ester linkages of acetate or ferulic acid side groups. These catalytic modules, based on homology of their primary sequence, can be assigned into GH and CE families. Some families, with an overall similar fold, can be further grouped into clans, marked alphabetically (e.g., GH-A). A most informative and updated classification of these and other carbohydrate active enzymes is available in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database. Hemicellulolytic enzyme activities can be measured according to Ghose and Bisaria, 1987<i>, Pure </i>&#x26; <i>Appl.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In an embodiment, the present invention relates to isolated polypeptides having a sequence identity to the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 of at least 85%, e.g., at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%; or the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 4 of at least 75%, e.g., at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%; at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%; which have xylanase activity. In one aspect, the polypeptides differ by up to 10 amino acids, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, from the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 4.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A polypeptide of the present invention preferably comprises or consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 4; or an allelic variant thereof; or is a fragment thereof having xylanase activity. In another aspect, the polypeptide comprises or consists of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 4. In another aspect, the polypeptide comprises or consists of amino acids 28 to 255 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another aspect, the polypeptide comprises or consists of amino acids 20 to 248 of SEQ ID NO: 4.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In another embodiment, the present invention relates to isolated polypeptides having xylanase activity that are encoded by polynucleotides that hybridize under very low stringency conditions, low stringency conditions, medium stringency conditions, medium-high stringency conditions, high stringency conditions, or very high stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, (ii) the cDNA sequence thereof, or (iii) the full-length complement of (i) or (ii) (J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch, and T. Maniatis, 1989<i>, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, </i>2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, or a subsequence thereof, as well as the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 4, or a fragment thereof, may be used to design nucleic acid probes to identify and clone DNA encoding polypeptides having xylanase activity from strains of different genera or species according to methods well known in the art. In particular, such probes can be used for hybridization with the genomic DNA or cDNA of a cell of interest, following standard Southern blotting procedures, in order to identify and isolate the corresponding gene therein. Such probes can be considerably shorter than the entire sequence, but should be at least 15, e.g., at least 25, at least 35, or at least 70 nucleotides in length. Preferably, the nucleic acid probe is at least 100 nucleotides in length, e.g., at least 200 nucleotides, at least 300 nucleotides, at least 400 nucleotides, at least 500 nucleotides, at least 600 nucleotides, at least 700 nucleotides, at least 800 nucleotides, or at least 900 nucleotides in length. Both DNA and RNA probes can be used. The probes are typically labeled for detecting the corresponding gene (for example, with <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>35</sup>S, biotin, or avidin). Such probes are encompassed by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A genomic DNA or cDNA library prepared from such other strains may be screened for DNA that hybridizes with the probes described above and encodes a polypeptide having xylanase activity. Genomic or other DNA from such other strains may be separated by agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or other separation techniques. DNA from the libraries or the separated DNA may be transferred to and immobilized on nitrocellulose or other suitable carrier material. In order to identify a clone or DNA that is homologous with SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, or a subsequence thereof, the carrier material is used in a Southern blot.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">For purposes of the present invention, hybridization indicates that the polynucleotide hybridizes to a labeled nucleic acid probe corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3; the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3; the cDNA thereof; the full-length complement thereof; or a subsequence thereof; under very low to very high stringency conditions. Molecules to which the nucleic acid probe hybridizes under these conditions can be detected using, for example, X-ray film or any other detection means known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one aspect, the nucleic acid probe is the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, or the cDNA sequence thereof. In another aspect, the nucleic acid probe nucleotides 82 to 851 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or nucleotides 58 to 802 of SEQ ID NO: 3. In another aspect, the nucleic acid probe is a polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 4, or the mature polypeptide thereof; or fragment thereof. In another aspect, the nucleic acid probe is SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, or the cDNA sequence thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another embodiment, the present invention relates to isolated polypeptides having xylanase activity encoded by polynucleotides having a sequence identity to the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or the cDNA sequence thereof, of at least 85%, e.g., at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%; or the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, or the cDNA sequence thereof, of at least 75%, e.g., at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In another embodiment, the present invention relates to variants of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 4 comprising a substitution, deletion, and/or insertion at one or more (e.g., several) positions. In an embodiment, the number of amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions introduced into the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 4 is not more than 10, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. The, amino acid changes may be of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of 1-30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino-terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to 20-25 residues; or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Examples of conservative substitutions are within the groups of basic amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine), acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine), and small amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine and methionine). Amino acid substitutions that do not generally alter specific activity are known in the art and are described, for example, by H. Neurath and R. L. Hill, 1979<i>, In, The Proteins</i>, Academic Press, New York. Common substitutions are Ala/Ser, Val/Ile, Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/Thr, Ser/Asn, Ala/Val, Ser/Gly, Tyr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Asp/Asn, Leu/Ile, Leu/Val, Ala/Glu, and Asp/Gly.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Alternatively, the amino acid changes are of such a nature that the physico-chemical properties of the polypeptides are altered. For example, amino acid changes may improve the thermal stability of the polypeptide, alter the substrate specificity, change the pH optimum, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Essential amino acids in a polypeptide can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 1989<i>, Science </i>244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for xylanase activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et al., 1996<i>, J. Biol. Chem. </i>271: 4699-4708. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction, or photoaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids. See, for example, de Vos et al., 1992, Science 255: 306-312; Smith et al., 1992<i>, J. Mol. Biol. </i>224: 899-904; Wlodaver et al., 1992<i>, FEBS Lett. </i>309: 59-64. The identity of essential amino acids can also be inferred from an alignment with a related polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988<i>, Science </i>241: 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989<i>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>86: 2152-2156; WO 95/17413; or WO 95/22625. Other methods that can be used include error-prone PCR, phage display (e.g., Lowman et al., 1991<i>, Biochemistry </i>30: 10832-10837; U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; WO 92/06204), and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et al., 1986<i>, Gene </i>46: 145; Ner et al., 1988<i>, DNA </i>7: 127).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Mutagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host cells (Ness et al., 1999<i>, Nature Biotechnology </i>17: 893-896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using standard methods in the art. These methods allow the rapid determination of the importance of individual amino acid residues in a polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The polypeptide may be a hybrid polypeptide in which a region of one polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of a region of another polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The polypeptide may be a fusion polypeptide or cleavable fusion polypeptide in which another polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the polypeptide of the present invention. A fusion polypeptide is produced by fusing a polynucleotide encoding another polypeptide to a polynucleotide of the present invention. Techniques for producing fusion polypeptides are known in the art, and include ligating the coding sequences encoding the polypeptides so that they are in frame and that expression of the fusion polypeptide is under control of the same promoter(s) and terminator. Fusion polypeptides may also be constructed using intein technology in which fusion polypeptides are created post-translationally (Cooper et al., 1993<i>, EMBO J. </i>12: 2575-2583; Dawson et al., 1994<i>, Science </i>266: 776-779).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A fusion polypeptide can further comprise a cleavage site between the two polypeptides. Upon secretion of the fusion protein, the site is cleaved releasing the two polypeptides. Examples of cleavage sites include, but are not limited to, the sites disclosed in Martin et al., 2003<i>, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. </i>3: 568-576; Svetina et al., 2000<i>, J. Biotechnol. </i>76: 245-251; Rasmussen-Wilson et al., 1997<i>, Appl. Environ.

For purposes of the present invention, the term &#x201c;obtained from&#x201d; as used herein in connection with a given source shall mean that the polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide is produced by the source or by a strain in which the polynucleotide from the source has been inserted. In one aspect, the polypeptide obtained from a given source is secreted extracellularly.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The polypeptide may be a fungal polypeptide. For example, the polypeptide may be a yeast polypeptide such as a <i>Candida, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces</i>, or <i>Yarrowia </i>polypeptide; or a filamentous fungal polypeptide such as an <i>Acremonium, Agaricus, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Botryospaeria, Ceriporiopsis, Chaetomidium, Chrysosporium, Claviceps, Cochliobolus, Coprinopsis, Coptotermes, Corynascus, Cryphonectria, Cryptococcus, Diplodia, Exidia, Filibasidium, Fusarium, Gibberella, Holomastigotoides, Humicola, Irpex, Len tinula, Leptospaeria, Magnaporthe, Melanocarpus, Meripilus, Mucor, Myceliophthora, Neocallimastix, Neurospora, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Phanerochaete, Piromyces, Poitrasia, Pseudoplectania, Pseudotrichonympha, Rhizomucor, Schizophyllum, Scytalidium, Talaromyces, Thermoascus, Thielavia, Tolypocladium, Trichoderma, Trichophaea, Verticillium, Volvariella</i>, or <i>Xylaria </i>polypeptide.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In another aspect, the polypeptide is an <i>Aspergillus aculeatus </i>polypeptide, e.g., a polypeptide obtained from <i>Aspergillus aculeatus </i>CBS 172.66.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">It will be understood that for the aforementioned species the invention encompasses both the perfect and imperfect states, and other taxonomic equivalents, e.g., anamorphs, regardless of the species name by which they are known. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize the identity of appropriate equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Strains of these species are readily accessible to the public in a number of culture collections, such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ), Centraalbureau Voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), and Agricultural Research Service Patent Culture Collection, Northern Regional Research Center (NRRL).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The polypeptide may be identified and obtained from other sources including microorganisms isolated from nature (e.g., soil, composts, water, etc.) or DNA samples obtained directly from natural materials (e.g., soil, composts, water, etc.) using the above-mentioned probes. Techniques for isolating microorganisms and DNA directly from natural habitats are well known in the art. A polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide may then be obtained by similarly screening a genomic DNA or cDNA library of another microorganism or mixed DNA sample. Once a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide has been detected with the probe(s), the polynucleotide can be isolated or cloned by utilizing techniques that are known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra).</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Polynucleotides</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The techniques used to isolate or clone a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide are known in the art and include isolation from genomic DNA or cDNA, or a combination thereof. The cloning of the polynucleotides from genomic DNA can be effected, e.g., by using the well known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody screening of expression libraries to detect cloned DNA fragments with shared structural features. See, e.g., Innis et al., 1990, <i>PCR: A Guide to Methods and Application</i>, Academic Press, New York. Other nucleic acid amplification procedures such as ligase chain reaction (LCR), ligation activated transcription (LAT) and polynucleotide-based amplification (NASBA) may be used. The polynucleotides may be cloned from a strain of <i>Aspergillus </i>aculeatus, or a related organism and thus, for example, may be an allelic or species variant of the polypeptide encoding region of the polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In another embodiment, the present invention relates to isolated polynucleotides comprising or consisting of polynucleotides having a degree of sequence identity to the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or the cDNA sequence thereof, of at least 85%, e.g., at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%; or the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, or the cDNA sequence thereof, of at least 75%, e.g., at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%; which encode polypeptides having xylanase activity.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Modification of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be necessary for synthesizing polypeptides substantially similar to the polypeptide. The term &#x201c;substantially similar&#x201d; to the polypeptide refers to non-naturally occurring forms of the polypeptide. These polypeptides may differ in some engineered way from the polypeptide isolated from its native source, e.g., variants that differ in specific activity, thermostability, pH optimum, or the like. The variants may be constructed on the basis of the polynucleotide presented as the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, or the cDNA sequences thereof, e.g., a subsequence thereof, and/or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions that do not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism intended for production of the enzyme, or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions that may give rise to a different amino acid sequence. For a general description of nucleotide substitution, see, e.g., Ford et al., 1991<i>, Protein Expression and Purification </i>2: 95-107.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In another embodiment, the present invention relates to isolated polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the present invention, which hybridize under low stringency conditions, medium stringency conditions, medium-high stringency conditions, high stringency conditions, or very high stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, (ii) the cDNA sequence thereof, or (iii) the full-length complement of (i) or (ii); or allelic variants and subsequences thereof (Sambrook et al., 1989, supra), as defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In one aspect, the polynucleotide comprises or consists of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3; or the mature polypeptide coding sequence thereof; or a subsequence thereof that encodes a fragment having xylanase activity.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Nucleic Acid Constructs</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The present invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention operably linked to one or more control sequences that direct the expression of the coding sequence in a suitable host cell under conditions compatible with the control sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">A polynucleotide may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of the polypeptide. Manipulation of the polynucleotide prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying polynucleotides utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The control sequence may be a promoter, a polynucleotide that is recognized by a host cell for expression of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention. The promoter contains transcriptional control sequences that mediate the expression of the polypeptide. The promoter may be any polynucleotide that shows transcriptional activity in the host cell including mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters, and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.</p>

Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992<i>, Yeast </i>8: 423-488.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The control sequence may also be a transcription terminator, which is recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator is operably linked to the 3&#x2032;-terminus of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide. Any terminator that is functional in the host cell may be used in the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Preferred terminators for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>cytochrome C(CYC1), and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Other useful terminators for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The control sequence may also be an mRNA stabilizer region downstream of a promoter and upstream of the coding sequence of a gene which increases expression of the gene.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Examples of suitable mRNA stabilizer regions are obtained from a <i>Bacillus thuringiensis </i>cryIIIA gene (WO 94/25612) and a <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>SP82 gene (Hue et al., 1995<i>, Journal of Bacteriology </i>177: 3465-3471).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The control sequence may also be a leader, a nontranslated region of an mRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader is operably linked to the 5&#x2032;-terminus of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide. Any leader that is functional in the host cell may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Preferred leaders for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>TAKA amylase and <i>Aspergillus nidulans </i>triose phosphate isomerase.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The control sequence may also be a polyadenylation sequence, a sequence operably linked to the 3&#x2032;-terminus of the polynucleotide and, when transcribed, is recognized by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation sequence that is functional in the host cell may be used.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that encodes a signal peptide linked to the N-terminus of a polypeptide and directs the polypeptide into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5&#x2032;-end of the coding sequence of the polynucleotide may inherently contain a signal peptide coding sequence naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding sequence that encodes the polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5&#x2032;-end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding sequence that is foreign to the coding sequence. A foreign signal peptide coding sequence may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding sequence. Alternatively, a foreign signal peptide coding sequence may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding sequence in order to enhance secretion of the polypeptide. However, any signal peptide coding sequence that directs the expressed polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Effective signal peptide coding sequences for bacterial host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for <i>Bacillus </i>NCIB 11837 maltogenic amylase, <i>Bacillus licheniformis subtilisin, Bacillus licheniformis </i>beta-lactamase, <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus </i>alpha-amylase, <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus </i>neutral proteases (nprT, nprS, nprM), and <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>prsA. Further signal peptides are described by Simonen and Palva, 1993<i>, Microbiological Reviews </i>57: 109-137.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Effective signal peptide coding sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for <i>Aspergillus niger </i>neutral amylase, <i>Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus oryzae </i>TAKA amylase, <i>Humicola insolens cellulase, Humicola insolens </i>endoglucanase V, <i>Humicola lanuginosa </i>lipase, and <i>Rhizomucor miehei </i>aspartic proteinase.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Useful signal peptides for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>alpha-factor and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>invertase. Other useful signal peptide coding sequences are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The control sequence may also be a propeptide coding sequence that encodes a propeptide positioned at the N-terminus of a polypeptide. The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide (or a zymogen in some cases). A propolypeptide is generally inactive and can be converted to an active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding sequence may be obtained from the genes for <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>alkaline protease (aprE), <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>neutral protease (nprT), <i>Myceliophthora thermophila </i>laccase (WO 95/33836), <i>Rhizomucor miehei </i>aspartic proteinase, and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>alpha-factor.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Where both signal peptide and propeptide sequences are present, the propeptide sequence is positioned next to the N-terminus of a polypeptide and the signal peptide sequence is positioned next to the N-terminus of the propeptide sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">It may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences that regulate expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory sequences are those that cause expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory sequences in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the <i>Aspergillus niger </i>glucoamylase promoter, <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, and <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>glucoamylase promoter, <i>Trichoderma reesei </i>cellobiohydrolase I promoter, and <i>Trichoderma reesei </i>cellobiohydrolase II promoter may be used. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those that allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems, these regulatory sequences include the dihydrofolate reductase gene that is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes that are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide would be operably linked to the regulatory sequence.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Expression Vectors</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The present invention also relates to recombinant expression vectors comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention, a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The various nucleotide and control sequences may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector that may include one or more convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide at such sites. Alternatively, the polynucleotide may be expressed by inserting the polynucleotide or a nucleic acid construct comprising the polynucleotide into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) that can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about expression of the polynucleotide. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vector may be a linear or closed circular plasmid.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one that, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids that together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The vector preferably contains one or more selectable markers that permit easy selection of transformed, transfected, transduced, or the like cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Examples of bacterial selectable markers are <i>Bacillus licheniformis </i>or <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>dal genes, or markers that confer antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, spectinomycin, or tetracycline resistance. Suitable markers for yeast host cells include, but are not limited to, ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1, and URA3. Selectable markers for use in a filamentous fungal host cell include, but are not limited to, adeA (phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase), adeB (phospho-ribosyl-aminoimidazole synthase), amdS (acetamidase), argB (ornithine carbamoyltransferase), bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase), hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase), niaD (nitrate reductase), pyrG (orotidine-5&#x2032;-phosphate decarboxylase), sC (sulfate adenyltransferase), and trpC (anthranilate synthase), as well as equivalents thereof. Preferred for use in an <i>Aspergillus </i>cell are <i>Aspergillus nidulans </i>or <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>amdS and pyrG genes and a <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus </i>bar gene. Preferred for use in a <i>Trichoderma </i>cell are adeA, adeB, amdS, hph, and pyrG genes.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The selectable marker may be a dual selectable marker system as described in WO 2010/039889. In one aspect, the dual selectable marker is a hph-tk dual selectable marker system.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The vector preferably contains an element(s) that permits integration of the vector into the host cell's genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">For integration into the host cell genome, the vector may rely on the polynucleotide's sequence encoding the polypeptide or any other element of the vector for integration into the genome by homologous or non-homologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector may contain additional polynucleotides for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids, such as 100 to 10,000 base pairs, 400 to 10,000 base pairs, and 800 to 10,000 base pairs, which have a high degree of sequence identity to the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding polynucleotides. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">For autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question. The origin of replication may be any plasmid replicator mediating autonomous replication that functions in a cell. The term &#x201c;origin of replication&#x201d; or &#x201c;plasmid replicator&#x201d; means a polynucleotide that enables a plasmid or vector to replicate in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Examples of bacterial origins of replication are the origins of replication of plasmids pBR322, pUC19, pACYC177, and pACYC184 permitting replication in <i>E. coli</i>, and pUB110, pE194, pTA1060, and pAM&#x3b2;1 permitting replication in <i>Bacillus. </i></p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Examples of origins of replication for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication, ARS1, ARS4, the combination of ARS1 and CEN3, and the combination of ARS4 and CEN6.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">More than one copy of a polynucleotide of the present invention may be inserted into a host cell to increase production of a polypeptide. An increase in the copy number of the polynucleotide can be obtained by integrating at least one additional copy of the sequence into the host cell genome or by including an amplifiable selectable marker gene with the polynucleotide where cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene, and thereby additional copies of the polynucleotide, can be selected for by cultivating the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent.</p>

The term &#x201c;host cell&#x201d; encompasses any progeny of a parent cell that is not identical to the parent cell due to mutations that occur during replication.

The filamentous fungi are generally characterized by a mycelial wall composed of chitin, cellulose, glucan, chitosan, mannan, and other complex polysaccharides. Vegetative growth is by hyphal elongation and carbon catabolism is obligately aerobic.

<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Methods of Production</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising: (a) cultivating a cell, which in its wild-type form produces the polypeptide, under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide. In one aspect, the cell is of the genus <i>Aspergillus</i>. In another aspect, the cell is <i>Aspergillus aculeatus</i>. In another aspect, the cell is <i>Aspergillus aculeatus </i>CBS 172.66.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising: (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell of the present invention under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The cells are cultivated in a nutrient medium suitable for production of the polypeptide using methods known in the art. For example, the cells may be cultivated by shake flask cultivation, or small-scale or large-scale fermentation (including continuous, batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations) in laboratory or industrial fermentors in a suitable medium and under conditions allowing the polypeptide to be expressed and/or isolated. The cultivation takes place in a suitable nutrient medium comprising carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published compositions (e.g., in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). If the polypeptide is secreted into the nutrient medium, the polypeptide can be recovered directly from the medium. If the polypeptide is not secreted, it can be recovered from cell lysates.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The polypeptide may be detected using methods known in the art that are specific for the polypeptides. These detection methods include, but are not limited to, use of specific antibodies, formation of an enzyme product, or disappearance of an enzyme substrate. For example, an enzyme assay may be used to determine the activity of the polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The polypeptide may be recovered using methods known in the art. For example, the polypeptide may be recovered from the nutrient medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, collection, centrifugation, filtration, extraction, spray-drying, evaporation, or precipitation. In one aspect, the whole fermentation broth is recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The polypeptide may be purified by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobic, chromatofocusing, and size exclusion), electrophoretic procedures (e.g., preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (e.g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), SDS-PAGE, or extraction (see, e.g., <i>Protein Purification</i>, Janson and Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989) to obtain substantially pure polypeptides.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Plants</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The present invention also relates to isolated plants, e.g., a transgenic plant, plant part, or plant cell, comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention so as to express and produce a polypeptide in recoverable quantities. The polypeptide may be recovered from the plant or plant part. Alternatively, the plant or plant part containing the polypeptide may be used as such for improving the quality of a food or feed, e.g., improving nutritional value, palatability, and rheological properties, or to destroy an antinutritive factor.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The transgenic plant can be dicotyledonous (a dicot) or monocotyledonous (a monocot). Examples of monocot plants are grasses, such as meadow grass (blue grass, <i>Poa</i>), forage grass such as <i>Festuca, Lolium</i>, temperate grass, such as <i>Agrostis</i>, and cereals, e.g., wheat, oats, rye, barley, rice, sorghum, and maize (corn).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Examples of dicot plants are tobacco, legumes, such as lupins, potato, sugar beet, pea, bean and soybean, and cruciferous plants (family Brassicaceae), such as cauliflower, rape seed, and the closely related model organism <i>Arabidopsis thaliana. </i></p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Examples of plant parts are stem, callus, leaves, root, fruits, seeds, and tubers as well as the individual tissues comprising these parts, e.g., epidermis, mesophyll, parenchyme, vascular tissues, meristems. Specific plant cell compartments, such as chloroplasts, apoplasts, mitochondria, vacuoles, peroxisomes and cytoplasm are also considered to be a plant part. Furthermore, any plant cell, whatever the tissue origin, is considered to be a plant part. Likewise, plant parts such as specific tissues and cells isolated to facilitate the utilization of the invention are also considered plant parts, e.g., embryos, endosperms, aleurone and seed coats.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Also included within the scope of the present invention are the progeny of such plants, plant parts, and plant cells.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The transgenic plant or plant cell expressing the polypeptide may be constructed in accordance with methods known in the art. In short, the plant or plant cell is constructed by incorporating one or more expression constructs encoding the polypeptide into the plant host genome or chloroplast genome and propagating the resulting modified plant or plant cell into a transgenic plant or plant cell.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The expression construct is conveniently a nucleic acid construct that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide operably linked with appropriate regulatory sequences required for expression of the polynucleotide in the plant or plant part of choice. Furthermore, the expression construct may comprise a selectable marker useful for identifying plant cells into which the expression construct has been integrated and DNA sequences necessary for introduction of the construct into the plant in question (the latter depends on the DNA introduction method to be used).</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The choice of regulatory sequences, such as promoter and terminator sequences and optionally signal or transit sequences, is determined, for example, on the basis of when, where, and how the polypeptide is desired to be expressed. For instance, the expression of the gene encoding a polypeptide may be constitutive or inducible, or may be developmental, stage or tissue specific, and the gene product may be targeted to a specific tissue or plant part such as seeds or leaves. Regulatory sequences are, for example, described by Tague et al., 1988<i>, Plant Physiology </i>86: 506.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">For constitutive expression, the 35S-CaMV, the maize ubiquitin 1, or the rice actin 1 promoter may be used (Franck et al., 1980<i>, Cell </i>21: 285-294; Christensen et al., 1992<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>18: 675-689; Zhang et al., 1991<i>, Plant Cell </i>3: 1155-1165). Organ-specific promoters may be, for example, a promoter from storage sink tissues such as seeds, potato tubers, and fruits (Edwards and Coruzzi, 1990<i>, Ann. Rev. Genet. </i>24: 275-303), or from metabolic sink tissues such as meristems (Ito et al., 1994<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>24: 863-878), a seed specific promoter such as the glutelin, prolamin, globulin, or albumin promoter from rice (Wu et al., 1998<i>, Plant Cell Physiol. </i>39: 885-889), a <i>Vicia faba </i>promoter from the legumin B4 and the unknown seed protein gene from <i>Vicia faba </i>(Conrad et al., 1998<i>, J. Plant Physiol. </i>152: 708-711), a promoter from a seed oil body protein (Chen et al., 1998<i>, Plant Cell Physiol. </i>39: 935-941), the storage protein napA promoter from <i>Brassica napus</i>, or any other seed specific promoter known in the art, e.g., as described in WO 91/14772. Furthermore, the promoter may be a leaf specific promoter such as the rbcs promoter from rice or tomato (Kyozuka et al., 1993<i>, Plant Physiol. </i>102: 991-1000), the <i>chlorella </i>virus adenine methyltransferase gene promoter (Mitra and Higgins, 1994<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>26: 85-93), the aldP gene promoter from rice (Kagaya et al., 1995<i>, Mol. Gen. Genet. </i>248: 668-674), or a wound inducible promoter such as the potato pin2 promoter (Xu et al., 1993, Plant Mol. Biol. 22: 573-588). Likewise, the promoter may be induced by abiotic treatments such as temperature, drought, or alterations in salinity or induced by exogenously applied substances that activate the promoter, e.g., ethanol, oestrogens, plant hormones such as ethylene, abscisic acid, and gibberellic acid, and heavy metals.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">A promoter enhancer element may also be used to achieve higher expression of a polypeptide in the plant. For instance, the promoter enhancer element may be an intron that is placed between the promoter and the polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide or domain. For instance, Xu et al., 1993, supra, disclose the use of the first intron of the rice actin 1 gene to enhance expression.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The selectable marker gene and any other parts of the expression construct may be chosen from those available in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The nucleic acid construct is incorporated into the plant genome according to conventional techniques known in the art, including <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation, virus-mediated transformation, microinjection, particle bombardment, biolistic transformation, and electroporation (Gasser et al., 1990<i>, Science </i>244: 1293; Potrykus, 1990<i>, Bio/Technology </i>8: 535; Shimamoto et al., 1989<i>, Nature </i>338: 274).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176"><i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated gene transfer is a method for generating transgenic dicots (for a review, see Hooykas and Schilperoort, 1992<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>19: 15-38) and for transforming monocots, although other transformation methods may be used for these plants. A method for generating transgenic monocots is particle bombardment (microscopic gold or tungsten particles coated with the transforming DNA) of embryonic calli or developing embryos (Christou, 1992<i>, Plant J. </i>2: 275-281; Shimamoto, 1994<i>, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. </i>5: 158-162; Vasil et al., 1992<i>, Bio/Technology </i>10: 667-674). An alternative method for transformation of monocots is based on protoplast transformation as described by Omirulleh et al., 1993<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>21: 415-428. Additional transformation methods include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,395,966 and 7,151,204 (both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Following transformation, the transformants having incorporated the expression construct are selected and regenerated into whole plants according to methods well known in the art. Often the transformation procedure is designed for the selective elimination of selection genes either during regeneration or in the following generations by using, for example, co-transformation with two separate T-DNA constructs or site specific excision of the selection gene by a specific recombinase.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In addition to direct transformation of a particular plant genotype with a construct of the present invention, transgenic plants may be made by crossing a plant having the construct to a second plant lacking the construct. For example, a construct encoding a polypeptide can be introduced into a particular plant variety by crossing, without the need for ever directly transforming a plant of that given variety. Therefore, the present invention encompasses not only a plant directly regenerated from cells which have been transformed in accordance with the present invention, but also the progeny of such plants. As used herein, progeny may refer to the offspring of any generation of a parent plant prepared in accordance with the present invention. Such progeny may include a DNA construct prepared in accordance with the present invention. Crossing results in the introduction of a transgene into a plant line by cross pollinating a starting line with a donor plant line. Non-limiting examples of such steps are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,151,204. Plants may be generated through a process of backcross conversion. For example, plants include plants referred to as a backcross converted genotype, line, inbred, or hybrid.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Genetic markers may be used to assist in the introgression of one or more transgenes of the invention from one genetic background into another. Marker assisted selection offers advantages relative to conventional breeding in that it can be used to avoid errors caused by phenotypic variations. Further, genetic markers may provide data regarding the relative degree of elite germplasm in the individual progeny of a particular cross. For example, when a plant with a desired trait which otherwise has a non-agronomically desirable genetic background is crossed to an elite parent, genetic markers may be used to select progeny which not only possess the trait of interest, but also have a relatively large proportion of the desired germplasm. In this way, the number of generations required to introgress one or more traits into a particular genetic background is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention comprising: (a) cultivating a transgenic plant or a plant cell comprising a polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Removal or Reduction of Xylanase Activity</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The present invention also relates to methods of producing a mutant of a parent cell, which comprises disrupting or deleting a polynucleotide, or a portion thereof, encoding a polypeptide of the present invention, which results in the mutant cell producing less of the polypeptide than the parent cell when cultivated under the same conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The mutant cell may be constructed by reducing or eliminating expression of the polynucleotide using methods well known in the art, for example, insertions, disruptions, replacements, or deletions. In a preferred aspect, the polynucleotide is inactivated. The polynucleotide to be modified or inactivated may be, for example, the coding region or a part thereof essential for activity, or a regulatory element required for expression of the coding region. An example of such a regulatory or control sequence may be a promoter sequence or a functional part thereof, i.e., a part that is sufficient for affecting expression of the polynucleotide. Other control sequences for possible modification include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenylation sequence, propeptide sequence, signal peptide sequence, transcription terminator, and transcriptional activator.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Modification or inactivation of the polynucleotide may be performed by subjecting the parent cell to mutagenesis and selecting for mutant cells in which expression of the polynucleotide has been reduced or eliminated. The mutagenesis, which may be specific or random, may be performed, for example, by use of a suitable physical or chemical mutagenizing agent, by use of a suitable oligonucleotide, or by subjecting the DNA sequence to PCR generated mutagenesis. Furthermore, the mutagenesis may be performed by use of any combination of these mutagenizing agents.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Examples of a physical or chemical mutagenizing agent suitable for the present purpose include ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, hydroxylamine, N-methyl-N&#x2032;-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), O-methyl hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS), sodium bisulphite, formic acid, and nucleotide analogues.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">When such agents are used, the mutagenesis is typically performed by incubating the parent cell to be mutagenized in the presence of the mutagenizing agent of choice under suitable conditions, and screening and/or selecting for mutant cells exhibiting reduced or no expression of the gene.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Modification or inactivation of the polynucleotide may also be accomplished by insertion, substitution, or deletion of one or more nucleotides in the gene or a regulatory element required for transcription or translation thereof. For example, nucleotides may be inserted or removed so as to result in the introduction of a stop codon, the removal of the start codon, or a change in the open reading frame. Such modification or inactivation may be accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis or PCR generated mutagenesis in accordance with methods known in the art. Although, in principle, the modification may be performed in vivo, i.e., directly on the cell expressing the polynucleotide to be modified, it is preferred that the modification be performed in vitro as exemplified below.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">An example of a convenient way to eliminate or reduce expression of a polynucleotide is based on techniques of gene replacement, gene deletion, or gene disruption. For example, in the gene disruption method, a nucleic acid sequence corresponding to the endogenous polynucleotide is mutagenized in vitro to produce a defective nucleic acid sequence that is then transformed into the parent cell to produce a defective gene. By homologous recombination, the defective nucleic acid sequence replaces the endogenous polynucleotide. It may be desirable that the defective polynucleotide also encodes a marker that may be used for selection of transformants in which the polynucleotide has been modified or destroyed. In an aspect, the polynucleotide is disrupted with a selectable marker such as those described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The present invention also relates to methods of inhibiting the expression of a polypeptide having xylanase activity in a cell, comprising administering to the cell or expressing in the cell a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule, wherein the dsRNA comprises a subsequence of a polynucleotide of the present invention. In a preferred aspect, the dsRNA is about 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or more duplex nucleotides in length.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The dsRNA is preferably a small interfering RNA (sRNA) or a micro RNA (miRNA). In a preferred aspect, the dsRNA is small interfering RNA for inhibiting transcription. In another preferred aspect, the dsRNA is micro RNA for inhibiting translation.</p>

While the present invention is not limited by any particular mechanism of action, the dsRNA can enter a cell and cause the degradation of a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) of similar or identical sequences, including endogenous mRNAs. When a cell is exposed to dsRNA, mRNA from the homologous gene is selectively degraded by a process called RNA interference (RNAi).</p>

<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The present invention is also directed to the following processes for using the polypeptides having xylanase activity, or compositions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The present invention also relates to processes for degrading a cellulosic material or xylan-containing material, comprising: treating the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material with an enzyme composition in the presence of a polypeptide having xylanase activity of the present invention. In one aspect, the processes further comprise recovering the degraded or converted cellulosic material or xylan-containing material. Soluble products of degradation or conversion of the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material can be separated from insoluble cellulosic material or xylan-containing material using a method known in the art such as, for example, centrifugation, filtration, or gravity settling.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The present invention also relates to processes of producing a fermentation product, comprising: (a) saccharifying a cellulosic material or xylan-containing material with an enzyme composition in the presence of a polypeptide having xylanase activity of the present invention; (b) fermenting the saccharified cellulosic material or xylan-containing material with one or more (e.g., several) fermenting microorganisms to produce the fermentation product; and (c) recovering the fermentation product from the fermentation.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The present invention also relates to processes of fermenting a cellulosic material or xylan-containing material, comprising: fermenting the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material with one or more (e.g., several) fermenting microorganisms, wherein the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material is saccharified with an enzyme composition in the presence of a polypeptide having xylanase activity of the present invention. In one aspect, the fermenting of the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material produces a fermentation product. In another aspect, the processes further comprise recovering the fermentation product from the fermentation.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">The processes of the present invention can be used to saccharify the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material to fermentable sugars and to convert the fermentable sugars to many useful fermentation products, e.g., fuel, potable ethanol, and/or platform chemicals (e.g., acids, alcohols, ketones, gases, and the like). The production of a desired fermentation product from the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material typically involves pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis (saccharification), and fermentation.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The processing of the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material according to the present invention can be accomplished using methods conventional in the art. Moreover, the processes of the present invention can be implemented using any conventional biomass processing apparatus configured to operate in accordance with the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Hydrolysis (saccharification) and fermentation, separate or simultaneous, include, but are not limited to, separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF); simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF); simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF); hybrid hydrolysis and fermentation (HHF); separate hydrolysis and co-fermentation (SHCF); hybrid hydrolysis and co-fermentation (HHCF); and direct microbial conversion (DMC), also sometimes called consolidated bioprocessing (CBP). SHF uses separate process steps to first enzymatically hydrolyze the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material to fermentable sugars, e.g., glucose, cellobiose, and pentose monomers, and then ferment the fermentable sugars to ethanol. In SSF, the enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material and the fermentation of sugars to ethanol are combined in one step (Philippidis, G. P., 1996, Cellulose bioconversion technology, in <i>Handbook on Bioethanol: Production and Utilization</i>, Wyman, C. E., ed., Taylor &#x26; Francis, Washington, D.C., 179-212). SSCF involves the co-fermentation of multiple sugars (Sheehan, J., and Himmel, M., 1999, Enzymes, energy and the environment: A strategic perspective on the U.S. Department of Energy's research and development activities for bioethanol, <i>Biotechnol. Prog. </i>15: 817-827). HHF involves a separate hydrolysis step, and in addition a simultaneous saccharification and hydrolysis step, which can be carried out in the same reactor. The steps in an HHF process can be carried out at different temperatures, i.e., high temperature enzymatic saccharification followed by SSF at a lower temperature that the fermentation strain can tolerate. DMC combines all three processes (enzyme production, hydrolysis, and fermentation) in one or more (e.g., several) steps where the same organism is used to produce the enzymes for conversion of the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material to fermentable sugars and to convert the fermentable sugars into a final product (Lynd, L. R., Weimer, P. J., van Zyl, W. H., and Pretorius, I. S., 2002, Microbial cellulose utilization: Fundamentals and biotechnology, <i>Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Reviews </i>66: 506-577). It is understood herein that any method known in the art comprising pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis (saccharification), fermentation, or a combination thereof, can be used in the practicing the processes of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">A conventional apparatus can include a fed-batch stirred reactor, a batch stirred reactor, a continuous flow stirred reactor with ultrafiltration, and/or a continuous plug-flow column reactor (Fernanda de Castilhos Corazza, Fl&#xe1;vio Faria de Moraes, Gisella Maria Zanin and Ivo Neitzel, 2003, Optimal control in fed-batch reactor for the cellobiose hydrolysis, <i>Acta Scientiarum. Technology </i>25: 33-38; Gusakov, A. V., and Sinitsyn, A. P., 1985, Kinetics of the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose: 1. A mathematical model for a batch reactor process, <i>Enz. Microb.

Bioeng. </i>25: 53-65), or a reactor with intensive stirring induced by an electromagnetic field (Gusakov, A. V., Sinitsyn, A. P., Davydkin, I. Y., Davydkin, V. Y., Protas, O. V., 1996, Enhancement of enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis using a novel type of bioreactor with intensive stirring induced by electromagnetic field, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 56: 141-153).

<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Pretreatment. In practicing the processes of the present invention, any pretreatment process known in the art can be used to disrupt plant cell wall components of the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material (Chandra et al., 2007, Substrate pretreatment: The key to effective enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosics?, <i>Adv. Biochem. Engin./Biotechnol. </i>108: 67-93; Galbe and Zacchi, 2007, Pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials for efficient bioethanol production, <i>Adv. Biochem.

<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The cellulosic material or xylan-containing material can also be subjected to particle size reduction, sieving, pre-soaking, wetting, washing, and/or conditioning prior to pretreatment using methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Conventional pretreatments include, but are not limited to, steam pretreatment (with or without explosion), dilute acid pretreatment, hot water pretreatment, alkaline pretreatment, lime pretreatment, wet oxidation, wet explosion, ammonia fiber explosion, organosolv pretreatment, and biological pretreatment. Additional pretreatments include ammonia percolation, ultrasound, electroporation, microwave, supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>, supercritical H<sub>2</sub>O, ozone, ionic liquid, and gamma irradiation pretreatments.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The cellulosic material or xylan-containing material can be pretreated before hydrolysis and/or fermentation. Pretreatment is preferably performed prior to the hydrolysis. Alternatively, the pretreatment can be carried out simultaneously with enzyme hydrolysis to release fermentable sugars, such as glucose, xylose, and/or cellobiose. In most cases the pretreatment step itself results in some conversion of biomass to fermentable sugars (even in absence of enzymes).</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Steam Pretreatment. In steam pretreatment, the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material is heated to disrupt the plant cell wall components, including lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose to make the cellulose and other fractions, e.g., hemicellulose, accessible to enzymes. The cellulosic material or xylan-containing material is passed to or through a reaction vessel where steam is injected to increase the temperature to the required temperature and pressure and is retained therein for the desired reaction time. Steam pretreatment is preferably performed at 140-250&#xb0; C., e.g., 160-200&#xb0; C. or 170-190&#xb0; C., where the optimal temperature range depends on addition of a chemical catalyst. Residence time for the steam pretreatment is preferably 1-60 minutes, e.g., 1-30 minutes, 1-20 minutes, 3-12 minutes, or 4-10 minutes, where the optimal residence time depends on temperature range and addition of a chemical catalyst. Steam pretreatment allows for relatively high solids loadings, so that the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material is generally only moist during the pretreatment. The steam pretreatment is often combined with an explosive discharge of the material after the pretreatment, which is known as steam explosion, that is, rapid flashing to atmospheric pressure and turbulent flow of the material to increase the accessible surface area by fragmentation (Duff and Murray, 1996<i>, Bioresource Technology </i>855: 1-33; Galbe and Zacchi, 2002<i>, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. </i>59: 618-628; U.S. Patent Application No. 20020164730). During steam pretreatment, hemicellulose acetyl groups are cleaved and the resulting acid autocatalyzes partial hydrolysis of the hemicellulose to monosaccharides and oligosaccharides. Lignin is removed to only a limited extent.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Chemical Pretreatment: The term &#x201c;chemical treatment&#x201d; refers to any chemical pretreatment that promotes the separation and/or release of cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or lignin. Such a pretreatment can convert crystalline cellulose to amorphous cellulose. Examples of suitable chemical pretreatment processes include, for example, dilute acid pretreatment, lime pretreatment, wet oxidation, ammonia fiber/freeze explosion (AFEX), ammonia percolation (APR), ionic liquid, and organosolv pretreatments.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">A catalyst such as H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>or SO<sub>2 </sub>(typically 0.3 to 5% w/w) is often added prior to steam pretreatment, which decreases the time and temperature, increases the recovery, and improves enzymatic hydrolysis (Ballesteros et al., 2006<i>, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. </i>129-132: 496-508; Varga et al., 2004<i>, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. </i>113-116: 509-523; Sassner et al., 2006<i>, Enzyme Microb. Technol. </i>39: 756-762). In dilute acid pretreatment, the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material is mixed with dilute acid, typically H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and water to form a slurry, heated by steam to the desired temperature, and after a residence time flashed to atmospheric pressure. The dilute acid pretreatment can be performed with a number of reactor designs, e.g., plug-flow reactors, counter-current reactors, or continuous counter-current shrinking bed reactors (Duff and Murray, 1996, supra; Schell et al., 2004<i>, Bioresource Technol. </i>91: 179-188; Lee et al., 1999<i>, Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. </i>65: 93-115).</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Several methods of pretreatment under alkaline conditions can also be used. These alkaline pretreatments include, but are not limited to, sodium hydroxide, lime, wet oxidation, ammonia percolation (APR), and ammonia fiber/freeze explosion (AFEX).</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Lime pretreatment is performed with calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide at temperatures of 85-150&#xb0; C. and residence times from 1 hour to several days (Wyman et al., 2005<i>, Bioresource Technol. </i>96: 1959-1966; Mosier et al., 2005<i>, Bioresource Technol. </i>96: 673-686). WO 2006/110891, WO 2006/110899, WO 2006/110900, and WO 2006/110901 disclose pretreatment methods using ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Wet oxidation is a thermal pretreatment performed typically at 180-200&#xb0; C. for 5-15 minutes with addition of an oxidative agent such as hydrogen peroxide or over-pressure of oxygen (Schmidt and Thomsen, 1998<i>, Bioresource Technol. </i>64: 139-151; Palonen et al., 2004, <i>Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. </i>117: 1-17; Varga et al., 2004<i>, Biotechnol. Bioeng. </i>88: 567-574; Martin et al., 2006<i>, J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol. </i>81: 1669-1677). The pretreatment is performed preferably at 1-40% dry matter, e.g., 2-30% dry matter or 5-20% dry matter, and often the initial pH is increased by the addition of alkali such as sodium carbonate.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">A modification of the wet oxidation pretreatment method, known as wet explosion (combination of wet oxidation and steam explosion) can handle dry matter up to 30%. In wet explosion, the oxidizing agent is introduced during pretreatment after a certain residence time. The pretreatment is then ended by flashing to atmospheric pressure (WO 2006/032282).</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX) involves treating the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material with liquid or gaseous ammonia at moderate temperatures such as 90-150&#xb0; C. and high pressure such as 17-20 bar for 5-10 minutes, where the dry matter content can be as high as 60% (Gollapalli et al., 2002<i>, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. </i>98: 23-35; Chundawat et al., 2007<i>, Biotechnol. Bioeng. </i>96: 219-231; Alizadeh et al., 2005<i>, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. </i>121: 1133-1141; Teymouri et al., 2005<i>, Bioresource Technol. </i>96: 2014-2018). During AFEX pretreatment cellulose and hemicelluloses remain relatively intact. Lignin-carbohydrate complexes are cleaved.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Organosolv pretreatment delignifies the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material by extraction using aqueous ethanol (40-60% ethanol) at 160-200&#xb0; C. for 30-60 minutes (Pan et al., 2005<i>, Biotechnol. Bioeng. </i>90: 473-481; Pan et al., 2006<i>, Biotechnol. Bioeng. </i>94: 851-861; Kurabi et al., 2005<i>, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. </i>121: 219-230). Sulphuric acid is usually added as a catalyst. In organosolv pretreatment, the majority of hemicellulose and lignin is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Other examples of suitable pretreatment methods are described by Schell et al., 2003<i>, Appl. Biochem. and Biotechnol. Vol. </i>105-108, p. 69-85, and Mosier et al., 2005<i>, Bioresource Technology </i>96: 673-686, and U.S. Published Application 2002/0164730.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">In one aspect, the chemical pretreatment is preferably carried out as a dilute acid treatment, and more preferably as a continuous dilute acid treatment. The acid is typically sulfuric acid, but other acids can also be used, such as acetic acid, citric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, hydrogen chloride, or mixtures thereof. Mild acid treatment is conducted in the pH range of preferably 1-5, e.g., 1-4 or 1-2.5. In one aspect, the acid concentration is in the range from preferably 0.01 to 10 wt % acid, e.g., 0.05 to 5 wt % acid or 0.1 to 2 wt % acid. The acid is contacted with the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material and held at a temperature in the range of preferably 140-200&#xb0; C., e.g., 165-190&#xb0; C., for periods ranging from 1 to 60 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">In another aspect, pretreatment takes place in an aqueous slurry. In preferred aspects, the cellulosic material or xylan-containing material is present during pretreatment in amounts preferably between 10-80 wt %, e.g., 20-70 wt % or 30-60 wt %, such as around 40 wt %. The pretreated cellulosic material or xylan-containing material can be unwashed or washed using any method known in the art, e.g., washed with water.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Mechanical Pretreatment or Physical Pretreatment: The term &#x201c;mechanical pretreatment&#x201d; or &#x201c;physical pretreatment&#x201d; refers to any pretreatment that promotes size reduction of particles. For example, such pretreatment can involve various types of grinding or milling (e.g., dry milling, wet milling, or vibratory ball milling).</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">The cellulosic material or xylan-containing material can be pretreated both physically (mechanically) and chemically. Mechanical or physical pretreatment can be coupled with steaming/steam explosion, hydrothermolysis, dilute or mild acid treatment, high temperature, high pressure treatment, irradiation (e.g., microwave irradiation), or combinations thereof. In one aspect, high pressure means pressure in the range of preferably about 100 to about 400 psi, e.g., about 150 to about 250 psi. In another aspect, high temperature means temperatures in the range of about 100 to about 300&#xb0; C., e.g., about 140 to about 200&#xb0; C.

A 500 &#x3bc;l volume of SEWS-M solution from the FASTDNA&#xae; SPIN Kit was added to the SPIN filter tube and the sample was centrifuged at the same speed for 1 minute. The catch tube was emptied and the SPIN filter replaced in the catch tube. The unit was centrifuged at 14,000&#xd7;g for 2 minutes to dry the matrix of residual SEWS-M wash solution. The SPIN filter was placed in a fresh catch tube and allowed to air dry for 5 minutes at room temperature. The matrix was gently resuspended in 100 &#x3bc;l of DES (DNase/Pyrogen free water) with a pipette tip. The unit was centrifuged at 14,000&#xd7;g for 1 minute to elute the genomic DNA followed by elution with 100 &#x3bc;l of 0.1 mM EDTA-10 mM Tris pH 8.0 by centrifugation at 14,000&#xd7;g for 1 minute and the eluates were combined. The concentration of the DNA harvested from the catch tube was measured at 260 nm with a UV spectrophotometer.</p>

<p id="p-0361" num="0360">A PHUSION&#xae; High-Fidelity PCR Kit (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland) was used for the PCR. The PCR reaction was composed of 5 &#x3bc;l of 5&#xd7;HF buffer (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland), 0.5 &#x3bc;l of dNTPs (10 mM), 0.5 &#x3bc;l of PHUSION&#xae; DNA polymerase (0.2 units/&#x3bc;l) (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland), 1 &#x3bc;l of primer F-P23Q45 (5 &#x3bc;M), 1 &#x3bc;l of primer R&#x2014;P23Q45 (5 &#x3bc;M), 0.5 &#x3bc;l of <i>A. aculeatus </i>genomic DNA (100 ng/&#x3bc;l), and 16.5 &#x3bc;l of deionized water in a total volume of 25 &#x3bc;l. The amplification reaction was performed in a PTC-200 DNA engine (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, Mass., USA) programmed for 1 cycle at 95&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes; 35 cycles each at 98&#xb0; C. for 10 seconds, 60&#xb0; C. for 30 seconds, and 72&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes; and 1 cycle at 72&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes. The sample was then held at 12&#xb0; C. until removed from the PCR machine.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using 40 mM Tris base, 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM disodium EDTA (TAE) buffer where a 1534 bp band was excised from the gel and purified using an illustra GFX&#xae; PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Brondby, Denmark) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fragment was then cloned into Bam HI and Xho I digested pDau109 using an IN-FUSION&#xae; Cloning Kit resulting in plasmid pP23Q45. Cloning of the P23Q45 gene into Bam HI-Xho I digested pDau109 resulted in transcription of the <i>Aspergillus aculeatus </i>pP23Q45 gene under the control of a NA2-tpi double promoter. The NA2-tpi promoter is a modified promoter from the gene encoding the <i>Aspergillus niger </i>neutral alpha-amylase in which the untranslated leader has been replaced by an untranslated leader from the gene encoding the <i>Aspergillus nidulans </i>triose phosphate isomerase.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">The cloning protocol was performed according to the IN-FUSION&#xae; Cloning Kit instructions generating a pP23Q45 GH11 construct.

After incubating at 37&#xb0; C. overnight, colonies were observed growing under selection on the LB ampicillin plates. Four colonies transformed with the pP23Q45 GH11 construct were cultivated in LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mg of ampicillin per ml and plasmid was isolated with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, Calif., USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.</p>
