<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a compound suitable for an organic electroluminescent (EL) device which is a self-luminescent device suitable for various displaying devices and a device. More specifically, it relates to a compound having a pyridoindole ring structure bonded with a substituted pyridyl group and to an organic EL device using the compound.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Since organic EL devices are self-luminescent devices, they are bright and excellent in visibility as compared with liquid-crystalline devices and capable of giving clear display, so that the organic EL devices have been actively studied.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In 1987, C. W. Tang et al. of Eastman Kodak Company put an organic EL device using organic materials into practical use by developing a device having a multilayered structure wherein various roles are assigned to respective materials. They formed a lamination of a fluorescent material capable of transporting electrons and an organic material capable of transporting holes, so that both charges are injected into the layer of the fluorescent material to emit light, thereby achieving a high luminance of 1000 cd/m<sup>2 </sup>or more at a voltage of 10 V or lower (see e.g., Patent Documents 1 and 2).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1: JP-A-8-48656</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent No. 3194657</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To date, many improvements have been performed for practical utilization of the organic EL devices, and high efficiency and durability have been achieved by an electroluminescent device wherein an anode, a hole-injecting layer, a hole-transporting layer, an emitting layer, an electron-transporting layer, an electron-injecting layer, and a cathode are sequentially provided on a substrate, to further segmentalize various roles (see e.g., Non-Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Non-Patent Document 1: Japan Society of Applied Physics Ninth Workshop Preprint, pp. 55-61 (2001)</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, for the purpose of further improvement of luminous efficiency, utilization of triplet exciton has been attempted and utilization of a phosphorescent material has been investigated (see e.g., Non-Patent Document 2).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Non-Patent Document 2: Japan Society of Applied Physics Ninth Workshop Preprint, pp. 23-31 (2001)</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The emitting layer can be also prepared by doping a charge-transporting compound, generally called a host material, with a fluorescent material or a phosphorescent material. As described in the above-mentioned Workshop Preprints, the choice of the organic materials in organic EL devices remarkably affects various properties such as efficiency and durability of the devices.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the organic EL devices, the charges injected from the both electrode are recombined in the emitting layer to attain light emission. However, since the mobility of holes is higher than the mobility of electrons, a problem of reduction in efficiency caused by a part of the holes passing through the emitting layer arises. Therefore, it is required to develop an electron-transporting material in which the mobility of electrons is high.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A representative light-emitting material, tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (hereinafter referred to as Alq<sub>3</sub>) is commonly used also as an electron-transporting material. However, since it has a work function of 5.8 eV, it cannot be considered that the material has hole-blocking capability.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As a technique to prevent the passing of a part of holes through the emitting layer and to improve probability of charge recombination in the emitting layer, there is a method of inserting a hole-blocking layer. As hole-blocking materials, there have been hitherto proposed triazole derivatives (see e.g., Patent Document 3), bathocuproine (hereinafter referred to as BCP), a mixed ligand complex of aluminum (BAlq) (see e.g., Non-Patent Document 2), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">On the other hand, as an electron-transporting material excellent in hole-blocking ability, there is proposed 3-(4-biphenylyl)-4-phenyl-5-(4-t-butylphenyl)-1,2,4-triazole (hereinafter referred to as TAZ) (see e.g., Patent Document 3).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent No. 2734341</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Since TAZ has a work function as large as 6.6 eV and thus exhibits a high hole-blocking ability, it is used as an electron-transporting hole-blocking layer to be laminated onto the cathode side of a fluorescence-emitting layer or phosphorescence-emitting layer prepared by vacuum deposition, coating or the like, and contributes to increase the efficiency of organic EL devices (see e.g., Non-Patent Document 3).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Non-Patent Document 3: Fiftieth Meeting of Japan Society of Applied Physics and Related Societies, 28p-A-6 Lecture Preprint, p. 1413 (2003)</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, TAZ has a great problem of having low electron transport property, and it is necessary to prepare an organic electroluminescent device in combination with an electron-transporting material having a higher electron transport property (see e.g., Non-Patent Document 4).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Non-Patent Document 4: Japan Society of Applied Physics, Journal of Organic Molecules/Bioelectronics Section, Vol. 11, No. 1, pp. 13-19 (2000)</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, BCP has a work function as large as 6.7 eV and a high hole-blocking ability, but has a low glass transition point (Tg) which is 83&#xb0; C., so that it is poor in thin-film stability and thus it cannot be considered that it sufficiently functions as a hole-blocking layer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">All the materials are insufficient in thin-film stability or are insufficient in the function of blocking holes. In order to improve characteristic properties of the organic electroluminescent devices, it is desired to develop an organic compound which is excellent in electron-injection/transport performances and hole-blocking ability and is highly stable in a thin-film state.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Objects of the present invention are to provide an organic compound having excellent properties, which is excellent in electron-injection/transport performances, has hole-blocking ability and is highly stable in a thin-film state, as a material for an organic electroluminescent device having a high efficiency and a high durability, and to provide an organic electroluminescent device having a high efficiency and a high durability using the compound.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0058">The compounds having a pyridoindole ring structure connected with a substituted pyridyl group of the invention are novel compounds, and these compounds can be synthesized, for example, by the following method. A compound having a pyridoindole ring structure bonded with a substituted pyridyl group can be synthesized by first subjecting a corresponding halogenoanilinopyridine to a cyclization reaction by a palladium catalyst to synthesize a pyridoindole ring (see, e.g., Non-Patent Document 5) and then condensing it with various halogenopyridines having a pyridyl group. The various halogenopyridines having a pyridyl group can be synthesized by condensing corresponding an aldehyde with an acetylpyridine in the presence of a base and further subjecting the condensates to a reaction with a corresponding pyridinium iodide (see, e.g., Non-Patent Document 6).</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0063">Purification of these compounds was performed by purification by column chromatography, adsorption purification with active carbon, activated clay, or the like, a recrystallization or crystallization method with a solvent, or the like. Identification of the compounds was performed by NMR analysis. As physical properties, DSC measurement (Tg) and melting point measurement were carried out. The melting point serves as an indicator of vapor deposition properties, and the glass transition point (Tg) serves as an indicator of stability in a thin-film state.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0064">The melting point and the glass transition point were measured using a powder material by means of a highly sensitive differential scanning calorimeter DSC 3100S manufactured by Bruker AXS.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0065">Further, the work function was measured by preparing a thin film of 100 nm on an ITO substrate and using a photo-electron spectroscopy in air (Model AC-3, manufactured by Riken Keiki Co., Ltd.). The work function is regarded as an indicator of hole-blocking ability.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0066">Examples of the structure of the organic EL device of the invention include a structure having an anode, a hole-injecting layer, a hole-transporting layer, an emitting layer, a hole-blocking layer, an electron-transporting layer and a cathode in this order on a substrate, and a structure further having an electron-injecting layer between the electron-transporting layer and the cathode. In these multilayer structures, it is possible to omit several layers of the organic layers and, for example, the structure may have a constitution sequentially having an anode, a hole-transporting layer, an emitting layer, an electron-transporting layer and a cathode on a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0067">As the anode of the organic EL device, an electrode material having a large work function, such as ITO or gold, is used. As the hole-injecting layer, besides copper phthalocyanine (hereinafter referred to as CuPc), materials such as star-burst type triphenylamine derivatives and wet-process type materials may be employed.</p>

Further, as the hole-injecting/transporting layers, wet-process type polymer materials such as PEDOT/PSS may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0069">As the emitting layer, hole-blocking layer, and electron-transporting layer of the organic EL device of the invention, besides the compound having a pyridoindole ring structure bonded with a substituted pyridyl group, aluminum complexes, thiazole derivatives, oxazole derivatives, carbazole derivatives, polydialkylfluorene derivatives, and the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0070">By using a conventional luminescence material such as an aluminum complex or styryl derivative for the emitting layer and using the compound having a pyridoindole ring structure bonded with a substituted pyridyl group as the hole-blocking layer and the electron-transporting layer, a high-performance organic EL device can be prepared. Further, a high-performance organic EL device can be prepared also by adding a dopant, for example, a fluorescent material such as quinacridone, coumarin or rubrene or a phosphorescent material such as an iridium complex of phenylpyridine, as a host material of the emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0071">Furthermore, the compound having a pyridoindole ring structure bonded with a substituted pyridyl group can be used as the electron-transporting layer through multilayering or co-deposition with conventional electron-transporting material(s).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0072">The organic EL device of the invention may have an electron-injecting layer. As the electron-injecting layer, lithium fluoride or the like may be used. For the cathode, an electrode material having a low work function such as aluminum, or an alloy having a low work function such as aluminum magnesium is used as an electrode material.</p>
