<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosure relates to an internal combustion engine having at least one liquid-cooled turbine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Internal combustion engines have a cylinder block and a cylinder head, which are connected to one another at the assembly faces thereof to form the at least one cylinder, i.e. combustion chamber. The cylinder block includes cylinder bores to hold the pistons. The cylinder head generally serves to accommodate the valve gear. The valve gear includes the intake and exhaust valves as well as the valve actuating mechanism required to move the valves.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, the inlet ducts, which lead to the inlet ports, and the outlet ducts, i.e. the exhaust lines, which are connected to the outlet ports, are at least partially integrated into the cylinder head. The exhaust lines of the outlet ports of each individual cylinder are generally brought together&#x2014;within the cylinder head&#x2014;to form a component exhaust line. The exhaust lines are combined into an overall exhaust line referred to generally and in the context of the present disclosure as an exhaust manifold. Downstream of the at least one manifold, the exhaust gases are then fed to a radial turbine, e.g. the turbine of an exhaust turbocharger and, if appropriate, are passed through one or more exhaust gas after treatment systems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The production costs for the turbine are comparatively high since the material&#x2014;which frequently contains nickel&#x2014;used for the thermally highly stressed turbine casing is expensive, especially in comparison with the material that is preferably used for the cylinder head; e.g. aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It would be advantageous in terms of costs if it were possible to provide a turbine which could be manufactured from a less expensive material, e.g. aluminum. To enable less expensive materials to be used to produce the turbine, turbines may be provided with a cooling system, e.g. a liquid cooling system, which greatly reduces the thermal stress imposed by the hot exhaust gases on the turbine and on the turbine casing and hence allows the use of materials less capable of bearing thermal stresses.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, the turbine casing is provided with a coolant jacket in order to form the cooling system. This includes both concepts in which the casing is a casting and the coolant jacket is formed as an integral part of a monolithic casing as part of the casting process, and concepts in which the casing is of modular construction, where a cavity which serves as a coolant jacket is formed during assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A turbine configured in accordance with the last-mentioned concept is described by German Laid-Open Application DE 10 2008 011 257 A1, for example. A liquid cooling system for the turbine is formed by providing the actual turbine casing with a shell, thus forming a cavity, into which coolant can be passed, between the casing and the at least one shell element arranged at a distance. The casing with the shell added then includes the coolant jacket. EP 1 384 857 A2 likewise discloses a turbine, the casing of which is provided with a coolant jacket. DE 10 2007 017 973 A1 describes a kit for the formation of a vapor-cooled turbine jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In principle, there is the possibility of providing the liquid cooling system of the turbine with a separate heat exchanger or the heat exchanger of another liquid cooling system. However, one factor that has to be taken into account in this context is that the amount of heat to be absorbed by the coolant in the turbine can be 40 kW or more if materials with little resistance to thermal stress, such as aluminum, are used for the production of the casing. Removing such a large amount of heat from the coolant in the heat exchanger and dissipating it to the environment by means of an air flow proves to be problematic, as surface area available for heat transfer may be limited.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition to the heat exchanger of the engine cooling system, modern motor vehicles often have additional heat exchangers, in particular cooling devices. For example, charge air coolers, oil coolers, EGR coolers, transmission fluid coolers, air conditioning condenser, etc., may all be arranged in or near the front end zone. Thus, owing to the very restricted space conditions in the front end zone and the large number of heat exchangers, it may not be possible to dimension the individual heat exchangers as required. Also, there may be no possibility of arranging a sufficiently large heat exchanger for liquid cooling of the turbine in the front end zone to allow dissipation of the large amounts of heat. There has therefore to be a compromise between cooling capacity and material in the design configuration of a cooled turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The inventors herein have recognized the above issues and have developed a system to at least partly address them. Accordingly, an internal combustion engine is provided. The engine comprises a turbocharger including a turbine having a coolant jacket integrated in a housing of the turbine, and an oil circuit, the oil circuit coupled to the coolant jacket of the turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure may provide several advantages. For example, it makes it possible to dispense with materials with the capacity to bear high thermal stresses, especially those containing nickel, for the production of the turbine casing, since the present description also makes provision for the turbine to be provided with a cooling system. The cooling system ensures a reduction in temperature and hence reduces the thermal stress on the material, rendering materials resistant to high temperatures unnecessary. On the other hand, utilizing oil as a coolant results in a cooling capacity that is not so large that materials with only little resistance to thermal stress, such as aluminum, can be employed. This approach makes the use of expensive materials unnecessary without dissipating excessively large amounts of heat in the context of turbine cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The above advantages and other advantages, and features of the present description will be readily apparent from the following Detailed Description when taken alone or in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It should be understood that the summary above is provided to introduce in simplified form a selection of concepts that are further described in the detailed description. It is not meant to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, the scope of which is defined uniquely by the claims that follow the detailed description. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any disadvantages noted above or in any part of this disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The use of a turbine constructed with material having high thermal stress capacity is often expensive and inefficient. To use material having a lower thermal stress capacity, the turbine may be cooled by an oil circuit of the engine. An example cylinder of an engine including an oil circuit and turbine is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A multi-cylinder engine including the cylinder depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an example turbine is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and a method for the oil circuit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a diagram illustrating the heat transfer coefficients of two coolants that may be used in coolant circuits according to the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing one cylinder <b>16</b> of a multi-cylinder engine <b>10</b>, which may be included in a propulsion system of an automobile. The engine <b>10</b> includes a cylinder head <b>12</b> and a cylinder block <b>14</b> which are connected to one another at their assembly end sides so as to form a combustion chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Combustion chamber (i.e. cylinder) <b>16</b> of engine <b>10</b> may include combustion chamber walls <b>18</b> with piston <b>20</b> positioned therein. Piston <b>20</b> may be coupled to crankshaft <b>22</b> so that reciprocating motion of the piston is translated into rotational motion of the crankshaft. Crankshaft <b>22</b> may be coupled to at least one drive wheel of a vehicle via an intermediate transmission system. Further, a starter motor may be coupled to crankshaft <b>22</b> via a flywheel to enable a starting operation of engine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Combustion chamber <b>16</b> may receive intake air from an intake manifold (not shown) via intake line, or intake passage, <b>24</b> and may exhaust combustion gases via exhaust line, or exhaust passage, <b>26</b>. Exhaust passage <b>26</b> may be coupled to an exhaust manifold <b>70</b>, which in the depicted embodiment is integrated into cylinder head <b>12</b>. Intake passage <b>24</b> and exhaust passage <b>26</b> can selectively communicate with combustion chamber <b>16</b> via inlet opening <b>28</b> and outlet opening <b>30</b> and respective intake valve <b>32</b> and exhaust valve <b>34</b>. In some examples, combustion chamber <b>16</b> may include two or more intake valves and/or two or more exhaust valves.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">During operation, each cylinder within engine <b>10</b> typically undergoes a four stroke cycle: the cycle includes the intake stroke, compression stroke, expansion stroke, and exhaust stroke. During the intake stroke, generally, the exhaust valve <b>34</b> closes and intake valve <b>32</b> opens. Air is introduced into combustion chamber <b>16</b> via intake passage <b>24</b>, and piston <b>20</b> moves to the bottom of the cylinder so as to increase the volume within combustion chamber <b>16</b>. The position at which piston <b>20</b> is near the bottom of the cylinder and at the end of its stroke (e.g. when combustion chamber <b>16</b> is at its largest volume) is typically referred to by those of skill in the art as bottom dead center (BDC). During the compression stroke, intake valve <b>32</b> and exhaust valve <b>34</b> are closed. Piston <b>20</b> moves toward the cylinder head so as to compress the air within combustion chamber <b>16</b>. The point at which piston <b>20</b> is at the end of its stroke and closest to the cylinder head (e.g. when combustion chamber <b>16</b> is at its smallest volume) is typically referred to by those of skill in the art as top dead center (TDC). In a process hereinafter referred to as injection, fuel is introduced into the combustion chamber. In a process hereinafter referred to as ignition, the injected fuel is ignited by known ignition means such as a spark plug (not shown), resulting in combustion. During the expansion stroke, the expanding gases push piston <b>20</b> back to BDC. Crankshaft <b>22</b> converts piston movement into a rotational torque of the rotary shaft. Finally, during the exhaust stroke, the exhaust valve <b>34</b> opens to release the combusted air-fuel mixture to exhaust passage <b>26</b> and the piston returns to TDC. Note that the above is shown merely as an example, and that intake and exhaust valve opening and/or closing timings may vary, such as to provide positive or negative valve overlap, late intake valve closing, or various other examples.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A valve actuating device depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises two camshafts <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, on which a multiplicity of cams <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are arranged. A basic distinction is made between an underlying camshaft and an overhead camshaft. This relates to the parting plane, that is to say assembly surface, between the cylinder head and cylinder block. If the camshaft is arranged above said assembly surface, it is an overhead camshaft, otherwise it is an underlying camshaft. Overhead camshafts are preferably mounted in the cylinder head, and are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The cylinder head <b>12</b> is connected, at an assembly end side, to a cylinder block <b>14</b> which serves as an upper half of a crankcase <b>44</b> for holding the crankshaft <b>22</b> in at least two bearings, one of which is depicted as crankshaft bearing <b>46</b>. At the side facing away from the cylinder head <b>12</b>, the cylinder block <b>14</b> is connected to an oil pan <b>48</b> which serves as a lower crankcase half and which is provided for collecting and storing engine oil. The oil pan <b>48</b> serves as a heat exchanger for reducing the oil temperature when the internal combustion engine <b>10</b> has warmed up. Here, the oil situated in the oil pan <b>48</b> is cooled by means of heat conduction and convection by means of an air flow conducted past the outer side.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A pump <b>50</b> is provided for feeding the engine oil via a supply line <b>52</b> to a main engine oil gallery <b>54</b>. The engine oil gallery <b>54</b> may be arranged above or below the crankshaft <b>22</b> in the crankcase <b>44</b> or else integrated into the crankshaft <b>22</b>. Ducts lead from the main oil gallery to feed at least one consumer within an oil circuit <b>56</b>. Example oil consumers include bearings of the camshaft and crankshaft, hydraulically actuable camshaft adjusters or other valve drive components, etc. In contrast, according to other systems, the supply line leads from the pump through the cylinder block to the camshaft receptacle, and in so doing, passes the so-called main oil gallery.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In previous systems, the pump which is provided is itself provided with engine oil originating from an oil pan via a suction line which leads from the oil pan to the pump, and said pump ensures an adequately high feed flow, that is to say an adequately high feed volume, and an adequately high oil pressure in the supply system, that is to say oil circuit, in particular in the main oil gallery.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The heat released during combustion by the exothermic chemical conversion of the fuel is dissipated in part to the cylinder head <b>12</b> and the cylinder block <b>14</b> via the walls bounding the combustion chamber <b>16</b> and in part to the adjoining components and the environment via the exhaust gas flow. To reduce the thermal stress on the cylinder head <b>12</b>, some of the heat flow introduced into the cylinder head <b>12</b> may be removed from the cylinder head <b>12</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Owing to the significantly higher heat capacity of liquids relative to air, significantly larger amounts of heat can be dissipated by a liquid cooling system than with an air cooling system, for which reason cylinder heads of the type in question are advantageously provided with a liquid cooling system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Liquid cooling requires that the cylinder head be provided with at least one coolant jacket, or the arrangement of coolant ducts which carry the coolant through the cylinder head, and this requires a cylinder head design with a complex structure. On the one hand, this means that the mechanically and thermally highly stressed cylinder head is weakened by the introduction of the coolant ducts. On the other hand, the heat does not first have to be conducted to the surface of the cylinder head in order to be dissipated, as with the liquid cooling system. The heat is released to the coolant, generally water containing additives, within the cylinder head itself. In this arrangement, the coolant is delivered by a pump arranged in the cooling circuit and thus circulates in the coolant jacket. In this way, the heat released to the coolant is dissipated from the interior of the cylinder head and removed from the coolant again in a heat exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cooling capacity may be sufficiently high to eliminate or reduce enrichment (&#x3bb;&#x3c;1) in order to lower the temperature of the exhaust gas, as described in EP 1 722 090 A2, for example, which is regarded as disadvantageous from the point of view of energy considerations&#x2014;especially as regards the fuel consumption of the internal combustion engine&#x2014;and as regards pollutant emissions. This is because enrichment involves the injection of more fuel than can possibly be burnt with the quantity of air provided, with the additional fuel likewise being heated and vaporized, thus lowering the temperature of the combustion gases. In particular, the required enrichment does not typically allow the internal combustion engine to be operated in the manner that would, for example, be optimal for an exhaust gas aftertreatment system provided. That is to say this results in limitations in the operation of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, cylinder head <b>12</b> may include one or more coolant jackets <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, coolant jacket <b>60</b> is located between exhaust passage <b>26</b> and the assembly end side of cylinder head <b>12</b>, while coolant jacket <b>62</b> is located between intake passage <b>24</b> and the assembly end side of cylinder head <b>12</b>. The cylinder head <b>12</b> of the internal combustion engine according to the disclosure has two coolant circuits which are independent of one another and which comprise in each case at least one coolant jacket, and which in particular can be and preferably are operated with different coolants. One coolant jacket <b>62</b> is located on an inlet side of the cylinder, that is, the coolant jacket is integrated into the cylinder head <b>12</b> at the side of the cylinder that is adjacent to and surrounding the intake passage <b>24</b>. Another coolant jacket <b>60</b> is located on an outlet side of the cylinder, that is, the coolant jacket <b>60</b> is integrated into the cylinder head <b>12</b> at the side of the cylinder that is adjacent to and surrounding the exhaust passage <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">This arrangement leaves free an adequate amount of installation space on that side of the cylinder head <b>12</b> which faces away from the block <b>14</b>, for example for the arrangement of a camshaft receptacle, and leads to a compact design.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cooling arrangement may reliably protect the internal combustion engine, in particular the cylinder head <b>12</b>, against thermal overloading, and may preferably be efficient enough that an enrichment (&#x3bb;&#x3c;1) at high exhaust-gas temperatures can be dispensed with. This configuration or design of the liquid cooling arrangement makes it possible for the inlet side on the one hand and the outlet side on the other hand to be cooled as required, specifically independently of one another and according to the respective demand profile.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the present disclosure, the at least one coolant jacket <b>60</b> of one circuit is arranged at the outlet side and the at least one coolant jacket <b>62</b> of the other circuit is arranged at the inlet side, such that different cooling capacities can be realized for the inlet side and the outlet side, specifically not only through the use of different coolants. Moreover, the pump power of each circuit, and therefore also the coolant throughput, that is to say the feed volume, can be selected and set independently of one another. In this way, it is possible to influence the throughflow speed, which significantly co-determines the heat transfer by convection.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this way, it is possible for less heat to be extracted from the cylinder head <b>12</b> at the inlet side and more heat to be extracted from the cylinder head <b>12</b> at the outlet side.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In particular, the internal combustion engine <b>10</b> according to the disclosure permits the use of oil as coolant for the inlet side in an oil circuit <b>56</b> and the use of water as coolant in a water circuit (not shown) for the thermally more highly or highly loaded outlet side of the cylinder head <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, the cooling water circuit does not comprise an inlet-side coolant jacket. That is to say, the inlet side of the cylinder head <b>12</b> is exclusively oil cooled, for which reason the heat is not dissipated unused with the cooling water. Conversely, the oil circuit <b>56</b> may not comprise an outlet-side coolant jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Oil has a lower heat capacity than water, as a result of which the cooling capacity at the inlet side can be reduced noticeably in relation to the use of water as coolant. This configuration of the liquid cooling arrangement makes it possible for heat to be extracted from the cylinder head <b>12</b> at the inlet side to the extent actually required to prevent overheating. In contrast, in previous systems, on account of the uniform use of water as coolant, the inlet side is cooled more intensely than is actually required, because the cooling arrangement is designed with regard to the thermally more highly loaded outlet side. The internal combustion engine <b>10</b> according to the disclosure is therefore optimized with regard to cooling. The efficiency of the internal combustion engine <b>10</b> is increased by the liquid cooling arrangement according to the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the use of oil as coolant for the at least one inlet-side coolant jacket <b>62</b> has a further advantage. If the inlet-side coolant jacket <b>62</b> jointly forms the oil circuit <b>56</b> of the internal combustion engine, which oil circuit <b>56</b> supplies oil to consumers via a supply line <b>52</b>, the engine oil is heated up more quickly after a cold start.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The oil specifically then flows, as it passes the cylinder head <b>12</b>, through the inlet-side coolant jacket <b>62</b>, the most innate function of which is the presently desired heat transfer. Here, the inlet-side coolant jacket <b>62</b> is utilized for heating the oil during the warm-up phase, and corresponding to its original function, for cooling the cylinder head <b>12</b> when the internal combustion engine <b>10</b> has warmed up. In both cases, the inlet-side coolant jacket <b>62</b> serves for introducing heat into the oil.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While the heat which is introduced into the coolant at the inlet side after a cold start advantageously ensures fast heating of the oil, and therefore increases the efficiency of the operation of the internal combustion engine <b>10</b>. The heat which, in previous systems, is introduced into the cooling water serving as coolant is dissipated unused. The latter heat transfer even counteracts a fast heating of the oil. The heating of the oil during the warm-up phase is slowed here because a warm-up of the internal combustion engine, and therefore also heating of the oil as it passes the cylinder head or cylinder block, is counteracted.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With regard to the heating of the oil during the warm-up phase, the inlet-side coolant jacket <b>62</b> has out of principle proven to be extremely suitable. Firstly, the inlet-side coolant jacket <b>62</b> has an expanded volume region to provide a large surface area, in particular in comparison with an oil supply line, which has a relatively small surface area. The expanded volume region may extend from an area adjacent to the intake passage <b>24</b> down to the assembly end side of the cylinder head <b>12</b>, and may substantially surround an area around an intake passage port. This increased surface area increases the heat transfer by convection. Secondly, the cylinder head <b>12</b> into which the coolant jacket <b>62</b> is integrated is thermally particularly highly loaded, which promotes the introduction of heat into the engine oil during the warm-up phase on account of the comparatively large temperature difference or temperature gradient.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Therefore, for the reasons stated above, embodiments of the internal combustion engine are particularly advantageous in which the at least one outlet-side coolant jacket <b>60</b> belongs to a cooling water circuit, whereas the at least one inlet-side coolant jacket <b>62</b> belongs to an oil circuit <b>56</b>. The two coolant circuits, specifically the cooling water circuit on the one hand and the cooling oil circuit <b>56</b> on the other hand, are separate from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, the oil circuit <b>56</b> comprises the oil pan <b>48</b>, which provides oil to the oil pump <b>50</b>. The supply line <b>52</b>, upstream of the main oil gallery <b>54</b>, leads through the cylinder head <b>12</b>, preferably through the inlet-side coolant jacket <b>62</b> of the cylinder head <b>12</b>. The supply line <b>52</b> of the oil circuit <b>56</b> firstly leads through the cylinder head <b>12</b> before said supply line <b>52</b> enters into the cylinder block <b>14</b>. The supply line <b>52</b> opens out, downstream, into the main oil gallery <b>54</b>. While in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the oil supply line <b>52</b> is shown both outside the cylinder head <b>12</b> as well as integrated in the cylinder head <b>12</b>, it is to be understood that virtually any configuration of the supply line <b>52</b> is within the scope of this disclosure. For example, the supply line <b>52</b> may be fully integrated within the cylinder head and/or cylinder block.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the oil circuit <b>56</b>, the oil is heated in the cylinder head <b>12</b> and then is it used for lubricating engine components, such as the bearings <b>46</b> of the crankshaft <b>22</b>. While it is the case in the systems described previously that the engine oil flows from the main oil gallery to the cylinder head, in the present case, said oil is conducted from the cylinder head <b>12</b> to the main oil gallery <b>54</b>, which reduces the friction in the bearings and reduces fuel consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To supply the camshafts <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> with oil, the supply line <b>52</b> may further lead from the inlet-side coolant jacket <b>62</b> to the camshafts <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">This embodiment makes use of the fact that the cylinder head <b>12</b> is thermally highly loaded, in particular is thermally more highly loaded than the cylinder block <b>14</b>, such that the heating of the oil, that is to say the rise in the oil temperature, as said oil flows through the cylinder head <b>12</b> is more pronounced than when said oil flows through the cylinder block <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">After a cold start, the cylinder head <b>12</b> warms up more quickly, in particular in relation to the cylinder block <b>14</b>, as a result of the combustion processes taking place. The embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> ensures that the crankshaft bearings <b>46</b> are supplied with pre-heated oil more quickly, and in particular prevents a situation in which the oil entering into the cylinder head <b>12</b> has heat extracted from it upstream in the cylinder block <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, turbine <b>72</b> is coupled to cylinder head <b>12</b> on an outside of the cylinder head <b>12</b>. However, in some embodiments, turbine <b>72</b> may be integrated in cylinder head <b>12</b>. In order to provide a cooling mechanism to cool turbine <b>72</b>, a coolant jacket <b>74</b> may be integrated in the housing of turbine <b>72</b>. This turbine coolant jacket <b>74</b> may be part of oil circuit <b>56</b>. Oil may be pumped from oil pan <b>48</b> via pump <b>50</b> in supply line <b>52</b> and fed through turbine coolant jacket <b>74</b> before entering the coolant jacket <b>62</b> on the inlet-side of cylinder head <b>12</b>. In the embodiment depicted, the pump <b>50</b> and the coolant jacket <b>74</b> integrated in the housing are coupled to each other without an intervening consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Providing the turbine <b>72</b> with a liquid cooling arrangement makes it possible to use thermally less highly loadable materials for producing the turbine housing, for example makes it possible to use low-alloy steels, cast iron or aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In particular, however, by using oil as coolant, the introduction of heat into the coolant can be limited and considerably reduced in relation to water coolant, since having to extract said very large amount of heat again from the water which serves as coolant, is eliminated. The fact that the amount of heat introduced into the coolant can be reduced by the use of oil as coolant can be attributed inter alia to the material properties of oil.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">By use of the Nusselt number, a dimensionless characteristic value from similitude theory, it is possible to describe the heat transfer to a flowing fluid, for example also the introduction of heat into the coolant as it flows through the turbine housing. The Nusselt number is a material-dependent and therefore fluid-specific characteristic value. It is proportional to the heat transfer coefficient a during heat transfer as a result of convection, and is therefore a measure for the quality, that is to say the magnitude of the introduction of heat.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The Nusselt number of water is a multiple of the Nusselt number of oil, as a result of which the introduction of heat as a result of convection is considerably higher when using water as coolant, under otherwise identical boundary conditions, than when oil is used for cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The housing of the turbine <b>72</b> may be produced from inexpensive materials on account of the liquid cooling arrangement provided, without having to dissipate excessively large amounts of heat, since the heat transfer in the housing is reduced in a targeted manner by the use, according to the embodiment, of oil.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Firstly, the internal combustion engine according to the disclosure makes it possible to dispense with thermally highly loadable, in particular nickel-containing materials for producing the turbine housing, since the turbine <b>72</b> is also provided, according to the disclosure, with a liquid cooling arrangement. Secondly, the cooling capacity, that is to say the introduction of heat into the coolant, is reduced by the use of oil, such that the amounts of heat to be dissipated do not constitute a problem in process terms.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A distinction is to be made between the oil cooling arrangement according to the disclosure and the oil supply which serves for lubricating the turbine shaft or the shaft bearings with oil. In principle, said oil supply also cools parts of the turbine or of the turbine housing. However, the turbine shaft oil supply itself has no coolant jacket, which clearly distinguishes the oil cooling arrangement according to the disclosure from the oil supply.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The amount of heat introduced into the coolant can be considerably reduced by the use of oil, and not only on account of the effects described in conjunction with the Nusselt number. Furthermore, it may be taken into consideration that oil can be heated to a considerably greater degree than water, which&#x2014;assuming atmospheric pressure&#x2014;evaporates at 100&#xb0; C. The heat transfer in the housing can consequently also be further reduced by reducing the temperature difference between the housing and coolant, that is to say oil, by heating the oil. Oil can, in some cases, be heated to 200&#xb0; C. or higher. An example diagram illustrating the relationship between the heat transfer coefficients of water and oil as a function of coolant temperature and coolant flow through is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Since the oil supply system of the internal combustion engine is connected to the coolant jacket <b>74</b> integrated in the turbine housing, the oil supply jointly forms the oil circuit <b>56</b> provided for the cooling of the housing, such that the other components and assemblies required to form a cooling circuit may basically be provided only singly and may be used both for the cooling circuit of the turbine and also for the oil supply, which leads to synergies and considerable cost savings, but also results in a weight saving. For example, only one pump for conveying the oil which serves as coolant, and one container for storing the oil, may be provided. The heat transferred to the oil in the housing and in the internal combustion engine can be dissipated in a common heat exchanger, such as the oil pan or another heat exchanger not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the engine <b>10</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is depicted. Here, multiple cylinders of engine <b>10</b> are shown. In addition to cylinder <b>16</b>, cylinders <b>66</b>, <b>67</b>, and <b>69</b> are depicted. While engine <b>10</b> is here depicted as a four-cylinder engine, it is to be understood that any number of cylinders in any arrangement is within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">An intake manifold <b>68</b> provides intake air to the cylinders via intake passages, such as intake passage <b>24</b>. After combustion, exhaust gasses exit the cylinders via exhaust passages, such as exhaust passage <b>26</b>, to the exhaust manifold <b>70</b>. The exhaust lines of at least two cylinders may be merged to form an overall exhaust line within the cylinder head, so as to form an integrated exhaust manifold that permits the densest possible packaging of the drive unit. The exhaust gasses may pass through one or more aftertreatment devices <b>76</b> before exiting to the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The engine <b>10</b> may be supercharged by means of an exhaust-gas turbocharger. The exhaust gas may pass through a turbine <b>72</b> to drive a compressor <b>75</b> to provide boosted intake air to engine <b>10</b>. The turbine <b>72</b> may be coupled to the compressor by a shaft <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment of the turbine <b>72</b> in a section perpendicular to the shaft <b>73</b> of the turbine rotor <b>106</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the turbine <b>72</b> is a radial turbine <b>102</b>, which comprises a rotor <b>106</b> arranged in a turbine casing <b>103</b> and rotatably supported on a shaft <b>107</b>. To allow radial inflow to the rotor blades, the inlet zone <b>104</b>, which merges downstream into a flow duct <b>105</b>, is of spiral design and the casing <b>103</b> for supplying the exhaust gas is designed as a spiral casing which extends all the way round the rotor <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">To form a cooling system, the casing <b>103</b> has an integrated coolant jacket <b>74</b>, which extends in a spiral around the shaft <b>107</b> in the casing <b>103</b> and hence follows the flow duct <b>105</b> as far as the entry of the exhaust gas into the rotor <b>106</b>. Provided adjacent to the inlet zone <b>104</b> of the turbine casing <b>103</b> are duct openings <b>109</b> to enable coolant to be introduced into and discharged again from the coolant jacket <b>74</b>. To enable the turbine <b>101</b> to be attached to the cylinder head (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the casing <b>103</b> is provided with a flange <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the turbine <b>72</b> is embodied as a radial turbine <b>102</b>, and thus the flow entering the rotor blades is substantially radial. In this context, substantially radial means that the velocity component in the radial direction is larger than the axial velocity component. The velocity vector of the flow intersects the shaft <b>73</b> or axis of the turbine <b>102</b>, more particularly at a right angle, if the flow entering is exactly radial. To this extent, the radial turbine <b>102</b> can also be of mixed-flow construction as long as the velocity component in the radial direction is larger than the velocity component in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">To enable the flow to enter the rotor blades radially, the inlet zone <b>104</b> for feeding in the exhaust gas is often designed as a spiral or volute casing that extends all the way round, ensuring that the inflow of exhaust gas to the turbine <b>102</b> is substantially radial.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The cylinder head according to the present disclosure with a radial turbine <b>102</b> is suitable especially for pressure-charged internal combustion engines, which are subject to particularly high thermal stresses owing to the relatively high exhaust gas temperatures. Consequently, cooling of the turbine of the exhaust gas turbocharger is advantageous. Thus, in the embodiment depicted, the radial turbine <b>102</b> is included in a turbocharger.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Pressure charging is used primarily to boost the power of the internal combustion engine. The air required for the combustion process is compressed, enabling a larger air mass to be fed to each cylinder per working cycle. As a result, it is possible to increase the fuel mass and hence the mean pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Pressure charging is a suitable way of boosting the power of an internal combustion engine while keeping the displacement unchanged or of reducing the displacement for the same power. In each case, pressure charging leads to an increase in power per unit installation volume and a more favorable power-to-mass ratio. Given identical vehicle boundary conditions, it is thus possible to shift the load population toward higher loads, where specific fuel consumption is lower. Consequently, pressure charging assists the constant effort in the development of combustion engines to minimize fuel consumption, that is to say, to improve the efficiency of internal combustion engines.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Compared with a mechanical charger, the advantage of an exhaust gas turbocharger is that there is no mechanical connection or no need for a mechanical connection to transmit power between the charger and the internal combustion engine. While a mechanical charger draws the energy required to drive it directly from the internal combustion engine, the exhaust gas turbocharger uses the energy of the hot exhaust gases.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the engine <b>10</b> including the turbocharger with the turbine according to the disclosure may include more than one cylinder. If the cylinder head has two cylinders and only the exhaust lines of one cylinder form an overall exhaust line which opens into the radial turbine, this is likewise a cylinder head according to the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">If the cylinder head has three or more cylinders and only the exhaust lines of two cylinders combine to form an overall exhaust line, this is likewise a cylinder head according to the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Embodiments of the cylinder head in which, for example, the cylinder head has four cylinders arranged in series and the exhaust lines of the outer cylinders and the exhaust lines of the inner cylinders each combine to form an overall exhaust line are likewise cylinder heads according to the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the case of three and more cylinders, there is therefore also an advantage with embodiments in which at least three cylinders are configured in such a way that they form two groups, each comprising at least one cylinder, and the exhaust lines of the cylinders in each cylinder group in each case combine to form an overall exhaust line, thereby forming an exhaust manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">This embodiment is suitable especially for the use of a double-flow turbine. A double-flow turbine has an inlet zone with two inlet ducts, that is to say as it were two inlet zones, the two overall exhaust lines being connected to the double-flow turbine in such a way that one overall exhaust line opens into each inlet duct. Combination of the two exhaust flows carried in the overall exhaust lines may take place downstream of the turbine. If the exhaust lines are grouped in such a way that the high pressures, especially the exhaust lead pulses, can be preserved, a double-flow turbine is suitable especially for pulse charging, whereby it is possible to achieve high turbine pressure ratios at low rotational speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">However, grouping the cylinders and exhaust lines also offers advantages when using several turbines or exhaust gas turbochargers, with one overall exhaust line being connected to each turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">However, embodiments in which the exhaust lines of all the cylinders of the cylinder head are combined to form a single, or common, overall exhaust line are also advantageous, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">While shown as a turbine <b>72</b> of radial type of construction, the turbine <b>72</b> may be of axial type of construction in other embodiments, that is to say the flow approaching the rotor blades runs substantially axially. Here, &#x201c;substantially axially&#x201d; means that the speed component in the axial direction is greater than the radial speed component.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The turbine <b>72</b> may be equipped with a variable turbine geometry, which enables a more precise adaptation to the respective operating point of the internal combustion engine an adjustment of the turbine geometry or of the effective turbine cross section. Here, guide blades for influencing the flow direction are arranged in the inlet region of the turbine <b>72</b>. In contrast to the rotor blades of the rotating rotor, the guide blades do not rotate with the shaft of the turbine <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the turbine <b>72</b> has a fixed, invariable geometry, the guide blades are arranged in the inlet region so as to be not only stationary but rather also completely immovable, that is to say rigidly fixed. In contrast, if use is made of a turbine <b>72</b> with variable turbine geometry, the guide blades are duly also arranged so as to be stationary but not so as to be completely immovable, rather so as to be rotatable about their axes, such that the flow approaching the rotor blades can be influenced.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a method <b>400</b> for operating an oil circuit according to an embodiment of the disclosure. Method <b>400</b> may be configured in some conditions to rapidly heat an engine and engine oil circuit utilizing exhaust heat. In other conditions, method <b>400</b> may cool a turbine and engine and enable utilization of a turbine constructed from inexpensive materials.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Method <b>400</b> comprises, at <b>402</b>, routing oil through an oil circuit. The oil circuit may comprise an oil pan located in the crankcase, an oil pump, and an oil supply line that leads to one or more components of the engine. For example, the oil may be pumped from the oil pan to the housing of a turbine coupled to the exhaust passage of the engine at <b>404</b>. In doing so, the oil may be heated from the exhaust heat while simultaneously cooling the turbine. In some embodiments, in order to reduce the amount of heat the oil is able to extract from the turbine, the oil may be heated by a heater prior to reaching the turbine at <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">After the oil is routed through the turbine, it may be routed to a coolant jacket located in an inlet side of the cylinder head at <b>408</b>. Here, the oil may act to heat the engine under conditions of cold engine start. However, when the engine reaches standard operating temperature and no longer requires heating, the oil may act to cool the engine. To do so, the oil may be routed through a heat exchanger positioned between the turbine and the coolant jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The oil may then be routed to one or more oil consumers of the engine at <b>410</b>. Example oil consumers include crankshaft and camshaft bearings, valve drive components, etc. The oil delivered to the oil consumers may be used to lubricate various engine parts. As the oil lubricates the engine components, some may return to the oil pan via gravity in order to complete the oil circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When method <b>400</b> acts in an engine cooling capacity, it may also include cooling an outlet side of the cylinder head. In this embodiment, the outlet side may be cooled by a separate water cooling circuit. Thus, method <b>400</b> also comprises, at <b>412</b>, routing water through a water circuit. The water circuit may comprise a standard engine coolant circuit including a coolant pump, radiator or other heat exchanger, etc. Routing water through the water circuit may include routing water through a coolant jacket located at the outlet side of the cylinder head at <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thus, method <b>400</b> provides for cooling an engine with two separate cooling circuits, an oil circuit and a water circuit. By providing two separate circuits, method <b>400</b> may provide different levels of cooling to the inlet and outlet sides of the cylinder head, which have different levels of cooling requirements. Additionally, method <b>400</b> includes utilizing the oil circuit to cool a turbine. By doing so, less expensive and more lightweight materials may be used to construct the turbine. Further, when the oil passes through the turbine, it may be rapidly heated, and this heat may be transferred to heat the engine. Thus, the oil circuit may increase engine efficiency by allowing for a more lightweight turbine and more rapid engine heating.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows, in a diagram <b>500</b>, the ratio (HTC Ratio) of the heat transfer coefficients HTC<sub>oil </sub>and HTC<sub>water </sub>of two different coolants as a function of the coolant temperature T<sub>coolant </sub>and the throughflow rate V.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As coolant, use is made on the one hand of oil (HTC<sub>oil </sub>and V<sub>oil</sub>) and on the other hand of water (HTC<sub>water </sub>and V<sub>water</sub>). The cooling water which is used may be a mixture of water and glycol.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The dimensionless ratio HTC Ratio of the heat transfer coefficients HTC<sub>oil </sub>and HTC<sub>water </sub>is plotted on the y-axis, and the through flow rate is plotted, likewise as a dimensionless ratio V<sub>oil</sub>/V<sub>water</sub>, on the x-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If the coolant temperature rises, for example from T<sub>coolant</sub>=20&#xb0; C. to T<sub>coolant</sub>=120&#xb0; C., the heat transfer coefficient of the oil increases noticeably in relation to the coefficient of cooling water. This clearly shows that, at relatively high coolant temperatures, cooling by oil has advantages with regard to heat dissipation, that is to say oil provides a more intense cooling action.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">It also emerges from the diagram that&#x2014;even when using oil as coolant&#x2014;the heat transfer coefficient increases with the through flow rate, since the flow speed rises with the through flow rate. In particular, however, it also emerges from the diagram that, as a result of the use of oil as coolant, the introduction of heat into the coolant is considerably reduced in relation to cooling by water. The basis for this is that the heat transfer coefficient HTC<sub>water </sub>of water is a multiple greater than the coefficient HTC<sub>oil </sub>of oil.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">It will be appreciated that the configurations and methods disclosed herein are exemplary in nature, and that these specific embodiments are not to be considered in a limiting sense, because numerous variations are possible. For example, the above technology can be applied to V-6, I-4, I-6, V-12, opposed 4, and other engine types.
