<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and related system for providing therapy to a treatment site, such as stenosis or other vasculature disease, at one or more locations of a subject, such as the vasculature. The method includes: advancing an ultrasound catheter to or in proximity to the subject's treatment site; infusing microbubbles into or proximal to the treatment site; and delivering ultrasonic energy from the ultrasound catheter. The ultrasonic energy may be adapted for: imaging the treatment site, translating the microbubbles into or in the vicinity of the treatment site and/or rupturing the microbubbles.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was blamed for 37% of the 2.4M deaths in the US (2003) [1]. CVD is the leading cause of death in the US and the developed world.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Currently Available Drug-Eluting Stents (DES) Pose a Major Potential Health Concern</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The clinical use of Drug Eluting Stents (DES), in relation to Bare Metal Stents (BMS), has evolved over a period of approximately 18 months from approximately 0% usage in the U.S., to the point where they were used in approximately 80% of coronary stent procedures in the U.S. [2, 3].</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above cited recent studies indicates that there is a significant, growing population (approximately 6 Million individuals worldwide [4]) who currently find themselves having been implanted with DES and face a choice between taking the expensive and risky drug clopidogrel&#x2014;potentially for life&#x2014;or increased risk of premature death.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell, VCAM-1 and Rapamycin: Vascular SMC Proliferation Contributes to Angioplasty-Induced Stenosis and In-Stent Restenosis.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The primary function of the vascular SMC in adult animals is contraction and SMCs express a unique repertoire of genes that allow for this specialized form of contraction, including SM &#x3b1;-actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), SM22&#x3b1;, calponin, desmin, smoothelin&#x2014;genes we refer to as SMC differentiation marker genes [5-8]. This repertoire of genes is typically used to describe the &#x201c;contractile&#x201d; phenotype or mature SMC.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">VCAM-1 is a Marker of the Phenotypically Modified/Proliferating SMC.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The changes in SMC gene expression profiles associated with injury-induced phenotypic modulation are transient. That is, SMCs undergo phenotypic modulation as a natural response to repair the injured blood vessel, transitioning from a contractile phenotype to a synthetic phenotype but revert back to a contractile phenotype as the lesion resolves itself. Thus, this continuum of altered SMC gene expression profiles can be used to target the phenotypically modified SMC that invests in the developing neointima using molecular targeting. VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) is expressed in proliferating SMCs [9, 10] and transiently upregulated in SMCs following acute vascular injury and in atherosclerotic lesions [11]. The function of VCAM-1 is to promote cell-cell interaction required for SMC migration and recruitment or attraction of other cell types into the lesion, e.g. VCAM-1 interaction on SMCs with integrins on leukocytes, monocytes or macrophages (all inflammatory cells) [9]. Because VCAM-1 is expressed at much lower levels in the quiescent contractile SMC phenotype, but increased in proliferating SMCs, VCAM-1 can thus be used to target the proliferating SMC.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Rapamycin is a Potent SMC Anti-Proliferative Agent and the Bench-Mark Agent for Preventing In-Stent Restenosis by Release from a DES.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The cell cycle consists of 5 basic steps: dormancy (G0) or the contractile SMC phenotype, gap phase 1 (G1), synthesis (S), pre-mitosis or gap phase 2 (G2) and mitosis (M). In response to acute vascular injury, SMCs leave G0 and enter G1 to begin the process of cell proliferation and division into M phase; this is the synthetic migratory or proliferative SMC phenotype. The strategies for preventing SMC proliferation and entry into the cell cycle have been to block various phases of the cell cycle once the cell has left G0 in response to injury or some acute growth stimulus. Sirolimus, or rapamycin, and its analogues, ABT578 (Abbot Pharmaceuticals) and everolimus, are immunosuppressants with both anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties that interfere early in the cell cycle by inhibiting the passage of cells from G1 to S phase. Drugs that inhibit cell cycle in the G1 phase are considered cytostatic and may be less toxic than drugs that act later in the cell cycle [12, 13]. Rapamycin is the most thoroughly investigated agent of this group and has become the bench-mark agent for the prevention of coronary artery restenosis [14]. Thus, because rapamycin is considered &#x201c;cytostatic&#x201d;, SMCs treated with rapamycin do not die but maintain their viability in the growth arrested state.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Molecular Targeting of Microbubble Carriers</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Recent research has investigated the feasibility of targeted ultrasound contrast microbubbles as a means of detecting intravascular manifestations of disease. Pathology is often accompanied by alterations of the endothelial cell layer lining of the affected blood vessels. This dysfunction may occur in the microcirculation, and is identified by the selective expression or up-regulation of certain molecules on the vascular endothelial surface. Many of the molecular markers of endothelial dysfunction corresponding to disease states such as atherosclerosis [15], transplant rejection [16], inflammation and ischemia reperfusion injury [17] are well characterized. However, there is currently no non-invasive, clinically approved technique to assess the extent and location of such vascular pathologies. Experimental formulations of targeted microbubbles, which contain a surface-bound ligand specific for the intended target, are injected intravascularly and, after a short circulation period, are observed to accumulate at the target site. Subsequent ultrasound imaging enables determination of the location and extent of the targeted disease state [18]. This technique, known as &#x201c;targeted contrast enhanced ultrasound&#x201d;, may achieve high spatial resolution, real time imaging, and a linear or other measurable correlation between adherent microbubbles and the received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There is therefore a need for, among other things, the drug, the drug carrier, and the means of localizing delivery; and a means to guide the focal delivery under real time image guidance.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">There is a need for real time, noninvasive, imaging method to reliably guide the focal delivery of antiproliferative drug to regions at risk of restenosis following angioplasty and/or stenting.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An aspect of some of the various embodiments of the invention comprise an ultrasound contrast agent that have a selected drug incorporated into the bubble shell. In one embodiment, the drug may be rapamycin. It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to any particular drug or class of drug, or agent (or any other type of medium or material being delivered to the location of the subject or the treatment site or diagnostic site of the subject. An aspect of various embodiments of the present invention may further comprise the means (a transducer [or transducer array] and its associated driving electronics) to deliver ultrasound energy (&#x201c;therapeutic&#x201d;) to break the bubbles in such a manner as to focally deliver drug material to selected local cells. For example, but not limited thereto, the selected cells are those on or in the wall of a selected blood vessel. The precise mechanisms and the optimal conditions for ultrasound mediated drug delivery are heretofore not well understood. What is known from extensive literature is that the combination of bubbles plus ultrasound greatly improve the delivery of drug (or gene) material through the cell membrane. In an approach, the &#x201c;therapeutic&#x201d; ultrasound transducer is intimately integrated with an &#x201c;imaging&#x201d; ultrasound transducer that provides real-time, noninvasive imaging for guiding the precise delivery of potent drugs to a selected tissue region. Similar transducers used clinically are referred to as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheters. Typically, the design of an optimal imaging transducer and an optimal therapeutic transducer are different&#x2014;e.g. the therapeutic transducer may operate in a high power transmit mode of about 0.5 to about 2 MHz, whereas the imaging transducer operates as a finely sampled imaging array about 5 to about 30 MHz range. It should be appreciated that other higher and lower frequency modes may, of course, be employed within the context of the invention as desired or required. Nevertheless, it is possible to make compromises in the transducer design and arrive at a common design for both imaging and therapeutic effect.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The combined transducer may be catheter-based, may transthoracically-based (i.e. &#x201c;conventional&#x201d; diagnostic ultrasound) and intravascularly, as is the case with IVUS&#x2014;introduced through femoral or carotid artery. The transducer may also be introduced via any natural or synthetic body cavity/orifice (uretha, anus, vagina, mouth/esophagus or surgical incision in any body part). Transducer designs (or aspects thereof) for some of these applications or aspects of the applications may be known in context of conventional diagnostic ultrasound and most large vendors develop and market transducers for each of these applications.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The drug/contrast may be delivered systemically via intravenous (IV) injection or it may be delivered more locally such as from an aperture/conduit in a catheter placed into the veinous or arterial circulatory system.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The drug may exist &#x201c;side by side&#x201d; with the agent&#x2014;i.e. the drug not bound into the bubble shell. When the drug is injected &#x201c;side by side&#x201d; it may be dissolved in any suitable solvent appropriate for that drug (e.g. water, lipid, alcohol, or solid form&#x2014;for example, in very fine particle form&#x2014;like nanoparticle, etc. Moreover, the drug could be in a gas or solid, for example, could be in the core or shell of the bubble (respectively)); in addition to being in the liquid phase, the drug may be used in the solid dosage forms, such as in nanoparticle formulations of kinds familiar to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The bubbles may be molecular targeted to enhance cell-specific selectivity&#x2014;per the techniques, for example, described in the multiple papers by Klibanov [19, 20] and colleagues.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An aspect(s) of various embodiments of the present invention may be provide a number of novel and nonobvious features, elements and characteristics, such as but not limited thereto, the following: integrated image guidance of ultrasound-based local drug delivery; integrated image guidance of ultrasound-based local gene delivery; cell-specific molecular targeting of therapeutic agent; and ultrasound imaging-based estimation of the delivery of therapeutic agent.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An aspect of an embodiment or partial embodiment of the present invention (or combinations of various embodiments in whole or in part of the present invention) comprises a method of providing therapy to a treatment site at one or more locations of a subject. The method comprising: advancing an ultrasound catheter to or in proximity to the subject's treatment site, the catheter having a proximal region and distal region; infusing microbubbles from the distal region of the ultrasound catheter into or proximal to the treatment site; and delivering ultrasonic energy from the distal region of the ultrasound catheter. The ultrasonic energy adapted for: imaging the treatment site and rupturing the microbubbles. The ultrasonic energy may also adapted for translating the microbubbles.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An aspect of an embodiment or partial embodiment of the present invention (or combinations of various embodiments in whole or in part of the present invention) comprises an ultrasound catheter system for providing therapy to a treatment site at one or more locations of a subject.

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Development of Transducer/Instrumentation to Optimize Delivery of a Therapeutic Agent by Microbubble Carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Spatially localized, focused, non-invasive/minimally invasive treatments require appropriate non invasive real time imaging to guide the localization of the therapeutic (focal) region with respect to selected target site in the context of surrounding anatomy. This point may seem simple but it has profound implications for non-invasive treatment. This paradigm further suggests attention be paid to ensuring that the focused treatment zone be accurately and reliably aligned with whatever non-invasive imaging is used. The ideal model would be that the image plane is coincident with the therapeutic point, line or plane. Frequently, a small imaging array is placed centrally within an aperture &#x201c;cut out&#x201d; from a larger therapeutic array. Rosenschein [21] describes a 94 mm diameter therapeutic array into which a 7.5 MHz annular array is placed in concentric fashion. The system was used successfully for in vitro thrombolysis in bovine artery segments. Unger [22] describes (at least conceptually) a transducer design incorporating therapeutic and imaging array elements with a common front face plane. In this example, the therapeutic array is placed within a hole in the imaging array. A large central &#x201c;hole&#x201d; in an array aperture gives rise to a near-field blind spot and distorted sidelobe patterns&#x2014;typically grating lobe related due to the poor spatial sampling implicit by virtue of the &#x201c;hole&#x201d; in the aperture. Until now, much work has involved fixturing an imaging array with respect to a therapeutic focused transducer/array [23-25]. An integrated imaging and therapeutic array, for example, was described by the University of Washington [26]. There is, however, no reason to believe that such an &#x201c;integrated&#x201d; array comprises exactly coincident &#x201c;therapeutic&#x201d; and imaging arrays as proposed here. The precise need for defining a required level of &#x201c;integration&#x201d; is a function of the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the context of microbubble imaging, Bouakaz [27] has described a dual frequency transducer (0.9 MHz and 2.8 MHz) array using interspersed elements. The element spacing is 0.5 mm&#x2014;i.e. &#x3bb; spacing at 2.8 MHz. When using an interspersed element design it becomes doubly problematic to achieve adequate spatial sampling. Further, only &#x3c;50% of potential active area for each array (in isolation) is available. This loss of active area limits maximal acoustic power delivery. Forsberg [28] has also described a multifrequency array in which three linear arrays (2.5 MHz, 5 MHz and 10 MHz) were placed side-by-side with a common focal range (50 mm). This approach works well within the one fixed focal region but lacks the versatility to address other ranges.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As discussed above, the chemical and biological properties of rapamycin and why it is the benchmark reagent for preventing SMC proliferation associated with vascular injury in vivo. This established the rationale for choosing rapamycin for ultrasound-triggered microbubble carrier release. Multiple groups have shown that treatment of cultured SMCs with rapamycin reduces SMC proliferation [12, 30]. However, delivering of rapamycin via ultrasound triggered release from a microbubble carrier has not been performed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Exemplary Design/Experiment</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Ultrasound was applied to rat smooth muscle cells in conjunction with modified ultrasound microbubbles containing rapamycin in their shells. The microbubbles were prepared by co-inventor A. L. Klibanov at UVA. Microbubbles were formed by self-assembly of a lipid monolayer during the ultrasonic dispersion of decafluorobutane gas in an aqueous micellar mixture of phosphatidylcholine (2 mg/ml) and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) stearate (2 mg/ml) with rapamycin (0.2 mg/ml) and/or a trace amount of a fluorescent dye DiI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), similarly to the procedure described previously [31]. Fluorescently labeled DiI microbubbles were used as a control to ensure that the microbubble vehicle alone did not cause an effect on the cells. The rapamycin drug, dissolved in 100% ethanol, was also used as a control with which to compare the effect of the rapamycin microbubbles. We assured a strong adherence of cells to the OptiCell (Biocrystal, Westerville, Ohio) flasks by plating them with fibronectin for 24 hrs prior to plating any cells. Rat SMCs were plated at a low density and allowed to grow for 48 hrs in DF10 media inside each of 12 OptiCells. Digital phase microscopy light images of the cells were taken at 5 hrs prior before treatment to establish baseline conditions. All images were taken at 4&#xd7; magnification. 24 hrs after plating, the media was replaced with fresh media containing either the DiI microbubbles (vehicle control), rapamycin drug (drug control), or rapamycin microbubbles. The microbubbles (DiI or rapamycin) were added to the OptiCells at a concentration of 10&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>bubbles/ml and the rapamycin was added at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. The microbubble concentrations were chosen such that the number of microbubbles added contained an equivalent amount of rapamycin, &#x2dc;10 ng/ml. We ensured that the drug had an effect even without prolonged exposure by taking half of the OptiCell flasks and giving them treatment for only two hours. After two hours the drug/bubble-containing media was replaced with fresh media. The cells in the OptiCell flasks received one of the following 6 treatments: DiI bubbles for 48 hours, rapamycin drug for 48 hours, rapamycin bubbles for 48 hours, DiI bubbles for 2 hours, rapamycin drug for 2 hours, rapamycin bubbles for 2 hours. All conditions were tested in duplicate.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Following the placement of fresh media and microbubbles into each OptiCell, ultrasound was applied to the entire area of cell growth. One at a time, each OptiCell was horizontally placed into a water bath (&#x2212;37&#xb0; C.). A focused 1 MHz (Panametrics, Waltham, Mass.) transducer was immersed in the water and located directly above the cells. A motion controller was used to traverse the transducer across the aperture of the OptiCell so as to evenly apply ultrasound to the entire area of cell growth. A 1 MHz, 35% BW, Gaussian pulse was applied at a Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) of 1 kHz, 600 kPa peak, for the entire insonation time (9 mins.). Images were taken at 4 locations within each OptiCell. These locations were marked with a dot at the 5 hr time point. Subsequent images were taken at these same locations, 24 hours, and 48 hours after treatment. The OptiCells were stored in a 37&#xb0; C. incubator.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(A) and 5(B)</figref>, we show that delivery of &#x2dc;10 ng/ml of rapamycin by ultrasound-triggered release form a microbubble carrier prevented SMC proliferation, depicted as a change in cell number, compared to release of a fluorescent membrane dye, DiI (Invitrogen), from an equivalent number of microbubble carriers. Moreover, quantitative analysis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(D)</figref>, shows that delivery of rapamycin (10 ng/ml) by ultrasound-triggered release from a microbubble carrier was not different from cells treated with free rapamycin drug (10 ng/ml) in the cell culture media. Similar results were observed in the set of 6 OptiCells which were only treated for 2 hours post ultrasound and then allowed to grow for 48 hrs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(C) and 5(E)</figref>). Thus, these results show (among other things) that rapamycin and an inert cell marking dye (DiI, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(C)</figref>) can be delivered to SMCs by ultrasound-triggered microbubble carrier release.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, non-invasive ultrasound imaging can play a critical role in the guidance of the therapeutic ultrasound that will localize the release and transcellular membrane delivery of the rapamycin drug. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> illustrate the current capabilities for fine-scale visualization of rodent vasculature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a bubble-specific image of vessel wall-bound molecular-targeted (anti-VCAM-1) bubbles in the mouse common carotid artery (CCA) assessed using 10 MHz bubble specific ultrasound imaging (e.g., Sequoia scanner or other commercial clinical ultrasound scanner). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref> is a VisualSonics VEVO 770 image of a rat carotid at 40 MHz demonstrating fine spatial resolution. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(B) and 7(C)</figref> are B-Mode, and contrast specific, rat carotid images acquired at 12 MHz and 10 MHz, respectively (e.g., Sequoia scanner).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Transducer and Instrumentation</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An exemplary transducer solution for dual function imaging therapeutics is one in which the transducer elements are sufficiently versatile that they can accomplish both tasks&#x2014;high frequency (HF) imaging and low frequency (LF) bubble manipulation/breaking. This enables a design in which the imaging plane and therapeutic planes are coincident. Deficiencies in these previous designs suggest the need for a superior solution.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The solution to the dual function requirement of the transducer (HF, high resolution, low intensity imaging and LF, high power bubble fracture) is to form a transducer with two active layers: one on top of the other (for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(C)</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Each layer is resonant at a widely disparate frequency&#x2014;the lower one at about 1-2 MHz and the upper one at approximately 12 MHz. Conventional design wisdom relating to stacked transducer layers would suggest that the two transducer layers would cause high undesirable interference between the resonances associated with each of the layers. Nevertheless, our experience suggests that a two layer transducer will work provided that the transducer layers are well matched between each other and to the backing material.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an approach, a prototype dual layer single element transducer was designed using 1:3 PZT/epoxy composite transducer layers. The acoustic impedance of each layer is approximately 15 MRayl. The backing is a dense metal (tungsten) loaded epoxy with an acoustic impedance of approximately 9 MRayl. This transducer was fabricated to our design by Vermon, Tours, France. The single element device, 1 cm in diameter and with a focal depth of 5 cm, was constructed to test the viability of the proposed dual layer approach. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(A)</figref> illustrates the pulse-echo responses of the LF layer. The LF result exhibits a desired smooth, short duration, waveform. The high frequency layer in the current prototype exhibits a reflection artifact that we attribute to reflections between the rear of the low frequency layer and the backing block (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(B)</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(C)</figref>, we show that we can substantially correct this deficiency by using an inverse filter designed to force the response to be more Gaussian (in the frequency domain). Alternatively, we will redesign and optimize the dual layer transducer using better matched transducer layers to minimize/eliminate internal reflections. An early FEA result for a modified design, using a better matched backing (i.e. 15 MRayl), is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(D)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The transducer may be designed for any one of many clinical applications. It may be for transcutaneous use and comprise a conventional phased or linear array (flat or curved, or contoured anatomically or ergonomically as desired or required). It may also be designed for transesophagael, transvaginal, transuretha, transrectal or intra-operative use. Examples of each of these form factor transducers are known in the field&#x2014;usually comprising similar transducer structures inside a plastic case adapted to the chosen anatomic use.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The transducer may also be formed in a catheter&#x2014;as in intrasvascular ultrasound (IVUS). IVUS catheters are currently widely marketed in the US by Boston Scientific (Natick, Mass.) and Volcano (Rancho Cordova, Calif.). The Boston Scientific transducer typically comprises a single element that is rotated at high speed by a drive wire to form a coronal view. The transducer element in this transducer may be modified by changing its operating frequency (i.e. lowered to around 2-15 MHz) to make it suitable for breaking bubbles. The Volcano transducer is generally a circumferential phased array. Again, the frequency of the array design may be modified (i.e. lowered to around 2-around 15 MHz) to make it suitable for breaking bubbles. It is possible to potentially use either a dual layer design&#x2014;as described herein&#x2014;or potentially use a modified design where a compromise between high frequency imaging and low frequency bubble breaking is selected&#x2014;e.g., instead of attempting to operate imaging at about 25 MHz and breaking at about 2 MHz, a single wideband design at about 15 MHz is capable of about 8 MHz breaking and 20 MHz imaging. High bandwidth transducer design, such as by using multiple matching layers, for example, as known to those skilled in the art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 12</figref>, for example, the catheter transducer may also include a continuous hollow port down which drug coated contrast is flushed during use. In this way, a stream of active contrast is emitted into the field of view of the transducer as shown schematically. (In clinical use, the blood flow in the coronaries is in the &#x201c;right&#x201d; direction&#x2014;i.e. blood flow is moving in the distal orientation.).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Notice also that other formats of drug media delivery are possible. For example: free dissolved (e.g. alcohol) rapamycin (or other drug) may be transferred side by side with plain contrast microbubbles down the hollow port. As indicated in Price's 1998 Circulation paper (&#x201c;Delivery of colloidal particles and red blood cells to tissue through microvessel ruptures created by targeted microbubble destruction with ultrasound&#x201d; Vol. 98, No 13, pp 1264-1267), local bubble breakage enables delivery of colloidal material (including potential drug in dissolved or undissolved form) across microcirculatory vessel walls. Bubble could be injected intravenously and dissolved rapamycin may be injected via the catheter port.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Normally lipid based bubbles are used. Other shell materials may be used&#x2014;such as albumen-based or polymer-based shelled bubbles. Bubbles with these shell materials are known in the field.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In Vitro Radiation Force Enhanced Molecular Targeted Ultrasound</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A problem encountered when using intravascular injected targeted contrast agent is that, except in very small vessels, only a very small fraction of the injected material will be sufficient close (&#x3c;1 &#x3bc;m) to have even a remote chance to form the intended molecular bond between ligand and receptor. In vitro studies of targeted microbubble adhesion on substrates of P-selectin have reported that only a small percentage of the perfused microbubbles were specifically retained under physiological flow conditions [e.g., Klibanov[33]]. Although detection of single microbubbles is possible [34], low efficiency of microbubble targeting requires a larger administered dose of microbubbles than would otherwise be required. Microbubbles exhibit rheological behavior similar to that of erythrocytes [35] and tend to migrate towards the center of the blood vessel. As most endothelial proteins extend only nanometers [36] from the endothelium, it is unlikely that many of the microbubbles flowing through the targeted vasculature come into contact with the intended molecular target. Microbubble attachment efficiency can be increased by moving circulating microbubbles into contact with the vessel wall, thus increasing the frequency of microbubble: target adhesive events. Dayton [37] and others [38] previously hypothesized that microbubble adhesion to the vascular endothelium may be enhanced by using ultrasound radiation forces to propel freely flowing microbubbles towards the vessel wall. Adhesion of microbubbles [39] and acoustically active liposomes [40] under applied acoustic pressure in an avidin: biotin model system has been examined, and adhesion of targeted microbubbles to cultured endothelial cells has been reported [39].</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Acoustic radiation traveling through a continuous media produces a pressure gradient, which is experienced as a directional force by compressible bubbles in the acoustic field. Two components of this radiation force have been described: a primary force, which is directed away from the source, and a secondary force, which is typically attractive between ultrasound contrast microbubbles [41]. The behavior of single, free-stream microbubbles exposed to acoustic radiation has previously been examined rigorously [37, 41, 42]. Derivations of the magnitude of both primary and secondary forces in the linear range were presented by Dayton [37], assuming a low duty factor, a constant magnitude of pressure in each applied pulse, and a unidirectional pressure gradient. The primary radiation force is proportional to the negative time-averaged product of the microbubble volume and the spatial pressure gradient. For a microbubble driven at resonant frequency, assuming small-amplitude oscillations, the magnitude of the primary radiation force is defined by</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Targeting these microbubbles to P-selectin was achieved by conjugating the anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody (mAb) Rb.40.34 [43] to the distal tips of PEG chains via a streptavidin link, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The preparation of the targeted microbubbles used in this experiment has been described in depth elsewhere [31, 44]. Trace amount (&#x3c;1% of total lipid mass) of Da lipid dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) was used as a fluorescence probe for epi-illumination microscopy. Microbubbles were conjugated to the targeting ligand the day of the experiment, and were stored on ice in C4F10-saturated Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline Solution (DPBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Microbubble size distribution and concentration was determined with a Coulter counter (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, Fla.).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A 2.25 MHz, 0.5&#x2033; diameter, 0.8&#x2033; focal depth ultrasound transducer (Panametrics V306, Waltham, Mass.) was used in this study. At a Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) of 10 kHz, 40 sinusoidal cycles at a frequency of 2.0 MHz were applied. Microbubbles were insonated at acoustic pressures between 24.5 and 170 kPa. Upon cessation of insonation, 10 optical fields along a P-selectin coated microcapillary within the width of the applied ultrasound beam were observed and recorded. Alternatively, some flow chambers were exposed to 2 minutes of flow alone, without insonation, in order to assess microbubble binding in the absence of applied radiation force. The number of adherent microbubbles in each of 10 fields of view following insonation was determined off-line. Microbubbles aggregates projecting normal to the optical plane (downward into the flow stream) were counted as a single bubble. Microbubble aggregation was assessed by counting the number of contiguous microbubbles adherent in the optical plane. Each flow chamber was used for a single experiment. Statistical significance was tested with a Student's t-test. We observed negligible binding of targeted microbubbles to casein-coated (i.e. control) microcapillaries both with and without the application of radiation force, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. We observed a statistically significant (p&#x3c;0.05) increase in specific microbubble adhesion to P-selectin due to applied radiation forces at each of the microbubble concentrations examined. Applied radiation force increased targeted microbubble adhesion to P-selectin coated microcapillaries 16-fold at 75.times.10.sup.6 B.sup.-ml.sup.-1 and over 60-fold at 0.25.times.10.sup.6 B.sup.-ml.sup.-1 (or other sizes, volumes and ranges as required or desired).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Imaging of adherent microbubbles in flow chambers was also performed using 14 MHz ultrasound imaging (e.g., on a Siemens Sequoia or similar clinical scanner). Microbubbles were infused into the flow chamber as described above and exposed to 1 minute of flow alone at the indicated shear rate, followed by one minute of insonation at 122 kPa or 1 additional minute of flow only. It has also been determined that microbubbles attached to the target substrate by acoustic radiation force remain viable for ultrasound imaging. We observed no adherent microbubbles and received no ultrasound signal in microcapillaries infused with buffer alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(A)</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(D)</figref>). A contrast signal is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(E)</figref>, which shows an ultrasound image of a microcapillary infused with 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>B/ml for 2 minutes in the absence of acoustic pressure then flushed with buffer. A representative fluorescence microscopy field of view in this capillary is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(C)</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(B)</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(C)</figref> shows a representative optical field of view from a microcapillary infused with 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>bubbles/ml exposed to 1 minute of flow only, 1 minute of insonation at 122 kPa and then saline flushed, in which extensive microbubble accumulation is evident. The corresponding echo shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(F)</figref> is very strong. This suggests that the microbubbles targeted by means of radiation force at an acoustic pressure of 122 kPa remain intact and echogenic.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Single Element Transducer (Typically Non Imaging Capable).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Our preliminary data provided promising early results using a simple, axisymmetrically focused, single element transducer. What is required is a dual function (low frequency bubble &#x201c;busting&#x201d; plus high frequency imaging) transducer and associated instrumentation.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Transducer Array (Typically Imaging Capable).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">An exemplary design may comprise 1:3 composite piezoceramic&#x2014;epoxy active layers stacked one over the other. (A &#x201c;1:3&#x201d; composite comprises piezoelectric ceramic posts embedded in a polymer matrix&#x2014;i.e. the two components are electrically and mechanically in &#x201c;parallel&#x201d;. The 1:3 configuration is the dominant composite configuration and is in widespread commercial use.). The composite material possesses approximate 50% ceramic volume fraction and possesses an acoustic impedance of approximately 15 MRayl. A dense, tungsten particle filled, backing block is used. A thin matching layer, approximately quarter wavelength matched for 12 MHz operation, is used over the top. A conventional filled silicone rubber lens will be used to obtain an elevation focus. The elevational focal depth is approximately 15 mm. Specifically, we use approximately 12 MHz B-Mode imaging resulting in &#x3c;200 &#x3bc;m lateral resolution and axial resolution. At this frequency, <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="3.13mm" wi="1.78mm" file="US08622911-20140107-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> is 125 &#x3bc;m. Consequently, for practical f#'s, (i.e. 1-2) a 200 &#x3bc;m resolution is feasible. An array system provides more than sufficient scanning frame rate (&#x3e;100 frames/s for selected small fields of view&#x2014;e.g. 15 mm&#xd7;15 mm). Focused ultrasound delivery is delivered at 1-2 MHz. We are able to control the region over which a therapeutic effect is obtained to approximately 3&#x3bb;&#x2014;i.e. approximately a 2 mm spot size.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">An objective is to provide anatomic B-Mode imaging capability, bubble specific imaging and application of bubble fracture pulses under user control. The anatomic B-Mode imaging are accomplished using standard B-Mode image formation techniques&#x2014;i.e. optimized aperture apodization, fixed focus transmit, dynamic receive focusing, signal detection and scan conversion. Bubble specific imaging will be provided by using &#x201c;Pulse Inversion&#x201d; (PI)[45]&#x2014;i.e. 1, &#x2212;1 transmit polarity/amplitude; followed by &#x201c;1&#x201d;+&#x201c;&#x2212;1&#x201d; processing to eliminate the linear component). If necessary other bubble specific techniques such as amplitude scaling (i.e. 1,2 transmit polarity/amplitude; followed by (2&#xd7;&#x201c;1&#x201d;)&#x2014;&#x201c;2&#x201d; processing [46]) and the combination of PI and amplitude scaling (e.g. &#x2212;1, 2, &#x2212;1 transmit polarity/amplitude; followed by &#x201c;&#x2212;1&#x201d;+&#x201c;2&#x201d;+&#x201c;&#x2212;1&#x201d; processing [47]).</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Bubble Making and Rapamycin Incorporation.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Microbubbles are prepared by self-assembly of a lipid monolayer during the ultrasonic dispersion of decafluorobutane gas in the aqueous micellar mixture of phosphatidylcholine and PEG stearate (2 mg/ml) with rapamycin (0.2 mg/ml) and/or a trace amount of a fluorescent dye DiI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), similarly to the procedure described earlier [48]. In some instances, membrane thickening is achieved by addition of glycerol trioleate (thicker microbubble shell will harbor increased amounts of rapamycin) [49]. Free lipid, dye and rapamycin, not incorporated in the bubble shell is removed by sequential (3&#xd7;) centrifugal flotation (100&#xd7;g, 5 min), with the recycling of the first wash to save reagents.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Robust and sensitive high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedures are described in the literature for clinical assays. We have HPLC available in our laboratory and will implement such a procedure [50]. Briefly, the sample being tested (microbubbles or media) is lyophilized and redissolved in chlorobutanol, centrifuged to remove sediment; samples placed in the autosampler vials and HPLC performed with UV detection against a calibration curve with a known amount of rapamycin.</p>

We will destroy bubbles by ultrasound in the conditions described for the cell culture study, remove the microbubble particles from OptiCell and subject them to centrifugal flotation to prove that residual microbubbles (if present) will be removed from the samples. We will then perform rapamycin quantitation in the bubble-free infranatant by HPLC technique as described above.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Coupling of anti-VCAM-1 antibody to microbubble surface is performed by streptavidin coupling technique as described [44]. Briefly, during the preparation of microbubbles, 2 mol % of biotin-PEG3400-phosphatidylethanolamine is added to the lipid mixture. A streptavidin bridge technique is applied for biotinylated anti-VCAM-1 antibody coupling to the microbubble surface as described earlier for other antibodies [33, 51]. Biotinylation of antibody molecule is performed with biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide ester reagent at pH 7.5 in DPBS buffer. The degree of antibody biotinylation is tested using the HABA assay as described previously [e.g., Klibanov [33]]. By the adjustment of the antibody-to-biotin-NHS, an incubation ratio coupling of &#x2dc;1 biotin per antibody will be achieved. The ELISA test on VCAM-1 antigen is used to confirm that biotinylation does not inactivate the antibody. Streptavidin-bubbles (10<sup>9</sup>/ml) are incubated with biotinylated antibody on ice for 30 min; free antibody are removed from the bubbles by triple centrifugal flotation wash with degassed DPBS buffer in a bucket-rotor centrifuge (100&#xd7;g, 5 min). After repeated flotations, the mean size of antibody-coated bubbles is normally &#x2dc;2.5 um, with &#x3e;99% of the particles less than 8 um (particle size and concentration are evaluated with a Coulter Multisizer IIe instrument (Beckman Coulter, Miami, Fla.). The amount of attached antibody per bubble is tested by fluorescence spectroscopy labeling as described earlier; typically, &#x2dc;10<sup>5 </sup>antibody molecules per microbubble are attached by this technique [51].</p>

An example would be, but not limited, to a G/C mutation in the SM22a promoter which renders the promoter active in all smooth muscle cell phenotypes [e.g., Wamhoff et al, Circ Res, 2004]. Genes under control of a tissue selective promoter include but are not limited to anti-proliferative genes such p21, p53, KLF4 and proliferative genes such as PCNA.
