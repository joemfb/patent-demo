<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a silicone (meth)acrylamide monomer with a straight chain siloxanyl group and preferably with a hydroxyl group in a molecule. A polymer obtained by polymerizing this monomer is suitable for use in various medical implements such as ophthalmic lenses, endoscopes, catheters, transfusion tubes, gas transport tubes, stents, sheaths, cuffs, tube connectors, access ports, drainage bags, blood circuits, wound covering material, and various types of medicine carriers, but is particularly suitable for contact lenses, ophthalmic lenses, and artificial corneas.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, silicone hydrogels obtained by copolymerizing a silicone monomer, a hydrophilic monomer, and a cross-linking agent monomer have become known as materials for contact lenses that are used for continuous wear. Patent document 1 discloses silicone acrylamide monomers expressed by the following formulas (x1) and (x2) as suitable for use in making silicone hydrogels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="53.51mm" wi="103.89mm" file="US08623934-20140107-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the silicone region of the silicone acrylamide monomer shown in patent document 1 is a branched siloxanyl group, so polymers obtained by polymerizing these monomers may have inferior shape recovery properties. Herein, branched refers to a condition where the Si&#x2014;(O&#x2014;Si)<sub>x </sub>bond (where x is an integer 1 or higher) beginning at the silicon atom that is bonded to the carbon backbone of the molecule is not a continuous single strand. Therefore, if a straight chain siloxanyl group is used, hydrophobicity will be increased and there is a concern that compatibility with hydrophilic substances will be inferior.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Acrylamide monomers account for the majority of the composition that is used in the silicone acrylamide monomer disclosed in patent document 2, and a higher polymerization rate for the entire system is anticipated. However, the silicone region of these monomers also has a branched siloxanyl group, so polymers obtained by polymerizing these monomers display inferior shape recovery. Furthermore, the amido bond of the acrylamide group has high hydrophilicity, and therefore providing a transparent lens may be difficult from the perspective of achieving both a sufficient amount of silicone component to provide high oxygen permeability and providing sufficient water content to provide flexibility to the lens. In particular, achieving a transparent lens is especially difficult if an internal wetting agent is added in order to increase the wettability of the surface.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">The present invention contains the silicone (meth)acrylamide monomer of the present invention and therefore can provide a silicone hydrogel with a high acrylamide monomer content, that is transparent, and that has an excellent balance between water content and wettability. The polymer obtained by polymerizing this silicone hydrogel is suitably used for various types of medical implements, particularly for ophthalmic lenses such as contact lenses, intraocular lenses, and artificial cornea, and especially for contact lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">A silicone (meth)acrylamide monomer of the present invention has a (meth)acrylamide group and a straight chain siloxanyl group in a molecule, and preferably has at least one hydroxyl group in a molecule. A siloxanyl group refers to a group having at least one Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Si bond, &#x201c;straight chain&#x201d; refers to a structure where a bond is formed in a single line beginning with a silicon atom that is bonded to an alkyl group which has a (meth)acrylamide group, or in other words a silicone (meth)acrylamide monomer having a straight chain siloxanyl group refers to a structure expressed by the following general formula (p)</p>

In formula (p), R<sup>p </sup>represents an alkyl group with a (meth)acrylamide group. R<sup>a </sup>through R<sup>g </sup>represent groups that do not contain a silicon atom. x represents an integer 2 or higher. Unlike the silicone (meth)acrylamides of the present invention, silicone (meth)acrylamides of the prior art contained at least a portion of the silicone in a pendant chain. In formula (p), x represents an integer 2 or higher, and if x is too small, sufficient oxygen permeability will not be achieved, but if too large, compatibility with the hydrophilic monomer will decrease, and achieving a transparent lens will be more difficult. Therefore, in some embodiments, x is a value between 3 and 7, between 3 and 6, and between 3 and 5. Furthermore, preferably x does not have a distribution in order to increase a reproducibility of the physical properties of the polymer obtained. For the present invention, the phrase &#x201c;does not have a distribution&#x201d; indicates a condition wherein various peaks for different values of x, a ratio of the largest peak is 80% or higher, as measured by GC for the case of a monomer that can be measured using gas chromatography (GC) (FID analyzer), or as measured by liquid chromatography (LC) (RI analyzer) for the case of a monomer has such high boiling point that cannot be measured using GC.

<p id="p-0018" num="0018">Furthermore, in this specification, (meth)acryl refers to acryl and methacryl and (meth)acrylamide refers to acrylamide and methacrylamide.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">The silicone (meth)acrylamide monomer of the present invention without hydroxyl group includes the monomer expressed by the following formulae (s1), (s5) and (s6);</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">Of these monomers, the monomers expressed by the formulae (s5) and (s6) are more preferable from the perspective of low modulus of the silicone hydrogel obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">With the present invention, there is concern that a hydrophobicity will increase and a compatibility with hydrophilic substances will be inferior if the monomer contains a straight chain siloxanyl group, but a hydrophilicity can be increased by having an amido bond and a hydroxyl group. However, if a number of hydroxyl groups is too high, an elastic modulus of the polymer will be undesirably high and therefore the number of hydroxyl groups per monomer unit is in one embodiment between 1 and 6, and in another between 1 and 3, further 1 or 2, and, where wettability (low contact angles) of the polymer obtained is particularly important, 2.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">Furthermore, if a branched siloxanyl group is present in addition to the straight chain siloxanyl group, the hydrophobicity may be undesirably high. Therefore, in one embodiment a branched siloxanyl group is present in an amount less than about 15 weight % based upon the polymerization components, and in other embodiments a branched siloxanyl group is not present.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">The silicone (meth)acrylamide monomer of the present invention has a (meth)acrylamide group as a polymeric group in order to increase a polymerization rate, and therefore an increased polymerization rate can be anticipated. When an acrylamide monomer is used as a hydrophilic substance, this effect is particularly prominent. This increase in polymerization rate decreases the cure time needed to complete the polymerization and yield the final material. Of acrylamide groups and methacrylamide groups, acrylamide groups are preferable from a perspective of further increasing the polymerization rate. As described above, ensuring transparency is difficult if an amide group is present, but if a hydroxyl group is present, a drop in the transparency due to the presence of an amide group can be prevented. The details are unclear, but it is thought that in addition to acting as a compatibilizer, the hydroxyl group also acts to increase wettability.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">An example of a preferable structure of the silicone (meth)acrylamide monomer of the present invention with at least one hydroxyl group is the monomer expressed by the following general formula (a).</p>

The mold is made from plastic, glass, ceramic, metal, or the like, but for the case of photo polymerization, an optically transparent material is used, and normally plastic or glass is used. When manufacturing the polymer, a space is formed by two counterfacing molds, and the monomer composition is injected into the space. Next, the mold with the space filled with the monomer composition is irradiated with an activating light such as ultraviolet light, visible light or a combination thereof, or placed in an oven or bath and heated to polymerize the monomer. It is also possible to use both methods, by thermal polymerization after photopolymerization or conversely by using photopolymerization after thermal polymerization. For the case of photopolymerization, generally a light containing a high level of light from a light source, such as a mercury lamp or a fluorescent lamp for example, is irradiated for a short period of time (normally 1 hour or less). When performing thermal polymerization, conditions where the temperature is gradually increased from near room temperature to a high temperature of between about 60&#xb0; C. and about 200&#xb0; C. over the course of several hours to several tens of hours is preferable in order to maintain the optical consistency and quality of the polymer and to increase the reproducibility.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">The polymer of the present invention can optionally be modified by various methods. If the application is an ophthalmic lens, and a hydrophilic polymer is not internally included, a modification process may be performed in order to improve the wetting properties of the lens.</p>

Of these modification means, base treatments and acid treatments are preferable because they are simple.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">Examples of a base treatment or acid treatment include a method of bringing a molded part into contact with a basic or acidic solution, or a method of bringing a molded part into contact with a basic or acidic gas. More specific methods include, for example, a method of immersing a molded parts in a basic or acidic solution, a method of spraying a basic or acidic solution or a basic or acidic gas onto a molded parts, a method of applying a basic or acidic solution onto a molded part using a paddle or brush or the like, a method of spin coating a basic or acidic solution onto a molded part, a dip coat method, and the like. The simplest method that provides a large modification affect is a method of immersing a molded part in a basic or acidic solution.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">A temperature range when immersing the polymer in a basic or acidic solution is not particularly restricted, but normally the temperature is within a range between approximately about &#x2212;50&#xb0; C. and about 300&#xb0; C. When considering an ease of work, a temperature range between about &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. and about 150&#xb0; C. is more preferable, and a range between about &#x2212;5&#xb0; C. and about 60&#xb0; C. is most preferable.

Any of the preferred lower limit values and any of the preferred upper limit values can be combined together.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">The optimum time that the polymer is immersed in the basic or acidic solution varies depending on the temperature, but generally 100 hours or less is preferable, 24 hours or less is more preferable, and 12 hours or less is most preferable. If the contact time is too long, not only will the ease of work and the productivity be inferior, but there may also be negative effects such as reducing the oxygen permeability and degrading the mechanical properties.</p>
