<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-114576, filed on Nov. 25, 2009, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Apparatuses and methods consistent with exemplary embodiments relate to a backlight unit (BLU) and a display apparatus, and more particularly, to a BLU which displays an image using backlight radiated from a light emitting module in a display and a display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A liquid crystal display (LCD) panel cannot emit light by itself. Therefore, an LCD panel needs to have a backlight unit which provides backlight to the LCD panel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The backlight unit includes a light emitting unit which generates backlight and a light guide plate which uniformly transmits backlight radiated from the light emitting unit onto a surface of the LCD panel. The light emitting unit includes light emitting elements which are disposed in order to efficiently provide backlight to the LCD panel and a driving element which drives the light emitting elements. An appropriate number of driving elements is provided to drive the light emitting elements without any problems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A light emitting diode (LED) which offers high luminance, a long operating lifespan, and low thermal resistance in comparison with a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) is mainly used as a light emitting element of a BLU. The LED can adjust its luminance using driving current supplied to the LED, and improve cognition and reduce power consumption by adjusting a voltage of a power supply unit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In particular, since the brightness of an LED is proportional to the current supplied thereto, constant current should be supplied to enable each LED to produce uniform luminance, thereby stabilizing the luminance. Accordingly, to stabilize the luminance, each LED has to produce uniform luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order for the LEDs to produce the same luminance, the rated voltage needs to be equal at each LED. However, LEDs show a deviation of the rated voltage according to various factors such as dispersion errors and temperature change. Herein, the rated voltage is a forwarding voltage which is supplied to an LED for normal operation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, there is a need for methods to compensate a deviation of rated voltage of an LED so that LED modules of a BLU produce uniform luminance.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One or more exemplary embodiments address at least the above problems and/or disadvantages and other disadvantages not described above. Also, the exemplary embodiments are not required to overcome the disadvantages described above, and an exemplary embodiment of the may not overcome any of the problems described above.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Exemplary embodiments provide a BLU including a compensation unit which compensates a deviation between the voltage supplied by a power supply unit and the rated voltage of a light emitting unit, and a display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an aspect of an exemplary embodiment, there is provided a display apparatus, including an image processing unit which processes a signal of an input image; a display panel which displays the image of the processed signal; and a BLU which provides backlight to the display panel, wherein the backlight unit comprises a power supply unit; a light emitting unit of which an end is connected to the power supply unit, and which receives a first voltage from the power supply unit; and a compensation unit of which an end is connected to an opposite end of the light emitting unit, and which compensates a deviation between the first voltage and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The compensation unit may calculate the deviation between the first voltage and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit, and compensate the deviation between the first voltage and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit by maintaining the voltage of the compensation unit at the calculated voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An opposite end of the compensation unit may be connected to the power supply unit, and supply an excess current to the power supply unit corresponding to the deviation between the first voltage and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The compensation unit may include a capacitor which includes an end connected to the opposite end of the light emitting unit and an opposite end connected to ground; an inductor which includes an end connected to the capacitor and an opposite end connected to a switch; a switch which is connected to the inductor, and is turned on or off to adjust the voltage of the capacitor; and a controller which controls the switch to control the voltage of the capacitor in order to compensate the deviation between the first voltage and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">If the voltage of the capacitor is higher than a first threshold, the controller may control the switch to turn on, and if the voltage of the capacitor is lower than a second threshold, the controller may control the switch to turn off.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The controller may control the switch to turn on and off repeatedly in order to maintain the voltage supplied to the capacitor at a constant level.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inductance of the inductor, the capacitance of the capacitor, and the rated power of the switch may be determined by the deviation between the first voltage and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The compensation unit may further include a diode which comprises an end connected to the power supply unit and an opposite end connected between the switch and the inductor, and supply an excess current to the power supply unit corresponding to the deviation between the first voltage and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The compensation unit may be fabricated on an integrated circuit (IC).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another aspect of an exemplary embodiment, there is provided a backlight unit, including a power supply unit; a light emitting unit of which an end is connected to the power supply unit, and which receives a first voltage from the power supply unit; and a compensation unit of which an end is connected to an opposite end of the light emitting unit, and which compensates a deviation between the first voltage and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The image input unit <b>110</b> includes an interface (not shown) to be communicably linked to an external device, or an external system in a wired or wireless manner and receives an image from the external device or the external system. The image input unit <b>110</b> transmits the input image to the image processing unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The image processing unit <b>120</b> processes an image signal to be a proper format for the LCD panel <b>140</b> which will be explained later, and generates a brightness controlling signal which controls the brightness of the BLU <b>130</b>. The image processing unit <b>120</b> processes a signal using video decoding, video scaling, and frame rate conversion (FRC) so that an input image is displayed, and then transmits the signal to the BLU <b>130</b> and the LCD panel <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The BLU <b>130</b> receives the signal generated by the image processing unit <b>120</b>, drives light emitting units <b>220</b>, and emits backlight to the LCD panel <b>140</b>. The backlight unit <b>130</b> includes a circuit which drives the light emitting units <b>220</b> to emit backlight.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The backlight emitted by the light emitting units <b>220</b> enters a light guide plate, and the backlight passes through the light guide plate to the LCD panel <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The LCD panel <b>140</b> adjusts transmittance of the backlight produced by the BLU <b>130</b> to visualize an image signal, and displays an image on a screen. The LCD panel <b>140</b> includes two substrates on which electrodes are disposed facing each other, and a liquid crystal material interposed between the two substrates. If voltage is applied to the two electrodes, an electric field is formed on the substrates and thus causes molecules of the liquid crystal material interposed between the two substrates to move, thereby adjusting the transmittance of the backlight.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A backlight unit according to an exemplary embodiment will be explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a circuit which drives light emitting modules in an LCD apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the circuit which drives the light emitting units <b>220</b> according to an exemplary embodiment includes a power supply unit <b>210</b>, the light emitting units <b>220</b>, and a compensation unit <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The power supply unit <b>210</b> supplies power to the light emitting units <b>220</b> in order to enable the light emitting units <b>220</b> to operate. If the rated voltage to operate a plurality of light emitting modules included in the light emitting unit <b>220</b> is equal at each light emitting module, the light emitting modules receive the same voltage from the power supply unit <b>210</b>, thereby emitting light having the same luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">However, the plurality of light emitting units <b>220</b> in the LCD apparatus <b>100</b> may not have the same rated voltage due to errors caused by the manufacturing process or temperature changes. Therefore, the power supply unit <b>210</b> supplies a voltage that is higher than a maximum voltage among the rated voltages required by each light emitting unit <b>220</b> so that the plurality of light emitting units <b>220</b> in the LCD apparatus <b>100</b> provide the same luminance. For example, if a first light emitting unit requires a rated voltage of 25V, a second light emitting unit requires a rated voltage of 27V, a third light emitting unit requires a rated voltage of 26V, and a fourth light emitting unit requires a rated voltage of 28V, the power supply unit <b>210</b> supplies power having a voltage equal to or higher than 28V.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The light emitting unit <b>220</b> receives power from the power supply unit <b>210</b>, and emits backlight. The plurality of light emitting units <b>220</b> included in the LCD apparatus <b>100</b> do not require the same rated voltage, but the light emitting units <b>220</b> emit backlight having uniform luminance because the compensation unit <b>230</b> compensates the voltage corresponding to a deviation of the rated voltage of each light emitting unit <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The compensation unit <b>230</b> compensates a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>210</b> and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit <b>220</b>. In more detail, the compensation unit <b>230</b> calculates a voltage corresponding to a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>210</b> and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit <b>220</b>. Based on the calculated voltage, the compensation unit <b>230</b> operates to maintain the compensation unit voltage at the calculated voltage. For instance, if the power supply unit <b>210</b> supplies a voltage of 30V, and the light emitting unit <b>220</b> requires a rated voltage of 28V, the compensation unit <b>230</b> calculates the deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>210</b> and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit <b>220</b> as 2V. The compensation unit <b>230</b> operates to maintain its voltage at 2V so that the rated voltage of 28V is supplied to the light emitting unit <b>220</b> as required. In such a manner, the compensation unit <b>230</b> compensates a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>210</b> and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The compensation unit <b>230</b> is connected to the power supply unit <b>210</b>. The compensation unit <b>230</b> supplies to the power supply unit an excess current corresponding to a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>210</b> and the rated voltage of the light emitting unit <b>220</b>. The excess current is applied to the power supply unit <b>210</b>, thereby increasing the power efficiency of the BLU <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit diagram of the BLU <b>130</b> according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the backlight unit <b>130</b> comprises a power supply unit <b>310</b>, LED modules <b>320</b>, an LED driving unit <b>330</b>, and a compensation unit <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the power supply unit <b>310</b> comprises a first end which is connected to the LED modules <b>320</b> and a second end which is connected to the compensation unit <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The power supply unit <b>310</b> supplies driving power to each LED module <b>320</b> to enable the LED modules <b>320</b> to operate. The power supply unit <b>310</b> provides a higher voltage than the maximum voltage among the rated voltages required by the LED modules <b>320</b> so that the LED modules <b>320</b> in the LCD apparatus <b>100</b> provide luminance of a predetermined level.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each of the LED modules <b>320</b> comprises a first end which is connected to the power supply unit <b>310</b> and a second end which is connected to the LED driving unit <b>330</b>. Each LED modules <b>320</b> in the LCD apparatus <b>100</b> may have a different rated voltage. However, the compensation unit <b>340</b> compensates a deviation of the rated voltage of each LED module <b>320</b>, and thus the plurality of LED modules <b>320</b> may emit backlight having the same luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The LED driving unit <b>330</b> is connected to each of the LED modules <b>320</b> in series to control a constant current of the LED module <b>320</b>. Since the luminance of the LED module <b>320</b> is proportional to the current of the LED module <b>320</b>, current balancing is required. Accordingly, the LCD apparatus <b>100</b> includes the LED driving unit <b>330</b> to supply a stable current to each of the LED modules <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The compensation unit <b>340</b> includes a first end which is connected to the LED driving unit <b>330</b> and a second end which is connected to the second end of the power supply unit <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, the compensation unit <b>340</b> compensates a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>310</b> and the rated voltage of the LED modules <b>320</b>. In more detail, the compensation unit <b>340</b> detects a voltage corresponding to a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>310</b> and the rated voltage of the LED module <b>320</b>. The compensation unit <b>340</b> operates to maintain its voltage at the detected voltage to compensate a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>310</b> and the rated voltage of the LED module <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The compensation unit <b>340</b> supplies to the power supply unit <b>310</b> an excess current corresponding to a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>310</b> and the rated voltage of the LED module <b>320</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a circuit of the BLU <b>130</b> in detail according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the BLU <b>130</b> includes a power supply unit <b>410</b>, LED modules <b>420</b>, an LED driving unit <b>430</b>, and a compensation unit <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The structure and the operation of the power supply unit <b>410</b>, the LED modules <b>420</b>, and the LED driving unit <b>430</b> are identical to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the compensation unit <b>440</b> includes a capacitor <b>441</b>, an inductor <b>442</b>, a switch <b>443</b>, a diode <b>444</b>, and a controller <b>445</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The capacitor <b>441</b> includes a first end which is connected to the LED driving unit <b>430</b> and a second end which is connected to ground. If the power supply unit <b>410</b> starts supplying power, the capacitor <b>441</b> is charged by a current flowing through the LED driving unit <b>430</b>. Therefore, the voltage of the capacitor <b>441</b> is increased while the capacitor <b>441</b> is charged.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The voltage of the capacitor <b>441</b> is increased up to a first threshold voltage, not infinitely. If the voltage of the capacitor <b>441</b> is increased up to the first threshold voltage, the controller <b>445</b> controls the switch <b>443</b> to turn on. If the switch <b>443</b> is turned on, the capacitor <b>441</b> is discharged, and the voltage of the capacitor <b>441</b> is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The voltage of the capacitor <b>441</b> is decreased down to the second threshold voltage. In this case, if the voltage of the capacitor <b>441</b> is decreased down to the second threshold, the controller <b>445</b> controls the switch <b>443</b> to turn off. If the switch is turned off, the capacitor <b>441</b> is charged, and the voltage of the capacitor <b>441</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Accordingly, the repetitive operation of turning on and off the switch <b>443</b> enables the capacitor <b>441</b> to maintain a constant voltage between the first threshold and the second threshold. In particular, the constant voltage of the capacitor <b>441</b> corresponds to a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>410</b> and the rated voltage of the LED module <b>420</b>. Through the above operation, the compensation unit <b>440</b> compensates the deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>410</b> and the rated voltage of the LED module <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The inductor <b>442</b> includes a first end which is connected to the capacitor <b>441</b> and a second end which is connected to the switch <b>443</b>. The inductor <b>442</b> temporarily stores energy while the capacitor <b>441</b> is charged and discharged repeatedly.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The switch <b>443</b> is connected to the second end of the inductor <b>442</b>. As described above, the switch <b>443</b> is turned on and turned off repeatedly to adjust the voltage of the capacitor <b>441</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The diode <b>444</b> includes a first end which is connected to the power supply unit <b>410</b> and a second end which is connected between the switch <b>443</b> and the inductor <b>442</b>. The diode <b>444</b> supplies to the power supply unit <b>410</b> an excess current corresponding to a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>410</b> and the rated voltage of the LED module <b>420</b>. The excess current is applied to the power supply unit <b>410</b>, thereby increasing the power efficiency of the BLU <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The controller <b>445</b> calculates a voltage corresponding to a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>410</b> and the rated voltage of the LED module <b>420</b>. The controller <b>445</b> controls the switch <b>443</b> so that the capacitor <b>441</b> maintains its voltage at the calculated voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Circuit elements of the compensation unit <b>440</b> are determined by a deviation between the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>410</b> and the rated voltage of the LED module <b>420</b>, rather than by the rated voltage of the LED module <b>420</b> alone. For example, if the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>410</b> is 30V and the rated voltage of the LED module <b>420</b> is 28V, the capacitance, the inductance, and the internal voltage of the capacitor <b>441</b>, the inductor <b>442</b>, and the switch <b>443</b> which constitute the compensation unit <b>440</b> are determined depending on the 2V deviation, rather than the 28V of the rated voltage of the LED module <b>420</b> alone.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Accordingly, the price and size of the compensation unit <b>440</b> is reduced compared to a compensation unit in which the circuit elements are determined by the rated voltage of the LED module <b>420</b>. The small size of the compensation unit <b>440</b> makes it possible to fabricate the compensation unit <b>440</b> as an integrated circuit (IC), thereby facilitating slimness of the display apparatus.</p>
