<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a speed change mechanism or transmission, particularly but not exclusively for a motor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The transmission is a very important part in speed change electric vehicles or electric hand tools. The whole speed change system typically represents about half of the production cost; therefore research on the speed change mechanism is always an important item for any company in the electric vehicle or the electric hand tool industry. A good transmission can change the rotational speed ratio according to different requirements. For use in an eclectic vehicle such as an electric bike, the transmission can be used to change the speed ratio so as to achieve the objective of an appropriate rotational speed or torque for the rider in different conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Planetary gear sets are commonly used in the transmission of an electric vehicle. A planetary internal transmission uses a planetary gear train as the principal part of a speed change mechanism which is typically installed in a gear housing of a rear wheel of the vehicle. A planetary internal transmission achieves different rotational speed ratios by changing the gear ratio of the planetary gear train through different input parts, output parts and fixed parts.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of a planetary gear train as the principal part of a speed change mechanism in an internal transmission has the following advantages. First, the volume is small and the structure is precise, and there is little limitation to the narrow installation and usage space of the rear wheel hub. Second, the gearshift process works stably. When used in a vehicle in which the rear wheel is driven by a chain, there is no requirement for the chain to be moved to engage with different chain wheels to change a gear ratio, thus the drawback of chain separation is effectively improved, and the transmission efficiency is increased. Third, the speed change mechanism is protected by the external housing of the wheel hub and is not affected by the external environment, thus the usage lifetime is increased. Fourth, the speed change mechanism is installed inside the wheel hub, and there is not as much noise as an external transmission produces during the gearshift process.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the transmission principle of the planetary gear train working as a transmission, the sun gear, planet pinion and ring gear each have a respective gear shaft and these three gears spin around one another. In different gear ratios, one of the three gear shafts is fixed and does not spin, another is a driving shaft, and still another is an output shaft. Different combinations result in different gear ratios needed when reducing, increasing and/or reversing the rotational speed. Six possible combination conditions are shown in Table 1 below.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, the present invention has been developed using the planetary gear train as the core for a speed change mechanism for use especially with wheeled or electric vehicles. Additionally, environmental issues have significantly promoted the use of electric bicycles and vehicles in recent years. Most electric bicycles and vehicles in use today are equipped with internal transmissions. Thus, internal transmissions have gradually become the research key point of large scale vehicle manufacturers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Whilst the invention has particular application for use with electrically propelled vehicles such as electric bicycles, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to this field but can find applications in other fields where there is a requirement for a speed change mechanism.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an objective to provide a speed change mechanism which overcomes, or at least mitigates, some or all of the limitations of the known speed change mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One objective of the present invention is to provide a speed change mechanism composed of a plurality of planetary gear sets and which can be used in combination with a motor having an output that can be driven clockwise and counter-clockwise to achieve the objective of changing the reduction ratio to constitute a multi-stage gearshift and speed change.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a speed change mechanism, comprising:</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Various aspects of a motor speed change mechanism in accordance with the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed description of preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the following description, the same reference numerals will be used to denote the same features or features that perform the same basic function in each of the embodiments described.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a speed change mechanism <b>1</b> comprises: a power input <b>2</b>, a first planetary gear set <b>11</b>, a second planetary gear set <b>12</b>, a third planetary gear set <b>13</b>, a sleeve ring <b>14</b>, and an electric clutch <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first planetary gear set <b>11</b> further comprises: a first sun gear <b>111</b>, a plurality of first planet pinions <b>112</b>, a first carrier arm <b>113</b> and a first ring gear <b>114</b>. The second planetary gear set <b>12</b> further comprises: a second sun gear <b>121</b>, a plurality of second planet pinions <b>122</b>, a second carrier arm <b>123</b> and a second ring gear <b>124</b>. The third planetary gear set <b>13</b> comprises: a third sun gear <b>131</b>, a plurality of third planet pinions <b>132</b>, a third carrier arm <b>133</b> and a third ring gear <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first planetary gear set <b>11</b>, the second planetary gear set <b>12</b> and the third planetary set <b>13</b> are so-called planetary gears sets which can also referred to as an &#x201c;Epicyclic Gear Reducer&#x201d; or &#x201c;Planetary Gear Reducer&#x201d; on the market where used to effect a speed reduction. In the above-mentioned planetary gear reducer mechanism, the gear at the centre is called the &#x201c;sun gear&#x201d;, which refers to the first, the second and the third sun gears <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> and <b>131</b>. The outermost gear is called the &#x201c;ring gear&#x201d;, which refers to the first, the second and the third ring gears <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> and <b>134</b>. Gears that rotate around the first, the second and the third sun gears <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> and <b>131</b> respectively are called the &#x201c;planet pinions&#x201d;, which refer to the first, the second and the third planet pinions <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first, the second and the third planet pinions <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>132</b> of the first, the second and the third planetary gear sets <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> are typically arranged in groups of three of four. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the gear sets has three planet pinions <b>112</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>132</b>, but the number of planet pinions can be varied as desired in any particular application. Carrier arms namely the first, the second and the third carrier arms <b>113</b>, <b>123</b> and <b>133</b> keep the first, the second and the third planet pinions <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>132</b> respectively in positions relative to one another. When the first, the second and the third sun gears <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> and <b>131</b> rotate and engage respectively with the first, the second and the third planet pinions <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>132</b>, the rotational directions of the two are different. However, when the first, the second and the third ring gears <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> and <b>134</b> rotate and engage respectively with the first, the second and the third planet pinions <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>132</b>, rotational directions of the two are the same.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The sleeve ring <b>14</b> encircles the first and second planetary gear sets <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and incorporates a power output connection <b>143</b>. The first and second ring gears <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> are drivingly coupled with the sleeve ring <b>14</b> via respective first and second one-way clutch mechanisms <b>141</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>125</b> so that drive can only be transmitted from either of the first and second ring gears <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> to the sleeve ring <b>14</b> when the respective ring gear <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> is rotating in a first rotary direction (clockwise as shown). The power output connection <b>143</b> is coupled with the third sun gear <b>131</b> of the third planetary gear set <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each of the first and second one-way clutches comprises an array of ratchet teeth <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> formed about the inner circumference of the sleeve ring <b>14</b> and a ratchet pawl <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> located on the outer diameter of the respective ring gear <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> for engagement with the ratchet teeth. Since both one-way clutches are operative in the same direction, the ratchet teeth <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> can be formed as single array in a Monocoque type construction as shown for ease of manufacture. However, two separate arrays of teeth could be provided. The ratchet pawls <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> are sprung loaded to protrude from the outer diameter of their respective ring gear <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> so as to engage with a steep face of one of the ratchet teeth to transmit drive to the sleeve ring <b>14</b> when the respective ring gear <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> is rotated in a first direction only (clockwise as shown). When a ring gear <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> is rotated in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise as shown), its pawl <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> rides over the shallow faces of the ratchet teeth <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> and is depressed into the ring gear against the spring bias so that no drive is transmitted. Each ring gear <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> can have more than one ratchet pawl <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first and the second one-way clutch mechanisms in the present embodiment are ratchets or ratchet devices that are operative in the same direction but any suitable one way clutch arrangements can be adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first sun gear <b>111</b> of the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> is drivingly coupled with the power input <b>2</b>, and the ring gear <b>114</b> of the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> is drivingly coupled with the second sun gear <b>121</b> of the second planetary gear set <b>12</b>. When the power input <b>2</b> drives the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> inside the sleeve ring <b>14</b>, one of the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> or the second planetary gear set <b>12</b> drives the sleeve ring <b>14</b> to rotate clockwise through the first one-way clutch <b>141</b> or the second one-way clutch <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The third carrier arm <b>133</b> of the third planetary gear set <b>13</b> is connected with a hub shell <b>3</b> through a third one-way clutch <b>16</b>, <b>135</b>. The hub shell <b>3</b> is typically part of a driving wheel of a vehicle. The third one way clutch is similar to first and second one-way clutches and comprises an array of ratchet teeth <b>16</b> formed about the inner surface of the hub sleeve <b>3</b> and a sprung loaded ratchet pawl <b>135</b> on an outer periphery of the third carrier arm <b>133</b> which co-operates with the ratchet teeth <b>16</b> to transmit drive from the third carrier <b>133</b> arm to the hub sleeve <b>3</b> only when the third carrier arm is rotating in a first direction, which is clockwise as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, any suitable one-way clutch arrangement can be used to transmit drive from the third carrier arm <b>133</b> to the hub sleeve <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The electric clutch <b>15</b> is operative to fix the third ring gear to prevent it from rotating and is arranged to operate synchronously with the power input <b>2</b>. The electric clutch may be a solenoid having an actuation rod which is normally biased to a retracted or open position when no power is supplied. When a current is supplied to actuate the solenoid, the rod is moved axially to an extended position. A block <b>151</b> is attached to the rod and engages with the third ring gear <b>134</b> when the solenoid rod is extended to fix the third ring gear and prevent it from rotating. When the solenoid is not actuated and the rod is retracted, the block <b>151</b> does not engage with the third ring gear is free to rotate. It will be appreciated that the direction of movement of the solenoid could be reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A current to actuate the solenoid and fix the third ring gear is supplied when the power input <b>2</b> is operative to power the speed change mechanism but is not supplied when the power input is not driving the transmission. Where the power input <b>2</b> is a DC electric motor, the solenoid may be connected in a circuit with the motor so that a current is inputted to actuate the solenoid whenever the motor is supplied with current to drive the transmission. Alternatively, the solenoid may be actuated by a control system configured to detect when the power input <b>2</b> is driving the speed change mechanism. Because the electric clutch <b>15</b> is an off-the-shelf part and is not the key point of the present invention, unnecessary detail is not given here.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the power input <b>2</b> can be a DC electric motor. By changing the positive and negative electrode direction of the input current, the DC electric motor can be arranged to drive the sun gear <b>111</b> of the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. The power input <b>2</b> simultaneously engages the electric clutch <b>15</b> when in operation to fix the third ring gear <b>134</b>. When the operation of the power input <b>2</b> stops, the electric clutch <b>15</b> releases the third ring gear <b>134</b> so that the third ring gear <b>134</b> can rotate freely, so as to prevent the third carrier arm <b>133</b> connected with the hub shell <b>3</b> from causing gears inside the third planetary gear set <b>13</b> to get stuck due to counter-clockwise rotation. This allows the hub shell to be rotated in either direction relative to the ring sleeve <b>14</b> when the power input <b>2</b> is not driving the speed change mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Regardless of whether the power input <b>2</b> (DC electric motor) rotates the first sun gear clockwise or counter-clockwise, the sleeve ring <b>14</b> is always driven to rotate in the same direction (clockwise as shown) through either the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> or the second planetary gear set <b>12</b>, and further drives the third carrier arm <b>133</b> of the third planetary gear set <b>13</b> to drive the hub shell <b>3</b> at a reduced rotational speed in comparison to the rotational speed of the power input. The hub shell <b>3</b> is also always driven in the same direction regardless of the direction of rotation of the power input.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is the schematic drawing illustrating a first speed reduction mode of the speed change mechanism of the present invention. The dashed line A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents the power transmission path through the speed change mechanism from the power input terminal <b>2</b> when operated in the first speed reduction mode.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the power input terminal <b>2</b> (DC electric motor) rotates clockwise (symbol &#x201c;+&#x201d; represents clockwise rotation and symbol &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; represents counter-clockwise rotation in the following drawing) it drives the first sun gear <b>111</b> of the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> to rotate clockwise and the first planet pinions <b>112</b> engaged with the first sun gear <b>111</b> are driven to rotated in the opposite direction (rotates counter-clockwise).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Because the first carrier arm <b>113</b> is fixed, according to the transmission principle of planetary gear sets, the power outputted from the first sun gear <b>111</b> is transmitted to the first ring gear <b>114</b> through the first planet pinions <b>112</b>, due to the engagement of the first ring gear <b>114</b> and the first planet pinions <b>112</b>. As a result, the first ring gear <b>114</b> and the first planet pinions <b>112</b> are both driven counter-clockwise (rotate counter-clockwise).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Because the first ring gear <b>114</b> is rotating counter-clockwise, the pawl <b>115</b> disposed outside the first ring gear <b>114</b> cannot drivingly engage with the ratchet teeth <b>141</b> inside the sleeve ring <b>14</b> so that the first one-way clutch idles (the symbol &#x201c;x&#x201d; represents ineffective power transmission), that is to say, power from the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> cannot be transmitted to the sleeve ring <b>14</b> through the first one-way clutch <b>115</b>, <b>141</b>. The first ring gear <b>114</b> is connected coaxially with the second sun gear <b>121</b> of the second planetary gear set <b>12</b> through a coaxial shaft <b>17</b> (please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), so that the second sun gear <b>121</b> is driven to rotate counter-clockwise in the same direction as the first ring gear. Thus drive from the power input <b>2</b> is transmitted directly to the second planetary gear set <b>12</b> through the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> after a first speed reduction step.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Power from the second sun gear <b>121</b>, which is rotating counter-clockwise, is transmitted to the second planet pinions <b>122</b> which are driven in the opposite direction to the second sun gear to rotate clockwise. Because the second planet pinions <b>122</b> are fixed through the second carrier arm <b>123</b>, according to the transmission principle of planetary gears, drive from the second sun gear <b>121</b> is transmitted to the second ring gear <b>124</b> through the second planet pinions <b>122</b>, due to the engagement of the second ring gear <b>124</b> and the second planet pinions <b>122</b>. Therefore, the second ring gear <b>124</b> and the second planet pinion <b>122</b> are both driven to rotate clockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">With the second ring gear <b>124</b> rotating in a clockwise direction, the second ratchet pawl <b>125</b> disposed outside the second ring gear <b>124</b> engages the steep face of one of the ratchet teeth <b>142</b> inside the sleeve ring <b>14</b> to transmit drive to the sleeve ring and rotate the sleeve ring in a clockwise direction. That is to say, power from the second planetary gear set <b>12</b> is transmitted to the sleeve ring <b>14</b> through the second one-way clutch <b>125</b>, <b>142</b>. The resultant rotational movement of the sleeve ring <b>14</b> is transmitted to the third sun gear <b>131</b> of the third planetary gear set <b>13</b> through the power output shaft <b>143</b>. With the electronic clutch <b>15</b> engaged to fix the third ring gear <b>134</b>, the third carrier arm <b>133</b> of the third planetary gear set <b>13</b> is caused to rotate clockwise (i.e. in the same direction as the third sun gear) and drive is transmitted to the hub shell <b>3</b> through the third one-way clutch <b>16</b> so that the hub shell <b>3</b> is driven in the same direction as the sleeve ring (clockwise as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the first speed reduction mode, drive is transmitted from the power input through the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> to the second planetary gear set <b>12</b> and through the secondary planetary gear set <b>12</b> to the sleeve ring <b>14</b> and thus undergoes a two stage speed reduction from the power input to the sleeve ring <b>14</b>. The drive is then transmitted from the sleeve ring <b>14</b> to the hub shell <b>3</b> through the third planetary gear set <b>13</b> where it undergoes a further speed reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, in the present embodiment of the present invention, the rotational speed of the power input terminal <b>2</b> (DC motor) is 4000 rpm (revolutions per minute), and the gear teeth numbers of the first, the second and the third planetary gear sets <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> are as shown below:</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The gear teeth number of the first, the second and the third sun gears <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> and <b>131</b> is 25;</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">the gear teeth number of the first, the second and the third planet pinions <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>132</b> is 26; and</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Thereby, in the first speed reduction mode, the original 4000 rpm output of the power input <b>2</b> (DC motor) reduces to 103.35 rpm through the motor speed change mechanism <b>1</b> and outputs to the hub shell <b>3</b>, to achieve the objective of low rotational speed and high torque.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which is the schematic drawing showing a second speed reduction mode of the speed change mechanism of the present invention, wherein the dashed line B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents the power transmission path through the mechanism in the second deceleration mode. In the second speed reduction mode, the power input <b>2</b> namely the DC motor operates counter-clockwise (rotates counter-clockwise) and outputs power (symbol &#x201c;+&#x201d; represents clockwise rotation and symbol &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; represents counter-clockwise rotation in the following drawing) to the first sun gear <b>111</b> of the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> which is driven to rotate counter-clockwise, while the first planet pinions <b>112</b> engaged with the first sun gear <b>111</b> are driven to rotate clockwise</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Because the first carrier arm <b>113</b> is fixed, according to the transmission principle of planetary gears, the power outputted from the first sun gear <b>111</b> is transmitted to the first ring gear <b>114</b> through the first planet pinions <b>112</b>, due to the engagement of the first ring gear <b>114</b> and the first planet pinions <b>112</b>. Therefore, the first ring gear <b>114</b> and the first planet pinion <b>112</b> are both driven to rotate clockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With the first ring gear <b>114</b> rotating in a clockwise direction, the first ratchet pawl <b>115</b> engages with the steep face of one of the ratchet teeth <b>141</b> inside the sleeve ring <b>14</b> to drive the sleeve ring in a clockwise direction (rotate clockwise). Accordingly, power from the input <b>2</b> is transferred to the sleeve ring <b>14</b> from the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> only through the first one-way clutch <b>115</b>, <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The first ring gear <b>114</b> is coupled with the second sun gear <b>121</b> of the second planetary gear set <b>12</b> through the coaxial shaft <b>17</b>, so that the second sun gear <b>121</b> is driven to rotate in the same direction (clockwise as shown) as the first ring gear. Further, because the second carrier arm <b>123</b> is fixed, according to the transmission principle of planetary gears, the power outputted from the second sun gear <b>121</b> is transmitted to the second ring gear <b>124</b> through the second planet pinions <b>122</b>, due to the engagement of the second ring gear <b>124</b> and the second planet pinion <b>122</b>. Therefore, the second ring gear <b>124</b> and the second planet pinion <b>122</b> are both driven to rotate counter-clockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">With the second ring gear <b>124</b> rotating in a counter-clockwise direction, the second ratchet pawl <b>125</b> is unable to drivingly engage the ratchet teeth <b>142</b> inside the sleeve ring <b>14</b>, so that the second one-way clutch <b>125</b>, <b>142</b> idles (the symbol &#x201c;x&#x201d; represents ineffective power transmission). That is to say no power is transmitted to the sleeve ring through the second planetary gear set <b>12</b> through the second one-way clutch <b>125</b>, <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus in the second speed reduction mode, drive is transmitted to the sleeve ring <b>14</b> through the first planetary gear set <b>11</b> only and so undergoes only a single stage speed reduction from the input to the sleeve ring. Drive is then transmitted from the sleeve ring <b>14</b> to the hub shell <b>3</b> through the third planetary gear set <b>13</b> and the third one-way clutch <b>16</b>, where it undergoes a further speed reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the second speed reduction mode of the speed change mechanism <b>1</b> of the present invention, the power input <b>2</b> (DC motor) is provided with a 4000 rpm counter-clockwise input. Reduction ratios of the first, the second and the third planetary gear sets <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> are the same as those in the first speed reduction mode. The power input <b>2</b> (DC motor) rotates counter-clockwise (as shown) to drive the hub shell <b>3</b> with high torque and low rotational speed wherein the output rotational speed rpm of the hub shell <b>3</b> can be calculated as below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>3.08&#xd7;4.08=12.57[the gear reduction ratio accumulated after the first and the third planetary gear sets]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>4000(rpm)[rotational speed of the power input terminal]&#xf7;12.57=318.22(rpm)[rotational speed of the hub]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Thereby, in the second speed reduction mode, the original 4000 rpm output of the power input <b>2</b> (DC motor) reduces to 318.22 rpm through the motor speed change mechanism <b>1</b> and outputs to the hub shell <b>3</b>, to achieve the objective of high rotational speed and low torque.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It can be seen then that the motor speed change mechanism <b>1</b> of the present invention, different speed change ratios are achieved by changing the direction of rotation of the power input <b>2</b>. The appropriate gear (speed change mode) is chosen according to different requirements needed in use of an electric vehicle for starting, climbing and cruising, so that the power input <b>2</b> can have more efficient performance.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Effecting a gear change by changing the direction of rotation of the power input <b>2</b> through the first, the second and the third planetary gear sets <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, is advantageous in that there is no friction generated as is the case with conventional gear box arrangements where it is necessary to actuate a clutch or switch the power path when changing gear. Accordingly, losses due to friction through transmission are reduced, and easy gear selection is provided for users.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In summary, the motor speed change mechanism <b>1</b> of the present invention uses a control system to change the positive and negative electrodes of the input current to the power input (DC motor), so as to change the power input <b>2</b> to rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Depending on the direction of rotation of the power input <b>2</b>, the motor speed change mechanism <b>1</b> provides either a first or a second speed change mode to provide different gear ratios to vary the output speed and torque at the hub.</p>

Furthermore, use of an electric clutch <b>15</b>, or other arrangement, to selectively fix the third ring gear <b>134</b> (or other fixed component) enables the hub shell <b>3</b> to be rotated in a reverse direction without the gear train locking up when power is not being transmitted through the speed change mechanism. This is useful where the speed change mechanism is used in a vehicle such as an electric bicycle where a user may wish to push the bicycle in a reverse direction but adds to the complexity and cost of the mechanism.</p>
