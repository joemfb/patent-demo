<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and methodology that facilitates dynamically determining an end-to-end response of a network prior to the selection of a technology for an application, is provided. Moreover, a user equipment (UE) can perform a proactive latency-based end-to-end technology survey to select appropriate technologies for different applications based in part on application requirements, UE and network infrastructure capabilities, network load, concurrent uses, or other factors as determined by the service provider. The results of the survey can be compared with pre-established criteria, as broadcast by the network operator, to determine a network that can be utilized to support an application at a particular location, or to determine whether fallback to another technology provides better quality and/or efficiency can be performed.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject disclosure relates to wireless communication and, more particularly, to facilitating dynamic and/or proactive selection of a method, technology, and/or access point for a communication session based on real-time end-to-end network conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With advances in mobile communication, wireless network service providers are moving to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and other new technologies to improve the efficiency of their networks and the quality of the service provided to the consumer. Voice calls are extremely susceptible to delay, jitter, and/or other impairments, which can be caused by various network conditions. For example, low capacity, high load, Quality of Service (QoS) settings, or other factors of the network, can negatively affect voice calls.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional user equipment (UE) selects a particular technology for voice calls based on radio conditions surrounding the UE. Moreover, the UE can determine Radio Frequency (RF) signal strength, interference, and/or parameters broadcast in system messages or stored in the UE, to facilitate the selection. Typically, the UE can trigger a carrier frequency scan that can scan a radio environment near/surrounding the UE. The scan receiver can identify surrounding network carriers, and select a carrier/technology for communication based on the RF signal strength. However, this traditional approach of carrier/technology selection, does not guarantee a high quality of service. For example, even though the RF signal strength of the selected carrier/technology can be the highest, the selected carrier can provide a lower-quality service in scenarios wherein the backhaul network performance of the selected carrier/technology is not optimal (e.g., backhaul network is congested, has low bandwidth, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Multi-technology UEs typically have fixed or per-operator adjustable technology preference settings, which leave little or no room for customizable network selection. In fact, the UEs typically prefer new networks over older networks, without knowing which is best suited for the customer and/or desired service. Such features of traditional carrier/technology selection can result in inefficient performance and/or communication quality, and can negatively impact consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above-described deficiencies of today's communications systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified summary of the specification in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification. This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the specification nor delineate any scope particular embodiments of the specification, or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The systems and methods disclosed herein, in one aspect thereof, can facilitate performing a proactive latency based end-to-end technology survey at a user equipment (UE) to survey the available services or technologies in order to differentiate their performance potential and determine which service or technology is appropriate for available applications. In particular, the UE performs a loopback measurement to assess real-time end-to-end network conditions and determines which services can be employed to support an application at a location. In addition, the UE can determine whether fallback to another technology provides better quality or efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the loopback measurement can be performed periodically by the UE to asses whether conditions have changed, necessitating a change in service (between access technologies or transport methodologies) for applications or classes of applications. Additionally or alternately, the UE can perform the loopback measurement prior to placing a voice and/or data call to determine a technology utilized to establish the call. Further, the UE can also perform the loopback measurement, in the background, during a call, data session or other application. In the event that service degradation is determined within the cellular network, the UE can scan available alternate access and transport technologies that provide improved service quality and perform an in-call handover or revised network selection after the in-progress call is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Yet another aspect of the disclosed subject matter relates to a method that can be employed to provide improved service quality for communication associated with a UE. The method includes assessing the ability of each network available to the UE, to deliver a high quality voice and/or data call. Moreover, the condition and/or availability of the backhaul circuits that carry the calls from the base station to the terrestrial telephone network or data network can also be determined. Further, a network that provides the best service quality for a particular call and/or application can be determined based in part on the assessment. Furthermore, communication associated with the UE can be established over the selected network.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following description and the annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects of the specification. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the specification may be employed. Other advantages and novel features of the specification will become apparent from the following detailed description of the specification when considered in conjunction with the drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Multi-technology devices typically have fixed or operator-defined technology preference settings, which generally prefer new networks to all others; without determining which network is best suited for the customer or desired service. Conventionally, technology preferences have been controlled based on RF signal strength, interference, and fixed or operator-defined parameters broadcast in system messages or stored in the user equipment (UE). The systems and methods disclosed herein provide a dynamic per-call and/or per-application based selection of technology. Further, embodiments disclosed herein provide selection of technology based in part on an end-to-end performance of the cellular system prior to call set-up.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Aspects, features, or advantages of the subject innovation can be exploited in substantially any wireless communication technology; e.g., WiFi, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), Enhanced General Packet Radio Service (Enhanced GPRS), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE), Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), or Zigbee. Additionally, substantially all aspects of the subject innovation can be exploited in legacy telecommunication technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there illustrated is an example system <b>100</b> that facilitates delivery of a high-quality communication session, based in part on end-to-end network conditions, such as, but not limited to, available bandwidth, instantaneous load on the serving network, network delay, jitter, etc. Typically, the system <b>100</b> can include a network selection component <b>102</b>, for example, within a UE <b>104</b>, which can be utilized to dynamically identify a preferred domain/technology that can be employed for communication established with/by UE <b>104</b>. Moreover, the domain/technology can be dynamically determined on a per call and/or per application basis.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In particular, next generation networks are moving towards new technologies, for example, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), that utilize packet based communication protocols. Real-time communication, such as, but not limited to voice calls, is extremely susceptible to delay, jitter, and other impairments which may be caused by low capacity, high load, Quality of Service (QoS) settings, or other factors on the network. Conventional UEs that select a particular technology for real-time communication based on radio conditions alone can provide a lower-quality service than an alternate technology call with less optimum radio conditions if backhaul performance is not optimal. In contrast, UE <b>104</b>, disclosed herein, performs a proactive latency-based end-to-end technology survey, to select an appropriate technology for a particular call and/or application.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Typically, UE <b>104</b> can include most any multi technology communication device employed by a subscriber, such as, but not limited to, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a laptop, a personal computer, a media player, a gaming console, and the like. Moreover, the multi-technology UE <b>104</b> can connect to a plurality of networks, including, but not limited to WiFi, WiMAX, LTE, UMTS, HSPA, Bluetooth&#xae;, femto networks, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to one aspect, the UE <b>104</b> can test an end-to-end response of a network, prior to the selection of the service for a particular application. For example, the UE <b>104</b> can utilize any loop back measurement designed to test network latency, throughput, bandwidth, etc. (e.g., a ping signal) prior to establishing a voice call (and/or any other real-time communication session). Based on the test results, the network selection component <b>102</b> can select appropriate technologies for different applications and/or services based on application requirements, UE <b>104</b> and network infrastructure capabilities, network load, concurrent uses, user preferences, or other factors as determined by the service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one aspect, the network selection component <b>102</b> can compare the results of the test with a set of parameters, for example, predefined by the service provider. In another aspect, the UE <b>104</b> can test the response of a plurality of networks and the network selection component <b>102</b> can compare the results of each test to identify a technology for communication. Moreover, the UE <b>104</b> can perform the network test periodically, prior to establishing a call with the UE <b>104</b>, during a call at the UE <b>104</b>, and/or at most any specific time set by the network operator.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">System <b>100</b> can further include a network utilization component <b>106</b> that can employ the selected technology for initiating communication with the UE <b>104</b>. In one aspect, the network utilization component <b>106</b> can be implemented within the UE <b>104</b> and can ensure that communication, such as, but not limited to, voice calls, originating from and/or directed to the UE <b>104</b> can employ the selected technology for communication. For outgoing calls, the UE <b>104</b> can perform the network response test prior to establishing the call, such that the network selection component <b>102</b> can select an appropriate network and the network utilization component <b>106</b> can employ the selected network for the outgoing call. Further, for incoming calls, the network selection component <b>102</b> can select an appropriate network based on the results from the periodic measurement by the UE <b>104</b> and the network utilization component <b>106</b> can employ the selected network for the incoming call.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there illustrated is an example system <b>200</b> that can be employed to dynamically select a communication technology for a particular communication session and/or application, according to an aspect of the subject innovation. In particular, system <b>200</b> initiates communication to/from the UE <b>104</b> by employing the selected communication technology. It can be appreciated that the network selection component <b>102</b> and UE <b>104</b> can include functionality, as more fully described herein, for example, with regard to system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one aspect, system <b>200</b> can include a scheduling component <b>202</b> that can determine when a network response test can be initiated. In one example, the scheduling component <b>202</b> can monitor communication with the UE <b>104</b> and identify when a communication e.g., voice call, gaming session, etc. is initiated, for example by a subscriber (e.g., when the subscriber dials a phone number to place an audio and/or video call). When determined that a communication session, for example, a real-time communication session, is being established, the scheduling component <b>202</b> can initiate a network response test. In another example, the scheduling component <b>202</b> can initiate the network response test periodically (e.g., once every hour, 30 minutes, etc.) and/or at any specific time, for example, set by a network operator and/or subscriber. For example, the scheduling component <b>202</b> can initiate a network response test periodically, when the UE <b>104</b> is camping on a cell to assess whether conditions have changed (for better or for worse), necessitating a change in service (e.g., between access technologies or transport methodologies) for applications or classes of applications. Additionally or alternately, the scheduling component <b>202</b> can also schedule the network response test (e.g., to be performed in the background) during a communication session, for example, on receipt of &#x201c;aged packets&#x201d;, described in detail infra.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to an embodiment, when the scheduling component <b>202</b> initiates a network response test, a testing component <b>204</b> can employ a loop back measurement designed to test network latency, throughput, bandwidth, etc. of a network. For example, when the UE <b>104</b> encounters a new cell in the idle mode, and the scheduling component <b>202</b> identifies a Femtocell, WiFi access point, eNodeB, NodeB and/or other wireless technology used to provide services, the testing component <b>204</b> can launch a &#x201c;ping&#x201d; session between the UE and a ping client co-located with an access controller, a Radio Network Controller (RNC), a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN), or similar core node in order to assess the delay in the network. In another example, during peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, the ping client can also be co-located within a disparate UE. Upon receiving the response from the ping client, the testing component <b>204</b> can receive and/or compute measurements, such as, but not limited to, the Round Trip Time (RTT), jitter, packet loss, noise level, or other metrics determined by the service provider, and deliver the measurements to the network selection component <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Typically, the network selection component <b>102</b> can compare the measurements to a set of pre-established parameters, for example specified by the network operator. Based on the comparison the network selection component <b>102</b> can determine which services can be employed to support an application at a particular location, or whether fallback to another technology provides better quality or efficiency. In one aspect, the UE <b>104</b> can survey all of the available services and/or technologies (e.g., by performing the loop back measurement by employing the testing component <b>204</b>) in order to differentiate the performance potential of the available services and/or technologies and determine which service/technology is appropriate for available applications. Moreover, the network selection component <b>102</b> can select a service/technology that provides the best Quality of Service (QoS) for the available applications at a particular UE location and/or particular time.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, a UE <b>104</b> with an LTE capability can have options of placing a voice call either on the LTE technology, which utilizes Von', or on UMTS technology, which utilizes a circuit switched protocol. Since UEs generally prefer newer technologies, due to their advantages over older technologies, the UE <b>104</b> can initially check the LTE network response and send out a ping (e.g., by employing the testing component <b>204</b>) to verify latency before a call is set up. The network selection component <b>102</b> can analyze the measurements received, for example by comparing with operator-defined parameters. If the latency is within an acceptable range defined by the parameters and/or below a threshold defined by the parameters, the UE <b>104</b> can utilize the LTE network to place the call (e.g., by employing the network utilization component <b>106</b>. However, if the latency (and/or any other measurement is outside the acceptable range (and/or above the threshold) the UE <b>104</b> can change services, e.g. change to a UMTS network; and initiate a circuit switched voice call that can provide better service for the voice call to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one aspect, the system <b>200</b> can also be employed in a reactive mode. For example, if during a call, data session or other application the scheduling component <b>202</b> identifies &#x201c;aged packets&#x201d;, the scheduling component <b>202</b> can determine that a background ping session can be initiated. The testing component <b>204</b> can transmit a ping signal to a ping client at a core node of the communication network to verify whether the aged packets are caused within the communication network. In the event that service degradation is within the communication network, a scan of available alternate access and transport technologies can be conducted by the UE <b>104</b> (e.g. by the testing component <b>204</b>). Further, change of technology on the existing service or an Inter-Radio Access Technology (IRAT) handover can be initiated if the network selection component <b>102</b> determines that the service quality can improve on the new technology. In this example scenario, the UE <b>104</b> can perform an in-call handover or revised network selection after the in-progress call is connected. In another example, when the UE <b>104</b> determines a cell or access point cannot support an application at the appropriate quality, the testing component <b>204</b> can be employed to signal the ping client located at the core node, which can trigger an application layer performance indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example system <b>300</b> that can ascertain an ability of a network to support a high quality real-time communication session, before the communication session is established. Real-time communication sessions can include a voice call, video call, a live gaming session, or most any communication that is typically more sensitive and/or susceptible to jitter and/or latency than a data call (e.g. a best effort data call for browsing). Moreover, system <b>300</b> enables a UE to be aware of jitter/latency conditions in the network before a communication session is established, such that latency/jitter effects, which include, but are not limited to, dropped packets, voice quality issues, delay, difficulty with the conversation due to the delay, can be avoided. Although not shown explicitly, it can be appreciated that the system <b>300</b> can be included within a UE. Further, it can be appreciated that the testing component <b>204</b> and the network selection component <b>102</b> can include functionality, as more fully described herein, for example, with regard to systems <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one aspect, the testing component <b>204</b> can perform an end-to-end network response test to measure factors, such as, but not limited to, latency, jitter, bandwidth, congestion, traffic, throughput, etc. As an example, the testing component <b>204</b> can transmit a ping signal to a ping client within a core network node and/or an end device (e.g., in P2P applications). Typically, the core network node can include, but is not limited to, an access controller, a RNC, a SGSN, a femto gateway (FGW) or the like. Further, the end device can include most any communication device, such as, but not limited to a media player, a digital camera, a media recorder, a laptop, a cell phone, a PDA (personal digital assistant), a personal computers, a printer, a scanner, a digital photo frame, a GPS module, a gaming module, etc. Furthermore, the end device can also include, but is not limited to, most any LTE-based appliances that can employed, for example, in a home, office, building, retail store, restaurant, hotel, factory, warehouse, etc., such as, but not limited to, heating or cooling unit, lighting unit, washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As an example, the ping signal can be transmitted over most any network (e.g., LTE, WiFi, etc.). Specifically, the ping signal can be a two-stage ping, wherein a first ping can be transmitted by the testing component <b>204</b> to establish a bearer and a second ping can be transmitted by employing the bearer to facilitate network response measurement. In response to the ping signal, the testing component <b>204</b> can receive a ping echo, for example, transmitted back from the core network node and/or end device. The network selection component <b>102</b> can calculate metrics, such as, but not limited to, RTT, jitter, packet loss, noise level, etc., based on the ping echo. In one aspect, the network selection component <b>102</b> can determine service success criteria based on a comparison of the metrics with a set of parameters stored in a database <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Moreover, database <b>302</b> can store predefined criteria that facilitate the determination of service success. For example, database <b>302</b> can include application requirements <b>304</b>, user specified parameters <b>306</b> (e.g. user preferences provided by a subscriber), and/or service provider parameters <b>308</b> (e.g. preferences provided by a network operator). In one aspect, the service provider parameters <b>308</b> can be transmitted to the UE, for example, over a macro network, in a broadcast message. Moreover, the network operator can set one or more service provider parameters <b>308</b> and deliver them to UEs that are capable of proactive latency-based end-to-end technology survey and fallback, as part of the normal operations parameters, for example, during provisioning or at any other time. Typically, the network operator can communicate, via the network infrastructure, the survey success criteria for all services and applications that the UE is capable of, for example, based on UE capability, subscribed applications, network technology, and other factors under operator control, in the broadcast message. In one example, the one or more service provider parameters <b>308</b> can be delivered by an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS), when the UE registers on the IMS, as part of a registration process.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one example, the requirements and/or parameters stored in database <b>302</b> can provide acceptable ranges and/or thresholds for one or more measured metrics. The network selection component <b>102</b> can compare the calculated metrics with the information in database <b>302</b> to determine whether the tested network can be utilized for communication, or whether an alternate method, technology, or access point can be chosen to improve service quality. In one aspect, the information in database <b>302</b> can specify a default method, technology, and/or access point that can be chosen by the network selection component <b>102</b>, if the calculated metrics are outside the acceptable ranges and/or thresholds. In another aspect, the testing component <b>204</b> can perform a survey on each available technology and select a method, technology, and/or access point, which provides the best metrics (e.g., highest service quality).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, the network selection component <b>102</b> can identify a method, technology, and/or access point that can be utilized for a particular communication session and/or application. Moreover, utilization of the identified method, technology, and/or access point can improve a customer's perception of the service provided by the network operator, while allowing the network operator to aggressively deploy efficient and robust technologies. By dynamically changing the criteria, for example, service provider parameters <b>308</b>, against which the survey results are compared, the network operator can shift traffic between technologies or services as efficiency, capacity, and/or other network requirements change.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It can be appreciated that the database <b>302</b> can include volatile memory or nonvolatile memory, or can include both volatile and nonvolatile memory. By way of illustration, and not limitation, nonvolatile memory can include read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM), electrically programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), or flash memory. Volatile memory can include random access memory (RAM), which acts as external cache memory. By way of illustration and not limitation, RAM is available in many forms such as static RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM), enhanced SDRAM (ESDRAM), Synchlink DRAM (SLDRAM), and direct Rambus RAM (DRRAM). The memory (e.g., data stores, databases) of the subject systems and methods is intended to comprise, without being limited to, these and any other suitable types of memory.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there illustrated is an example system <b>400</b> that performs an end-to-end technology survey through an infrastructure network, according to an aspect of the subject disclosure. Typically, conventional latency measurement methods cover a portion of the pipe and/or a portion of the path from one point to another but not the entire path end-to-end. In contrast, system <b>400</b> facilitates a dynamic and/or proactive determination of metrics, such as, but not limited to, latency, bandwidth, throughput, jitter, noise, etc. based on an end-to-end technology survey. It can be appreciated that the network selection component <b>102</b>, scheduling component <b>202</b>, testing component <b>204</b>, and UE <b>104</b> can include respective functionality, as more fully described herein, for example, with regard to systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, and <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At a scheduled time (e.g., determined by scheduling component <b>202</b>) the testing component <b>204</b> can initiate the end-to-end technology survey. For example, the end-to-end technology survey can be initiated periodically and can provide an input that facilitates determination of a network that the UE <b>104</b> should camp on. Additionally or alternately, the end-to-end technology survey can be initiated on a per-call basis, such that a real-time latency in the bearer can be determined. For example, changes in network load, traffic, etc. can be identified prior to placing a voice call based in part on the per-call end-to-end technology survey.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Typically, the scheduling component <b>202</b> can optimize the end-to-end technology survey in a manner, such that, a call setup is not slowed down (reactive approach). Additionally or alternately, unnecessary measurements overhead and battery life impact can be reduced (e.g., by scheduling component <b>202</b>) to further optimize the end-to-end technology survey (proactive approach). In one aspect, a validity factor and/or maximum age of survey measurements can be set based upon a mobility profile. For example, the mobility profile can include a number and/or rate of reselections and/or fading profile. In another aspect, survey measurements can last longer (and are refreshed less) if the UE <b>104</b> is stationary, but are repeated and/or refreshed more often if UE <b>104</b> is moving. Further, the scheduling component <b>202</b> can optimize the end-to-end technology survey based on user behavior prediction. For example, the scheduling component <b>202</b> can initiate survey measurements (e.g., performed by testing component <b>204</b>) if the user interface on the UE <b>104</b> is switched to a voice application; and/or before the call dialing is completed. This approach can minimize unnecessary survey overhead and reduce the potential for delayed call setup whilst the UE <b>104</b> is reactively surveying.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to an aspect, the testing component <b>204</b> can initiate a loop back measurement, for example, a ping signal to a ping client (not shown) within the core network node <b>402</b> of network <b>404</b>. Typically, network <b>404</b> can include any wireless and/or wired communication network, such as, but not limited to GSM, UMTS, LTE, WiFi, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), etc. and the core network node <b>402</b> can include, but is not limited to, an access controller, access point, RNC, SGSN, or similar core node within the network <b>404</b>. Although, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the ping signal being transmitted between the UE <b>104</b> and network <b>404</b> over a wireless link, it can be appreciated that the ping signal and/or communication session can be transmitted over a wired link.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, the testing component <b>204</b> can receive a ping echo from the core network node <b>402</b> and the network selection component <b>102</b> can determine performance metrics, such as, but not limited to RTT, jitter, packet loss, noise level, etc. Moreover, the network selection component <b>102</b> can ascertain the ability of the network <b>404</b> to support the voice call and can determine whether fallback to a different technology is required to support the voice call.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one aspect, the UE <b>104</b> can report the results of the end-to-end technology survey to the network <b>404</b> in a message via the most any appropriate service, as configured by the network operator. It can be appreciated that the service selection criteria, survey frequency, reporting method, performance indicators, rule sets for network selection, selection order, reselection, and/or fallback can each be dynamically configurable under network operator control as UE location, system load, and/or other factors change. As an example, the UE <b>104</b> can return measured latency information to the core network node <b>402</b> via network <b>404</b>. The core network node <b>402</b> can utilize the information to for various network management mechanisms, such as, but not limited to, load balancing, rerouting traffic, and/or update a Key Performance Indicator (KPI), such that the network <b>404</b> can be aware of its performance from a user perspective.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to another aspect, the UE <b>104</b> can perform an optimal routing mechanism based on the results of the end-to-end technology survey. For example, the testing component <b>204</b> can perform the end-to-end technology survey on a plurality of available networks (not shown) and the network selection component <b>102</b> can analyze the results of the end-to-end technology survey to select an optimal method, technology, and/or access point for establishing the voice call. For example, if there are multiple networks that can support the voice call, e.g. WiFi, LTE, HSPA+, testing component <b>204</b> can perform an end-to-end technology survey (e.g., ping) on each technology and the network selection component <b>102</b> can determine a ranked list of technologies/networks for establishing the voice call. The ranking can be indicative of various performance metrics, such as, but not limited to, latency, jitter, noise, traffic, etc., which can be employed by the network selection component <b>102</b> to select a technology/network prior to placing the voice call. In another example, the UE <b>104</b> can ping (e.g., by employing the testing component <b>204</b>) a DSL and cable modem technology in a location, for determining which technology is better suited for a communication session associated with the UE <b>104</b>. Typically, a path with the lowest latency is the most efficient, since a lower latency indicates a fewer number of network elements and/or transport paths between the UEs.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example system <b>500</b> that performs a proactive latency based end-to-end technology survey between two UEs for P2P applications. It can be appreciated that the network selection components (<b>102</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>102</b><sub>2</sub>), testing components (<b>204</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>204</b><sub>2</sub>), and UEs (<b>104</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>104</b><sub>2</sub>) can be substantially similar to network selection component <b>102</b>, testing component <b>204</b>, and UE <b>104</b> respectively, which are more fully described herein, for example, with regard to systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> and <b>400</b>. Further, network <b>502</b> can include UMTS, GSM, LTE, WiFi, WiMAX, EV-DO, CDMA, Bluetooth&#xae;, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to an aspect, during P2P applications, e.g., gaming, performance metrics, for example, latency, noise, jitter, etc. can be determined by performing an end-to-end technology survey between the two end devices, e.g., UEs (<b>104</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>104</b><sub>2</sub>). In one aspect, both the testing components (<b>204</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>204</b><sub>2</sub>) can perform loop back measurements based on the end-to-end technology survey and facilitate determination of whether network <b>502</b> can support the P2P application or whether fallback to another network (not shown) can be performed, prior to initiating the P2P application. In another aspect, testing components (<b>204</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>204</b><sub>2</sub>) can perform loop back measurements on a plurality of available networks (not shown) including network <b>502</b> to determine the best network for the P2P application (e.g., based in part on application requirements). For example, testing components (<b>204</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>204</b><sub>2</sub>) can ping multiple networks available to the UEs (<b>104</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>104</b><sub>2</sub>), for example, Bluetooth&#xae;, WiFi, UMTS, LTE, etc. prior to establishing a P2P gaming session between the UEs (<b>104</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>104</b><sub>2</sub>). Based in part on the ping results, the network selection components (<b>102</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>102</b><sub>2</sub>) can determine the best network peer to minimize latency before the UEs (<b>104</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>104</b><sub>2</sub>) start the game.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a system <b>600</b> that employs an artificial intelligence (AI) component <b>602</b>, which facilitates automating one or more features in accordance with the subject innovation. It can be appreciated that the network selection component <b>102</b>, scheduling component <b>202</b>, and testing component <b>204</b> can include respective functionality, as more fully described herein, for example, with regard to systems <b>100</b>-<b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The subject innovation (e.g., in connection with technology/network selection) can employ various AI-based schemes for carrying out various aspects thereof. For example, a process for determining when a ping signal can be initiated, when fallback can be performed, and/or which technology/network can be selected for communication, etc. can be facilitated via an automatic classifier system and process. Moreover, where the UE can operate in multiple technologies/networks, the classifier can be employed to determine which technology/network can be selected for initiating communications associated with the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x)=confidence(class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. In the case of communication systems, for example, attributes can be information stored in the database <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or other data-specific attributes derived from the stored information, and the classes can be categories or areas of interest (e.g., levels of priorities).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs, which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., na&#xef;ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As will be readily appreciated from the subject specification, the subject innovation can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., via a generic training data) as well as implicitly trained (e.g., via observing user behavior, receiving extrinsic information). For example, SVM's are configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, the classifier(s) can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions, including but not limited to determining according to a predetermined criteria when the UE is likely to initiate a voice call and/or a real-time communication session, which of the available technologies/networks can be utilized for the voice call and/or a real-time communication session, etc. The criteria can include, but is not limited to, historical patterns, user behavior, location of the UE, parameters defined by a network operator, application preferences, time, date, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> illustrate methodologies and/or flow diagrams in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. For simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are depicted and described as a series of acts. It is to be understood and appreciated that the subject innovation is not limited by the acts illustrated and/or by the order of acts, for example acts can occur in various orders and/or concurrently, and with other acts not presented and described herein. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement the methodologies in accordance with the disclosed subject matter.

Additionally, it should be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers. The term article of manufacture, as used herein, is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, illustrated is an example methodology <b>700</b> that facilitates a proactive latency-based end-to-end technology survey and fallback for mobile telephony in accordance with an aspect of the subject disclosure. Typically, the technology survey can be performed periodically, prior to establishing a high quality communication session and/or during a high quality communication session. For example, a high quality communication session can include a voice call, a video call, a real-time communication session, a high quality data call, etc. In one aspect, a UE can establish the high quality communication session over one of a plurality of technologies/networks. At <b>702</b>, the ability of each available network (e.g., available to the UE) to deliver a high quality voice and/or data call can be assessed. Moreover, the condition and/or availability of the backhaul circuits that carry the calls from the base station to the terrestrial telephone network can also be determined. In one aspect, the ability of all available wireless access nodes, (e.g., Femtocell, eNodeB, NodeB, or other access point) can be assessed based in part on current network conditions such as, but not limited to, available bandwidth, instantaneous load on the serving broadband network, network delay, jitter, and/or other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At <b>704</b>, a preferred network that provides the best end-to-end QoS can be determined based in part on the assessment. In addition, factors including application preferences, user preferences, service provider preferences, etc. can be utilized to determine the preferred network. Further, at <b>706</b>, the voice and/or data call can be established over the preferred network.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an example methodology <b>800</b> that determines whether a fallback from one technology to another is to be performed for establishing a communication session, according to an aspect of the subject specification. In particular, methodology <b>800</b> facilitates determination of whether fallback to another technology provides better quality or efficiency for a particular communication session and/or application. For example, the methodology <b>800</b> can be employed periodically (e.g., by a UE camping on a cell) to asses whether conditions have changed (for better or for worse), necessitating a change in service (between access technologies or transport methodologies) for applications and/or classes of applications.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At <b>802</b>, an end-to-end technology survey can be performed. Typically, the end-to-end technology survey can include most any loop back measurement designed to test network latency, throughput, bandwidth, noise, jitter, etc. Moreover, the measurement can be through an infrastructure network or peer-to-peer, between two UEs. For example, when the UE encounters a new cell in the idle mode, and it identifies a Femtocell, WiFi access point, eNodeB, NodeB and/or other wireless technology used to provide services, a &#x201c;ping&#x201d; session between the UE and a ping client co-located with the access controller, AP, RNC, SGSN, or substantially similar core node can be performed for determining the delay in the network. In another example, the &#x201c;ping&#x201d; session can be initiated between ping clients within two UEs, for example, in a peer-to-peer communication session. At <b>804</b>, the results of the survey can be compared with a set of predefined parameters. For example, on receiving a response from the ping client, the UE can determine parameters, such as, but not limited to, RTT, jitter, packet loss, noise level, and/or other metrics with predefined values set by the service provider. In one aspect, the predefined parameters can be broadcast, over wireless and/or wired communication, by employing a dedicated channel and/or signal, via SMS messaging, via application layer messaging, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At <b>806</b>, it can be identified whether the technology can support a high quality voice and/or data call (including video session, gaining session, and/or most any real-time application, etc.), based in part on the comparison. Moreover, if determined that the technology cannot support the high quality voice and/or data call a fallback to a disparate technology, which can support the call, can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an example methodology <b>900</b> that facilitates dynamic and proactive selection of a communication technology for a particular communication session and/or application. Typically, methodology <b>900</b> can be utilized to identify an optimal routing mechanism and dynamically select a technology/network for communication, based on the quality of service provided by that technology/network in real-time. For example, if a UE can communicate over multiple networks, e.g. WiFi, LTE, UMTS, HSPA+, then prior to placing a call (voice and/or data), the best network for a particular call and/or application can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">At <b>902</b>, an end-to-end loopback measurement can be performed over a plurality of technologies. For example, a ping signal can be transmitted and ping echo can be received via each of the plurality of technologies. In one aspect, various factor, such as, but not limited to, RTT, noise level, jitter, bandwidth, traffic, congestion, etc. can be measured. At <b>904</b>, the results of the loopback measurement can be analyzed. For example, a ranked list of technologies based on their performance and/or QoS can be determined. At <b>906</b>, the technology that provides the best performance and/or QoS can be selected. Further, at <b>908</b>, the selected technology can be employed for communication associated with a UE.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">WiFi, or Wireless Fidelity, allows connection to the Internet from a couch at home, a bed in a hotel room, or a conference room at work, without wires. WiFi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices, e.g., computers, to send and receive data indoors and out; anywhere within the range of a base station. WiFi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 (a, b, g, etc.) to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A WiFi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wired networks (which use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet). WiFi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands, at an 11 Mbps (802.11a) or 54 Mbps (802.11b) data rate, for example, or with products that contain both bands (dual band), so the networks can provide real-world performance similar to the basic 10BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.</p>
