<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/526,565, which was filed on Aug. 23, 2011, and entitled &#x201c;User Interface,&#x201d; which is incorporated by reference into the present application in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates generally to grouping, transmitting, storing, and providing access to information. More particularly, the present application relates to grouping transmitting, storing, and providing access to audiovisual content based on selected television channels and selected times. Still more particularly, the present application relates to providing a user interface for accessing the audiovisual content.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one implementation, systems and methods of providing access to a block of content may include determining a block of content from a plurality of instances of received content being received by a tuner from a same frequency band of at least one content provider broadcast or a stored instances of such content and transmitting a block list including such block content in response to a user request. Content from the block list may be accessed in response to selections received in response to presentation of the block list. The method may also include transmitting a general EPG at a content receiver for display on a presentation device. The EPG may include a plurality of channels having a plurality of programs available at a plurality of times. The block list may be configured as a block guide that includes a plurality of channels having a plurality of programs available for a selected airing time.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another implementation, systems and methods for providing access to content may include determining a block of content from a plurality of instances of received content being received by a tuner from a same frequency band of at least one content provider broadcast or a stored instances of such content and transmitting a block list including such block content in response to a user request. The method may also include receiving user input requesting display of an instance of content available in the block list and determining if the program is available live or from a stored state. The method may also include transmitting the content to the presentation device live if the program is available live. However, where the program is not available live, the method may include accessing the block of stored content and transmitting the stored content to the presentation device. The block list may be configured as a block guide that may include a plurality of channels having a plurality of programs available for a selected airing time and the airing time may correspond to a time frame for which content has been or is scheduled to be stored as a block of stored content.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In various implementations, a user interface may be provided that may include a menu displayed at a presentation device and associated with a block of content. The menu may include an arrangement of television network names along a first side of the menu, the network names each being associated with a network defined by network content in the block of content, wherein each network is related to the other named networks by an attribute. The menu may also include an arrangement of time slots along a second side of the menu. The second side of the menu may be substantially orthogonal to the first side to form a tabular display and the time slots may fill a time window having a selected start time and a selected end time. The menu may also include references to content arranged in the tabular display, each reference corresponding to a network name and at least one time slot.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are for purposes of example and explanation and do not necessarily limit the present disclosure. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate subject matter of the disclosure. Together, the descriptions and the drawings serve to explain the principles of the disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The description that follows includes sample systems, methods, and computer program products that embody various elements of the present disclosure. However, it should be understood that the described disclosure may be practiced in a variety of forms in addition to those described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Users of content receivers may desire to access different instances of content that are broadcast simultaneously and/or substantially contemporaneously by content providers. For example, many television programming viewers wish to watch different television programs that occupy the same broadcast time slot, such as the different television programs associated with the major television programs that are broadcast between seven PM and ten PM mountain time. Content receivers may attempt to address this issue by utilizing multiple tuners that can each separately present and/or record different, simultaneously broadcast instances of content. However, a separate tuner may still be required for each simultaneous or substantially contemporaneous instance of broadcast or otherwise received content that a content receiver user wishes to view and/or record. Further, in addition to separate tuners required for each instance of content, the content receiver may require sufficient resources to descramble and store each of the instances of content desired by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a system <b>100</b> for automatically recording multiple instances of content from one or more programming providers. The automatic recording of multiple instances of content provided by the system <b>100</b> may enable users of content receivers to access different instances of content that are broadcast simultaneously and/or substantially contemporaneously by content providers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In various broadcast systems, content providers may broadcast content to a plurality of different content receivers via one or more frequency bands utilizing one or more satellites. Each multiplexed signal contained in the frequency band (sometimes referred to as a transponder) may be configured to include data related to one or more instances of content, such as one or more television programming channels. The data related to each of the instances of content included in each frequency may be scrambled utilizing one or more CWs (control words), which may then be encrypted to generate one or more ECMs (entitlement control messages) which may in turn be included with the data. A content receiver may typically tune to one or more of the frequency bands to receive the multiplexed signal that contains data for a particular programming channel utilizing one or more tuners. The content receiver may process only a subset of the programming channels by keeping the data associated with the particular programming channel and discarding data received via the tuned frequency band and multiplexed signal associated with other programming channels. The content receiver may decrypt the ECM included with the data associated with the particular programming channel to obtain the CW, descramble the data utilizing the CW, and store and/or transmit the data (e.g., decompressed, reconstructed audio and video data) to one or more presentation devices.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in this implementation, one or more content providers may select multiple instances of content <b>101</b> to be automatically recorded such as by utilizing predefined recording parameters. For example, a content provider may select all of the television events defined as &#x201c;primetime events&#x201d; associated with all channels defined as &#x201c;primetime television channels&#x201d; for a particular period of time defined as &#x201c;prime time&#x201d; to be automatically recorded. In other examples, the content provider may select television events associated with programming channels for a particular time period (such as a half hour, multiple hours, and/or an entire programming day) in response to user selections. After the content provider selects the multiple instances of content, the multiple instances of content may be multiplexed utilizing a multiplexer <b>102</b>. The multiplexed signal (which includes the multiplexed selected multiple instances of content) may then be scrambled by a scrambler <b>105</b> utilizing one or more CWs <b>103</b>. The CW may be encrypted to generate an ECM, which may be included with the multiplexed signal. The scrambled multiplexed signal may then be included in a broadcast on a frequency band (e.g., cable, satellite), which may then be transmitted to one or more satellites <b>106</b> for broadcast. The satellite <b>106</b> may receive the frequency band (uplink frequency band) and then broadcast the multiplexed signal to a number of content receivers on a translated frequency band (downlink frequency band), such as a content receiver that includes a tuner <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The tuner <b>107</b> may tune to the frequency band that includes the multiple instances of content (which may be performed in response to one or more recording instructions received by the content receiver that includes the tuner from the content provider). The data received via the tuned frequency may be demultiplexed by a demultiplexer <b>109</b> and then descrambled by a descrambler <b>110</b> utilizing the CW before being stored in a non-transitory storage medium <b>111</b> (which may take the form of, but is not limited to, a magnetic storage medium; optical storage medium; magneto-optical storage medium; read only memory; random access memory; erasable programmable memory; flash memory; and so on) based on recording parameters, such as predefined recording parameters. The demultiplexer <b>109</b> may obtain the included ECM <b>104</b>, and the ECM may be provided to a smart card <b>108</b> that may decrypt the ECM <b>104</b> to obtain the CW <b>103</b> for the descrambler <b>110</b>. Hence, the multiple instances of content may subsequently all be available to a user of the content receiver (until such time as they are removed from the non-transitory storage medium) without requiring multiple tuners to receive each of the multiple instances of content, without requiring the smart card to decrypt multiple ECMs. In some implementations, the multiple instances of content may be stored in a single file.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In at least one embodiment, the tuner <b>107</b> may receive multiple instances of content which may be simultaneously recorded and/or watched by one or more users. For example, in one embodiment, the tuner <b>107</b> may operate to receive instances of content (e.g., multiple television channels or multiple programs) multiplexed together on single tuned frequency. Furthermore, in at least one embodiment, each of the multiple instances of content may be encrypted using a single control word. As described above, the multiple instances of content may be received, decrypted and/or stored onto the storage medium <b>111</b>. Simultaneously, a user may request to view one or/more of the received programs. A receiver may demodulate and output the signal to a presentation device for presentation to a user. In association with reception of the content, the receiver performs appropriate processing to select portions of the received plurality of content associated with the selected channel for further processing and output.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In at least one embodiment, a single tuner <b>107</b> and smart card <b>108</b> may be utilized to receive, process and output multiple instances of content to multiple devices simultaneously. For example, the tuner <b>107</b> may simultaneously receive content associated with the big four tv networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox) which are encrypted using the same control word and multiplexed into the same tuned frequency. The smart card <b>108</b> performs processing for simultaneously decrypting a plurality of the channels and the decrypted signals may be output to multiple presentation devices, either using the same output device (e.g., one set-top box with multiple outputs) or via multiple output devices which are communicatively coupled over a network or other communication link (e.g., multiple set-top boxes).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although the system <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and is described above as including a number of specific components configured in a specific arrangement, it is understood that this is for the purposes of example and other arrangements involving fewer and/or additional components are possible without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, in various implementations, the multiple instances of content may be individually scrambled utilizing the control word prior to multiplexing. In another example, in some implementations, the data received via the tuned frequency may be descrambled utilizing the control word before being demultiplexed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The multiple instances of content have been described in the context of primetime television and thus the multiple instances of content have been described as relating to content available on selected popular network television channels during a particular period of the day. In other implementations, the multiple instances of content may be related to otherwise related channels. That is, rather than primetime channels, the multiple instances of content may include a group of selected sports channels, decorating channels, shopping channels, cartoon channels, cooking channels, or other groups of channel related by subject matter and may further include a time period within which these channels are commonly watched. For example, multiple instances of content may include a group of morning talk shows and may cover a time period from approximately 7:00 am to 10:00 am. Other groups may include afternoon talk shows, soaps, or news broadcasts. Other multiple instances of content may include groups of channels selected based on demographics of a group of users, for example. That is, where a study is performed suggesting that a particular group of users watches a particular set of channels in a particular time period each day, the particular channels within that time period may define multiple instances of content.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The multiple instances of content may also include information and/or data and may thus not be limited to television programming or audiovisual content, for that matter. For example, a bundle of data or a bundle of groups of data may also be processed as described above. Where a single CW is used for the several groups of data, the several channels, or other instances of content or information, large volumes of data and/or content may be transmitted without requiring multiple tuners to receive each of the multiple instances of content, without requiring the smart card to decrypt multiple ECMs, and/or without requiring the combiner <b>109</b> to have to descramble multiple signals. Accordingly, while the remaining portion of the application may include reference to primetime television and thus be focused on a particular set of channels for a particular period of time, other groups of content may also be provided and the methods, menus, and systems for accessing the content may be reflective of the type of content or information stored.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> a system <b>120</b> for accessing and displaying the multiple instances of content may be described. The system <b>120</b> may include some parts of the system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as part of a content receiver <b>122</b>. The content receiver <b>122</b> may further include a processor <b>124</b> and an output <b>126</b>. The system <b>120</b> may also include a presentation device <b>128</b> connected to the output <b>126</b> of the content receiver <b>122</b>. The content receiver <b>122</b> may be configured for performing the storage function of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and may also be configured for processing information from the service provider and/or processing data stored in the storage medium <b>111</b>. The content receiver <b>122</b> may also be configured for interfacing with a user to receive commands or instructions. As such, the content receiver <b>122</b> may include an interfacing module <b>130</b> for processing menu related data, for example. The interfacing module <b>130</b> may receive menu data from a service provider or read the data from the storage medium <b>111</b>. The interfacing module <b>130</b> may send menus to the presentation device for display and may receive input from the user via a remote control used by the user in conjunction with the menu. The interfacing module <b>130</b> may adjust, change, or adapt the displayed menu based a users selections and/or predefined preferences. Upon selection of content, the content receiver <b>122</b> may also send selected content or other content to the presentation device for display. The presentation device <b>128</b> may be configured for receiving the content or information from the content receiver <b>122</b> and displaying the content or information for viewing and/or interaction by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The interfacing module <b>130</b> may include software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware configured for interfacing with the user. In some implementations, the interfacing module <b>130</b> may include computer-implemented instructions stored on the computer readable storage medium <b>111</b> in the content receiver <b>122</b>, for example. The computer-implemented instructions may be for displaying particular menus and waiting for user input relating to the menus and either displaying an additional menu or prompting the user based on user input or accessing the content selected by the user. The interfacing module <b>130</b> may also include databases, tables, or otherwise arranged files for storing information for populating the menus. The databases, tables, or otherwise arranged files may be updated periodically with additional information relating to current programming availability.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the content receiver <b>122</b> is illustrated and described above as including the tuner <b>107</b> and the storage <b>111</b>, it is understood that other arrangements are possible without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, in various implementations the tuner <b>107</b> and/or the storage <b>111</b> may be components of another content receiver (not shown) with which the content receiver <b>122</b> is configured to communicate. As such, the content receiver <b>122</b> may be operable to communicate with the other content receiver in order to access and/or present content received and/or stored by the other content receiver. In such cases, the content receiver <b>122</b> may not include a tuner and/or storage similar to the tuner <b>107</b> and the storage <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7</figref>, a series of selection of menus are shown. Where a block of content, or series of blocks of content, is received and processed as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the block of content may be accessible live or from a stored state by a user via one or more dedicated interfaces. That is, an interface may be provided that is particularly adapted for displaying selection options relating to the content being streamed to or stored in the block. In the context of television programming, the dedicated interface may be in the form of a dedicated electronic programming guide (EPG) or block guide <b>132</b> (though in some cases a block list may be presented that is not configured as a block guide or other kind of dedicated programming guide). In one implementation, the block guide <b>132</b> may include one or more menu screens relating to primetime television and, as such, may include one or more menu screens relating to programming content on, for example, ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX, from seven PM to ten PM as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. Other networks, time frames, and other groupings of shows may also be provided. Programming that aired on different days or weeks may also be accessible within the block guide <b>132</b>. For example, previous episodes of a program may be accessible. This dedicated EPG or block guide <b>132</b> may be compiled in one more ways, it may be accessible in one or more ways, and it may include one or more menu screens for accessing content in the block or in related blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some implementations, the block guide <b>132</b> may be a condensed or alternative version of an associated or general EPG usable by a user to access programs outside the block of content. As such, in some implementations, the block guide <b>132</b> may be developed by accessing the general EPG and extracting or displaying portions of the general EPG. This process may be performed by, for example, a content receiver <b>122</b> or this process may be performed by a service provider. In other implementations, the block guide <b>132</b> may be developed wholly separate from the general EPG, but the block guide <b>132</b> may still have some overlapping information with the general EPG. The block guide <b>132</b>, in this implementation, may be developed by a service provider, for example, and transmitted with, or separate, from the block of content. In any of the above cases, the block guide <b>132</b> may be stored at a content receiver <b>122</b> and a user may access the block guide <b>132</b> in several ways.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a view of a general EPG <b>131</b> is shown where options are included for a user to select content including content within or outside the block of content. As shown, the general EPG <b>131</b> may include a drop down menu <b>134</b> allowing a user to select the format in which they would like to have their program options displayed. The drop down menu <b>134</b> may include a block guide option <b>136</b>. The user may scroll to the block guide option <b>136</b> and select the block guide option <b>136</b> and the system may present a block guide <b>132</b> such as one of those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, for example. It is noted that other selection options may be provided other than a drop down menu <b>134</b>. A list menu, a radio button menu, a series of push buttons, or other interface menu options may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another view of a general EPG <b>131</b> is shown. As with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this general EPG <b>131</b> may be arranged to show a series of television channels and the programs available on those channels for several time ranges. As shown, this general EPG <b>131</b> may include a channel option in the form of a block guide bar <b>138</b>. The block guide bar <b>138</b> may be arranged between any of the channel selections and it may extend across the whole of the time ranges available. In some implementations, the block guide bar <b>138</b> may be arranged near or within the series of channels available in the block guide <b>132</b>. That is, as shown, block guide bar <b>138</b> may be arranged adjacent to the CBS network channel selection, for example. Other locations may be provided and may be selected such that the user can associate the block guide bar <b>138</b> with channels available in the block guide <b>132</b> or such that the user can at least view the block guide bar <b>138</b> when viewing programming options available on channels associated with the block guide <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, still another view of a general EPG <b>131</b> is shown. In this implementation, an interactive feature may be provided allowing the user to access the block guide <b>132</b>. As shown, the interactive feature may include a pop-up selection <b>140</b>. The pop-up selection <b>140</b> may be triggered when a user highlights, scrolls across, or otherwise preliminarily selects a selection option on one of the channels included in the EPG <b>131</b>. For example, as shown, a user has highlighted a program on FOX at seven PM. Upon highlighting the program, the general EPG <b>131</b> may present a pop-up <b>140</b> asking or suggesting that the user use the block guide <b>132</b>. The pop-up <b>140</b> may read &#x201c;primetime anytime&#x201d; for example. The pop-up <b>140</b> may be triggered when the user scrolls across any program listed for a channel included in the block guide <b>132</b>. That is, the pop-up <b>140</b> may be triggered when the user scrolls across the FOX channel, for example, at any time of day including times outside the timeframe included in the block guide <b>132</b>. In other implementations, the pop-up <b>140</b> may only be triggered when the user scrolls across a program within the time frame included in the block guide <b>132</b>. In any of the above cases, upon being presented with the pop-up <b>140</b>, the user may select the pop-up <b>140</b> and the system may display a block guide <b>132</b>, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In any of the above-mentioned access options, a block guide <b>132</b> may be presented revealing content for a particular day. Depending on the time of day the block guide <b>132</b> is accessed and the time frame of content available in the block guide <b>132</b>, a previous day's content or a current day's content may be presented. In some implementations, the day's content that is presented may be based on a cut-off time. For example, where the content in the block of stored content relates to programming available from seven PM to ten PM, a cut-off time of four PM may be established. That is, where the block guide <b>132</b> is accessed before four PM, the previous day's content may be presented. However, if it is after four PM, but before the start time of the block window, the current day's content may be presented and may be highlighted as upcoming, for example. The content in the block guide <b>132</b> may be presented in a grayscale or other dimmed presentation to indicate that the programming is not yet available. Where the block guide <b>132</b> is accessed during the block window, the current day's programming may be presented and the programming that has begun may be presented as available and other programming may be grayed or otherwise signaled as not available. Other cut-off times may be used. For example, the cut-off time may be set to the start time of the block window and accessing the block guide <b>132</b> may show the previous day's content until the current day's content begins to be received. Still other cut-off times may be also be used. In some implementations, a user option may be provided for setting the cut-off time. In any of the above-mentioned cut-off time scenarios, the system <b>120</b> may check the cut-off time upon being instructed to access the block guide <b>132</b> and may compare the current time to the cut-off time to determine which day's block guide <b>132</b> to display.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations, the block guide <b>132</b> may be offered to users as an additional service and accessing the block guide <b>132</b> may be conditional upon having subscribed to the block guide service. In this implementation, where a user accesses the block guide <b>132</b>, the system <b>120</b> may check for rights to access the block guide <b>132</b>. Where a user has rights, the block guide <b>132</b> may be presented. Where the user does not have rights, an inactive version of the block guide <b>132</b> may be presented. For example, an inactive version may include a grayscale type menu such that the potential subscriber can view what the block guide <b>132</b> looks like and thus begin to understand how it might work and why they may be interested in subscribing. However, selections within the block guide <b>132</b> may not be active and the user may not be able to use the block guide <b>132</b> to select content to be displayed. Alternatively, where a user does not have rights, an informational screen may be provided. An informational screen may include a description of the block guide service program and may also include ordering information, for example. A menu of options may be presented on either an inactive block guide or an informational screen including a back button for returning to a previous guide screen and an ordering button, for example. A combination of an inactive block guide and an informational screen may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, one implementation of a block guide <b>132</b> is shown. The block guide <b>132</b> may include an interface for accessing the content in the block of content and, as such, may include a table, chart, listing, or other menu reflecting the content available in the block of content. In the context of television programming, for example, the block guide may include one or more channels <b>142</b> and the programming available on those channels for a selected airing time <b>144</b>. The selected airing time <b>144</b> may correspond to the time frame or block window within which the block of stored content is received and stored in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown, for example, the block guide <b>132</b> may include channels associated with ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX and may include programming on those channels extending from seven PM to ten PM.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A user may access the block guide <b>132</b> in one of the ways mentioned above and may peruse the block guide <b>132</b>. The user may select a program to view from the block guide <b>132</b> and the content receiver <b>122</b> may transmit the associated content to the presentation device for viewing. The content receiver <b>122</b> may check the content requested and determine whether the selection relates to a live running program or whether the selection relates to stored content. Where the content requested relates to a live running program, the content receiver <b>122</b> may receive and transmit the live content. However, where the content requested relates to stored content, the content receiver <b>122</b> may access the stored content and transmit the stored content. In some implementations, for example, where a selected program is currently being aired live, but began earlier, the content receiver <b>122</b> may prompt the user with a question or selection list requiring input regarding whether they would like to view the program from the beginning or tune in to the live broadcast of the content. The selection list may include &#x201c;beginning&#x201d; and &#x201c;live&#x201d; options, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a block guide <b>132</b> is shown, similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this figure, however, the block guide bar <b>138</b> is shown highlighted and selected by the user. The block guide bar <b>138</b> in this view may provide the user with access to a different menu than the block guide bar <b>138</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example. That is, the block guide bar <b>138</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, may bring the user to the block guide <b>132</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, however, the user is already viewing the block guide <b>132</b>. As such, selection of the block guide bar in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, may provide the user with access to a block guide informational screen. In one implementation, the block guide informational screen may include options for configuring the user's block guides <b>132</b>. In other implementations, the block guide informational screen may include a listing of available block guides <b>132</b>. That is, for example, a listing of previous or other days block guides <b>132</b> may be shown and available for selection. Other information may also be provided on the block guide informational screen. It is also noted that the block guide bar <b>138</b> may be provided in a block guide <b>132</b> and may be active when the remaining portion of the block guide <b>132</b> is inactive. That is, for example where the block guide <b>132</b> is accessed by a non-subscriber, the block guide <b>132</b> may be inactive as described above, but the block guide bar <b>138</b> may be active. As such, when the block guide bar <b>138</b> is selected, an informational screen or an order screen may be presented for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an additional block guide <b>132</b> is shown. In this implementation, some of the programs shown include an additional selection option relating to previous episodes. As such, for programs that are part of a series, an additional selection option may be provided. In some implementations, the additional selection option may expand in the form of a list <b>146</b> upon scrolling across a particular program. For example, as shown, when scrolling across the program available on FOX at eight PM, an additional list <b>146</b> may be presented including previous dates or previous episode names or other indications of previous episodes available via a block of content other than the one reflected in the currently presented guide <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In other implementations, the additional selection option <b>146</b> may include a link to a menu relating to the associated program. For example, the link may indicate that related episodes, other episodes, or previous episodes are available. Selection of the link by the user may cause the system to display a menu relating to the selected program. The menu may include a general description of the program and may include links to all available episodes, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described above, a single content receiver may be utilized to simultaneously receive and/or output one or more instances of content receive in a multiplexed signal. Thus, a tuner and smart card combination may be operable to receive multiple instances of content (e.g., multiple channels) simultaneously, which are available for viewing by a user. In accordance with some implementations, a tuner and smart card may be configured to receive and stored multiple channels at once, such as multiple channels broadcast during primetime viewing. While in use to record the multiple channels of content, the tuner may be unavailable to receive content on other frequencies. Thus, a user may not be able to change the tuner to receive some programs. Nonetheless, the user may be able to channel surf within the plurality of instances of content which are currently being received by the tuner. For example, a user may surf between the big four TV networks which are being simultaneously received by a tuner using a single control word.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with implementations described herein, a content receiver may be configured to identify one or more instances of content being received by a tuner from the same frequency band of at least one content provider and generate a block list of available programs including the one or more instances of content. For example, a receiver may identify that a tuner is being utilized to currently receive four channels, of which one channel of content may be currently output by the receiver for presentation to a user. The receiver may generate a block list for output which identifies the other three instances of content which are available to the user via the tuner at the present time. Thus, the user can select another channel presently being received by the tuner for output by the receiver. The block list may be output in any appropriate manner, such as overlaid onto a presently watched instance of content, or output as a separate menu, EPG or the like. In at least one embodiment, the receiver may include an option, selected via one or more menus, which allows the user to enter a limited channel surfing mode within the multiple instances of receiver content by receiver by a tuner. For example, the user may provide input to change a channel (e.g., via a channel up and down key), in which the receiver does not move numerically through all channels offered by a content provider, but rather moves through a subset of channels currently being received by a tuner.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref> and the above illustrate and describe generation and/or presentation of a block list that is configured as a block guide, other arrangements are possible.
