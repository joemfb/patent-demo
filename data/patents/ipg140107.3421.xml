<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an organic light-emitting element that comprises an anode, a cathode, and a layer containing an organic compound (hereinafter, electroluminescent layer) that generates light by applying electric field through the electrodes; and a light-emitting device that comprises the organic light-emitting element. Specifically, the present invention relates to a light-emitting element that exhibits white emission and a full color light-emitting device comprising the organic light-emitting element.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An organic light-emitting element emits light when electric field is applied thereto. The emission mechanism is a carrier injection type. That is, by applying voltage through a pair of electrodes that interposes an electroluminescent layer therebetween, electrons injected from a cathode and holes injected from an anode are recombined within the electroluminescent layer to form molecules in excited states (hereinafter, excited molecule), and the excited molecules return to the ground state while radiating energy to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are two excited states possible from organic compounds, the singlet state and the triplet states. Light emission from the singlet state is referred to as fluorescence and the same from the triplet state is referred to as phosphorescence.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such organic light-emitting element, an electroluminescent layer is generally formed to have a thickness of below 1 &#x3bc;m. Further, since the organic light-emitting element is a self-luminous element in which an electroluminescent layer emits light, a back light used for the conventional liquid crystal display device is unnecessary. Therefore, the organic light-emitting element has a great advantage of being manufactured to have a ultra thin film thickness and light weight.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case of an electroluminescent film with a thickness of approximately 100 nm to 200 nm, the time between the injection of carriers and their recombination is about several ten nanoseconds considering the carrier mobility. Hence, the time required for the process of injecting carriers and emitting light of the electroluminescent layer is on the order of microsecond. Thus, an extremely high response speed is one of the advantages thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, since an organic light-emitting element is carrier injection type, it can be driven by a direct current voltage, thereby noise is hardly generated. With respect to a drive voltage, an electroluminescent layer is formed into a uniform ultra thin film having a thickness of approximately 100 nm, and a material for an electrode is selected to reduce a carrier injection barrier. Further, a hetero structure (two-layers structure) is introduced. Accordingly, a sufficient luminance of 100 cd/m<sup>2 </sup>can be obtained at an applied voltage of 5.5V (non-patent literature 1: C. W. Tang and S. A. VanSlyke, Applied Physics Letters, vol. 51, No. 12, pp. 913-915 (1987)).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An organic light-emitting element has been attracted attention as a next generation's device for a flat panel display in terms of the thin thickness and light weight, the high response speed, the direct low voltage operation, or the like. In addition, the organic light-emitting element can be used effectively as the element for the display screen of a portable electric appliance in terms of the self luminous type, the wide viewing angle, and the high level of visibility.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Wide variations of emission color is also one of the advantages of the organic light-emitting element. Richness of color is resulted from the multiplicity of an organic compound itself. That is, an organic compound is flexible enough to be developed to various materials by designing molecules (such as introducing substituent). Accordingly, the organic light-emitting element is rich in color.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">From these viewpoints, it would not be an overstatement to say that the biggest application area of an organic light-emitting element is a full color flat panel display device. Various means for full colorization have been developed in view of characteristics of the organic light-emitting element. At present, there are three primary methods of forming the structure of a full color light-emitting device by using the organic light-emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">First, the method that organic light-emitting elements having three primary colors, that is, red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are patterned, respectively, by shadow mask technique to serve them as pixels (hereinafter, RGB method). Second, a blue organic light-emitting element is used as a light emission source, and the blue emission is converted into green or red by color changing material (CCM) made from phosphorescent material to obtain three primary colors (hereinafter, CCM method). Third, a white organic light-emitting element is used as a light emission source, and a color filter (CF) used for a liquid crystal display device or the like is provided to obtain three primary colors (hereinafter, CF method).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Among these, in the CCM system and the CF system, an organic light-emitting element that is used therein emits monochromatic light such as blue (CCF system) or white (CF system); accordingly, different from the RGB system, precise separate coating by use of a shadow mask is not necessary. Furthermore, a color conversion material or a color filter can be manufactured according to an existing photolithography technique, and there is no need of complicated processes. Still furthermore, other than merits from a process point of view, there is another advantage in that since only one kind of element is used, the brightness varies uniformly with time; accordingly, the color shift or irregular brightness with time are not caused.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in case of adopting the CCM method, there has been a problem in red color since color conversion efficiency of from blue to red is poor in principle. In addition, there has been a problem that the contrast becomes deteriorated since a color conversion material itself is fluorescent so that light is generated in pixels due to outside light such as sunlight. CF method has no such problems since a color filter is used as well as the conventional liquid display device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, although the CF method has comparative few disadvantages, the CF method has a problem that a high efficient white organic light-emitting element is indispensable to the CF method since a great deal of light is absorbed into the color filter. A mainstream white organic light-emitting element is the element that combines complementary colors such as blue and yellow) (hereinafter, two wavelengths white light-emitting element) instead of white color having the peak intensity in each wavelength of R, G, and B (non-patent literature 2: Kido et al. &#x201c;46<sup>th </sup>Applied Physics Relation Union Lecture Meeting&#x201d; p 1282, 28a-ZD-25 (1999)).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, considering a light-emitting device combined with a color filter, a white organic light-emitting element having an emission spectrum with the peak intensity in each wavelength of R, G, and B (hereinafter, three wavelengths white light-emitting element) is desirable instead of the two wavelengths white light-emitting element, which was reported in the non-patent literature 2.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Such three wavelengths white light-emitting element has been reported several times (for instance, non-patent literature 3: J. Kido at al., Science, vol. 267, 1332-1334 (1995)). However, such three wavelengths white light-emitting element is inferior to the two wavelengths white light-emitting element in terms of luminous efficiency, consequently, significant improvement is required.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, irrespective of two-wavelength type or three-wavelength type, white emission can be applied also to lighting and so on. From such meaning too, development of a highly efficient white organic light-emitting element is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems that the Invention is to Solve</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this connection, the present invention intends to provide a while organic light-emitting element that is high in the emission efficiency. In particular, the invention intends to provide a white organic light-emitting element that has an emission spectrum that has peaks in the respective wavelength regions of red color, green color and blue color and is high in the efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, the invention intends, by manufacturing a light-emitting device with the organic light-emitting element, to provide a light-emitting device that is lower in the power consumption more than ever. In the present specification, &#x201c;a light-emitting device&#x201d; indicates a light-emitting device or an image display device that uses an organic light-emitting element. Furthermore, all of a module in which to an organic light-emitting element a connector such as a flexible printed circuit (FPC) or a TAB (Tape Automated Bonding) tape or a TCP. (Tape Carrier Package) is attached, a module in which to a tip end of the TAB or TCP a printed wiring board is disposed, or a module in which an IC (integrated circuit) is directly mounted on an organic light-emitting element according to a COG (Chip On Glass) method are included in the light-emitting device.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the case of a white emission spectrum, in particular, an emission spectrum having peaks in the respective wavelength regions of red color, green color and blue color, it is considered that a spectrum region poorest in the emission efficiency is a red region. This is because the emission efficiencies of red emitting materials are generally lower than that of others. In view of the circumstance, the present invention intends to realize a highly efficient white organic light-emitting element by introducing a reddish phosphorescent material.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A phosphorescent material is a material that can convert a triplet excitation state to emission, that is, a material that can emit phosphorescence. It is known that since in an organic light-emitting element it is considered that a singlet excitation state and a triplet excitation state are generated at a ratio of 1:3, when a phosphorescent material is used high emission efficiency can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, in the case of a red phosphorescent material being introduced in a structure of a white organic light-emitting element such as shown in non-patent literature 2, only the red color is emitted, other components such as blue one or green one cannot be observed. As a result, white emission cannot be obtained. That is, since a phosphorescent material easily converts excitation energy larger than itself to emission of itself, a white organic light-emitting element in which a reddish phosphorescent material is introduced can be said to be difficult to realize.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present inventors found, after studying hard, that by applying an element structure shown below a white organic light-emitting element in which a reddish phosphorescent material is introduced can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">That is, a configuration of the present invention is characterized in that in an organic light-emitting element in which an electroluminescent layer that has a first emission region and a second emission region the maximum peak of an emission spectrum of which is located in a longer wavelength side than the first emission region is disposed between an anode and a cathode, emission in the second emission region is one from a triplet excitation state and the second emission region is located apart from the first emission region.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the above, the second emission region is preferably constituted of a host material and a guest material that exhibits emission from a triplet excitation state.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, the configurations are particularly effective when the emission from the first emission region is one from a singlet excitation state. Accordingly, in the invention, the emission from the first emission region is characterized by being the emission from a singlet excitation state. In this case, a configuration of the first emission region is preferably one that includes a host material and one kind or a plurality of guest materials that exhibits emission from a singlet excitation state.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Still furthermore, a more preferable configuration in the abovementioned organic light-emitting element according to the invention is one in which the first emission region is located toward an anode more than the second emission region. In this case, in order to design a carrier recombination region in the neighborhood of the first emission region, between the first emission region and the second emission region, a layer made of a hole block material that has an ionization potential larger than a substance having the largest ionization potential of substances contained in the first emission region is preferably disposed. A value of the ionization potential of the hole block material is preferably 0.4 eV or more larger than a value of the ionization potential of a substance that has the largest ionization potential of substances contained in the first emission region.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, in the configuration according to the invention, in order to allow both of the first emission region and the second emission region to emit efficiently, a distance between the first emission region and the second emission region is preferably 1 nm or more and 30 nm or less. More preferably, it is 5 nm or more and 20 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One of intentions of the invention is to manufacture a highly efficient white organic light-emitting element. At this time, when light that is generated from the first emission, region on a shorter wavelength side and light that is generated from the second emission region on a longer wavelength side are combined with a good balance, high quality white emission can be realized. Accordingly, an emission wavelength of the first emission region and that of the second emission region preferably satisfy the conditions below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">That is, in the invention, an emission spectrum in the first emission region has at least one peak in a region of 400 nm or more and 500 nm or less. Alternatively, it has at least two peaks in a region of 400 nm or more and 560 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, an emission spectrum in the second emission region has at least one peak in a region of 560 nm or more and 700 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the first and second emission regions that exhibit emission in the wavelength regions as mentioned above are combined, highly efficient and high-quality white organic light-emitting element can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Here, as the emission in the first emission region, excimer emission can be used. When thus configured, since emission having two peaks can be easily taken out of the first emission region, when this is combined with the emission from the second emission region, white emission having peaks in the respective wavelength regions of R, G and B can be easily realized. Accordingly, in the invention, in the case of an emission spectrum in the first emission region having at least two peaks in a region of 400 nm or more and 560 nm or less, the emission in the first emission region includes excimer emission.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the abovementioned organic light-emitting element according to the invention, the emission in the second emission region is one from a triplet excitation state. As materials that exhibit such an emission, an organometallic complex can be preferably used. Furthermore, in particular, from the highness of the emission efficiency, the organometallic complex that has iridium or platinum as a central metal can be preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When a light-emitting device is prepared by use of the abovementioned organic light-emitting element according to the invention, a light-emitting device having lower power consumption more than ever can be provided.

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Embodiments of the present invention will be explained below.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In what follows, of embodiments of the invention, principles of operation and specific examples of configuration are cited and detailed. In an organic light-emitting element, in order to extract emission, any one of electrodes has only to be transparent. Accordingly, not only an existing element structure in which a transparent electrode is formed on a substrate and light is extracted from a substrate side but also a structure in which light is actually extracted from a side opposite to the substrate and a structure in which light is extracted from both sides of an electrode can be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Firstly, of an existing white organic light-emitting element that has two emission regions, that is, a first emission region and a second emission region a maximum peak of an emission spectrum of which is located in a longer wavelength side than the first emission region, an example of a basic configuration thereof is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a structure of an organic light-emitting element in which a laminated structure (electroluminescent layer <b>903</b>) of a hole transport layer <b>911</b> made of a hole transport material <b>921</b> and an electron transport layer <b>912</b> made of an electron-transporting material <b>922</b> is sandwiched between an anode <b>901</b> and a cathode <b>902</b>. However, a first emission region <b>913</b> where a first dopant <b>923</b> is added to the hole transport layer <b>911</b> and a second emission region <b>914</b> where a second dopant <b>924</b> is added to the electron transport layer <b>912</b> are disposed. That is, the hole transport material <b>921</b> and the electron transport material <b>922</b> each work as a host material. Furthermore, both of the first emission region <b>913</b> and the second emission region <b>914</b> are present in the neighborhood of an interface <b>915</b> between the hole transport layer <b>911</b> and the electron transport layer <b>912</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In such a structure, a recombination region of carriers is in the neighborhood of the interface <b>915</b>. Since in the neighborhood of the interface <b>915</b> two kinds of the first dopant <b>923</b> and the second dopant <b>924</b> are present together, emission processes are competed between the two kinds of dopants. At this time, when the two kinds of dopants are both fluorescent materials, since excitation life times thereof are both similarly short, unless a F&#xf6;rster type energy transfer condition (an emission wavelength of any one of dopants overlaps with an absorption wavelength of another dopant) is sufficiently satisfied, both two kinds can emit. As a result, white emission can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For instance, though a structure of a white organic light-emitting element shown in non-patent literature 2 is one that is obtained by further adding another electron transport layer and electron injection layer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a basic principle is similar. That is, in the hole transport layer <b>911</b> perylene that is a blue-emitting material is introduced as the first dopant <b>923</b> and in the electron transport layer <b>912</b> DCM<b>1</b> that is an orange-emitting material is introduced as the second dopant <b>924</b>, and thereby white emission is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the other hand, the gist of the invention is to aim higher efficiency by introducing a reddish phosphorescent material in a white organic light-emitting element. However, even when a reddish phosphorescent material is introduced in the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> as the second dopant <b>924</b>, white emission cannot be obtained. For instance, even when an element in which perylene that is a blue-emitting material is used as the first dopant <b>923</b> and as the second dopant <b>924</b> 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18-octaethyl-21H, 23H-porphyrin-platinum complex (hereinafter abbreviated as PtOEP) that is a red phosphorescent material is used is prepared, only red emission of PtOEP is observed (described later in comparative example 1). This is explained as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Firstly, in order to obtain white emission in the element structure, at least perylene that is the first dopant <b>923</b> has to emit. That is, a minimum condition is that a singlet excitation state of perylene emits light as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, without restricting to PtOEP, since many of phosphorescent materials are small in the ionization potential (a position of a HOMO level <b>1001</b> is high), it forms a deeper trap level to a hole. Accordingly, PtOEP traps a hole, and without exciting perylene, the PtOEP is likely to be directly excited.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, many of the phosphorescent materials typical in PtOEP have a broad absorption band called a triplet MLCT in a visible light region (this corresponds to a lowest triplet excitation state of a phosphorescent material). In addition to this, in the case of the F&#xf6;rster type energy transfer, an energy transfer from a singlet excitation state of one molecule to a triplet excitation state of another molecule is allowed. This means that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, even when a substance (perylene here) that has emission in a visible light region is excited, from the singlet excitation state S<sub>D1 </sub>thereof to a triplet excitation state T<sub>D2 </sub>of the phosphorescent material (PtOEP here), a F&#xf6;rster type energy transfer <b>1011</b> can easily occur. Accordingly, emission of perylene becomes difficult to observe. Here, though a triplet excitation state of perylene is not considered here, since perylene is a fluorescent material, the triplet excitation state thereof is deactivated or transfers energy to PtOEP.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Still furthermore, since the triplet MLCT absorption is generally wide in the band width, an energy transfer not only from a blue-emitting substance such as perylene but also even from a substance exhibiting greenish emission is induced. This phenomenon occurs not only in the case where a fluorescent material such as perylene is used as an emitting material in the first emission region but also similarly in the case where a phosphorescent material is used. Accordingly, a white organic light-emitting element in which a reddish phosphorescent material is introduced can be realized with difficulty.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A method of overcoming the problem is to make a distance between a first emission region and a, second emission region more distant and thereby to inhibit an excitation state, of the first emission region (singlet excitation state in particular) from being transferred to a triplet excitation state of the second emission region. An example of such a basic configuration of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first dopant (fluorescent material here) <b>123</b> is added to a hole transport layer <b>111</b> that is made of a hole transport material <b>121</b> and thereby a first emission region <b>113</b> is formed. Furthermore, a second dopant (phosphorescent material) <b>124</b> is added to an electron transport layer <b>112</b> that is made of an electron transport material <b>122</b> and thereby a second emission region <b>114</b> is formed. As to emission wavelength, one of the second dopant (phosphorescent material) <b>124</b> is located toward a longer wavelength side than one of the first dopant <b>123</b>. Furthermore, between the first emission region <b>113</b> and the second emission region <b>114</b>, a layer <b>116</b> (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;gap layer&#x201d;) to which the second dopant (phosphorescent material) <b>124</b> is not added is disposed with a thickness of d, and this point is different from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Here the gap layer <b>116</b> is assumed to have the electron transportability. Still furthermore, reference numerals <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>, respectively, denote an anode, a cathode and an electroluminescent layer.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At this time, since the gap layer <b>116</b> has the electron transportability, a recombination region in the structure is in the neighborhood of an interface <b>115</b> between the first emission region <b>113</b> and the gap layer <b>116</b>. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, owing to a distance d, a HOMO level <b>201</b> of the second dopant (phosphorescent material) does not directly trap a hole. Accordingly, firstly, the first dopant <b>123</b> is excited. As an excitation state, there are a singlet excitation state S<sub>D1 </sub>and a triplet excitation state T<sub>D1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, since owing to the gap layer <b>116</b> the first dopant and the second dopant (phosphorescent material) are apart by a distance d, the aforementioned F&#xf6;rster type energy transfer <b>211</b> of S<sub>D1</sub>&#x2192;T<sub>D2 </sub>contributes less (drastically diminishes as the distance d becomes larger). By just that much, S<sub>D1</sub>&#x2192;G<sub>D1</sub>, that is, emission of the first dopant h&#x3bd;<sub>D1 </sub>becomes to be observed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">On the other hand, since the first dopant is a fluorescent material here, the triplet excitation state T<sub>D1 </sub>cannot emit but can transfer energy to a triplet excitation state T<sub>D2 </sub>of the second dopant (phosphorescent material). An excitation lifetime of a triplet excitation molecule is normally longer than that of a singlet excitation molecule and a diffusion distance thereof is large; accordingly, in comparison with the aforementioned energy transfer <b>211</b> of S<sub>D1</sub>&#x2192;T<sub>D2</sub>, an energy transfer <b>212</b> of T<sub>D1</sub>&#x2192;T<sub>D2 </sub>is affected less by a distance d. Accordingly, even when a distance d is separated to some extent, the energy transfer of T<sub>D1</sub>&#x2192;T<sub>D2 </sub>is effectively caused, subsequently, a triplet excitation state T<sub>D2 </sub>of the second dopant (phosphorescent material) is speedily converted into emission h&#x3bd;<sub>D2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As described above, when the element structure according to the invention is applied, both the first dopant and the second dopant (phosphorescent material) that exhibits an emission in a longer wavelength side than the first dopant are allowed to emit; accordingly, white emission can be attained.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the element structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the second emission region, a phosphorescent material is used as a dopant; however, a phosphorescent material can be used singularly.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Furthermore, as a luminescent material in the first emission region, a phosphorescent material may be used; however, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a fluorescent material can be used preferably. In this case, a generated singlet excitation state and a generated triplet excitation state, respectively, contribute to emissions mainly in the first emission region and the second emission region; accordingly, both excitation states of the singlet and the triplet are allowed to contribute to emission and thereby an increase in the efficiency can be expected. Furthermore, an emission mechanism is understandable and an element can be easily designed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Still furthermore, in the first emission region of the invention, without using a dopant, a layer that emits singularly may be applied. However, since the use of the dopant generally makes the emission efficiency higher, the dopant is preferably used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Furthermore, as mentioned above, since as a luminescent material in the first emission region a fluorescent material is preferable, it is the best to use a fluorescent material as the dopant in the first emission region. In that case, a plurality of kinds of dopants may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The element configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is one example of the invention and the element configuration, as far as it does not deviate from the gist of the invention, is not restricted thereto. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a configuration in which in the hole transport layer <b>111</b> the second dopant (phosphorescent material) is doped, and in the electron transport layer <b>112</b> the first dopant is doped (that is, in this case, the second emission region becomes <b>113</b> and the first emission region becomes <b>114</b>) may be formed. In this case, the gap layer <b>116</b> is necessarily constituted of a hole-transporting material and a recombination region of carriers is necessarily designed at an interface between the gap layer <b>116</b> and the electron transport layer <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Furthermore, though not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, between the anode <b>101</b> and the hole transport layer <b>111</b>, a hole injection layer or a hole transport layer made of a hole transport material other than the hole transport material <b>121</b> may be inserted. Still furthermore, between the cathode <b>102</b> and the electron transport layer <b>112</b>, an electron injection layer or an electron transport layer made of an electron transport material other than the electron transport material <b>122</b> may be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As mentioned above, the invention pays attention to a point that firstly an excitation state is formed in the first emission region and energy thereof is partially transferred to the second emission region. From such a viewpoint, like the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first emission region <b>113</b> is preferably designed more toward the anode than the second emission region <b>114</b>. This is because when at this time a hole block layer made of a hole block material is applied as the gap layer <b>116</b>, holes can be more effectively confined within the hole transport layer <b>111</b>; accordingly, the recombination region of the carriers can be decided to the first emission region <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A value of ionization potential of the hole block material is preferably larger by 0.4 eV or more than a value of ionization potential of a substance that has the largest ionization potential of substances contained in the first emission region <b>113</b>. Furthermore, when as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the first emission region <b>113</b> has a dopant, it is important that substantially a value of the ionization potential of the hole block material that is used in the gap layer <b>116</b> is larger (preferably larger by 0.4 eV or more) than a value of the ionization potential of the hole transport material <b>121</b> that is a host in the first emission region.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When an element is designed thus, it becomes easy to form an excitation state in the first emission region firstly and to partially transfer energy thereof to the second emission region. However, in the next, a distance d that governs the energy transfer thereof is necessary to be decided.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Firstly, when d is set at 1 nm or more, since a Dexter type energy transfer (energy transfer due to exchange of the wave motion of an electron) can be inhibited from occurring and thereby an energy transfer mechanism becomes solely due to the F&#xf6;rster type energy transfer, the abovementioned principle can be applied. Furthermore, when d is set at substantially 30 nm, even the energy transfer due to T<sub>D1</sub>&#x2192;T<sub>D2 </sub>described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> tends to decrease much. Accordingly, the d is preferably in the range of 1 nm or more and 30 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">However, in order to inhibit the phosphorescent material in the second emission region from directly trapping the holes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), the d is preferably set at 5 nm or more. Furthermore, a proper distance that makes the contribution of the energy transfer <b>211</b> of S<sub>D1</sub>&#x2192;T<sub>D2 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> smaller and further sufficiently causes the energy transfer <b>212</b> of T<sub>D1</sub>&#x2192;T<sub>D2 </sub>is substantially 5 to 20 nm. Accordingly, the d is more preferably 5 nm or more and 20 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the above, a principle that according to the present invention a white organic light-emitting element in which a reddish phosphorescent material is introduced can be realized was described. In the next place, a wavelength range preferable for obtaining a high-quality white emission color will be illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Firstly, an emission spectrum in the first emission region has at least one peak in a region of 400 nm or more and 500 nm or less or at least two peaks in a region of 400 nm or more and 560 nm or less. When this is combined with an emission color of a reddish phosphorescent material in the second emission region, white light can be realized. At this time, an emission spectrum of the phosphorescent material has only to be reddish, that is, to have at least one peak in a region of 560 nm or more and 700 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Furthermore, when for instance a first dopant that is capable of exhibiting the excimer emission is added to the first emission region, by optimizing a doping concentration, emission intrinsic to the first dopant and excimer emission thereof are allowed to simultaneously emit. Since the excimer emission is necessarily located on a longer wavelength side than the intrinsic emission, two emission peaks can be extracted from one substance. When this phenomenon and a reddish emission color in the second emission region are combined, an emission spectrum having peaks in the respective wavelength regions of R, G and B can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In what follows, materials that can be used in the invention will be specifically illustrated. However, materials that can be applied to the invention are not restricted thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As a hole injection material that is used in a hole injection layer, porphyrin base compounds are effective among organic compounds; that is, phthalocyanine (abbreviated as H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;Pc), copper phthalocyanine (abbreviated as Cu&#x2014;Pc) and so on can be used. Furthermore, there are materials obtained by applying the chemical doping to conductive polymers; that is, polyethylene dioxythiophene (abbreviated as PEDOT), polyaniline (abbreviated as PAni) and polyvinyl carbazole (abbreviated as PVK) that are doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid (abbreviated as PSS) can be used. Still furthermore, very thin films of inorganic insulators such as vanadium pentoxide and aluminum oxide are effective as well.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As a hole transport material for using a hole transporting layer, aromatic amine (that is, the one having a benzene ring-nitrogen bond) compounds are preferably used. For example, N,N&#x2032;-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N&#x2032;-diphenyl-1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl-4,4&#x2032;-diamine (abbreviated TPD) or derivatives thereof such as 4,4&#x2032;-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]-biphenyl (hereafter, referred to as &#x3b1;-NPD) is widely used. Also used are star burst aromatic amine compounds, including: 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris(N,N-diphenyl-amino)-triphenyl amine (hereafter, referred to as TDATA); and 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenyl-amino]-triphenyl amine (hereafter, referred to as &#x201c;MTDATA&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As electron transport materials for forming an electron transporting layer, in specific, metal complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolate)aluminum (abbreviated Alq<sub>3</sub>), tris(4-methyl-8-quinolinolate)aluminum (abbreviated Almq<sub>3</sub>), bis(10-hydroxybenzo[h]-quinolinato)beryllium (abbreviated BeBq<sub>2</sub>), bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolate)-(4-hydroxy-biphenylyl)-aluminum (abbreviated BAlq), bis [2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-benzooxazolate]zinc (abbreviated Zn(BOX)<sub>2</sub>), and bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-benzothiazolate]zinc (abbreviated Zn (BTZ)<sub>2</sub>). Besides, oxadiazole derivatives such as 2-(4-biphenyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (abbreviated PBD), and 1,3-bis[5-(p-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-yl]benzene (abbreviated OXD-7); triazole derivatives such as 3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviated TAZ) and 3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-(4-ethylphenyl)-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviated p-EtTAZ); imidazol derivatives such as 2,2&#x2032;,2&#x2033;-(1,3,5-benzenetryil)tris[1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole] (abbreviated TPBI); and phenanthroline derivatives such as bathophenanthroline (abbreviated BPhen) and bathocuproin (abbreviated BCP) can be used in addition to metal complexes.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Furthermore, as hole block materials that are useful as the materials for the abovementioned gap layer, abovementioned BAlq, OXD-7, TAZ, p-EtTAZ, TPBI, BPhen and BCP can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Still furthermore, as the luminescent materials in the first emission region, fluorescent materials having the hole transportability such as abovementioned TPD and &#x3b1;-NPD and fluorescent materials having the electron transportability such as Alq<sub>3</sub>, Almq<sub>3</sub>, BeBq<sub>2</sub>, BAlq, Zn(BOX)<sub>2 </sub>and Zn(BTZ)<sub>2 </sub>may be used. Furthermore, various kinds of fluorescent dyes such as quinacridone, N,N&#x2032;-dimethyl quinacridone, perylene, fluoranthene, and cumarine base dyes (such as cumarone 6) can be cited as dopant. Still furthermore, phosphorescent materials such as tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium (abbreviated as Ir(ppy)<sub>3</sub>) can be cited. All these exhibit an emission peak in 400 nm or more and 560 nm or less; accordingly, these can be preferably used as aluminescent material in the first emission region.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">On the other hand, as a luminescent material in the second emission region, an organometallic complex having iridium or platinum as a central metal is effective. Specifically, other than the abovementioned PtOEP, bis(2-(2&#x2032;-benzothienyl)pyridinato-N,C<sup>3&#x2032;</sup>) (acetylacetonato)iridium (abbreviated as btp<sub>2</sub>Ir(acac)), bis(2-(2&#x2032;-thienyl)pyridinato-N,C<sup>3&#x2032;</sup>(acetylacetonato)iridium (abbreviated as thp<sub>2</sub>Ir(acac)) and bis(2-(1-naphthyl)benzooxazolato-N,C<sup>2&#x2032;</sup>(acetylacetonato)iridium (abbreviated as bon<sub>2</sub>Ir(acac)) can be cited. All these are phosphorescent materials having a reddish (560 nm or more and 700 nm or less) emission peak and suitable as a luminescent material in the second emission region according tot the invention.</p>

That is, at a concentration of substantially 1 weight percent, perylene is dispersed in &#x3b1;-NPD. This co-deposited layer of 10 nm is a first emission region <b>313</b>.</p>
