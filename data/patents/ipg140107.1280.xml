<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an aerodynamic drag reducing apparatus for use with vehicles having downstream surfaces that are not streamlined. Examples include: over-the-road trucks and truck trailers, vans and minivans, motor homes and travel trailers, and pickup trucks. In vehicles such as pickup trucks, one non-streamlined surface is near the center of the vehicle. The present invention is suitable for use with vehicles having rear doors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known that a significant amount of aerodynamic drag is created when a vehicle travels at typical velocities on a modern roadway. This is partly due to areas of low pressure that act on the rear surfaces of the vehicle. The low pressure becomes more pronounced as airflow over the vehicle separates from the vehicle surfaces. The phenomenon of airflow separation is also well known in the design of aircraft wings and, in this case, causes the wing to stall.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vehicles with blunt rear ends are especially affected by airflow separation, often starting at the abrupt transition to the rear&#x2014;near vertical surface. The low pressure that the airflow separation causes is compounded by the relatively large area that the low pressure acts over as compared with more streamlined vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The low air pressure acting on the rear surfaces of a moving vehicle produces a force that resists the forward motion of the vehicle. This force is opposed by the vehicle's engine and requires power that is typically produced by burning fuel. Any reduction in aerodynamic drag results in a reduction in fuel consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a period of high fuel prices, increasing fuel efficiency is a growing concern. Aerodynamic improvements are especially valuable since they can be combined with other improvements such as engine efficiency and reduced chassis weight. Increasing fuel efficiency also provides the valuable benefit of increasing the range a given vehicle can travel between refueling.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention uses the technique of tapering the rear surfaces of a vehicle. The same technique is in use with other vehicles such as streamlined cars and airplanes. It has also been applied to over-the-road trucks where it is known as a &#x201c;boat-tail&#x201d;.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is concerned with providing an aerodynamic drag reducing apparatus, which reduces energy consumption as described above. More specifically, this is achieved by adding gently sloping surfaces downstream of rear facing surfaces of the vehicle with the goal of keeping the airflow attached. Keeping the airflow attached results in less aerodynamic drag and reduced fuel consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On certain vehicles, simply adding the required additional surfaces would result in a substantial increase to the vehicle length. This length would be acceptable in many cases on the open road in uncongested traffic, but would be impractical in crowded urban roadways, parking lots, campgrounds, and loading docks. To address this, the present invention has two primary configurations. The first is an extended configuration that reduces drag and fuel consumption, especially at highway speeds. The second is a retracted configuration that provides much less, if any, drag reduction, but results in a vehicle that is practical in crowded areas. This combination of configurations in the same apparatus is especially useful since zones of higher speed driving are often not congested. These high-speed zones are also where the drag reducing potential is the highest. Likewise, congested areas often have reduced speed with less drag reducing potential, but in these cases, the retracted configuration may be required for maneuvering in traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to easily and conveniently convert between the retracted configuration and the extended configuration, the present invention employs shapes that nest. The largest such shape is either attached or closest to the vehicle when the apparatus is in the extended configuration. The shapes gradually become smaller as their position in the extended configuration is farther from the vehicle. When extended, the collection of shapes either forms an enclosed or mostly enclosed volume or provides a framework that can be covered by a fabric. In the latter case, the combination of framework and fabric forms an enclosed or mostly enclosed volume.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further objective of the present invention is to provide a mechanism to support the nested shapes while they are retracted, extended, and in any transitional position. If fabric is used, it is also supported by the mechanism. This mechanism is comprised of a series of linkages between successive nested shapes. In certain forms of the invention, the linkages are spring-loaded which results in two stable configurations&#x2014;fully extended and fully retracted. This feature aids in keeping the apparatus in one of the two desired configurations. There are also features in the apparatus that prevent the various parts from reaching an undesired configuration, such as over-extension.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An optional feature of the present invention provides a method of motorizing the extension and retraction. This allows for the remote extension and retraction of the apparatus for convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another optional feature is covers that keep elements such as mud, snow, and ice from reaching and collecting on interior surfaces and parts of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To accommodate vehicles with rear doors, an optional feature of the present invention is to have the overall aerodynamic shape split into two halves. These halves can be opened, providing access to the rear doors of the vehicle. This optional feature requires a support panel or framework that holds the first nested shape and any optional motorized extension and retraction mechanism. The support panel is mounted on a hinge, linkage, or linear slide. The framework can be moved away from the rear door(s) of the vehicle to allow access. Alternatively, the rear door of the vehicle itself may be incorporated in the apparatus by serving as the support panel. An alternative to having the apparatus in two halves would be to have a single whole apparatus mounted on a support panel, door, or framework that is mounted on a hinge, linkage, or linear slide. In this case, the whole apparatus would be moved away from the rear door(s) of the vehicle.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2H</figref> show the linkage assembly and components. The linkage assemblies are used to hold the panel assemblies in place. In particular:</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a second perspective view showing the linkage assembly in its fully extended position.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> is a perspective view showing the linkage assembly in a collapsed position.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3F</figref> show several variations of the basic panel assembly and their features. These panel assembly variations are used together to form the basic apparatus. Each of the panel assemblies has provisions to mount several of the extension-retraction linkages mentioned above and are referred to as &#x201c;linkage assemblies&#x201d; when discussed below. These panels, in fact, become part of that linkage chain in the overall apparatus. When relative placements are discussed below, they are in reference to the placements in a fully extended apparatus. In the form shown in these figures, the panel assemblies each have provisions to guide an extension-retraction web. The web exerts forces on the guides that cause the apparatus to extend and retract. In particular:</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a perspective view showing the panel assembly farthest upstream. This panel assembly typically does not move during the extension and retraction of the apparatus. This panel assembly could be fixedly mounted on the support panel or mounting framework. It has provisions to rotatably mount several linkage assemblies, which hold the next panel assembly immediately downstream.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a perspective view showing a typical panel assembly representative of all panel assemblies in the basic apparatus with the exception of the farthest upstream and farthest downstream panel assemblies. These panel assemblies have provisions to rotatably mount two sets containing several linkage assemblies each. The first set is mounted toward the upstream edge of the panel assembly and is used to hold the linkage assembly that is also connected to the panel assembly immediately upstream. The second set is mounted in the interior of the panel assembly and is used to hold the linkage assembly that is also connected to the panel assembly immediately downstream. In this particular view, the two sets of mounts are at the same elevation. In the form shown, the panel assembly has notches to allow the upstream linkage assemblies to swing through their required range of motion. The notches, as shown here, are not visible from the exterior of the apparatus when it is fully deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> is a perspective view showing a variation of the typical panel assembly discussed in the preceding paragraph. The variation illustrated locates the upstream and downstream linkage mounts at different rather than the same elevation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> is a perspective view showing the panel assembly farthest downstream. It has provisions to rotatably mount several linkage assemblies. Each of these linkage assemblies also attach to the panel assembly immediately upstream. In the form shown, this panel has an extension-retraction, web-guiding feature in addition to two web mounting features. The first web-mounting feature holds the end of the web closest to the web guiding features in the panel assemblies. The second web-mounting feature holds the end of the web closest to the extension-retraction actuation motor. In the form shown, this panel assembly has notches to allow the linkage assemblies to swing through their required range of motion.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> is an enlarged partial perspective view of a typical panel assembly showing the pivoting linkage mounting surfaces and notches mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> is an enlarged partial section view of a typical panel assembly showing the linkage mounts, notches, and web guides mentioned above. The section cut is through the vertical center of the panel assembly and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3X</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3X</figref> is an elevation view showing the interior of a typical panel assembly. It also shows the section cut used to create <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref> show the extension-retraction web, its routing, related hardware, and attachment points. In particular:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a partial perspective view showing the web, the extension-retraction drive motor and pulley, the web corner pulley, and web-to-panel attachment points. The method of retracting the apparatus simply involves shortening the length of the longest straight section of web that attaches farthest downstream on the farthest downstream panel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a section view of a typical basic partially extended apparatus showing different configurations of link assemblies, the extension-retraction web routing, the web attachment points and web pulleys. It also shows a linkage extending past the usual boundary of the apparatus half. The section cut is through the vertical center of a typical apparatus and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4X</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a reduced scale version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> showing only the web and the centers of the web pulleys and centers of the panel web guides. The section cut is through the vertical center of a typical apparatus and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4X</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4X</figref> is an elevation view showing the interior of the apparatus. It also shows the section cut used to create <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a partial section view showing two linkage assemblies from end to end. The first linkage assembly is between a fully retracted pair of panel assemblies. The second linkage assembly is between a fully extended pair of panel assemblies. In both cases, the linkage assemblies themselves are fully extended. Since the linkage assemblies are spring-loaded to seek this fully extended configuration, the apparatus will seek either the extended or retracted configurations between each set of neighboring panels. The linkage assemblies also form a mechanical stop to keep the apparatus from over extending or over retracting, holding each pair of neighboring panels either in the extended or retracted position. This is very desirable since those two configurations are sought in operation, and movement drifting toward an intermediate position would either lose aerodynamic performance, if drifting from the extended configuration, or occupy more volume, if drifting from the retracted position. The view's section cut is taken through the linkage component that attaches to the upstream edge of the panel assemblies and is perpendicular to the pivot point within the linkage assembly. The section cut is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5X</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5X</figref> is an elevation view showing the interior of a typical panel assembly. It also shows the section cut used to create <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> illustrate the methods used to keep the various linkage assemblies from interfering with each other when transitioning between the extended and retracted configurations. In particular:</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a perspective view showing the smallest, most crowded two sets of panel assemblies, located farthest downstream and illustrates that staggering the elevation of the linkage assemblies lets each pass through the center plane without interfering with the opposing linkage assembly. It also shows that interference can be avoided by placing links that run in a horizontal plane lower than the operating range of links that run in a vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a partial perspective view showing two sets of adjacent panel assemblies and illustrates that interference can be avoided by placing links that run in a vertical plane farther inboard than the operating range of links that run in a horizontal plane.</p>

An aerodynamic fairing is also used to fill the gap between the non-planar rear of the vehicle and the apparatus. The right and left halves can be opened for access to the rear of the vehicle. These three perspective views are taken from the left rear corner of the vehicle and are shown with access to the rear doors of the minivan closed.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A through 12C</figref> show a form of the present invention mounted behind the passenger cab of a pickup truck in two configurations. In this form, the aerodynamic drag reducing apparatus extends and retracts as a single mechanism. In this form, the apparatus, when fully extended, covers a pocket in the vehicle producing an overall aerodynamic shape that significantly reduces drag. In this form, two sets of linear sliding joints are used, each at a different location, between adjacent panel assemblies. A linear sliding joint is also formed between the bottom surfaces of the apparatus and the top surfaces of the pickup box sides. The interior of the pickup truck box can be accessed by retracting the apparatus. A retracted apparatus allows rear visibility through the apparatus and serves as a sun-shielding louver as well. The extension-retraction web and its related features are not shown but could be included as described above. In particular:</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> is a perspective view from the left rear corner. The configuration shown is fully extended.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref> is a perspective view showing the interior of the apparatus in a fully extended configuration. The linkage assemblies shown in this form are optional and serve the purpose of driving each adjacent pair of panels into either the retracted or extended configuration as mentioned above in the discussion on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The linkage assembly also forms a travel-stop preventing over extension and over retraction. A pair of linkage assemblies and a connection between them also coordinates the movement between the right and left sides and reduces the chance of binding.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12F</figref> is a perspective view of two extension-retraction linkage assemblies with a straight shaft connection joining a corresponding pair of links together. This ensures coordinated, non-binding action on all forms of the apparatus, especially where the spacing between linkage assemblies is wide. The straight shaft connection shown in this view could be replaced with a flexible shaft connection in the case that the coordinated links do not share a common pivot centerline. A gear train connection including components such as U-joints, belts, pulleys, and bevel gears could also replace the straight shaft connection. This view shows two linkage assemblies being connected and therefore coordinated. Additional linkage assemblies could be added in series or in parallel. In this view, linkage assemblies from between the same panel assemblies are connected. Linkage assemblies that are not between the same panel assemblies could also be connected in series or in parallel. An actuator controlling multiple linkage assemblies could be added to the shaft or alternate connecting parts mentioned above.</p>

The present variation incorporates a smooth transition across the apparatus and the vehicle or trailer. The smooth transition, as shown in these figures, is formed into the panel assembly farthest upstream.

This panel assembly has curved surfaces that are tangent to their corresponding exterior trailer surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref> is a partial section view of a partially extended apparatus.

The linkage assemblies between the panel assembly farthest upstream and the adjacent panel assembly are specially designed to fit into the more compact space available when this form of the apparatus is in the retracted configuration. The section cut is through the vertical center of the apparatus and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14X</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F</figref> is a perspective view showing the panel assembly farthest upstream. It is similar to the panel assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> with the exception of the curved surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14G</figref> is a partial section view of a partially extended apparatus. It is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref> with the exception of a different apparatus extension configuration. The more compact linkage assembly mentioned above is shown at its closest point to the second farthest upstream panel assembly. Small notches were added to this panel assembly to allow the more compact linkage assemblies to swing through their required range of motion. The small notches are not visible from the exterior of the apparatus when it is fully deployed. The section cut is through the vertical center of the apparatus and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14X</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14H</figref> is a perspective view showing the more compact linkage assembly in its fully extended position. This linkage has the same spacing between its rotational mounts when fully extended as the less compact linkage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. It also has the same collapsing range. It could therefore replace the less compact linkage if small notches, as mentioned above, were added to the upstream edge of the remaining panel assemblies.</p>

The more compact linkage assembly mentioned above is shown at its closest point to the farthest upstream panel assembly. This view also illustrates the extension-retraction web routing between panel assemblies. If the web were drawn tighter in the areas shown in this view, the upstream edge of the downstream panel assemblies would be drawn towards the adjacent downstream edge of the upstream panel assemblies. This would have the cumulative effect of extending the apparatus. The section cut is through the vertical center of the apparatus and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14X</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14X</figref> is an elevation view showing the interior of the apparatus. It also shows the section cut used to create <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14E</figref>, <b>14</b>G, and <b>14</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A through 15L</figref> show an optional configuration consisting of covers added to the basic configuration. The covers serve two purposes. The first purpose is to cover the openings that expose the interior portions of the apparatus when it is in the fully retracted configuration. This is a valuable feature in that it keeps elements such as dirt, mud, snow, and ice from reaching and accumulating in the interior of the apparatus. At a certain amount, accumulations of such elements could interfere with the proper operation of the apparatus. The second purpose served by these covers is providing a smoother transition from the edge of one panel assembly to the panel assembly immediately downstream. With the exception of these covers and their related hinge lines, the components and their functions are identical to the basic form as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1I</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. As in the basic form, the aerodynamic drag reducing apparatus is in two halves, split right and left. The right and left halves open for access to the rear of the trailer. The slight changes required by these optional doors are further described below. In particular:</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> is a partial perspective view from the left rear corner. The configuration shown is fully extended with trailer doors closed. The optional covers are shown laying flat over the panel assembly immediately downstream.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> is a partial perspective view from the left rear corner. The configuration shown is fully retracted with trailer doors closed. The optional covers are shown with their interior surfaces laying near vertical and covering the opening that would otherwise be there.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref> is a perspective view showing the right apparatus fully extended. It is identical to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1I</figref> with the exception of the covers.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref> is an enlarged partial elevation view showing the interior of the right apparatus. This view illustrates the partial smoothing the covers provide over the joints between the panel assemblies. In the apparatus as shown, the panel assembly farthest downstream when the apparatus is fully extended is also shorter than the others in the downstream direction. This view illustrates that a smaller cover is used to cover the joint in front of the short panel.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref> is a partial elevation showing the interior of the right apparatus in a partially extended configuration. The view shows panel assemblies that are fully extended, partially extended, and fully retracted with respect to their immediate neighbor. The view also shows the covers in contact with the panel assembly immediately downstream. This view illustrates that the covers could be actuated by a simple torsional spring along their hinge line. As the apparatus extends, the panel assemblies will push the covers into their open position. As the apparatus retracts, the torsional springs will return the covers over the openings.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref> is a partial perspective view showing the exterior of the left apparatus.

In addition to these covers, corner covers are used to form completely smooth exterior corners when the apparatus is in the extended configuration. In addition to the features above, each panel assembly has an exterior surface that is shaped to blend in with the covers to form a completely smooth exterior surface when the apparatus is in the extended position. The covers with the exception of the corner covers also keep the elements from reaching the interior of the apparatus. As in the basic form, the aerodynamic drag reducing apparatus is in two halves, split right and left. The right and left halves open for access to the rear of the trailer. The modifications to the basic form required by the present form are further described below. In particular:</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A through 20E</figref> show a form of the present invention that substitutes hinged panels for the linkage assemblies such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The notches on the leading edge of the panel assemblies have also been removed. Instead of the notches, the entire upstream edge of the panel assembly has been trimmed, allowing the hinged panels connecting to the upstream panel assembly to occupy a small space in front of the upstream edge. In comparison, this reduces the overlap from one panel assembly to the next when fully deployed. The hinged panel assemblies are used on the top, bottom, right, and left sides. The five figures are all partial elevation views showing the interior of the left hand apparatus. The figures all show the highest hinged panel assembly in the fully retracted configuration and the lowest hinged panel assembly in the fully extended configuration. As with the linkage assemblies, the hinged panel assemblies could use springs and hinge stops to keep the apparatus stable in the fully extended and fully retracted positions. This form of the invention will allow a similar web extension-retraction system, providing the hinged panels assemblies are interrupted to allow the web to pass through. The term &#x201c;hinged panels&#x201d; is used for descriptive purposes. In fact, the &#x201c;hinged panels&#x201d; are linkage assemblies in their own right. The hinged panels could range in length from rather short to close to the length of the corresponding panel assembly. The minimum workable length for each successive group of hinged panels is determined by strength considerations. The maximum workable length is determined by the need to avoid interference with the panel assemblies in all configurations. In particular:</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> shows the center hinged panel assembly in the fully retracted configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> shows the center hinged panel assembly in the slightly extended configuration.</p>

<p id="p-0186" num="0185"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A through 21O</figref> show a form of the present invention that is completely smooth on its exterior surface when the apparatus is in the extended configuration. The present form incorporates a smooth transition across the apparatus and the vehicle or trailer similar to, but more gradual than, those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A through 14G</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A through 16J</figref>. This form also uses covers similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A through 15I</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A through 16M</figref>. Furthermore, this form incorporates corner covers similar in purpose to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A through 16F</figref>, but hinging on the panel assemblies rather than the horizontal and vertical covers. The gradual transition from the vehicle surfaces occurs over several of the farthest upstream panel assemblies and results in the panel assemblies being closer to each other. As the transition is made more gradual, the affected panels become closer to each other. At some point, practical linkage assemblies cannot be made compact enough to fit in-between the panel assemblies in the retracted configuration. This form of the invention addresses this limitation by replacing the affected linkage assemblies with those shown in the figures below. As in the basic form, the aerodynamic drag reducing apparatus is in two halves, split right and left. The right and left halves open for access to the rear of the trailer. The modifications to the basic form required by the present form are further described below. In particular:</p>

<p id="p-0221" num="0220"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A through 24D</figref> illustrate a form of the present invention where the rigid components form only a framework and not an enclosed volume when fully extended. The aerodynamic shape is formed by fabric (not shown in these figures) which is attached to and takes its shape from the framework. All of the previously mentioned forms of the invention may be adapted to serve as a framework used in conjunction with fabric. A particular form with the apparatus split in two halves, right and left, was chosen for the purpose of illustration. In particular:</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms, there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described a presently preferred embodiment with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiment illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The embodiment presented is also shown in various forms and shapes and with various optional features in various combinations. These variations also are exemplifications of the invention and are not intended to limit the combinations of forms, shapes, and optional features.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">It should be further understood that the title of this section of this specification, namely, &#x201c;Detailed Description of the Invention&#x201d;, relates to a requirement of the United States Patent Office, and does not imply, nor should be inferred to limit the subject matter disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Referring now to the figures, in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1E</figref> and <b>1</b>G, there is shown an exemplary over-the-road trailer <b>1</b> with an enclosed cargo holding area <b>1</b><i>a</i>. On the back end of the trailer <b>1</b>, a left hand apparatus <b>2</b> and a right hand apparatus <b>3</b> are mounted and shown in various configurations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1F</figref>, <b>1</b>H, and <b>1</b>I show the right hand apparatus in detail in various configurations including a rear door <b>9</b> of the trailer <b>1</b> which, in this embodiment, serves as a mounting platform for the right hand apparatus <b>3</b> and is also part of the apparatus <b>3</b>. The left hand apparatus <b>2</b> is a mirror image of the right hand apparatus <b>3</b>. For gaining access to the cargo holding area <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the trailer <b>1</b>, the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are opened as typical trailer doors.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">If the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are symmetric in a vertical direction, as they are shown here, they can be identical with each other. In this case, the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are simply assembled to the trailer <b>1</b> upside down from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">There are trailers and other vehicles that neither have rear doors nor need access to the rear of the vehicle. For these applications, the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> could be combined together, joined at their common edges. This would result in fewer parts and less weight.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1F</figref>, <b>1</b>H, and <b>1</b>I reveal other features of a typical apparatus <b>2</b> or <b>3</b> in addition to the door/mounting platform <b>9</b>. In this section of the disclosure, the placement position of the features and components is described with respect to a fully deployed apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1I</figref>. Immediately behind and fixedly connected to the door/mounting platform <b>9</b> are an optional extension-retraction system <b>10</b> and the first panel assembly <b>5</b>. A plurality of intermediate panel assemblies <b>6</b>, each having a different size but sharing the same features, follows the first panel assembly <b>5</b>. The last panel assembly <b>7</b> immediately follows the last intermediate panel assembly <b>6</b>. Connecting the various panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> to each other are sets of extension-retraction linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b>. Linkage assemblies <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> perform the same function, but linkage assembly <b>8</b> is narrower in the direction of its pivot axis and is used between the rearward panel assemblies <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> where there is less available space.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">A set of extension-retraction linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> holds each intermediate panel assembly <b>6</b> to the panel assembly <b>5</b> or <b>6</b> immediately in front of it. A second set of linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> holds each intermediate panel assembly <b>6</b> to the panel assembly <b>6</b> or <b>7</b> immediately to its rear. In this way, all panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> are held to each other in series with a set of linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> between each. The linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> in each set allow linear movement between each panel assembly <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, or <b>7</b> and its neighbor(s). To accomplish the linear movement, at least two linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> are required in each set. Each linkage assembly <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> by itself constrains the panel assembly <b>6</b> or <b>7</b> connected to its rear to move in a plane perpendicular to its joint axes of rotation. If two linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> have corresponding axes that are collinear, the panel assembly <b>6</b> or <b>7</b> is still constrained to move in a perpendicular plane. However, if the corresponding axes are coplanar, but not collinear, a second planar constraint is formed. In this case, the two planar constraints combine to form a linear constraint at their common intersection. This is the method the present invention employs. Additional linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> may be used to distribute the loads transferred between panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, or <b>7</b> among more connection locations.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2H</figref>, the extension-retraction linkage assembly <b>4</b> and its components and features are shown. The linkage assembly <b>4</b> consists of two links <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> that rotatably connect to each other with the cylindrical surface <b>16</b> of link <b>11</b> forming a joint with the cylindrical surface <b>18</b> of link <b>12</b>. This joint is constrained such that it effectively rotates about the common centerlines of the above surfaces. Provisions are made that effectively restrict any linear movement along the common centerlines. A torsional spring <b>13</b> is also included along the above joint that tends to cause the cylindrical surfaces <b>14</b> and <b>20</b> at the ends of the linkage assembly <b>4</b> to extend away from each other. To keep the linkage assembly <b>4</b> from overextending, a stop <b>17</b> is provided on link <b>11</b> that contacts a surface <b>21</b> on link <b>12</b>. Unless an external force is acting on the linkage assembly <b>4</b>, the spring <b>13</b> keeps the stop <b>17</b> and stop surface <b>21</b> in contact with each other with a certain amount of preload. The various features of link <b>11</b> are held in place by one or more link arms <b>15</b>. The various features of link <b>12</b> are held together by one or more link arms <b>19</b>. When assembled, the centerlines of the cylindrical surfaces <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b> are all parallel with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">The extension-retraction linkage assembly <b>4</b> also connects to the various panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> as mentioned above and described below. Panel assemblies <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> have interior cylindrical surfaces <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> that rotatably connect to cylindrical surface <b>14</b> of link <b>11</b>. Likewise, panel assemblies <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> have cylindrical surfaces <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> towards their upstream edge that rotatably connect to cylindrical surface <b>20</b> of link <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3C</figref>, <b>3</b>E, and <b>3</b>F, the centerlines of surfaces <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> are coplanar, but not collinear. Likewise, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B through 3F</figref>, the centerlines of <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are coplanar, but not collinear. This geometry satisfies the above requirement to produce linear movement between adjacent panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> when used with two or more linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> are each constructed from a set of panels <b>22</b> that also locate the various features described above. Notches <b>29</b> are cut into the upstream edge of the panels <b>22</b> as required to provide clearance with the linkage assemblies <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> as they travel through their range of motion.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">There are other benefits provided by the linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> and panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> when used together as described above. One is the travel-stop function that keeps the panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> from over retracting and over extending. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates this by showing two linkage assemblies <b>4</b> extended against their respective stops <b>17</b>. The pair of panel assemblies <b>6</b> shown higher in the figure is fully extended and is prevented from extending farther by the stop <b>17</b> on the linkage assembly <b>4</b>. Likewise, the lower pair of panel assemblies <b>6</b> are fully retracted and prevented from retracting farther by the stop <b>17</b>. A second benefit is the self-return function. When each linkage assembly <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> is spring loaded against its stop <b>17</b>, each pair of panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> connected to them has only two stable positions&#x2014;fully extended and fully retracted. If the pair of panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> are put in another configuration and released, the spring <b>13</b> will return the pair to one of the two stable positions. This feature allows the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> to be set in an extended or retracted configuration and keep this position until the opposite configuration is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">If desired, an optional feature can be incorporated on the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> that allows for remote, powered extension and retraction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref> illustrate this extension-retraction system <b>10</b> as applied to the current form. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14K</figref> also illustrates this extension-retraction system as applied to a similar form. The larger scale of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14K</figref> shows the routing of the extension-retraction web <b>10</b><i>a </i>more clearly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> shows a typical panel assembly <b>6</b> cross-section and highlights the web routing features <b>25</b> and <b>28</b>. To operate the extension-retraction system <b>10</b>, a drive motor <b>32</b> rotates a connected drive pulley <b>33</b>, which moves a web <b>10</b><i>a </i>in one direction when turning clockwise and the opposite direction when turning counter-clockwise. As shown, the web is kept under tension by a pair of tensioning pulleys <b>35</b> which also serve to keep most of the drive pulley <b>33</b> in contact with the web <b>10</b><i>a</i>. A corner idler pulley <b>34</b> is also employed near the joint between the first panel assembly <b>5</b> and the trailer door/mounting platform <b>9</b>. The web <b>10</b><i>a </i>is attached on each end to the last panel assembly <b>7</b>. One end is attached at a downstream connection point <b>31</b>, and the opposite end is attached at an upstream connection point <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">The operation of the extension-retraction system <b>10</b> is described below. If retraction is desired, the drive motor <b>32</b> is made to turn counter-clockwise as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. This causes a tension increase in the section of web <b>10</b><i>a </i>between the drive motor pulley <b>33</b> and web connection point <b>31</b>. The increase in tension pulls the last panel assembly <b>7</b> towards the first panel assembly <b>5</b>. Since the panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> and linkage assemblies <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> are connected in series, the entire linkage-panel chain feels a force pulling it towards the first panel assembly <b>5</b>. At a certain point as the tension force increases, the spring <b>13</b> preload forces in a certain set of linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> are overcome. This causes the pair of panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, or <b>7</b> on either side of the overcome set of linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> to switch to a retracted configuration. As the drive motor <b>32</b> continues to turn, the panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> each switch to a retracted configuration until the entire apparatus <b>2</b> or <b>3</b> is in the retracted configuration. With certain options described below, it may be desirable to have the panels retract in a predetermined sequence. To accomplish this, the linkage preload springs <b>13</b> may be customized for each linkage assembly <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> set putting weaker springs on those sets that are desired to retract first and stronger springs on those sets that are desired to retract last.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">If it is desired to extend the apparatus <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, the drive motor <b>32</b> is made to turn clockwise as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. This causes a tension increase in the section of web <b>10</b><i>a </i>between the drive motor pulley <b>33</b> and the web connection point <b>30</b>. The increase in web <b>10</b><i>a </i>tension between web routing features <b>25</b> and <b>28</b> on the same panel assembly <b>6</b> is reacted by internal stresses within the panel assembly <b>6</b>. The increase in web tension between panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> results in a force pulling the upstream edge of the downstream panel assembly <b>6</b> or <b>7</b> toward the downstream edge of the upstream panel assembly. This force is initially resisted by the spring <b>13</b> preload force in the linkage assemblies <b>4</b> and <b>8</b>. At a certain point as the tension force increases, the spring <b>13</b> preload force in a certain set of linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> is overcome. This causes the pair of panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, or <b>7</b> on either side of the overcome set of linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> to switch to an extended configuration. As the drive motor <b>32</b> continues to turn, the panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> each switch to an extended configuration until the entire apparatus <b>2</b> or <b>3</b> is in the extended configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">A benefit of the extension-retraction system <b>10</b> as described above is that the routing length of the web <b>10</b><i>a </i>remains nominally the same regardless of the configuration of the panel assemblies. This avoids the need for a web <b>10</b><i>a </i>take up and storage system.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">If a larger radius on the web guiding features <b>25</b> and <b>28</b> within the panel assemblies <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> is required, either the panel assembly can be made thicker or the features <b>25</b> and <b>28</b> could be made to protrude outside the existing panel assembly <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> boundary. The protrusion could either be covered or left open to the environment. This will likely cause a small increase in drag, but may render the present invention more robust.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">A space is reserved for the extension-retraction motor <b>32</b>, drive pulley <b>33</b>, tensioning pulleys <b>35</b>, and related mounting hardware by making the last panel assembly <b>7</b> shorter in depth than the other panel assemblies <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. When retracted, the last panel assembly <b>7</b> is positioned to the rear of the drive motor <b>32</b>, but remains within the overall contours of the retracted apparatus <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. In the case that the extension-retraction system <b>10</b> is not used, or in the case that the form of the invention provides a space for the motor <b>32</b> and its related items to occupy (as with apparatuses <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>, and <b>72</b>), the panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> should be the same depth to minimize the volume required in the retracted configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Each apparatus may require its own extension-retraction system <b>10</b>. It would also be possible for one apparatus <b>2</b> or <b>3</b> to drive the other apparatus <b>2</b> or <b>3</b>. This could be done by forming some type of connection such as pins and pinholes across the halves. These connections could also provide structural reinforcing from one half to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, vortex generators <b>36</b> may be added to the exterior of certain panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>. Vortex generators <b>36</b> are formed by adding a relatively small protrusion to the exterior surfaces. Their purpose is to add a small amount of turbulence to the airflow in their local area in the form of a small vortex. The goal of adding turbulence is keeping the airflow attached over a larger area of the exterior of the apparatus <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. If the vortex generators <b>36</b> are added sufficiently downstream on the panel assemblies <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, they will tuck inside the adjacent upstream panel assemblies <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> when the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are retracted.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">The descriptions above focused on a basic form and shape of the present invention and included certain optional features. The basic form above is thought to provide the lowest cost solution with acceptable performance for over-the-road trailers <b>1</b> and also provide access to the enclosed trailer volume <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Just as vehicles and trailers come in various forms and are operated in many different environments with many different requirements, there are also different adaptations of the present invention. Some of these will be discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">There are known trailer skirts <b>39</b> that may be added to over-the-road trailers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8D</figref>. These trailer skirts <b>39</b> could be combined with the present invention in the basic form described above and exemplified by apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. However, a greater reduction in aerodynamic drag could be achieved by employing the trailer skirts <b>39</b> in combination with vertically lengthened apparatuses <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8D</figref>. These apparatuses <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> differ from the basic apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> only by an increase in the length of the vertical panels <b>22</b>. It may be desirable to add additional linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> along the length of these extended panels <b>22</b> to further distribute the load.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Upon testing, it may be found that significant airflow separation occurs somewhere along the length of the fully extended apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. Testing may also reveal that there is little benefit provided by extending the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> until a vertex is formed, and the extra weight and cost is not worth the small benefit. Highway regulations may also limit the maximum length of the vehicle of trailer. In these cases, it may be desirable to use a truncated form of the apparatuses <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A through 9D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Upon testing, it may be found that better aerodynamic performance is gained by reducing the slope of one or more surfaces. This can be accomplished by replacing the linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> and related attachment points <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> and notches <b>29</b> with linear sliding joints as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A through 10G</figref> on apparatuses <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>. To accomplish this, the panel assembly <b>44</b> is fitted with a key <b>45</b> and way <b>46</b> that engage the key <b>45</b> and way <b>46</b> of adjacent panel assemblies <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">In addition to over-the-road trailers <b>1</b>, the present invention may be adapted to other vehicles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11I</figref> show a form suitable for use behind a minivan <b>51</b>. The left hand apparatus <b>52</b> and right hand apparatus <b>53</b> have panel assemblies <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> of mixed shapes that allow them to blend to the contours of the minivan <b>51</b>. The panel assembly <b>56</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11H</figref> transitions from one shape to another. The concept of transitioning shapes across a panel assembly <b>56</b>, as illustrated here, can also be applied to other forms of the invention. The only limitations to this are that the panel assemblies must nest within each other when the apparatuses <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> are retracted, the mating edges must meet when the apparatuses <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> are deployed, and the linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> must have adequate clearance over their required range of motion.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">In the case of the minivan <b>51</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11C</figref> and <b>11</b>F, the rear surfaces are not vertical and do not meet with the apparatuses <b>52</b> and <b>53</b>. To provide a smooth transition from the minivan to the apparatuses <b>52</b> and <b>53</b>, an aerodynamic fairing <b>54</b> is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">In addition to vehicles that have blunt rear surfaces as described above, vehicles such as pickup trucks <b>61</b> may benefit from the present invention. Pickup trucks <b>61</b> typically have blunt rear facing surfaces behind the passenger cab. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A through 12C</figref>, a form of the apparatus <b>62</b> may be employed. This form of the invention also employs linear sliding joints with keys <b>45</b> and ways <b>46</b> as described earlier on two surfaces of each panel assembly <b>65</b>, <b>66</b>, and <b>67</b> that are shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12E and 12G</figref> through <b>12</b>I.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">In this form, the linkage assembly <b>63</b> is optional. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12F</figref>, the linkage assembly <b>63</b> is comprised of two linkage assemblies <b>4</b> in combination with a straight shaft connection <b>64</b> between them. This is useful to coordinate the motion of one or more linkage assemblies <b>4</b> that are separated by a distance. This form of linkage assembly <b>63</b> may also be employed on other forms of the invention between two or more linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> that have collinear joints axes. A flexible shaft connection could be used in forms of the invention that have non-collinear joints. A gear train connection could also be used to coordinate movement between various linkage assemblies. The linkage assemblies could be between the same or different sets of panels. An actuator could power one or more of these connected linkage assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">If the linkage assembly <b>63</b> is used with apparatus <b>62</b>, it could provide the benefits of a self-return function and a travel-stop function, as described above. In addition to vehicles that have predominately horizontal and vertical exterior surfaces as described above, the present invention may be adapted to vehicles with other shapes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B through 13K</figref> show a form suitable for use behind a tanker trailer <b>71</b> with an elliptical cross-section. In this case, no access to the rear of the trailer <b>71</b> is required. Thus the apparatus <b>72</b> is made as a whole and not in halves.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">The panel assemblies <b>75</b>, <b>76</b>, and <b>77</b> are made in the general shape of the tanker trailer <b>71</b>. The panel assembly <b>77</b> farthest downstream in the extended configuration is formed with a smooth capping surface. The linkage assemblies <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> are used in sets of three. Correspondingly, three sets of linkage mounting surfaces <b>79</b> and <b>80</b> are provided to attach the linkage assemblies <b>4</b> and <b>8</b>. Shallow grooves <b>78</b> are cut into the panel assemblies <b>75</b> and <b>76</b> to allow the linkage assemblies <b>4</b> or <b>8</b> to move through their required range of motion.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">To smooth the transition from the tanker trailer <b>71</b> to the apparatus <b>72</b>, an aerodynamic fairing <b>73</b> is employed. The fairing <b>73</b> also covers a domed surface at the rear of the tanker trailer <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">A modification to the basic form of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A through 14K</figref> that provides for a smooth transition from the exterior surfaces of the over-the-road trailer <b>1</b> to the apparatuses <b>82</b> and <b>83</b>. This form of the apparatuses <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> has all the same components and features as the basic apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> except for those specifically mentioned in the conversion process below. Apparatuses <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> will reduce drag, but will cost more to produce. To convert apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> into apparatuses <b>82</b> and <b>83</b>, several steps are required. To begin, the first panel assembly <b>5</b> is replaced by the first panel assembly <b>85</b>. Next, the panel assembly <b>6</b> adjacent to the first panel assembly <b>85</b> is replaced by panel assembly <b>86</b>. Finally, the first set of linkage assemblies <b>4</b> are replaced by a set of linkage assemblies <b>84</b>, and the extension-retraction corner pulley <b>34</b> is moved slightly. The first panel assembly <b>85</b> has curved surfaces that blend the overall slope of the apparatuses <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> with the trailer <b>1</b>. This creates a slightly smaller space for the extension-retraction linkage assembly <b>84</b> to occupy. This is addressed by using link <b>88</b> and link <b>89</b> in the linkage assembly <b>84</b>, resulting in a lower profile. A torsional spring <b>81</b> is used to spring load the linkage assembly <b>84</b> into the extended position. Panel assembly <b>86</b> differs from panel assembly <b>6</b> only by small notches <b>87</b> that are required to allow the linkage assembly <b>84</b> to operate through its range of motion.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Optional doors <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, and <b>93</b> may be added to the basic apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A through 15F</figref>. These doors serve two functions but add cost and complexity to the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. The first function is keeping mud, snow, ice, and other debris out of the interior of the apparatuses when they are in the retracted configuration by covering up the openings between the panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>. The second function is providing a smoother transition across the panel assembly joints when in the extended configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>. The latter will reduce drag. The doors <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, and <b>93</b> are actuated by a spring-loaded hinge <b>94</b> that tends to rotate them to a closed position. As the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> extend, the panel assemblies <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> simply overpower the spring-loaded hinges <b>94</b> and open the doors. The sequence that the panel assemblies <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> open is important when the optional doors <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, and <b>93</b> are present. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref>, the upstream panel assemblies <b>6</b> should extend sequentially before each downstream panel assembly <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> to avoid having the tips of the doors <b>90</b> and <b>91</b> caught in the hinge area of the doors <b>90</b> and <b>91</b> below it. As described above, this can be accomplished by putting stiffer springs <b>13</b> on the downstream linkage assemblies <b>4</b> and <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">A modification to the basic form of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A through 16J</figref> that provides for a smooth transition from the exterior surfaces of the over-the-road trailer <b>1</b> to the apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> and between the panel assemblies <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> when fully extended. This modification consists of a pair of first panel assemblies <b>105</b> having essentially the same form and features as the pair of first panel assemblies <b>85</b> described above. In addition, a set of linkage assemblies <b>84</b> connects the first panel assemblies <b>105</b> to the corresponding panel assemblies <b>106</b>. Furthermore, the exterior shape of panel assemblies <b>106</b> is modified from panel assemblies <b>6</b>. Doors <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> are added and serve a similar function to the doors <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, and <b>93</b> as described in the preceding paragraph. Finally, corner covers <b>112</b> provide a smooth shape to the corners of the apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> when fully extended. In this form, the invention will produce a greater drag reduction, but at a greater cost and complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16H</figref>, the doors <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> combine with the exterior surfaces of the panel assemblies <b>106</b> to form a smooth contour along the exterior of the apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> when fully extended with the exception of the corners. The doors <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> are actuated in a similar fashion to the doors <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, and <b>93</b> mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The doors <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>, in a fully extended configuration, do not reach the corner of the apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>. This leaves a small portion of the corner uncovered similar to the corner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. Corner covers <b>112</b> can be attached to the doors <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> to cover the corners in a smooth manner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16K through 16M</figref>. The hinge <b>94</b> between the corner covers <b>112</b> and the door <b>110</b> or <b>111</b> is spring-loaded and tends to return to the fully extended configuration. When the apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> retract, the corner cover <b>112</b> pushes against the neighboring corner cover <b>112</b>, and they both fold into the retracted configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16M</figref>. This results in the corner covers <b>112</b> protruding the farthest downstream when the apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> are fully retracted. The corner covers <b>112</b> are optional, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16G and 16J</figref> are shown without them.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Different methods may be employed to gain access to the rear of the vehicle or trailer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> show hinges <b>118</b> connecting the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> to the trailer <b>1</b>. This type of connection has been implied above.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> show a telescoping linear slide <b>121</b> connecting the apparatuses <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> to the trailer <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, the apparatuses <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> differ from the basic apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> only because they have a linear slide feature <b>124</b> on them. The telescoping linear slide <b>121</b> has trailer attachment points <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A through 19G</figref> illustrate articulating links <b>127</b>, <b>128</b>, and <b>129</b> that move the apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> from a closed position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19C</figref>, to a fully open position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19B and 19G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">A modification to the basic form of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A through 20E</figref> that replaces the linkage assemblies <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> with straight links (or hinged panels) <b>133</b> and <b>134</b>. The simplicity of the straight links <b>133</b> and <b>134</b> may result in a lower overall cost for this form of the invention compared to the basic form, exemplified by apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. However, the reduced cost sacrifices the robust travel-stop function as described above. The door/mounting platform <b>131</b> is essentially the same as the door/mounting platform <b>9</b> described above. The panel assemblies <b>132</b> and <b>135</b> replace panel assemblies <b>6</b> and <b>5</b> respectively. The panel assemblies <b>132</b> and <b>135</b> have significantly smaller pivoting surfaces <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> in a slightly different location. The notches <b>29</b> are removed from panel assembly <b>132</b>, which is instead trimmed to a shorter depth than panel assembly <b>135</b>. This allows the straight links <b>134</b> to sit in a gap upstream from the upstream edge of the panel assemblies <b>132</b> when the apparatus is in the fully retracted configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">A modification to the basic form of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A through 21O</figref> that provides for a smooth transition from the exterior surfaces of the over-the-road trailer <b>1</b> to the apparatuses <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> and between panel assemblies, <b>201</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>207</b> when fully extended. In the present form, a more gradual transition is possible than those described above in apparatuses <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>102</b>, and <b>103</b>. This is possible because the transition occurs over two panel assemblies <b>201</b> and <b>205</b>. This concept could also be used to extend the transition over three or more panel assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">When making a gradual transition over multiple panel assemblies <b>201</b> and <b>205</b>, the panel assemblies <b>201</b> and <b>205</b> end up closer to each other in the retracted configuration as compared to the basic form in apparatuses <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. At some point, a practical linkage assembly <b>4</b> will no longer fit between the panel assemblies <b>201</b> and <b>205</b>. The present form of the invention resolves this problem by using linkage assemblies <b>204</b> and <b>208</b> of a different form to connect the first three panel assemblies <b>205</b>, <b>201</b>, and <b>206</b>. These linkage assemblies <b>204</b> and <b>208</b> fit in front of the panel assemblies <b>201</b> and <b>206</b> when the apparatuses <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> are fully retracted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21M and 21N</figref>. To conserve space, linkage assembly <b>208</b> nests inside of linkage assembly <b>204</b>. This concept could be extended to three or more linkage assemblies as well.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Linkage assemblies <b>204</b> connect to the first panel assembly <b>205</b> near its upstream edge at pivot points <b>234</b> and <b>235</b>. On the other end, linkage assemblies <b>204</b> connect to the second panel assembly <b>201</b> near its upstream edge at pivot points <b>236</b> and <b>237</b>. Pivot points <b>236</b> and <b>237</b> are also used by linkage assemblies <b>208</b> to connect the second panel assembly <b>201</b> to the third panel assembly <b>206</b> near its upstream edge at pivot points <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>. This results in the second panel assembly <b>201</b> not being in the linkage chain, but merely attaching to linkage pivot points.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">The panel assemblies <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> downstream from the gradual transition area retain the same pivot features <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> as the panel assemblies <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>86</b>, and <b>106</b> used in the apparatuses <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>102</b> previously described. Likewise, linkage assemblies <b>4</b> are used in conjunction with these downstream panel assemblies <b>206</b> and <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A through 22E</figref>, the linkage assemblies <b>204</b> and <b>208</b> use a stop pocket <b>223</b> and stop protrusion <b>224</b> to prevent over travel. The stop pockets <b>223</b> are placed in links <b>221</b> and <b>225</b> and the stop protrusions <b>224</b> are placed in links <b>222</b> and <b>226</b>. In addition to the travel stop function, the stop pocket <b>223</b> and stop protrusion <b>224</b> together perform a detent function. This is done by having the stop pocket <b>223</b> deeper at the end of the travel range. The stop protrusions <b>224</b> are spring-loaded and thus move into these detents. The result is that the apparatuses <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> are stable in the fully retracted and fully extended configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">The present form of the invention incorporates vertical covers <b>210</b> and horizontal covers <b>211</b> in much the same way as apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>. They serve the function of keeping debris out of the apparatuses <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> when they are in the closed configuration. When in the extended configuration, the covers smooth the transition between panel assemblies <b>201</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Corner covers <b>212</b> are also used in the present form of the invention. These corner covers <b>212</b> have a single hinge line <b>94</b> connecting them to the corresponding panel assemblies <b>201</b>, <b>205</b>, and <b>206</b>. The primary function of the corner covers <b>212</b> is to form a smooth surface near the corners when the apparatuses <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> are fully extended.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">To assist in keeping the panel assemblies <b>201</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>207</b> properly aligned with each other when the apparatuses <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> are fully extended, optional guides <b>220</b> are incorporated along the leading edge of the panel assemblies <b>201</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>207</b>. These guides contact the inside surfaces of the downstream edge of the panel assemblies <b>205</b>, <b>201</b>, and <b>206</b> immediately upstream. The trailer door <b>209</b> accommodates the guides <b>220</b> belonging to the second and third panel assemblies <b>201</b> and <b>206</b> with appropriate pockets.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">An alternative to the linkage assemblies <b>204</b> and <b>208</b> would be to use linear slides <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10E</figref>, <b>10</b>F, and <b>10</b>G.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">An alternative form of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A through 24D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A through 25D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A through 26F</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A through 27J</figref>. In the present form, one or more of the panel assemblies <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>65</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>67</b>, <b>75</b>, <b>76</b>, <b>77</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>135</b>, <b>201</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>207</b> belonging to a previous form of the invention are replaced by a corresponding framework <b>305</b> and <b>306</b>. The framework <b>305</b> and <b>306</b> retains the attachment points <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>235</b>, <b>236</b>, and <b>237</b> connecting to the linkage assemblies <b>4</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>208</b>. The function and operation of the linkage assemblies remain the same as in the previous corresponding form. Likewise, the optional extension-retraction system <b>10</b> is retained by the present form, including web routing features <b>25</b> and <b>28</b> and web connecting features <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>. To provide an aerodynamic surface, fabric <b>308</b> is connected to the framework <b>305</b> and <b>306</b> and, in some cases, to panel assemblies <b>304</b> and <b>307</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">An example of the present form of the invention (excluding the fabric <b>308</b>) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> fully extended and attached to the rear of an over-the-road trailer <b>1</b>. If the fabric <b>308</b> were included in this view, the appearance and exterior shape would be similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>. As in earlier forms, this exemplary form has the aerodynamic drag reducing apparatus split in two halves, right <b>303</b> and left <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">The fabric <b>308</b> attaches to the framework <b>305</b> and <b>306</b> at the trailing edge. When fully extended, the framework <b>305</b> and <b>306</b> provide shape and support to the fabric. When partially extended and when fully retracted, the fabric <b>308</b> takes the form of a bellows as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A through 27C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27F through 27H</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Optionally, it may be desired to have the fabric <b>308</b> drawn into the spaces in between the frameworks <b>305</b> and <b>306</b> and panel assemblies <b>304</b> and <b>307</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26D</figref>. In this case, elastic members can be attached between various points on the fabric <b>308</b> and the frameworks <b>305</b> and <b>306</b> and panel assemblies <b>304</b> and <b>307</b>. When fully extended, the elastic members are overcome by the extension forces and the bellows shape is lost. An alternative method would be to embed elastic members into the fabric <b>308</b>. In this case, the fabric <b>308</b> would take a bellows shape when no external loads were present. An additional alternative method would be to attach the fabric farther upstream than the trailing edge of the framework.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">The fabric <b>308</b> serves several potential functions. The first is to provide all or part of the aerodynamic surface when the apparatus is fully extended. A second function is to carry tensile and shear loads when the apparatus <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> is fully extended. A third is to protect the joints of the linkage assemblies from the elements. A fourth is to provide an optional means for extending and retracting the apparatus. This is done by the fabric <b>308</b> serving as a bladder. To extend the apparatus <b>302</b> and <b>303</b>, this bladder is filled with air. To retract the bladder, the air is evacuated.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">The fabric <b>308</b> may be airtight or it may be porous. The fabric may be stiff or it may be stretchable.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">In the present disclosure, the words &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; are to be taken to include both the singular and the plural. Conversely, any references to plural items shall, where appropriate, include the singular.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">In the present disclosure, many features are described with respect to the theoretical design. For instance, &#x201c;completely smooth&#x201d; refers to the theoretical design shape. It is understood that imperfections exist and clearances are required in real parts. In these cases, such terms are used to distinguish the differences between theoretical designs.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">It is desirable for drag reducing devices in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure to be shaped to reduce the effects of air flow separation. In certain example embodiments, drag reducing devices in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure may define an angle &#x3b8; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21F</figref>) relative to the rear surface of the vehicle that is less than 18 degrees, or in the range of 10 to 18 degrees. As the drag reducing devices extend in a rearward direction relative to the vehicle, the drag reducing devices may be straight as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1I</figref>. Alternatively, the drag reducing devices may include at least portions having segments angled relative to one another at progressively steeper angles as the devices extend in a rearward direction. In still other embodiments, at least portions of the drag reducing devices may curve as the devices extend rearwardly from their corresponding vehicles. In still other embodiments, the drag reducing devices may curve continuously along their lengths. Angle variations (e.g., curves or angled segments as described above) can be used to provide smooth transitions from the rear of the vehicle to the main bodies of the drag reducing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">When extended, drag reducing devices in accordance with the present disclosure may define relatively discrete peaks (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) or may be truncated (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21E</figref>). In certain truncated embodiments, the extended lengths of the drag reducing devices are such that the effects of drag caused by air separation at the truncated ends are minimal. In example embodiments suitable for tractor trailers, the drag reducing devices may have extended lengths greater than 6 feet, or in the range of 6 to 22 feet, or in the range of 8-14 feet. Vehicles having smaller heights and widths could be equipped with proportionally smaller drag reduction devices. In certain embodiments, the ratio of the extended length of the drag reduction device to a reference dimension of the vehicle is at least 1 to 1. The reference dimension is typically the smaller of the width or the height of the rear of the vehicle body. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, the width w is the reference dimension since it is smaller than the height h. In other embodiments, this ratio is at least 1.5 to 1, or at least 2 to 1, or at least 3 to 1.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">In certain embodiments, drag reducing devices in accordance with the present disclosure may be automatically extended or retracted. A control system may be used to automatically control extension and retraction. In certain embodiments, vehicle speed or other vehicle parameters may be used to automatically control retraction/extension. For example, a controller may sense vehicle speed, and automatically cause retraction of the drag reducing device if the vehicle speed moves below a given speed value (e.g., 45 miles per hour).</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">Retractable drag reducing devices in accordance with the present disclosure can have relatively long extended lengths as compared to retracted lengths. Certain embodiments have an extended length to retracted length ratio of at least 6 to 1. Other embodiments have extended length to retracted length ratios of at least 10 to 1 or at least 20 to 1.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">While specific angles and lengths have been specified for certain embodiments of the present disclosure, it will be appreciated that the broad aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to these values.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">From the foregoing it will be observed that numerous modifications and variations can be effectuated without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the present invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with respect to the specific embodiments illustrated is intended or should be inferred.</p>
