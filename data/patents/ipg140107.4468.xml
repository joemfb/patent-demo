<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method for mobility support of a mobile node having a home network in a heterogeneous roaming environment is presented. The method comprises the steps of authenticating the mobile node in a visited network and obtaining an address for the mobile node in the visited network, establishing a security connection between a functional component in the visited network and an agent in the home network, creating a home address for the mobile node, and using the home address to generate a SIP signaling address, a SIP media address, and a non-SIP media address, such that SIP non-media is transmitted using the security connection to the SIP signaling address, SIP media is transmitted using the security connection to the SIP media address, and non-SIP media is transmitted using the security connection to the non-SIP media address.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to next generation wireless networks, and more specifically to a framework for heterogeneous roaming of mobile nodes in such networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ubiquitous roaming support for real-time traffic, such as interactive VoIP, streaming, and the non-real-time data transfer of FTP and e-mail in an access independent manner, is becoming increasingly important. For example, the evolution of the mobility protocols of Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) and Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) has made it easier to support ubiquitous roaming. Carriers in the wireless Internet have different mobility capabilities, and mobile clients may also have a variety of mobility capabilities. For example, some operators or carriers may support mobile assisted mobility protocol, such as MIPv6 and Client Mobile IPv6 (CMIPv6), while others may support network assisted mobile protocol, such as Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). In some cases, often the mobile assisted mobility protocols, a mobile node or mobile client may be equipped with a mobility stack, and the mobile node may use an application layer mobility protocol in certain situations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a typical roaming environment, two domains can belong to two separate carriers with different mobility support and security and authentication procedures. Accordingly, a mobile node in the Next Generation Wireless Networks may be subjected to roaming that may involve different kinds of movement scenarios. These movement types can be confined to home domain or visited domain. When the mobile node is away from home and is in the visited domain, the mobile node is defined to be in roaming mode. When in the roaming mode, the mobile node can move between two sub-networks that may belong to the same carrier domain, or it can move from one carrier domain to another carrier domain. Any mobile node in roaming scenario may be subjected to several degrees of heterogeneity, such as types of mobility being supported in the network elements and in the mobile node's stack, the type of application supported in the mobile node and type of movement both in the local domain or in the visited domain that might involve changing bearer manager. Also, while in the visited domain, avoiding exposure of a subscriber's permanent IP address in the visited carrier networks is important to maintain security.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several existing standards bodies are attempting to define the core network architecture for next generation wireless networks. Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defined an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) architecture, and 3GPP2 defined the Multimedia Domain (MMD) architecture. Recently, Advances to IMS (A-IMS) architecture, which enhances existing IMS and MMD networks, has been proposed to support a variety of services such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based and non-SIP-based applications. SIP-based applications are typically set up by SIP and provide services such as VoIP. On the other hand, non-SIP-based applications provide services such as IPTV and FTP without using SIP. Similarly, International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is working on defining the Next Generation Network (NGN) under the premises of a Global Standards Initiative, i.e. NGN-GSI. All these architectures include heterogeneous access networks, such as CDMA, WiMAX, and 802.11 technologies, and include support for roaming.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At present, however, the inventors know of no flexible framework that can support seamless mobility between networks with different mobility support.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0063">An inventive solution to the problem of mobility management in next generation wireless networks is presented. This solution is a framework for supporting inter-carrier roaming involving global and local mobility between domains and within domains. When a mobile node changes its network point of attachment, traffic is disrupted due to the handover process, which can be mobile-node-controlled or network-controlled. Depending on the type of movement, mobility can be handled at the link layer, the network layer, or the application layer. Link layer mobility is access specific, so that it cannot solve the problem of heterogeneity and therefore is not discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0064">In network layer mobility, mobility involves heterogeneous access technologies, and can be controlled either by the mobile node or the network. In a mobile-controlled scenario of network layer mobility, the mobile node is usually equipped with a mobility stack and interacts with a remote entity such as a Home Agent (HA). An example of mobile-node-controlled mobility is CMIPv6. In the network layer mobility, when the mobility protocol is network-controlled, other networking elements in the middle of the network interact with the remote entity, typically an HA, and perform handoff related functions.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the functional components of generic network architecture for next generation wireless networks for providing ubiquitous services that need mobility support along with quality of service, security and charging. This generic network comprises a home network <b>10</b> and a visited network <b>12</b>, which can also be considered another home network. In addition, it includes IP core entities of MN or mobile node <b>14</b>, access gateways (AGW) <b>16</b>, home agents (HA) <b>18</b>, and authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) <b>20</b>. It also has IMS/MMD entities of Proxy Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF) <b>22</b>, Interrogating Call Session Control Function (I-CSCF) <b>24</b>, Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) <b>26</b>, home subscriber service (HSS) <b>28</b>, application server (AS) <b>30</b> and policy and charging rules function (PCRF) <b>32</b>. Details of these functions components are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0066">Home agent or entity HA <b>18</b> provides media packet transfer in the home domain or network <b>10</b> as Home Agent (hHA), and in the visited domain or network <b>12</b> as Visited Home Agent (vHA). The HAs <b>18</b> map the home addresses with the temporary care-of-addresses, and route the media and signaling messages to the mobile node <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0067">SIP servers or entities, such as S-CSCF <b>26</b> and P-CSCF <b>22</b>, take care of routing SIP signaling messages from and to the mobile node <b>14</b>. S-CSCF <b>26</b> is always located in the home network <b>10</b> and assists with user or MN <b>14</b> registration regardless of the user location. In MMD network, either the P-CSCF <b>22</b> located in the home network <b>10</b> or the P-CSCF <b>22</b> in the visited network <b>12</b> can be used for registration. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers (not shown) in each network help assign the P-CSCF <b>22</b> address to the mobile node <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0068">AAA <b>20</b> servers in both the home network <b>10</b> and visited network <b>12</b> are used for user profile verification. However, each of the visited networks <b>12</b> and the home network <b>10</b> can have different mobility capabilities and requirements depending on the verification policy defined by the individual network operators.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0069">In addition, there are both SIP-based and non-SIP-based ASs <b>30</b> that are responsible for providing advanced multimedia services beyond voice over internet protocol (VoIP). PCRF <b>32</b> controls the media based on the policy in each home and/or visited network <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, and helps to provide feature interaction between SIP-based and non-SIP-based services. Depending on the type of access network, e.g., CDMA, 802.11, etc., the architecture can have AGWs <b>16</b> that may act as Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN), Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) or Packet Data Interworking Function (PDIF).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0070">Home local mobility is a scenario in which the mobile node <b>14</b> moves between two different access routers within a home domain <b>10</b>. A similar type of movement in the visited domain <b>12</b> is called visited local mobility. Correspondingly, there can be several types of global mobility. The first form of global mobility occurs when the mobile node <b>14</b> moves from its home network <b>10</b> to the visited domain <b>12</b> of a new carrier network. The second form of global mobility involves the mobile node <b>14</b> moving from one visited domain <b>12</b> to another visited domain <b>12</b> within the same carrier network. The third form of global mobility happens when the mobile node <b>14</b> moves from one carrier network to another carrier network while away from the home domain <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0071">Table 1 shows the possible combination of movement patterns that involve different types of mobility support in the home domain <b>10</b> and in the visited domain <b>12</b>. The mobile node's stack can have either Simple IP or CMIPv6, and can move from the home domain <b>10</b> to the visited domain <b>12</b>, where the home domain <b>10</b> and the visited domain <b>12</b> may offer different mobility support. The grey areas are situations that are unlikely to happen.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0073">In order to reduce the load on the mobile node <b>14</b> and handle local mobility, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been developing network-based localized mobility management protocols. These protocols are designed to take care of local mobility and are controlled by the network elements in the access routers. One such protocol is PMIPv6, which does not use any mobility stack on the mobile node <b>14</b> but rather uses functions or proxies on the access routers to help perform the mobility functions, such as the binding update to the HA <b>18</b>. These functions or functional components are called Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and can co-locate with the access routers. As long as the mobile node <b>14</b> moves within the same domain that has MAGs, the mobile node <b>14</b> assumes that it is in a home link. The MAG is responsible for sending the proper mobile prefix as part of the router advertisement for stateless auto-configuration, or it can also act as a DHCP relay agent for stateful auto-configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> describes the network elements associated with PMIPv6 operation, and illustrates mobile node <b>14</b> handoff from visited network <b>1</b> <b>12</b> to visited network <b>2</b> <b>12</b>. The mobile node <b>14</b> is in communication with a correspondent node (CN) <b>34</b>. AGW<b>1</b> <b>16</b> and AGW<b>2</b> <b>16</b> each include a mobile proxy or MAG <b>38</b>, and each has a tunnel <b>36</b> with HA <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0075">After the mobile node <b>14</b> connects to the new point-of-attachment as part of the initial bootstrapping process or after the movement to a new domain, access is authenticated with the designated AAA <b>20</b> server. During this process, MAG <b>38</b> sends the binding update to the HA <b>18</b> with the address of the MAG <b>38</b> that is specific to the home prefix of the mobile node <b>14</b>. In the absence of a pre-existing tunnel, this process helps to set up a tunnel <b>36</b> between the HA <b>18</b> and the respective MAG <b>38</b>. The mobile node <b>14</b> configures its address using the prefix included in the router advertisement and interface-id, which can be assigned by MAG <b>38</b> or created by itself. The PMIPv6-based mobility protocol is preferred when mobility is confined within a domain and wireless service providers do not want to overload the mobile node's stack by setting up a tunnel <b>36</b> between the mobile node <b>14</b> and the HA <b>18</b>. A tunnel is not desirable on the mobile node <b>14</b> because it adds extra processing and bandwidth constraints to the wireless hop.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates roaming according to one embodiment of the invention. A home domain <b>10</b> includes entities or functional components of hP-CSCF <b>22</b>, hS-CSCF <b>26</b>, hI-CSCF <b>24</b>, hHA <b>18</b> and hDHCP <b>40</b>. In addition, the home domain <b>10</b> includes hPDSN routers each having a proxy mobile agent <b>38</b>. The visited domain <b>12</b> includes entities of vP-CSCF <b>22</b>, vS-CSCF <b>26</b>, vI-CSCF <b>24</b>, vHA <b>18</b> and vDHCP <b>40</b>. The visited domain <b>12</b> also includes vPDSN routers, each having a mobile agent gateway <b>38</b>. MN<b>1</b> <b>14</b> and MN<b>2</b> <b>14</b> are in visited domain <b>12</b>. A tunnel <b>36</b> is established between each MAG <b>38</b> and hHA <b>18</b> in the home domain <b>10</b>. Tunnels <b>36</b> are also created between each MAG <b>38</b> and vHA <b>18</b> in the visited domain <b>12</b>. During session enablement, when the end nodes are notified of the signaling address and Session Description Protocol (SDP) address, media and signaling splitting is performed. The tunnels <b>36</b> carry the split traffic, so that SIP signaling is transmitted over one tunnel, and media for SIP as well as non-SIP application is sent over another tunnel. Each application specific media uses different contact address for transport.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the case of home local mobility when the mobile node <b>14</b> has a Simple IP stack, and the home network <b>10</b> is equipped with PMIPv6. Generic network architecture having access routers that behave as 3GPP2 PDSN are assumed, and a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) serves as HA <b>18</b>. As the mobile node <b>14</b> initially bootstraps in PDSN#<b>1</b>, it goes through an access authentication phase. With a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) link, access authentication takes place at the lower layer during the Link Control Protocol (LCP) and authentication phase. Since the PDSNs are equipped with MAG <b>38</b>, the Network Access Identifier (NAI) is passed to the LMA <b>18</b> as part of the binding update, during which a tunnel <b>36</b> is created between MAG <b>38</b> and LMA <b>18</b>. MAG <b>38</b> may also receive the home prefix and the interface-id for the specific mobile node <b>14</b> from the LMA <b>18</b>. These are used for creating the hHoA#<b>1</b> address.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0078">The mobile node <b>14</b> interacts with the DHCP server to obtain the address of the P-CSCF <b>22</b>. It then sends a SIP registration to the P-CSCF <b>22</b>, and the P-CSCF <b>22</b> sends this registration to S-CSCF <b>26</b>. Since hHoA#<b>1</b> is used for the purpose of SIP signaling, the mobile node <b>14</b> uses the HoA's prefix and locally generated random interface-id to generate the new media addresses, hHoA#<b>2</b> and hHoA#<b>3</b>, for SIP-based and non-SIP-based traffic, respectively. The mobile node <b>14</b> uses hHoA#<b>2</b> as the media contact address in its SDP when the mobile node <b>14</b> invites another user or correspondent node <b>34</b>. Consequently, the mobile node <b>14</b> receives media for the SIP-based application using a different IP address than for SIP signaling.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0079">Since there is already a tunnel <b>36</b> established between the MAG <b>38</b> and LMA <b>18</b>, any SIP signaling traffic destined for hHoA#<b>1</b>, SIP media destined for hHoA#<b>2</b>, and non-SIP media destined for hHoA#<b>3</b> are tunneled via the PMIPv6 tunnel <b>36</b> setup between the MAG <b>38</b> and LMA <b>18</b>. In one embodiment (not shown), separate tunnels are established for each of SIP signaling traffic, SIP media and non-SIP media. In all cases, even if the mobile node <b>14</b> moves to a new PDSN#<b>2</b>, and hence changes to a new MAG <b>38</b>, hHoA#<b>1</b>, hHoA#<b>2</b>, and hHoA#<b>3</b> do not change.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the flows for the case in which the mobile node <b>14</b> has a Simple IP stack, and both the home domain <b>10</b> and visited domain <b>12</b> support PMIPv6. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, LMA serves as a form of HA <b>18</b>. The first time the mobile node <b>14</b> moves to the visited domain <b>12</b>, access is authenticated along with the PMIPv6 binding update procedure with MAG <b>38</b>. During the access authentication, the MAG <b>38</b> sends two binding update messages to two LMAs <b>18</b>. One binding update message is sent to the visited LMA <b>18</b> and the other is sent to the home LMA <b>18</b> according to the authentication response message from the visited AAA <b>20</b> and home AAA <b>20</b>. MAG <b>38</b> sends the interface-id during the IPv6CP procedure, and sends both the vHoA's prefix and hHoA's prefix as part of the router advertisement message. Based upon these three parameters, the mobile node <b>14</b> generates hHoA#<b>1</b> used for SIP signaling, and vHoA#<b>2</b> used for media packets. The mobile node <b>14</b> then obtains the address of home P-CSCF <b>22</b> from the home DHCP server through the PMIPv6 tunnel <b>36</b> between the MAG <b>38</b> and home LMA <b>18</b>, and sends SIP registration to the home P-CSCF <b>22</b>. The home P-CSCF <b>22</b> forwards it to home S-CSCF <b>26</b> to update the user information. After a successful SIP signaling setup, the mobile node <b>14</b> receives traffic using the vHoA#<b>1</b> address. In order to send the non-SIP media packets, the mobile node <b>14</b> creates vHoA#<b>3</b> using a self-generated interface-id and vHoA's prefix. During handoff, the mobile node <b>14</b> obtains the same prefixes from the visited LMA <b>18</b> and home LMA <b>18</b>. Therefore, the mobile node <b>14</b> does not have to send an SIP registration message unless the assigned P-CSCF <b>22</b> changes.</p>
