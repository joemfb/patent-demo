<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Continuation-in-Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/703,279, filed on Feb. 10, 2010, and claims priority from and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0058584, filed on Jun. 29, 2009, which are both hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to automatically displaying residual lifetime information or replacement information of a light emitting device. Specifically, exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to preventing sudden failure in illumination due to deterioration of the light emitting device by informing a manager of is replacement information before termination of the lifetime of the light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a light-emitting module includes a plurality of light-emitting packages and a plurality of printed circuit boards (PCBs). Each of the light-emitting packages includes a light-emitting chip having a light emitting diode and a housing to receive the light-emitting chip. The PCB includes a power-supplying pad to transfer external electrical power. The light-emitting package receives electrical power through a lead frame that is electrically connected to the power-supplying pad. Typically, the lead frame of the light-emitting package is soldered to the power-supplying pad of the PCB.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When one of the light-emitting packages is faulty, it should be replaced. However, it may be complicated to replace a light-emitting package because the typical process includes de-soldering the lead frame from the power-supplying pad. As a result, the entire light-emitting module having a faulty light-emitting package is often replaced.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a light-emitting module having a light-emitting package that may be easily combined with and also easily detached from a printed circuit board so that the light-emitting package may be replaced as desired, for is example, when the light-emitting package fails.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention discloses an illumination system having at least one light emitting apparatus having at least one light emitting module detachably coupled to the at least one light emitting apparatus, the at least one light emitting module having an information storage unit to store characteristic information of the at least one light emitting module, and a controller configured to detect whether the at least one light emitting module is connected to or disconnected from the at least one light emitting apparatus, and to read out the characteristic information of the at least one light emitting module according to a detection result, wherein the characteristic information comprises unique identification information or absolute lifetime information of the at least one light emitting module.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these exemplary embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the size and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It will be understood when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on or directly connected to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be understood that, although terms such as first, second, and third may be used to describe various items such as elements, components, regions, layers, or sections, these items are not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one item from another item. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer, or section could be termed a second element, component, region, layer, or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Spatially relative terms such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper&#x201d; may be used for ease of description to describe how an element or feature is related to another element or feature as illustrated in the figures.

Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; encompasses both orientations of &#x201c;above&#x201d; and &#x201c;below.&#x201d; The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a light-emitting module according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention before a light emitting-chip is fastened to a printed circuit board, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the light-emitting module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> after the light emitting-chip is fastened to the printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a light-emitting module includes a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>100</b>, a fastening member <b>200</b>, and a light-emitting package <b>300</b>. The PCB <b>100</b> includes a power-supplying pad <b>110</b> to transfer an external driving power to the light-emitting package <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The power-supplying pad <b>110</b> is formed on the PCB <b>100</b> and may have two pads spaced apart from each other to apply opposite polarity voltages to the light-emitting package <b>300</b>. Additionally, the PCB <b>100</b> includes a plurality of wirings (not shown) to transfer the external power to the power-supplying pad <b>110</b>. The plurality of wirings may be formed on an upper surface of the PCB <b>100</b> or a lower surface of the PCB <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The fastening member <b>200</b> is disposed on the PCB <b>100</b> and has a package-receiving hole <b>210</b> exposing the power-supplying pad <b>110</b>. The fastening member <b>200</b> may include an elastic material to detachably fasten the light-emitting package <b>300</b>. For example, the fastening member <b>200</b> may include elastic materials such as rubber, silicone, or compositions thereof. However, the fastening member <b>200</b> may include relatively hard materials such as a plastic. The fastening member <b>200</b> may be disposed on the PCB <b>100</b> such that the fastening member <b>200</b> is detachably combined with the PCB <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the fastening member <b>200</b> may be integrally formed with the PCB <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the PCB <b>100</b> includes the wirings formed thereon, the fastening member <b>200</b> may make contact with the wirings. Therefore, electrically insulating material may be disposed between the fastening member <b>200</b> and the wirings. The fastening member <b>200</b> may have a rectangular shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Alternatively, the fastening member <b>200</b> may have other polygonal shapes. The fastening member <b>200</b> may have a catching jaw <b>220</b> formed on an inner surface of the fastening member <b>200</b>. Preferably, two catching jaws <b>220</b> may be formed to face each other.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The light-emitting package <b>300</b> is received by (or inserted into) the package-receiving hole <b>210</b> to combine with the fastening member <b>200</b> and electrically connect to the power-supplying pad <b>110</b> on the PCB <b>100</b>. The light-emitting package <b>300</b> is detachably coupled with the fastening member <b>200</b>. In other words, the light-emitting package <b>300</b> may be easily detached from the fastening member <b>200</b> so that the light-emitting package <b>300</b> may be easily replaced as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Since the fastening member <b>200</b> may include elastic material, a user may compress the peripheral regions of the fastening member <b>200</b> to increase the width of the package-receiving hole <b>210</b> so that the light-emitting package <b>300</b> may be easily extracted from the package-receiving hole <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The light-emitting package <b>300</b> includes a light-emitting chip <b>310</b>, a housing <b>320</b>, and a lead frame <b>330</b>. The light-emitting chip <b>310</b> includes a semiconductor material, for example, gallium nitride or indium nitride. The light-emitting chip <b>310</b> may generate light of various wavelengths such as red light, green light, blue light, ultraviolet light, or white light.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The housing <b>320</b> receives the light-emitting chip <b>310</b>. The housing <b>320</b> may include, for example, polyphthalamide resin and may be formed through a molding method. The housing <b>320</b> may include electrically or thermally insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the housing <b>320</b> has an opening portion <b>322</b> exposing at least a portion of the light-emitting chip <b>310</b>. The opening portion <b>322</b> may have various shapes such as a circular shape, an oval shape, or polygonal shape.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The inner surface of the housing <b>320</b> corresponding to the opening portion <b>322</b> may be angled with respect to the PCB <b>100</b> increasing the solid angle subtended by light generated by the light-emitting chip <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The opening portion <b>322</b> may be filled with an encapsulant covering the light-emitting chip <b>310</b>. The encapsulant may be optically transparent to efficiently transmit light generated by the light-emitting chip <b>310</b>. Additionally, a lens <b>324</b> may be disposed on the housing <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The housing <b>320</b> include a fastening protrusion <b>326</b> formed on an outer surface of the housing <b>320</b>. The outer surface of the housing faces the inner surface of the fastening member <b>200</b>. When the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is inserted into the package-receiving hole <b>210</b>, the fastening protrusion <b>326</b> is combined with the catching jaw <b>220</b> so that the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is fastened to the PCB <b>100</b> through the fastening member <b>200</b>. Two fastening protrusions <b>326</b> may be formed to correspond to the two catching jaws <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The fastening protrusion <b>326</b> may have a triangular shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Alternatively, the fastening protrusion <b>326</b> may have various shapes such as a semicircular shape or polygonal shape. In this embodiment, the fastening protrusion <b>326</b> has a triangular shape with increasing width along a direction from a lower portion of the housing <b>320</b> to the upper portion of the housing <b>320</b>. For example, the fastening protrusion <b>326</b> has a right triangular shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As a result, when the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is inserted into the package-receiving hole <b>210</b>, the fastening protrusion <b>326</b> is caught by the catching jaw <b>220</b> so that the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is stably combined with the PCB <b>100</b> through the fastening member <b>200</b>. Furthermore, the width of the fastening protrusion <b>326</b> increases along the direction from the lower portion of the housing <b>320</b> to the upper portion of the housing <b>320</b> so that upper portion of the fastening protrusion <b>326</b> is caught by the catching jaw <b>220</b> to prevent unwanted detachment of the light-emitting package <b>300</b> from the package-receiving hole <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fastening protrusion <b>326</b> may be spaced apart from the lead frame <b>330</b> to prevent contact between the fastening protrusion <b>326</b> and the lead frame <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The lead frame <b>330</b> is electrically connected to the light-emitting chip <b>310</b> by a wire <b>340</b>, and the lead frame <b>330</b> extends from inside the housing <b>320</b> to outside the housing <b>320</b> to be electrically connected to the power-supplying pad <b>110</b>. In the present embodiment, the lead frame <b>330</b> includes two lead terminals <b>351</b> and <b>352</b> spaced apart from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In order to electrically connect the light-emitting chip <b>310</b> to the lead frame <b>330</b>, a portion of lead frame <b>330</b> on which the light-emitting chip <b>310</b> is mounted is exposed through the opening portion <b>322</b>. Furthermore, the lead frame <b>330</b> extends out of the housing <b>320</b> to be electrically connected to the power-supplying pad <b>110</b> via the lead terminals <b>351</b> and <b>352</b>. Voltages may be applied to the two lead terminals by contact with the power-supplying pads <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A portion of the lead frame <b>330</b>, e.g., the lead terminal <b>351</b> and <b>352</b>, is curved to provide elasticity and to contact with the power-supplying pad <b>110</b>. When the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is inserted into the package-receiving hole <b>210</b>, the portion of the lead frame <b>330</b> that is curved pushes against the power-supplying pad <b>110</b> so that the fastening protrusion <b>326</b> and the catching jaw <b>220</b> become engaged. Furthermore, when the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is inserted into the package-receiving hole <b>210</b>, the portion of the lead frame <b>330</b>, which is curved, ensures electrical connection between the power-supplying pad <b>110</b> and the lead frame <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is inserted into the package-receiving hole <b>210</b>, the fastening protrusion <b>326</b> of the housing <b>320</b> may be caught by the catching jaw <b>220</b> of the fastening member <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a light-emitting module according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the housing <b>320</b> includes a hollow portion <b>328</b>. The housing <b>320</b> may include two hollow portions <b>328</b>. The two hollow portions <b>328</b> may be formed at opposite sides of the housing <b>320</b>. The hollow portion <b>328</b> is spaced apart from the lead frame <b>330</b> to prevent contact between the hollow portion <b>328</b> and the lead frame <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The fastening member <b>200</b> includes a penetration hole <b>230</b>. The penetration hole <b>230</b> is formed at a region corresponding to the hollow portion <b>328</b>. The fastening member <b>200</b> also includes an insertion unit <b>240</b>. The insertion unit <b>240</b> penetrates the penetration hole <b>230</b> to be inserted into the hollow portion <b>328</b> to fasten the light-emitting package <b>300</b> to the PCB <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The insertion unit <b>240</b> has a cross-sectional area that is similar to that of the penetration hole <b>230</b> to prevent foreign substances from entering the package-receiving hole <b>210</b> so that the light-emitting efficiency of the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is not diminished. The insertion unit <b>240</b> may include an elastic material so that the insertion unit <b>240</b> may easily penetrate the penetration hole <b>238</b> and easily insert into the hollow portion <b>328</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A first end portion of the insertion unit <b>240</b>, which is inserted into the hollow portion <b>328</b>, may be formed to have a hook-shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Therefore, the insertion unit <b>240</b> is not easily separated from the hollow portion <b>328</b> of the housing <b>320</b> to stabilize the connection between the light-emitting package <b>300</b> and the PCB <b>100</b>. A second end portion of the insertion unit <b>240</b>, which is opposite to the first end portion, has a larger radius than a center portion of the insertion unit <b>240</b> so that the insertion unit <b>240</b> has a nail head shape. Therefore, the insertion unit <b>240</b> may be easily extracted from the hollow portion <b>328</b> when detaching the light-emitting package <b>300</b> from the PCB <b>100</b>, for example, when the light-emitting package <b>300</b> fails. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a portion of the insertion unit <b>240</b> between the first and second end portions may have a larger radius than the end portions so that the insertion unit <b>240</b> may be tightly combined with the fastening member <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first end portion of the insertion unit <b>240</b>, which is inserted into the hollow portion <b>328</b>, may be bent, and the hollow portion <b>328</b> may have a keyway shape that accommodates rotation of the first end portion of the insertion unit <b>240</b> within the hollow portion <b>328</b>. When the first end portion of the insertion unit <b>240</b> is inserted into the hollow portion <b>328</b>, the insertion unit <b>240</b> may be rotated and locked into the hollow portion <b>328</b> to securely fasten the light-emitting package <b>300</b> to the PCB <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Alternatively, the two insertion units <b>240</b> may have different shapes relative to each other. For example, one of the two insertion units <b>240</b> may have a hook-shaped end portion as described above, and the first end portion of the other insertion unit <b>240</b> may have a cross-sectional area similar to that of the hollow portion <b>328</b> to prevent the insertion unit <b>240</b> from being disengaged from the penetration hole <b>230</b> and the hollow portion <b>328</b>. Therefore, the light-emitting package <b>300</b> may be stably combined with the PCB <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The fastening member <b>200</b> may be integrally formed with the PCB <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the fastening member <b>200</b> may be formed separately from the PCB <b>100</b> so that the fastening member <b>200</b> may be detachably combined with the PCB <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a light-emitting module according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a light-emitting module includes a PCB <b>100</b>, a fastening member <b>200</b>, and a light-emitting package <b>300</b>. The PCB <b>100</b> has a power-supplying pad <b>110</b> to apply electrical power to the light-emitting package <b>300</b>. The fastening member <b>200</b> includes a first fastening part <b>250</b> and a second fastening part <b>260</b> spaced apart from each other such that the power-supplying pad <b>110</b> on the PCB <b>100</b> is disposed between the first fastening part <b>250</b> and the second fastening part <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The first fastening part <b>250</b> and the second fastening part <b>260</b> are spaced apart on the PCB <b>100</b> to define a package-receiving space to receive the light-emitting package <b>300</b>. The package-receiving space may have various shapes such as a rectangular shape or a semicircular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first fastening part <b>250</b> and the second fastening part <b>260</b> may be detachably combined with the PCB <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the first fastening part <b>250</b> and the second fastening part <b>260</b> may be integrally formed with the PCB <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The light-emitting package <b>300</b> is inserted into the package-receiving space between the first fastening part <b>250</b> and the second fastening part <b>260</b> to be detachably combined with the PCB <b>100</b> so that the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is electrically connected to the power-supplying pad <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The fastening member <b>200</b> includes a penetration hole <b>230</b> at a position corresponding to the hollow portion <b>328</b>. The fastening member <b>200</b> may further include an insertion unit <b>240</b> to pass through the penetration hole <b>230</b> and to insert into the hollow portion <b>328</b> so that the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is fastened to the PCB <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The insertion unit <b>240</b> includes an insertion body <b>242</b> and a protrusion <b>244</b>. The insertion body <b>242</b> penetrates the penetration hole <b>230</b> and inserts into the hollow portion <b>328</b>. The insertion body <b>242</b> has a cross-sectional shape similar to that of the penetration hole <b>230</b> to prevent foreign substances from entering the package-receiving space.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The protrusion <b>244</b> protrudes from the insertion body <b>242</b> and inserts into a catching recess <b>232</b> formed on an inner surface of the penetration hole <b>230</b>. More than one catching recess <b>232</b> may be formed on the inner surface of the penetration hole <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The width of the protrusion <b>244</b> decreases along the direction from outside the fastening member <b>200</b> to the housing <b>320</b>. For example, the protrusion <b>244</b> has a right triangular cross-section whose hypotenuse forms an acute included angle with the insertion unit <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Therefore, when the insertion unit <b>240</b> is extracted from the hollow portion <b>328</b>, the protrusion <b>244</b> is caught by the catching recess <b>232</b> to prevent the insertion unit <b>240</b> from being pulled completely out of the penetration hole <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In contrast, when the insertion unit <b>240</b> is pulled out of the hollow portion <b>328</b> in order to replace the light-emitting package <b>300</b>, the insertion unit <b>240</b> may be pushed and rotated. When the protrusion <b>244</b> disengages from the catching recess <b>232</b>, the insertion unit <b>240</b> may be easily pulled out of the penetration hole <b>230</b>. Then, the light-emitting package <b>300</b> may be easily detached from the package-receiving space.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the light-emitting package <b>300</b> is received by the package-receiving hole <b>210</b> so that the light-emitting package <b>300</b> may be easily combined with the PCB <b>100</b>.

For example, in the state that the absolute lifetime information of each light emitting module <b>510</b> and the information upon the driving start time point thereof are recorded, the lifetime information calculation unit <b>630</b> can calculate the residual lifetime of the light emitting module <b>510</b> by comparing the absolute lifetime information with the time that has elapsed after the driving start time point.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Moreover, an overall driving time may be calculated by accumulating an actual driving time of the light emitting module <b>510</b>, and the residual lifetime may be calculated by subtracting the calculated overall driving time from the absolute lifetime information.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Furthermore, it may be also possible to calculate an overall driving time by applying a weight to the actual driving time of the light emitting module <b>510</b> based on a voltage level applied to adjust a dimming level of the light emitting module <b>510</b>. For example, if a voltage equal to or higher than a reference voltage level is applied, the actual driving time is multiplied by a weight equal to or larger than about 1, whereas if a voltage lower than the reference voltage level is applied, the actual driving time may be multiplied by a weight smaller than about 1. Then, the driving times to which the weights are applied are added up, so that the overall driving time is calculated. Thereafter, the residual lifetime can be calculated by subtracting the calculated overall driving time from the absolute lifetime information.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The database <b>660</b> may store information upon a driving start time point for each light emitting module <b>510</b>, thus making it possible to calculate time information that has passed after the driving of each light emitting module <b>510</b> is started. Moreover, the database <b>660</b> may also store driving information of each light emitting module <b>510</b> in a cumulative manner, so that the information upon the actual driving time of each light emitting module <b>510</b> can be accumulated. Since the driving conditions for each light emitting module <b>510</b> may differ, overall driving time information may be accumulated for each light emitting module. In addition, more accurate driving information of each light emitting module <b>510</b> may be stored by additionally storing the dimming level information of each light emitting module <b>510</b>. Further, the replacement information and the residual lifetime information of each light emitting module <b>510</b> calculated based on the absolute lifetime information and the driving information of each light emitting module <b>510</b> may also be matched and stored in the database <b>660</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The management method according to the present exemplary embodiment may be substantially similar to the method described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> above. However, the present exemplary embodiment may further include an additional step S<b>1120</b> for receiving driving information. Accordingly, a step S<b>1130</b> for calculating the lifetime information may be modified.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Driving information of the light emitting module <b>510</b> is received (S<b>1120</b>). The driving information may include information upon a time point of connection of the light emitting module <b>510</b> to the light emitting apparatus <b>500</b>, driving time information of the light emitting module <b>510</b>, a dimming level information of the light emitting module <b>510</b>, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Next, residual lifetime information is calculated based on absolute lifetime information and driving information of the light emitting module <b>510</b> (S<b>1130</b>). For example, a residual lifetime of the light emitting module <b>510</b> may be calculated by subtracting driving time information from the absolute lifetime information thereof. Alternatively, the residual lifetime may be calculated by subtracting, from the absolute lifetime information, a value obtained by applying to the driving time information of the light emitting module <b>510</b> a weight according to a dimming level thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As discussed above, by calculating the residual lifetime by additionally considering the driving information of the light emitting module <b>510</b>, it may be possible to calculate the residual lifetime information almost coincident with an actual driving state of the light emitting module.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a diagram showing an illumination system <b>10</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In accordance with the present exemplary embodiment, a management apparatus <b>600</b> of an illumination system <b>10</b> may access an information providing server <b>700</b> through a network and request characteristic information of each light emitting module <b>510</b> in a light emitting apparatus <b>500</b>, <b>500</b>&#x2032;, or <b>500</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">At this time, the network may be implemented by a wireless network such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or a value added network (VAN), or a wireless network such as a mobile radio communication network or a satellite communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The management apparatus <b>600</b> of the illumination system <b>10</b> may acquire unique identification information of the light emitting module <b>510</b> and can also acquire from a database <b>660</b> a URL of a manufacturer of the light emitting module <b>510</b> matched with the unique identification information. Furthermore, the management apparatus <b>600</b> can also access the information providing server <b>700</b> corresponding to the acquired URL and can receive characteristic information corresponding to the unique identification information of the light emitting module <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variation can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
