<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A personal hydration system includes a control valve assembly including a valve body provided with a first inlet port fed by a liquid, a second inlet port, and an outlet port for dispensing at least fluid from the first inlet port. The control valve assembly further includes either a flexible and resilient or a non-collapsible reservoir which holds an additive and is mounted to the second inlet port. The first inlet port can be provided with a valve for preventing backflow of the additive from the reservoir, and the reservoir can be provided with a screen for disrupting coagulation of certain additives when mixed with liquid. A valve core is rotatably mounted in the valve body to establish various flow conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to personal hydration systems and, more particularly, pertains to a personal hydration system equipped with a control valve assembly for selectively regulating the flow of various liquids desired by a user of the system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/701,304, filed Feb. 5, 2010, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/154,280, filed Feb. 20, 2009, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in entirety, disclose personal hydration systems comprising a hydration bladder for holding a liquid. A control valve assembly includes a valve body provided with a first inlet port in communication with the liquid in the hydration bladder, a second inlet port and an outlet port for dispensing at least the liquid from the hydration bladder therefrom. The control valve has a reservoir holding an additive and being mounted to the second inlet port of the valve body such that the additive is in communication with the second inlet port. The control valve assembly also includes a valve core mounted within the valve body to establish at least either a single flow condition of the liquid or a mixed flow condition of the liquid and the additive. The valve body and the valve core cooperatively define a liquid circulation arrangement directing flow from the hydration bladder into the reservoir to enable circulation and form a mixture of the liquid and the additive in the reservoir deliverable to the outlet port.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As described in the incorporated patent applications, the present inventor has recognized deficiencies in prior art personal bladder-type hydration systems. The inventor has recognized that it is desirable to provide a personal hydration system which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art, and includes a control or mixing valve that selectively controls dispensing of a liquid, such as water or juice, alone or in combination with an additive in solid or liquid form.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is the product of continued research and development to address these problems.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The following description regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-16</figref> is taken from the incorporated U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/701,304.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a personal hydration system <b>10</b> for storing liquid (such as water, sports drinks, juices, etc.) and features a control valve assembly <b>12</b> for selectively controlling the flow of liquid from the system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Personal hydration system <b>10</b> includes a flexible and expandable bladder <b>14</b> which is typically housed in a carrying device <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that is conveniently worn on the back of a user U and supported by shoulder straps <b>18</b> and a cross strap <b>20</b>. The bladder <b>14</b> is provided with a fill opening having a cap <b>22</b>, which may be opened and closed to fill, empty or clean the bladder <b>14</b>. Bladder <b>14</b> also has an outlet <b>24</b> equipped with a first tubular barbed adapter <b>26</b> onto which one end of a typically transparent, flexible supply hose <b>28</b> is removably mounted. The other end of supply hose <b>28</b> is removably secured to a second barbed tubular adapter <b>30</b> extending generally perpendicularly from a tubular body <b>32</b> of the control valve assembly <b>12</b>. A reservoir <b>34</b> taking the form of a non-collapsible, generally rigid and refillable plastic bottle is removably secured to the valve body <b>32</b> and is designed to hold an additive typically used to provide an energy and/or nutritional boost to the user of the hydration system <b>10</b>. Such additive is typically in the form of a powder as shown at <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) or a gel <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Many different sources and brands of powder, liquid and gel additives may be used in the reservoir <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The valve body <b>32</b> has an open end and is designed to receive a removable and rotatable valve control member or core <b>40</b>. The valve body <b>32</b> also has a third barbed tubular adapter <b>42</b> which is removably attached to one end of a normally transparent delivery hose <b>44</b> at a forward end thereof. The delivery hose <b>44</b> forms a drinking tube to enable fluid to be withdrawn from bladder <b>14</b>. The other end of the delivery hose <b>44</b> is provided with a bite or mouth-actuated valve <b>46</b>. The bite valve <b>46</b> is selectively deformed from a position in which liquid regulated by control valve assembly <b>12</b> is prevented from being dispensed to a dispensing position in which the user U by oral suction may draw liquid from the bladder <b>14</b> when the user U compresses the mouth piece <b>46</b> with one's teeth or lips.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the valve body <b>32</b> is provided with a reservoir receiver <b>48</b> spaced from the tubular adapter <b>30</b> for receiving and removably mounting the reservoir <b>34</b> at a substantially 90&#xb0; orientation with respect to the valve body <b>32</b>. A solid bar <b>50</b> interconnects tubular adapter <b>30</b> and reservoir receiver <b>48</b>, and may be utilized with an appropriate attachment device such as a clip or tie to position the control valve assembly <b>12</b> on the straps <b>18</b> of the carrying device <b>16</b> holding the hydration bladder <b>14</b>. In addition, the valve body <b>32</b> is formed with a retaining arm <b>52</b> opposite the adapter <b>30</b> and reservoir receiver <b>48</b>. The retaining arm <b>52</b> creates one or more openings <b>54</b> for receiving an attachment device similarly used to fasten the control valve assembly <b>12</b> on the carrier straps <b>18</b> as will be further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The valve core <b>40</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, has an elongated tubular spool portion <b>56</b> provided with a bulbous front end <b>58</b> that is generally frustonically shaped and formed transversely therethrough with a first valve core port <b>60</b>. Rearwardly of the front end <b>58</b>, the spool portion <b>56</b> is formed with a tab <b>62</b> extending therefrom and includes a second valve core port <b>64</b> formed transversely therethrough. The spool portion <b>56</b> is also constructed with a grooved seal holder <b>66</b> that extends radially outwardly from an outer surface of the spool portion <b>56</b>, and retains a sealing device such as an O-ring <b>68</b> thereon. A valve core retaining element <b>70</b> further extends radially from the spool portion <b>56</b>, and has an outer diameter larger than that of the seal holder <b>66</b> to further retain O-ring <b>68</b> in position on a valve core <b>40</b>. A cap <b>72</b> is integrally configured with a handle <b>74</b> and defines a rearward end of the spool portion <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, the spool portion <b>56</b> has an internal chamber <b>76</b> extending longitudinally therethrough. The chamber <b>76</b> is closed at a rearward end <b>57</b> thereof, open at a forward end <b>58</b> thereof, and communicates with the valve core ports <b>60</b> and <b>64</b>. The valve core ports <b>60</b> and <b>64</b> and the chamber <b>76</b> collectively define liquid passageways for selectively conducting liquid flow through the control valve assembly <b>12</b> as will be more closely understood hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The valve body <b>32</b> is formed with an internal wall <b>78</b> defining a bore <b>80</b> and having a annular groove <b>82</b> for slidably receiving and retaining the valve core <b>40</b>. Sliding of the valve core <b>40</b> into the bore <b>80</b> enables the retaining element <b>70</b> to snap into the wall <b>78</b> so as to permit rotation of the valve core <b>40</b>, but prevent axial movement of the valve core port <b>60</b> relative to the valve body <b>32</b>. At the same time, the O-ring <b>68</b> seals tightly against the internal wall <b>78</b> of the valve body <b>32</b>. As seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the internal wall <b>78</b> is formed with a series of spaced apart dimples <b>84</b> each of which is engageable with the tab <b>62</b> on the rotatable valve core <b>40</b> to precisely position the handle <b>74</b> relative to the valve body <b>32</b>. The dimples <b>84</b> and the tabs <b>62</b> serve as a tactile indicator for selection of incremental positions of the rotatable valve core <b>40</b> within the valve body <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The tubular adapter <b>30</b> defines a first inlet port <b>86</b> which lies in communication with the water or other liquid in hydration bladder <b>14</b>. The inlet port <b>86</b> also communicates with an axially extending recess <b>88</b> lying between the internal wall <b>78</b> of the valve body <b>32</b> and the outer surface of spool portion <b>56</b>, and substantially surrounding the spool portion <b>56</b> between the front end <b>58</b> thereof and the seal holder <b>66</b>. The reservoir receiver <b>48</b> has an internally threaded mouth <b>90</b>, a sealing ring <b>92</b>, and a narrowed portion <b>94</b> which defines a second inlet port <b>96</b>. The narrowed portion <b>94</b> is provided with an opening <b>97</b> which is selectively aligned with the valve core port <b>60</b>. External threads <b>98</b> on a neck <b>100</b> of the reservoir <b>34</b> are screwthreaded into the threaded mouth <b>90</b> such that an inner surface of the neck <b>100</b> is sealed with ring <b>92</b>. With this construction, additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> in the reservoir <b>34</b> communicates with the second inlet port <b>96</b> which, in turn, may be placed in communication with valve core ports <b>60</b>, <b>64</b> and chamber <b>76</b> upon selective rotation of the valve core <b>40</b>. The tubular adapter <b>42</b> defines an outlet port <b>102</b> that provides communication between the chamber <b>76</b> and the delivery hose <b>44</b> terminating in bite valve <b>46</b>. The outlet port <b>102</b> extends centrally from a forward end of the valve body <b>32</b>, and is aligned with the chamber <b>76</b>. A longitudinal axis of the control valve assembly <b>12</b> passes through the chamber <b>76</b> and outlet port <b>42</b>. As will be described below, the valve core <b>40</b> is rotated within the bore <b>80</b> of the valve body <b>32</b> to create single flow and mixed flow conditions which will prevent or allow certain flow of liquid from the control valve assembly <b>12</b> to delivery hose <b>44</b> and bite valve <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The control valve assembly <b>12</b> is conveniently provided to the user U in the form of a kit or package which includes the valve core <b>40</b> assembled in the valve body <b>32</b> along with a reservoir <b>34</b> which is screwthreadedly attached to the valve body <b>32</b> and may be prefilled with liquid, gel or other additives <b>36</b> or <b>38</b>, or may be manually filled by the user. The kit also includes attachment devices such as a tie <b>104</b> or band <b>106</b> for securing the control valve assembly <b>12</b> to the straps <b>18</b> of the carrier <b>16</b>. Other suitable attachment devices may be provided to secure the control valve assembly <b>12</b> to the straps <b>18</b> of the carrier <b>16</b> holding the hydration bladder <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an exemplary attachment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the tie <b>104</b> is passed through openings <b>54</b> on retainer arm <b>52</b> and secured to one of the over the shoulder straps <b>18</b>. The band <b>106</b> secures the reservoir <b>34</b> and the supply hose <b>28</b> to the strap <b>18</b>. In the exemplary attachment shown, the control valve assembly <b>12</b> is oriented such that the reservoir <b>34</b> filled with additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> is oriented in a generally gravity flow position when the user is in a generally upright position as is the case in a running, walking or biking activity. However, it should be understood that the control valve assembly <b>12</b> can also be used if the user U occupies a non-upright position, such as a prone position, as might be assumed during use by military personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In operation, the valve core <b>40</b> is rotatably positioned within the valve body <b>32</b> in a single flow condition when the handle <b>74</b> is turned to the downwardly extending position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 9</figref>, or an alternative upwardly extending position shown in phantom lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the single flow condition, alignment of the second inlet port <b>96</b> with the valve core port <b>60</b> is blocked, but communication among first inlet port <b>86</b>, valve core port <b>64</b>, chamber <b>76</b> and outlet port <b>102</b> is enabled. As a result, no mixing of water or liquid from hydration bladder <b>14</b> and additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> in reservoir <b>34</b> is permitted, and liquid from hydration bladder <b>14</b> only is allowed to flow (as represented by the dotted line <b>108</b>) through inlet port <b>86</b> to outlet port <b>102</b> and delivery hose <b>44</b> upon a suction force applied at bite valve <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be appreciated that leakage from the rear of the control valve assembly <b>12</b> is prevented by the O-ring <b>68</b>. Leakage from the forward end of the control valve assembly <b>12</b> is prevented by the sealing interface between the bulbous front end <b>58</b> of the spool portion <b>56</b> and the internal wall <b>78</b> of the valve body <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The valve core <b>40</b> is rotatably positioned within the valve body <b>32</b> in a mixed flow condition when the handle <b>74</b> is turned to a laterally extending position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 10</figref>, or an alternative position shown in phantom lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In the mixed flow condition, there is alignment of the second inlet port <b>96</b> with the valve core port <b>60</b> and simultaneous communication with the chamber <b>76</b>, the valve core port <b>64</b>, the first inlet port <b>86</b>, and the outlet port <b>102</b>. As a result, liquid from the hydration bladder <b>14</b> flows freely through the chamber <b>76</b> and directly into opening <b>97</b>, second inlet port <b>96</b> and the reservoir <b>34</b>, as represented by the dotted line <b>108</b>, where it forcefully circulates and combines with the additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> represented by the solid line <b>110</b>. Narrowed portion <b>94</b> serves as a flow directing structure for directing liquid flow from hydration bladder <b>14</b> into reservoir <b>34</b> to facilitate circulation of liquid and additive in the reservoir <b>34</b>. The valve core port <b>60</b>, the opening <b>97</b> and the narrowed portion <b>94</b> are sized and shaped to promote optimum flow of liquid <b>108</b> into the reservoir <b>34</b> so as to produce an evenly blended liquid mixture <b>112</b> of liquid <b>108</b> and additive <b>110</b> (as represented by line <b>112</b>) to flow from the outlet port <b>42</b>. That is, the circulation action of the liquid <b>108</b> and the additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> results in a more homogenous liquid mixture <b>112</b> which minimizes the presence of liquefied powder clumps when using a dry additive or globs when using a liquid or gel additive. The control valve assembly <b>12</b> has been found to provide a substantially consistent liquid mixture product when used with different types of powder, liquid and gel additives.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The control valve assembly <b>12</b> is suitably designed so that rotation of the valve core <b>40</b> within the valve body <b>32</b> between the single flow condition and the mixed flow condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> provides the user U with different ratios of liquid from the hydration bladder <b>14</b> and gel or powder additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> from the reservoir <b>34</b> as desired. The various ratios desired can be correlated with locations of the dimples <b>84</b> spaced circumferentially on the internal wall <b>78</b> of the valve body <b>32</b>. Once the additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> is exhausted, the user U unscrews the reservoir <b>34</b> from the valve body <b>34</b>, cleans the interior of the reservoir <b>34</b> and refills the reservoir <b>34</b> with a similar or different additive than previously used.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be appreciated that the control valve <b>12</b> does not utilize any check valves in the flow passageways <b>60</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>76</b> or inlet ports <b>86</b>, <b>96</b>, but instead provides a free flow of water or other liquid flow from the hydration bladder <b>14</b> (via a suction force) through the port <b>60</b> and opening <b>97</b> and into reservoir <b>34</b> so as to provide the circulation action with the additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> as described above. In addition, the circulation action is facilitated due to the substantially rigid, non-collapsible nature of the reservoir <b>34</b> which has an interior mixing space in which water or liquid sucked from the hydration bladder <b>14</b> replaces the additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> being mixed or diluted when the valve core <b>40</b> is in the mixing position. The control valve assembly <b>12</b> can provide a closed system wherein the reservoir <b>34</b> does not collapse, and enables circulation action for consistently dissolving a powder additive or liquefying a gel additive. The reservoir <b>34</b> can be constructed of substantially rigid material, such as plastic, which will not normally rupture or deform, such as by squeezing or pinching, so as to obstruct or destroy liquid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-16</figref> illustrate another embodiment of a control valve assembly <b>12</b>&#x2032; which is generally similar to the control valve assembly <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref> except for the following modifications.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Control valve assembly <b>12</b>&#x2032; includes a valve body <b>32</b>&#x2032; in which a valve core <b>40</b>&#x2032; is rotatably mounted. As seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, valve body <b>32</b>&#x2032; is formed with a lower belly portion <b>114</b> that facilitates a directed flow of water or liquid from the hydration bladder <b>14</b> through the control valve assembly <b>12</b>&#x2032;. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref>, reservoir receiver <b>48</b> of valve body <b>32</b>&#x2032; is provided internally with a vertically extending flow divider <b>116</b> which extends from the base of opening <b>97</b> up to the sealing ring <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-16</figref>, the valve port <b>40</b>&#x2032; has an elongated splined spool portion <b>118</b> and a bulbous front end <b>120</b> formed therethrough with a valve core port <b>122</b> that communicates via a recess <b>123</b> with a depression <b>124</b>. Recesses <b>123</b> and depressions <b>124</b> are provided on each side of the front end <b>120</b>. Front end <b>120</b> is further formed with another valve core port <b>126</b> which is spaced from the depression <b>124</b>. Valve core ports <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> are in communication with an internal chamber <b>128</b> which extends out of the front end <b>120</b> of the control core <b>40</b>&#x2032;, and communicates with outlet port <b>102</b> and valve core <b>40</b>&#x2032; mounted inside valve body <b>32</b>&#x2032;. Valve core ports <b>122</b> and <b>126</b>, recesses <b>123</b>, depressions <b>124</b> and chamber <b>128</b> define liquid passageways for conducting liquid flow through the control valve assembly <b>12</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In operation of the control valve assembly <b>12</b>&#x2032;, the valve core <b>40</b>&#x2032; is rotatably mounted within valve body <b>32</b>&#x2032; in a no flow condition when the handle <b>74</b> is turned to the upwardly extending position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In the no flow condition, liquid flow from the bladder <b>14</b>, as represented by solid line <b>108</b>, may be drawn through inlet port <b>30</b> for flow around the spool portion <b>118</b>, but the rotational position of the valve core <b>40</b>&#x2032; prevents any liquid flow <b>108</b> from entering valve core port <b>126</b>, chamber <b>128</b> and outlet port <b>102</b> as well as opening <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the handle <b>74</b> of valve core <b>40</b>&#x2032; is rotated to the downwardly extending orientation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a single flow condition is established in which liquid flow <b>108</b> from the bladder <b>14</b> is drawn through inlet port <b>30</b>, flows around spool portion <b>118</b>, and is allowed to flow through valve port <b>126</b> into chamber <b>128</b> and out of outlet port <b>102</b>. The rotational position of the valve core <b>40</b>&#x2032; prevents any liquid flow <b>108</b> from entering the opening <b>97</b> leading into the reservoir <b>34</b> filled with additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the valve core <b>40</b>&#x2032; is further rotated to the laterally extending orientation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a mixed flow condition is defined. In the mixed flow condition, liquid flow <b>108</b> from bladder <b>14</b> drawn through the inlet port <b>30</b> flows around spool portion <b>118</b> and is led into depressions <b>124</b> and opening <b>97</b> at the bottom of reservoir receiver <b>48</b>. The liquid flow <b>108</b> is then directed along one side of the flow divider <b>116</b> so that if forcefully circulates and mixes with the additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> in the reservoir <b>34</b> as represented by the dotted line <b>110</b>. Flow divider <b>116</b> and narrowed portion <b>94</b> act as a flow directing structure for directing liquid flow from bladder <b>14</b> into reservoir <b>34</b> to facilitate circulation of liquid and additive in the reservoir <b>34</b>. The liquid and additive mixture represented by the dotted line <b>112</b> flows down the other side of flow divider <b>116</b> and exits out chamber <b>128</b> and outlet port <b>102</b>. As the additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b> is used, liquid flow <b>108</b> continues to replenish the empty space in the reservoir <b>34</b> vacated by the additive <b>36</b> or <b>38</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-21A</figref>, the additive reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2032; is constructed of a flexible material such as for example relatively low density plastic so that the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2032; can be manually squeezed from the expanded shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-20</figref> to the collapsed shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Collapsing of the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2032; forces additive from inside the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2032; into the valve body <b>32</b>, as shown at arrows A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> for mixing with fluid that is withdrawn from the bladder <b>14</b> via the delivery hose <b>44</b>, for example via bite valve <b>46</b> during oral suction by the user. The low density plastic of the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2032; can be selected to have resiliency so that the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2032; returns to the expanded shape upon being manually released.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The control valve assembly <b>12</b>&#x2033; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-21A</figref> also includes a quick connect adapter <b>130</b> instead of the barbed tubular adapter <b>30</b> shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref>. The quick connect adapter <b>130</b> can be of the type manufactured by Colder Products Company of St. Paul, Minn. See the website www.colder.com for examples of such quick connect adapters. An example of such a quick connect adapter is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,158, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in entirety. Additional quick connect adapters could be utilized, such as for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,082,401 and D384,731, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in entirety. The quick connect adapter <b>130</b> is in communication with the inlet port <b>86</b>, and can thus enable quick connection and disconnection of the supply hose <b>28</b> to the body <b>32</b> of assembly <b>12</b> for delivery of fluid thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">An additional quick connect adapter <b>142</b> enabling quick connection and disconnection of the delivery hose <b>44</b> and related bite or mouth actuated valve <b>46</b> is provided instead of the third barbed tubular adapter <b>42</b>. The quick connect adapter <b>142</b> is in communication with the outlet port <b>102</b>, and can be of the types mentioned herein above.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A duckbill valve D is disposed in the inlet port <b>86</b> of valve body <b>32</b> and prevents backflow of additive at arrow B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) from the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2032; and body <b>32</b> to the adapter <b>130</b> and supply hose <b>28</b>. That is, the duckbill valve D will not allow backflow of additive out of inlet port <b>86</b> to supply hose <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The assembly <b>12</b>&#x2033; thus allows the user U to increase the amount of additive in the mixture dispensed through the delivery hose <b>44</b> by squeezing the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2032; and forcing additional additive into the valve body <b>32</b>. The duckbill valve D advantageously protects the adapter <b>130</b> and supply hose <b>28</b> from becoming clogged with additive.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-27</figref> depict additional embodiments of an assembly <b>12</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;. In these embodiments, the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2033; is part of a rigid housing H that is integral with body <b>32</b>&#x2032; and also includes a liquid chamber C. The reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2033; is separated from the chamber C by a separating wall W. A movable lid L is provided on the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2033;. The lid L can be hinged at one end, such as shown at hinge <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> and latched at an opposite end by a camming latch <b>134</b>. Alternately, a snap-fit arrangement <b>135</b> for the lid L can be provided, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, and adapter <b>30</b>&#x2032; extends upwardly from the lid L. Alternately, a sliding latch arrangement <b>136</b>, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref> can be provided to lock the lid L in the closed position. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26</figref>, <b>27</b>, the sliding latch arrangement <b>136</b> is shown on a front edge of lid L, and the hinge <b>132</b> is located at a rear edge of lid L.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An inlet screen S is provided in the lower end of inlet port <b>96</b> and the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2033;. The screen S in the example shown is dome shaped and extends across the second inlet port <b>96</b>; however, other configurations can be employed. The purpose of the screen S will be described further herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The control valve assembly <b>12</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; has a valve core <b>40</b>&#x2033; similar to the valve core <b>40</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-16</figref>. The valve core <b>40</b>&#x2033; includes a flow divider Y that aligns with the flow divider <b>116</b> of body <b>32</b>&#x2032; when the valve core <b>40</b>&#x2033; is rotated into the noted mixed flow condition, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23</figref>, <b>25</b> and <b>27</b>. As shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 27</figref>, drinking fluid from the chamber C is directed upwardly through the screen S by the flow dividers Y and <b>116</b> so as to cause circulation within the reservoir <b>34</b>&#x2033;, thus disrupting and preventing coagulation of the additive and clearing the screen S from blockage. This is particularly helpful when the additive is a powder-based material. Flow of the liquid and the pore size of the screen S can be configured so as to prevent formation of a certain particle size within the powder-based additive, thus protecting the downstream bite valve <b>46</b> from clogging. The top of the flow divider <b>116</b> is spaced from the screen S so that liquid flow from chamber C is directed through the entire screen to push additive particles away from screen S until the flow-stimulated particles have broken down in size to pass freely through the screen S. The screen S is replaceable and can have different sized holes and different shapes depending upon the particular type of additive being utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As with the previous embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-21A</figref>, adapters and quick connectors such as are shown at <b>142</b>&#x2032;, <b>130</b>, and <b>30</b>&#x2032; can be utilized to facilitate quick connection of the delivery and supply hoses.</p>
