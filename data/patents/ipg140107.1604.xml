<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a dust collecting cover used for preventing scattering of and collecting dust generated in grinding work performed mainly using an angle grinder.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">During the grinding work of concrete and the like, generation of dust is inevitable, and various methods have been devised so far to prevent scattering of and collect the dust.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Most of them are of the kind in which a cup-shaped cover covering a grinding cup wheel rotationally driven by using an electric tool such as an angle grinder and a vacuum cleaner is connected to a duct provided at a portion of the cover to collect the dust inside the cover using the suction force of the vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Among them, the dust collecting cover introduced in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2008-049469 employs the method of connecting an angle grinder to an adapter that is joined to a body cover by a plurality of springs, so that the worker can freely move a head part of the angle grinder and therefore perform finer grinding work. Further, a sub-cover provided at a portion of the body cover is also openable/closable utilizing a magnetic force of magnets, so that the dust collecting cover has a structure allowing even the grinding work close to a wall.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">However, since various kinds of angle grinders which are used in the actual sites of work widely vary in shape, it is impossible to design the aforesaid adapter to be commonly used for all of the angle grinders.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Accordingly, for versatility, it is necessary to prepare dedicated adapters matching the respective shapes of the angle grinders. However, with the configuration of the above-described dust collecting cover, all of the springs need to be detached using a special tool such as pliers or the like for replacement of the adapter, thus forcing the worker to perform a difficult and complex work.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">Furthermore, the above-described sub-cover, which opens/closes utilizing the magnetic force of the magnets, is not always attached to the body cover by an absolute binding force. Therefore, when the surface of a material to be ground is very coarse and has many steps, the worker has to perform the is grinding work paying close attention not to detach the sub-cover during the work.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">The other devised dust collecting covers have problems in the structure, usability, and the dust collecting performance as described in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2008-049469, and any of them is far from perfect.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2008-049469</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">An effective measure of preventing scattering of the dust generated during the grinding work is that the grinding cup wheel is covered with a cover, and a vacuum cleaner is connected to a duct provided on the cover to suck the dust in the cover. However, the above-described angle grinders are of various types and their shapes are not uniform, and it is difficult to give versatility to them.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">Further, there is another method of making a portion of the cover openable/closable to enable the grinding work to an extent close to a wall, but the portion needs to be the one whose open/close movement can be easily performed and which is not unintentionally opened during the work.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">An object of the present invention is to provide a dust collecting cover for a grinding cup wheel having both excellent practicality and versatility.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">The above object is achieved by joining a base plate to a body of a dust collecting cover via elastic bodies at a plurality of positions, providing an adapter for joining an angle grinder to be attachable/detachable on the base plate, and forming a portion of the body cover as a sub-cover openable/closable utilizing a magnetic force of a magnet to configure the sub-cover to be fastenable to the body cover by a screw inserted via a through hole provided in the magnet into a female screw part provided on the body cover side.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">The dust collecting cover according to the present invention has a structure in which an adapter used for connection with an angle grinder can be easily replaced with another by a commonly-used tool, so that the dust collecting cover can be widely used for various angle grinders by replacement of adapters prepared for the respective angle grinders.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">In addition, the dust collecting cover not only employs the easily-handled magnet attraction method but also is structured to be completely fixable with screws, so that stable grinding work can be performed even under conditions that a load is applied on the sub-cover.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">A dust collecting cover according to the present invention is configured such that a base plate <b>3</b> is joined to a body cover <b>1</b> via springs <b>2</b> at a plurality of positions as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Female screws <b>4</b> are provided, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the base plate <b>3</b> to which a first adapter <b>5</b> as a separate component is fixed by screws <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">A gear case part <b>8</b> of an angle grinder <b>7</b> is placed on the first adapter <b>5</b> and a second adapter <b>9</b> is fastened to the first adapter <b>5</b> with screws <b>10</b>, whereby the angle grinder <b>7</b> can be joined to the body cover <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">The body cover <b>1</b> is configured to be open at a portion to which a separate sub-cover <b>11</b> is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, magnets <b>13</b> are adhered to the tips of protruding-shape parts <b>12</b> on the sub-cover <b>11</b> side, recessed-shape parts <b>14</b>, which are matched with the positions and the shapes of the protruding-shape parts <b>12</b>, are provided on the body cover <b>1</b> side, and bushings <b>15</b> made of iron are casted in the bottom faces of the recessed-shape parts <b>14</b>. Accordingly, only by bringing the sub-cover <b>11</b> into abutment with the body cover <b>1</b>, the sub-cover <b>11</b> can be attached to the body cover <b>1</b> side by the attraction force of the magnets <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">Further, the magnets <b>13</b> are machined to have through holes <b>16</b> and the bushings <b>15</b> are machined to have female screws <b>17</b> so that screws <b>18</b> can be inserted into the through holes <b>16</b> of the magnets <b>13</b> from the sub-cover <b>11</b> side and fastened to the female screws <b>17</b> of the bushings <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">For an open face <b>19</b> of the body cover <b>1</b>, a plate <b>20</b> that is attachable thereto is prepared separately from the sub-cover <b>11</b> and also has protruding-shape parts <b>22</b>, similar to those of the sub-cover <b>11</b>, having magnets with through hole <b>21</b> adhered to the tips thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">A pedestal <b>23</b> is provided on a side face of the body cover <b>1</b>, and recessed-shape parts <b>25</b> having bushings with female screw <b>24</b> casted therein are provided on the pedestal <b>23</b> similarly to the open face <b>19</b> so that the sub-cover <b>11</b> and the plate <b>20</b> can be similarly attached to the pedestal <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">When a grinding cup wheel <b>26</b> is attached to the angle grinder <b>7</b>, the body cover <b>1</b> and the sub-cover <b>11</b> come to cover the grinding cup wheel <b>26</b>. Note that blushes <b>27</b> are attached to the lower end faces of the body cover <b>1</b> and the sub-cover <b>11</b> and configured such that a lower end face <b>28</b> of the grinding cup wheel <b>26</b> is slightly retracted to the inside of the cover behind lower end faces <b>29</b> of the blushes <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">At the body cover <b>1</b>, a duct <b>30</b> leading from the inside of the body cover <b>1</b> is provided, and a hose <b>31</b> can be attached to the duct <b>30</b> and connected to a not-shown vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031">Since the shape of the angle grinder <b>7</b> varies from manufacturer to manufacturer as described above, when another angle grinder is newly attached, it is necessary to replace the adapter with a dedicated adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">Even such a situation can be easily dealt with in the dust collecting cover according to the present invention only by detaching the screws <b>6</b> using an ordinary tool <b>32</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and attaching another adapter in the reverse order.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">Since the base plate <b>3</b> itself is in a stable state during the adapter replacement, a worker never worries about the influence of the springs <b>2</b>, unlike the above-described conventional product.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034">After turning on the power of the angle grinder <b>7</b> to drive the grinding cup wheel <b>26</b>, the worker first brings the blushes <b>27</b> into contact with a material to be ground and then gradually presses the angle grinder <b>7</b> downward, whereby the lower end face <b>28</b> of the grinding cup wheel <b>26</b> finally comes into contact with the material to be ground and the worker can start the grinding work.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">Since the blushes <b>27</b> are provided all around a space between the material to be ground and the cover, dust generated by the grinding rarely escapes from the lower end portion of the cover and will be blown and gathered inside the cover. By connecting the vacuum cleaner to the duct <b>30</b> for suction in this event, it becomes possible to collect most of the dust.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0036">In the actual grinding work, not only surface grinding but also local grinding through use of an edge portion of the grinding cup wheel <b>26</b> by inclining the grinding cup wheel <b>26</b> are required in many case. The dust collecting cover according to the present invention has a spring-holding structure in which the adapter part is freely movable, so that the grinding cup wheel <b>26</b> can be inclined inside the cover without separating the blushes <b>27</b> from a material to be ground <b>33</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, thus never deteriorating the dust collecting efficiency even during such a specific use.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">Further, the first adapter <b>5</b> and the second adapter <b>9</b> and the base plate <b>3</b> being the base of them are molded products made of a steel sheet and therefore have high durability to withstand the load, fall and the like in use.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">Further, even if there are some steps and the like on the surface of the material to be ground <b>33</b>, the blushes <b>27</b> flexibly cope with the steps and the like and can therefore minimize catch during the work and escape of dust. Even when the blushes <b>27</b> are damaged due to repeated use over the years, it is possible to detach only the blushes <b>27</b> and replace them with other ones.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">When the surface of the material to be ground <b>33</b> is very coarse and has many steps, the blushes <b>27</b> are likely to be caught by the steps. However, the screws <b>18</b> absolutely fix the sub-cover <b>11</b> under such bad conditions to eliminate the fear of unintentional dropout of the sub-cover <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040">As a matter of course, when the surface of the material to be ground <b>33</b> is relatively flat and free from conspicuous steps, the sub-cover <b>11</b> can be attached only by the attraction force of the magnets <b>13</b> as usual for the grinding work.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0041">On the other hand, when the sub-cover <b>11</b> is replaced with the plate <b>20</b>, a grinding cup wheel side face <b>35</b> is slightly exposed from a plate face <b>34</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Therefore, by performing the work while keeping the plate face <b>34</b> in abutment with the wall surface, the worker can perform the grinding as close as possible to the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0042">Basically, a load is unlikely to be applied in a direction in which the plate <b>20</b> is detached in the grinding work close to the wall, and it is also possible to completely fix the plate <b>20</b> to the body cover <b>1</b> with the screws <b>18</b> as necessary, similarly to the sub-cover <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0043">Note that the plate <b>20</b> is unnecessary during the normal grinding work, whereas the sub-cover <b>11</b> is unnecessary during the grinding close to the wall. Each of the plate <b>20</b> and the sub-cover <b>11</b> can be easily attached to the pedestal <b>23</b> on the side face of the body cover <b>1</b> utilizing the attraction force of the magnets <b>13</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, so that missing of them can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">Further, when the body cover <b>1</b> and the sub-cover <b>11</b> are made of a transparent material, the worker can visually grasp the approximate position of the grinding cup wheel <b>26</b> inside them during the work.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0045">In the actual use, the insides of both the body cover <b>1</b> and the sub-cover <b>11</b> are likely to be slightly obscure by the dust, but the transparent material is effective means for the worker who wants to intuitively grasp the position of the grinding cup wheel <b>26</b>.</p>
