<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 61/245,511 which was filed on Sep. 24, 2009, and which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to lithography, and more particularly to patterning device inspection.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A lithographic apparatus is a machine that applies a pattern onto a substrate, usually onto a target portion of the substrate. A lithographic apparatus can be used, for example, in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs). In that instance, a patterning device, which is alternatively referred to as a mask or a reticle, can be used to create a circuit pattern formed on an individual layer of the IC. The pattern can be transferred onto the target portion (e.g., comprising part of, one, or several dies) of the substrate (e.g., a silicon wafer). Transfer of the pattern is typically via imaging the pattern onto a layer of radiation-sensitive material (resist) on the substrate. In general, a single substrate will contain a network of adjacent target portions that are patterned. Known lithographic apparatus include steppers, in which each individual target portion is irradiated by exposing an entire pattern onto the target portion at one time, and scanners, in which each target portion is irradiated by scanning the pattern through a radiation beam in a given direction (the &#x201c;scanning&#x201d; direction) while synchronously scanning the substrate parallel or anti-parallel to this direction. It is also possible to transfer the pattern from the patterning device to the substrate by imprinting the pattern onto the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To image smaller features, it has been proposed to use extreme ultraviolet radiation (EUV) as exposure radiation in a lithographic apparatus. EUV radiation needs the exposure radiation beam path in the apparatus to be evacuated to avoid absorption of the exposure radiation. EUV lithographic apparatus use a patterning device, such as a mask or a reticle, to impart a pattern into a beam of EUV radiation. Such patterning devices are highly susceptible to contamination, such as particulate contamination, which provides image defects in the pattern imparted into the EUV radiation beam. The image defects at least degrade, and in some cases, can destroy the performance of an IC manufactured with a contaminated reticle. The image defects reduce yield of the lithographic apparatus. Therefore, inspecting patterning devices for contamination is important to maintain and improve yield of the lithographic apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, masks are inspected for contamination using two methods, absolute detection and a comparison technique. Absolute detection measures a scattered signal from a probe beam. Analysis of the scattered signal may indicate a particular type and size of particulate contamination. However, absolute detection is not able to accurately distinguish between a signal produced by scattering from a reticle pattern and a signal produced by scattering from contamination on the reticle pattern. This problem occurs because contamination can be composed of any material having dimensions down to a molecular level, which unfortunately includes dimensions of a reticle's absorber structures. As a result, when using absolute detection, a scattered signal from a particle on the reticle's surface is indistinguishable from a signal scattered by the reticle's absorber structures. Thus, absolute detection is often relegated to inspecting non-patterned surfaces, such as a back-side of a reticle or a pellicle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another conventional method for reticle inspection uses comparison techniques. Comparison techniques include two common methods for inspecting patterned surfaces of a reticle. The first traditional comparison technique is commonly known as &#x201c;die-to-die&#x201d; comparison. This technique contemporaneously compares a first pattern on a substrate to a second pattern, similar to the first pattern, that is also located on the substrate. This technique essentially compares a first optical signal from a first pattern on the reticle with a second optical signal from a second pattern on the same reticle. Problems with this technique include that it cannot be performed when the reticle contains only one pattern or only a collection of unique patterns. Further, variations in absorber structure sizes and variations in critical dimensions between the first and second patterns can complicate the particle detection process and undesirably limit inspection accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The second conventional comparison technique compares a pattern on a tangible reticle with a computer-generated theoretical reticle layout design from which the tangible reticle was fabricated. Problems with this technique include that errors in a reticle fabrication process, such as those stemming from critical dimension control, are not represented in the computer-generated theoretical reticle layout design. These errors complicate the comparison technique by indicating differences between the tangible reticle and the computer-generated theoretical reticle layout design that are false positive indications of contamination. Thus, this comparison technique inherently produces errors that complicate the particle detection process and undesirably limit inspection accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the conventional systems and methods for inspecting a reticle suffer from significant disadvantages.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This section is for the purpose of summarizing some aspects of the present invention and to briefly introduce some preferred embodiments. Simplifications or omissions may be made to avoid obscuring the purpose of the section. Such simplifications or omissions are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Consistent with the principles of the present invention as embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention includes improved reticle inspection systems and methods. To meet these needs, embodiments of the present invention are directed toward time differential reticle inspection. For example, an embodiment provides a method for detecting contamination on a reticle using a time differential technique. In this embodiment, presence of a difference between a first signature of a portion of the reticle and a second signature, produced subsequent to the first signature, of the portion of the reticle is determined. A significant difference between the first and second signatures indicates a presence of contamination on the reticle. If there are no significant differences, then the reticle is considered to be clean. In this embodiment, the first signature can be measured when the reticle is in a known clean condition.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As a further example, another embodiment provides a method for detecting contamination on a reticle. A first signature of a portion of the reticle is recorded. Then the portion of the reticle is exposed to form a wafer image. The wafer image is inspected to detect an error. If an error is detected, the first signature is erased and the reticle is rejected as contaminated. If no error is detected in the wafer image, then the portion of the reticle is subsequently inspected to produce a second signature. A difference between the first signature and the second signature is determined, to detect contamination on the reticle. If contamination is detected, the reticle can be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another exemplary embodiment, there is provided a method for detecting contamination on a reticle. A first signature of a portion of the reticle is recorded at a time when the reticle meets a minimum level of cleanliness necessary to produce a functional integrated circuit layer. After the recording, the portion of the reticle is inspected to produce a second signature. A difference between the first signature and the second signature is determined, to detect contamination on the reticle. If contamination is detected, the reticle can be cleaned.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">I. Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention will be better understood from the following descriptions of various &#x201c;embodiments&#x201d; of the invention. Thus, specific &#x201c;embodiments&#x201d; are views of the invention, but each does not itself represent the whole invention. In many cases individual elements from one particular embodiment may be substituted for different elements in another embodiment carrying out a similar or corresponding function. The present invention relates to time differential reticle inspection methods and apparatus. This specification discloses one or more embodiments that incorporate the features of this invention. The disclosed embodiment(s) merely exemplify the invention. The scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment(s). The invention is defined by the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The embodiment(s) described, and references in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;an example embodiment&#x201d;, etc., indicate that the embodiment(s) described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is understood that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments, whether or not explicitly described.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Features of embodiments of the invention may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof. Features of embodiments of the invention may also be implemented as instructions stored on a machine-readable medium, which may be read and executed by one or more processors. A machine-readable medium may include any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computing device). For example, a machine-readable medium may include read only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory devices; electrical, optical, acoustical or other forms of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.), and others. Further, firmware, software, routines, instructions may be described herein as performing certain actions. However, it should be appreciated that such descriptions are merely for convenience and that such actions in fact result from computing devices, processors, controllers, or other devices executing the firmware, software, routines, instructions, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Disclosed are systems and methods for time differential reticle inspection. Contamination on a reticle is detected by, for example, determining a difference between a first signature of a portion of a reticle and a second signature, produced subsequent to the first signature, of the portion of the reticle. Measurement of the first and second signatures is not contemporaneous. In the time between measuring the first and second signatures, the reticle can be stored in a library and/or can be used in a lithographic apparatus to fabricate integrated devices.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this example, the first signature can be measured when the reticle is in a known clean condition, such as at a time when the reticle meets a minimum level of cleanliness necessary to produce a functional integrated circuit layer. Thus, if there is a significant difference between the first and second signatures, this difference indicates a presence of contamination on the reticle. If there are no significant differences, then the reticle is considered to be clean. If contamination on the reticle is detected, the reticle can be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Before describing such embodiments in more detail, however, it is instructive to present an example environment in which embodiments of the present invention may be implemented.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">II. An Example Lithographic Environment</heading>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">A. Example Reflective and Transmissive Lithographic Systems</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> schematically depict lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032;, respectively. Lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032; each include: an illumination system (illuminator) IL configured to condition a radiation beam B (e.g., DUV or EUV radiation) provided by a source SO; a support structure (e.g., a mask table) MT configured to support a patterning device (e.g., a mask, a reticle, or a dynamic patterning device) MA and connected to a first positioner PM configured to accurately position the patterning device MA; and a substrate table (e.g., a wafer table) WT configured to hold a substrate (e.g., a resist coated wafer) W and connected to a second positioner PW configured to accurately position the substrate W. Lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b> and <b>100</b>&#x2032; also have a projection system PS configured to project a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B by patterning device MA onto a target portion (e.g., comprising one or more dies) C of the substrate W. In lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> the patterning device MA and the projection system PS are reflective, and in lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032; the patterning device MA and the projection system PS are transmissive.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The illumination system IL can include various types of optical components, such as refractive, reflective, magnetic, electromagnetic, electrostatic, or other types of optical components, or any combination thereof, for directing, shaping, or controlling the radiation beam B.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The support structure MT holds the patterning device MA in a manner that depends on the orientation of the patterning device MA, the design of the lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b> and <b>100</b>&#x2032;, and other conditions, such as for example whether or not the patterning device MA is held in a vacuum environment. The support structure MT can use mechanical, vacuum, electrostatic or other clamping techniques to hold the patterning device MA. The support structure MT can be a frame or a table, for example, which can be fixed or movable, as required. The support structure MT can ensure that the patterning device is at a desired position, for example with respect to the projection system PS.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The term &#x201c;patterning device&#x201d; MA should be broadly interpreted as referring to any device that can be used to impart a radiation beam B with a pattern in its cross-section, such as to create a pattern in the target portion C of the substrate W. The pattern imparted to the radiation beam B can correspond to a particular functional layer in a device being created in the target portion C, such as an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The patterning device MA can be transmissive (as in lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) or reflective (as in lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Examples of patterning devices MA include reticles, masks, programmable mirror arrays, and programmable LCD panels. Masks are well known in lithography, and include mask types such as binary, alternating phase shift, and attenuated phase shift, as well as various hybrid mask types. An example of a programmable mirror array employs a matrix arrangement of small mirrors, each of which can be individually tilted so as to reflect an incoming radiation beam in different directions. The tilted mirrors impart a pattern in the radiation beam B which is reflected by the mirror matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;projection system&#x201d; PS can encompass any type of projection system, including refractive, reflective, catadioptric, magnetic, electromagnetic and electrostatic optical systems, or any combination thereof, as appropriate for the exposure radiation being used, or for other factors, such as the use of an immersion liquid or the use of a vacuum. A vacuum environment can be used for EUV or electron beam radiation since other gases can absorb, respectively, too much radiation or too many electrons. A vacuum environment can therefore be provided to the whole beam path with the aid of a vacuum wall and vacuum pumps.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and/or lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032; can be of a type having two (dual stage) or more substrate tables (and/or two or more mask tables) WT. In such &#x201c;multiple stage&#x201d; machines the additional substrate tables WT can be used in parallel, or preparatory steps can be carried out on one or more tables while one or more other substrate tables WT are being used for exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the illuminator IL receives a radiation beam from a radiation source SO. The source SO and the lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032; can be separate entities, for example when the source SO is an excimer laser. In such cases, the source SO is not considered to form part of the lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b> or <b>100</b>&#x2032;, and the radiation beam B passes from the source SO to the illuminator IL with the aid of a beam delivery system BD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) comprising, for example, suitable directing mirrors and/or a beam expander. In other cases, the source SO can be an integral part of the lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032;&#x2014;for example when the source SO is a mercury lamp. The source SO and the illuminator IL, together with the beam delivery system BD, if required, can be referred to as a radiation system.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The illuminator IL can comprise an adjuster AD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) for adjusting the angular intensity distribution of the radiation beam. Generally, at least the outer and/or inner radial extent (commonly referred to as &#x3c3;-outer and &#x3c3;-inner, respectively) of the intensity distribution in a pupil plane of the illuminator can be adjusted. In addition, the illuminator IL can comprise various other components (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), such as an integrator IN and a condenser CO. The illuminator IL can be used to condition the radiation beam B, to have a desired uniformity and intensity distribution in its cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the radiation beam B is incident on the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA, which is held on the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT, and is patterned by the patterning device MA. In lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>, the radiation beam B is reflected from the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA. After being reflected from the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA, the radiation beam B passes through the projection system PS, which focuses the radiation beam B onto a target portion C of the substrate W. With the aid of the second positioner PW and position sensor IF<b>2</b> (e.g., an interferometric device, linear encoder or capacitive sensor), the substrate table WT can be moved accurately, e.g. so as to position different target portions C in the path of the radiation beam B. Similarly, the first positioner PM and another position sensor IF<b>1</b> can be used to accurately position the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA with respect to the path of the radiation beam B. Patterning device (e.g., mask) MA and substrate W can be aligned using mask alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the radiation beam B is incident on the patterning device (e.g., mask MA), which is held on the support structure (e.g., mask table MT), and is patterned by the patterning device. Having traversed the mask MA, the radiation beam B passes through the projection system PS, which focuses the beam onto a target portion C of the substrate W. With the aid of the second positioner PW and position sensor IF (e.g., an interferometric device, linear encoder or capacitive sensor), the substrate table WT can be moved accurately, e.g. so as to position different target portions C in the path of the radiation beam B. Similarly, the first positioner PM and another position sensor (which is not explicitly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) can be used to accurately position the mask MA with respect to the path of the radiation beam B, e.g., after mechanical retrieval from a mask library, or during a scan. In general, movement of the mask table MT can be realized with the aid of a long-stroke module (coarse positioning) and a short-stroke module (fine positioning), which form part of the first positioner PM. Similarly, movement of the substrate table WT can be realized using a long-stroke module and a short-stroke module, which form part of the second positioner PW. In the case of a stepper (as opposed to a scanner) the mask table MT can be connected to a short-stroke actuator only, or can be fixed. Mask MA and substrate W can be aligned using mask alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>. Although the substrate alignment marks as illustrated occupy dedicated target portions, they can be located in spaces between target portions (known as scribe-lane alignment marks). Similarly, in situations in which more than one die is provided on the mask MA, the mask alignment marks can be located between the dies.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b> and <b>100</b>&#x2032; can be used in at least one of the following modes:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0041">1. In step mode, the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT and the substrate table WT are kept essentially stationary, while an entire pattern imparted to the radiation beam B is projected onto a target portion C at one time (i.e., a single static exposure). The substrate table WT is then shifted in the X and/or Y direction so that a different target portion C can be exposed.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0042">2. In scan mode, the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT and the substrate table WT are scanned synchronously while a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B is projected onto a target portion C (i.e., a single dynamic exposure). The velocity and direction of the substrate table WT relative to the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT can be determined by the (de-)magnification and image reversal characteristics of the projection system PS.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0043">3. In another mode, the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT is kept substantially stationary holding a programmable patterning device, and the substrate table WT is moved or scanned while a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B is projected onto a target portion C. A pulsed radiation source SO can be employed and the programmable patterning device is updated as required after each movement of the substrate table WT or in between successive radiation pulses during a scan. This mode of operation can be readily applied to maskless lithography that utilizes programmable patterning device, such as a programmable mirror array of a type as referred to herein.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0044">Combinations and/or variations on the described modes of use or entirely different modes of use can also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0045">Although specific reference can be made in this text to the use of lithographic apparatus in the manufacture of ICs, it should be understood that the lithographic apparatus described herein can have other applications, such as the manufacture of integrated optical systems, guidance and detection patterns for magnetic domain memories, flat-panel displays, liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), thin-film magnetic heads, etc. The skilled artisan will appreciate that, in the context of such alternative applications, any use of the terms &#x201c;wafer&#x201d; or &#x201c;die&#x201d; herein can be considered as synonymous with the more general terms &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; or &#x201c;target portion,&#x201d; respectively. The substrate referred to herein can be processed, before or after exposure, in for example a track (a tool that typically applies a layer of resist to a substrate and develops the exposed resist), a metrology tool and/or an inspection tool. Where applicable, the disclosure herein can be applied to such and other substrate processing tools. Further, the substrate can be processed more than once, for example in order to create a multi-layer IC, so that the term substrate used herein can also refer to a substrate that already contains multiple processed layers.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">In a further embodiment, lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> includes an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source, which is configured to generate a beam of EUV radiation for EUV lithography. In general, the EUV source is configured in a radiation system (see below), and a corresponding illumination system is configured to condition the EUV radiation beam of the EUV source.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">B. Example EUV Lithographic Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically depicts an exemplary EUV lithographic apparatus <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, EUV lithographic apparatus <b>200</b> includes a radiation system <b>42</b>, an illumination optics unit <b>44</b>, and a projection system PS. The radiation system <b>42</b> includes a radiation source SO, in which a beam of radiation can be formed by a discharge plasma. In an embodiment, EUV radiation can be produced by a gas or vapor, for example, from Xe gas, Li vapor, or Sn vapor, in which a very hot plasma is created to emit radiation in the EUV range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The very hot plasma can be created by generating at least partially ionized plasma by, for example, an electrical discharge. Partial pressures of, for example, 10 Pa of Xe, Li, Sn vapor or any other suitable gas or vapor can be required for efficient generation of the radiation. The radiation emitted by radiation source SO is passed from a source chamber <b>47</b> into a collector chamber <b>48</b> via a gas barrier or contaminant trap <b>49</b> positioned in or behind an opening in source chamber <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">In an embodiment, gas barrier <b>49</b> can include a channel structure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0049">Collector chamber <b>48</b> includes a radiation collector <b>50</b> (which can also be called a collector mirror or a collector) that can be formed from a grazing incidence collector. Radiation collector <b>50</b> has an upstream radiation collector side <b>50</b><i>a </i>and a downstream radiation collector side <b>50</b><i>b</i>, and radiation passed by collector <b>50</b> can be reflected off a grating spectral filter <b>51</b> to be focused at a virtual source point <b>52</b> at an aperture in the collector chamber <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0050">From collector chamber <b>48</b>, a beam of radiation <b>56</b> is reflected in illumination optics unit <b>44</b> via normal incidence reflectors <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> onto a reticle or mask (not shown) positioned on reticle or mask table MT. A patterned beam <b>57</b> is formed, which is imaged in projection system PS via reflective elements <b>58</b> and <b>59</b> onto a substrate (not shown) supported on wafer stage or substrate table WT. In various embodiments, illumination optics unit <b>44</b> and projection system PS can include more (or fewer) elements than depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, grating spectral filter <b>51</b> can optionally be present, depending upon the type of lithographic apparatus. Further, in an embodiment, illumination optics unit <b>44</b> and projection system PS can include more mirrors than those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, projection system PS can incorporate one to four reflective elements in addition to reflective elements <b>58</b> and <b>59</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference number <b>180</b> indicates a space between two reflectors, e.g., a space between reflectors <b>142</b> and <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0051">In an embodiment, collector mirror <b>50</b> can also include a normal incidence collector in place of or in addition to a grazing incidence mirror. Further, collector mirror <b>50</b>, although described in reference to a nested collector with reflectors <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>146</b>, is herein further used as example of a collector.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0052">Further, instead of a grating <b>51</b>, as schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a transmissive optical filter can also be applied. Optical filters transmissive for EUV, as well as optical filters less transmissive for or even substantially absorbing UV radiation, are known to skilled artisans. Hence, the use of &#x201c;grating spectral purity filter&#x201d; is herein further indicated interchangeably as a &#x201c;spectral purity filter,&#x201d; which includes gratings or transmissive filters. Although not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, EUV transmissive optical filters can be included as additional optical elements, for example, configured upstream of collector mirror <b>50</b> or optical EUV transmissive filters in illumination unit <b>44</b> and/or projection system PS.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0053">The terms &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream,&#x201d; with respect to optical elements, indicate positions of one or more optical elements &#x201c;optically upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;optically downstream,&#x201d; respectively, of one or more additional optical elements. Following the light path that a beam of radiation traverses through lithographic apparatus <b>200</b>, a first optical element closer to source SO than a second optical element is configured upstream of the second optical element; the second optical element is configured downstream of the first optical element. For example, collector mirror <b>50</b> is configured upstream of spectral filter <b>51</b>, whereas optical element <b>53</b> is configured downstream of spectral filter <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0054">All optical elements depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (and additional optical elements not shown in the schematic drawing of this embodiment) can be vulnerable to deposition of contaminants produced by source SO, for example, Sn. Such can be the case for the radiation collector <b>50</b> and, if present, the spectral purity filter <b>51</b>. Hence, a cleaning device can be employed to clean one or more of these optical elements, as well as a cleaning method can be applied to those optical elements, but also to normal incidence reflectors <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> and reflective elements <b>58</b> and <b>59</b> or other optical elements, for example additional mirrors, gratings, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0055">Radiation collector <b>50</b> can be a grazing incidence collector, and in such an embodiment, collector <b>50</b> is aligned along an optical axis O. The source SO, or an image thereof, can also be located along optical axis O. The radiation collector <b>50</b> can comprise reflectors <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>146</b> (also known as a &#x201c;shell&#x201d; or a Wolter-type reflector including several Wolter-type reflectors). Reflectors <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>146</b> can be nested and rotationally symmetric about optical axis O. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an inner reflector is indicated by reference number <b>142</b>, an intermediate reflector is indicated by reference number <b>143</b>, and an outer reflector is indicated by reference number <b>146</b>. The radiation collector <b>50</b> encloses a certain volume, i.e., a volume within the outer reflector(s) <b>146</b>. Usually, the volume within outer reflector(s) <b>146</b> is circumferentially closed, although small openings can be present.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0056">Reflectors <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>146</b> respectively can include surfaces of which at least portion represents a reflective layer or a number of reflective layers. Hence, reflectors <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>146</b> (or additional reflectors in the embodiments of radiation collectors having more than three reflectors or shells) are at least partly designed for reflecting and collecting EUV radiation from source SO, and at least part of reflectors <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>146</b> can not be designed to reflect and collect EUV radiation. For example, at least part of the back side of the reflectors can not be designed to reflect and collect EUV radiation. On the surface of these reflective layers, there can in addition be a cap layer for protection or as optical filter provided on at least part of the surface of the reflective layers.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0057">The radiation collector <b>50</b> can be placed in the vicinity of the source SO or an image of the source SO. Each reflector <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>146</b> can comprise at least two adjacent reflecting surfaces, the reflecting surfaces further from the source SO being placed at smaller angles to the optical axis O than the reflecting surface that is closer to the source SO. In this way, a grazing incidence collector <b>50</b> is configured to generate a beam of (E)UV radiation propagating along the optical axis O. At least two reflectors can be placed substantially coaxially and extend substantially rotationally symmetric about the optical axis O. It should be appreciated that radiation collector <b>50</b> can have further features on the external surface of outer reflector <b>146</b> or further features around outer reflector <b>146</b>, for example a protective holder, a heater, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0058">In the embodiments described herein, the terms &#x201c;lens&#x201d; and &#x201c;lens element,&#x201d; where the context allows, can refer to any one or combination of various types of optical components, comprising refractive, reflective, magnetic, electromagnetic and electrostatic optical components.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0059">Further, the terms &#x201c;radiation&#x201d; and &#x201c;beam&#x201d; used herein encompass all types of electromagnetic radiation, comprising ultraviolet (UV) radiation (e.g., having a wavelength &#x3bb; of 365, 248, 193, 157, or 126 nm), extreme ultra-violet (EUV or soft X-ray) radiation (e.g., having a wavelength in the range of approximately 5-20 nm, e.g., 13.5 nm), or hard X-ray working at less than 5 nm, as well as particle beams, such as ion beams or electron beams. Generally, radiation having wavelengths between about 780-3000 nm (or larger) is considered IR radiation. UV refers to radiation with wavelengths of approximately 100-400 nm. Within lithography, it is usually also applied to the wavelengths, which can be produced by a mercury discharge lamp: G-line 436 nm; H-line 405 nm; and/or I-line 365 nm. Vacuum UV, or VUV (i.e., UV absorbed by air), refers to radiation having a wavelength of approximately 100-200 nm. Deep UV (DUV) generally refers to radiation having wavelengths ranging from about 126 nm to about 428 nm, and in an embodiment, an excimer laser can generate DUV radiation used within lithographic apparatus. It should be appreciated that radiation having a wavelength in the range of, for example, about 5-20 nm relates to radiation with a certain wavelength band, of which at least a part is in the range of about 5-20 nm.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">III. Time Differential Reticle Inspection</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0060">Disclosed are systems and methods to detect contamination on a reticle by time differential reticle inspection. A first and second signature are measured at different times to compare a region of the reticle to itself, at an earlier point in time, and thus identify contamination due to changes in the signatures. The first signature can be measured when the reticle is in a known clean condition, such as at a time when the reticle meets a minimum level of cleanliness necessary to produce a functional integrated circuit layer. Thus, if there is a significant difference between the first and second signatures, this difference indicates a presence of contamination on the reticle. If there are no significant differences between the first and second signatures, the reticle is considered to be clean.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0061">Unlike absolute detection methods, the systems and methods described herein do not need to discriminate between contaminates and a reticle absorber structure. Also, unlike comparison methods, there is no need to have knowledge of the reticle pattern, either for purposes of comparison to a computer-generated theoretical reticle layout design from which the tangible reticle was fabricated, or for purposes of locating a similarly-patterned region. Moreover, any type of reticle pattern can be inspected using the methods described herein, so reticle pattern features whose dimensions are similar to those of particles, or whose uniqueness may prevent die-to-die comparison, can be inspected with this technique. This technique distinguishes between signals produced by the reticle's absorber and a signal produced by contaminants and thus, the technique identifies presence of contamination having physical dimensions substantially similar to those of absorber structures. Also, since each region of the reticle is compared with itself, critical dimension variation is not an issue, and this noise source is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method <b>300</b> for detecting contamination on a reticle. In step <b>310</b>, a first signature, of at least a portion of a reticle, is produced and recorded. A signature results from measuring a physical characteristic of at least a part of the reticle surface. A signature can be produced using an inspection technology such as intensity imaging, interferometry, holography, thermal imaging, or electrostatic measurement. Other inspection technologies can also be used to produce a signature.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0063">As an example, in step <b>310</b>, the reticle is scanned with electromagnetic radiation, from a source, to produce a signature in a form of a digital image. The electromagnetic radiation has a wavelength of substantially 266 nanometers, a deep ultraviolet wavelength, or another practical wavelength. In some instances, the radiation can be polarized. Further, the system magnification can be adjusted to adjust a projected image size. After interacting with the reticle, the electromagnetic radiation is subsequently detected by a detector that is coupled to a processor and a storage device. The detector can be a focal plane array, for example, a charge-coupled device (CCD) such as an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD). Optionally, the detection process operates in a time delay and integration (TDI) mode. Alternatively, the electromagnetic radiation can be detected with a photomultiplier tube or a CMOS active pixel sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">In step <b>320</b>, a second signature, of at least the portion of the reticle, is produced. Step <b>320</b> starts at a later time than the start of step <b>310</b>. Step <b>320</b> can be performed at a routine interval, such as after passage of a predetermined period of time, a predetermined period of reticle usage, a predetermined period of storage, or a combination of these factors. Performance of step <b>320</b> need not be periodic, and can be started at any time after starting step <b>310</b>. The first signature and the second signature need not be of exactly the same region of the reticle, and need only include overlapping regions for comparison in step <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0065">In step <b>330</b>, the first signature and the second signature are compared to identify a difference between the first signature and the second signature. A difference between the signatures indicates contamination on the reticle. The quantity of contamination is also identified to determine if the quantity of contamination is significant enough to warrant further action. For example, the difference between the signatures indicates a presence of significant contamination if the difference indicates that the contamination will degrade imaging of the reticle pattern sufficiently to impair function of a circuit fabricated with the reticle. The quantity of contamination can also be considered significant if the difference between signatures indicates particles have a surface area greater than a surface area limit. The comparison result can also indicate a size and location of the contamination. If the quantity of contamination is significant, the reticle can be cleaned to reduce the quantity of contamination present.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method <b>400</b> for detecting contamination using a known clean reticle. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, optional steps are illustrated with a dashed box. In step <b>410</b>, the reticle is presented to the inspection system, such as an inspection module in a lithographic tool. The reticle can be a reflective reticle and can lack a protective pellicle.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0067">In step <b>420</b>, a first signature of at least a portion of the reticle is produced and recorded. The reticle meets a minimum level of cleanliness necessary to produce a functional circuit layer. For example, the first signature is produced by intensity imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068">Steps <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> are performed subsequent to step <b>430</b>. In step <b>320</b>, a second signature of at least a portion of the reticle is produced. Like the first signature, the second signature can also be produced by intensity imaging. In step <b>330</b>, the first signature and the second signature are compared to identify a difference between the first signature and the second signature. A difference between the first and second signatures indicates contamination on the reticle. Additional details about steps <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> are found elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0069">In step <b>440</b>, the reticle is removed from the inspection system. In step <b>450</b>, if contamination is detected, the reticle is cleaned. In step <b>460</b>, presence of contamination on the reticle is reported. In step <b>470</b>, the exemplary method <b>400</b> ends.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method <b>500</b> for detecting contamination including inspecting a reticle to determine the reticle's initial cleanliness. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, optional steps are illustrated with a dashed box. In step <b>510</b>, the reticle is presented to an inspection system.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0071">Step <b>310</b> is performed subsequent to step <b>510</b>. In step <b>310</b>, a first signature, of at least a portion of the reticle, is produced. Additional details about step <b>310</b> are found elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0072">In step <b>515</b>, the first signature is recorded. In step <b>520</b>, at least a portion of the reticle is exposed to form a wafer image. In step <b>525</b>, the wafer image is examined to determine if there are any errors present in the image that suggest the reticle will produce a malfunctioning circuit layer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, step <b>530</b> is a decision block which determines a flowpath of the exemplary method <b>500</b> based upon the results of step <b>525</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0073">In step <b>535</b>, the reticle is stored, for example, in a reticle library. In step <b>540</b>, the reticle is used. For example, the reticle is exposed to impart a pattern into the radiation beam B in the lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> or the lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0074">In step <b>550</b>, data identifying a location of the contamination is stored. In step <b>555</b>, the first signature is stored. In step <b>560</b>, the reticle is cleaned to remove contamination causing the error.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0075">In step <b>570</b>, a post-cleaning signature is recorded. The first signature is then compared with the post-cleaning signature to confirm the contamination is removed from the reticle, and no new contamination is present on the reticle. If no new contamination is present, the first signature is overwritten with the post-cleaning signature. Accordingly, the post-cleaning signature becomes the first signature.</p>
