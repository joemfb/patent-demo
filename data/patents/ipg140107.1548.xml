<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to an apparatus and methods for forming flanges on components. More particularly, this invention relates to an apparatus and methods for forming flanges on composite components.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Components often have flanges to increase the stiffness thereof and/or to facilitate assembly with other parts. As used herein, the term &#x201c;flange&#x201d; may indicate a raised rim or lip of a fitting. Some conventional processes have been implemented to form the flanges on components, such as metal parts. However, these methods are not suitable to form the flanges on composite components.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Composite components, such as fan cases, have been used in a variety of fields, such as the aerospace industry. It is relatively straightforward to deposit composite material in a cylindrical configuration to form tubular composite components. However, current processes for forming flanges on composite components are labor intensive, and the quality of the flanges can be operator-dependent. In particular, it is difficult to form flanges automatically or semi-automatically due to the complexity of the motions and the intricacy of the manipulation during material placement.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As current processes are ill equipped to form flanges in composite components, it would be desirable to have improved apparatuses and methods for forming the flanges in composite components. It would further be desirable for the improved apparatuses and methods for forming flanges to be suitable for use in automated or semi-automated composite lay-up processes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An apparatus for forming a flange on a component in accordance with one embodiment is provided. The apparatus comprises a mold disposed for placement of the component thereon, a forming element configured to hold the component on the mold to facilitate formation of the flange, and a pressure element configured to cooperate with the mold to define a space therebetween. The apparatus further comprises a bladder disposed in the space and configured to impart a forming force to a portion of the component to form the flange on the component when the bladder is inflated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another embodiment of the invention further provides a method for forming a flange on a component. The method comprises placing a bladder on a mold, placing a component on the mold, providing a forming element to hold the component on the mold, providing a pressure element to cooperate with the mold to confine the bladder and to receive a portion of the component therebetween, and inflating the bladder to impart a forming force to the portion of the component to form the flange on the component.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferred embodiments of the present disclosure will be described hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail to avoid obscuring the disclosure in unnecessary detail.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of an apparatus <b>10</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. In embodiments of the invention, it should be noted that the schematic diagrams are merely illustrative. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> comprises a mold <b>11</b>, a bladder <b>12</b>, a forming element <b>13</b>, and a pressure element <b>14</b>, together for forming at least one flange <b>102</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) on a component <b>100</b> disposed on the mold <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For the example arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, bladder <b>12</b> is equipped with a valve <b>16</b> configured to pass a substance into and to inflate the bladder <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the valve <b>16</b> may not be employed. The substance may comprise gas, such as air or liquid, such as water. In some embodiments of the invention, the substance may comprise air. Further, in some non-limiting examples, the apparatus <b>10</b> may further comprise a reaction element <b>15</b> disposed at one end of the mold <b>11</b> to cooperate with the mold <b>11</b>, the bladder <b>12</b>, and the forming element <b>13</b> for forming the flange. In other arrangements, the reaction element <b>15</b> is not employed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of the mold <b>11</b>. For the example arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mold <b>11</b> comprises a mandrel having a circular shape and configured to rotate about an axis <b>115</b>. Alternatively, in some examples, the mold <b>11</b> may comprise other elements with other shapes, such as a rectangular shape. The mold <b>11</b> may be formed from a variety of materials with certain hardness, including but not limited to metals or metal alloys. It should be noted that the mandrel <b>11</b> is merely illustrative, and the invention is not limited to a specific mandrel.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the exemplary embodiment, the mandrel <b>11</b> comprises first and second side surfaces <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>, a periphery surface <b>112</b> disposed between the first and second side surfaces <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>, and a step <b>113</b> disposed around the periphery surface <b>112</b> and located at a corner (not labeled) between the periphery surface <b>112</b> and the first side surface <b>110</b>. In other examples, the step <b>113</b> may be defined on a portion of the periphery surface <b>112</b> and/or spaced away from the first and second side surfaces <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In certain embodiments, the mandrel <b>11</b> may comprise more than one step <b>113</b> thereon to form multiple flanges on the component <b>100</b>. In one non-limiting example, a fan case (not shown) typically comprises two flanges. Thus, the mandrel <b>11</b> used to from a composite fan case with two flanges may comprise two steps for forming two flanges on the fan case. Additionally, for the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mandrel <b>11</b> further comprises an inlet <b>114</b> for receiving the valve <b>16</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">After the mold <b>11</b> is provided and for the arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the bladder <b>12</b> is disposed within the step <b>113</b> so as to be located around the mandrel <b>11</b>, and be flush with the periphery surface <b>112</b> of the mandrel <b>11</b>. That is, the bladder <b>12</b> is flush with an outer diameter (not labeled) of the mandrel <b>11</b>. Alternatively, the bladder <b>12</b> may be lower or higher than the outer diameter of the mandrel <b>11</b>. In embodiments of the invention, the bladder <b>12</b> may comprise any flexible material that is configured to be inflatable. In some examples, the bladder may comprise, but is not limited to, Butyl material, silicone rubber, fluoro-elastomers, or nylon bagging films. In one non-limiting example, the bladder <b>12</b> comprises an inner tube type bladder.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, in the exemplary arrangement, the valve <b>16</b> is received in the inlet <b>114</b> and connected to the bladder <b>12</b> with one end (not labeled) thereof.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In certain embodiments, after forming the flange <b>102</b>, the composite component <b>100</b> with the flange <b>102</b> may be cured. As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the cure process and conditions may depend upon the material (the fiber and the resin) of the composite component <b>100</b>. In one non-limiting example, the apparatus <b>10</b> with the composite component <b>100</b> therein may be placed in an oven (not shown) and heated to a desired temperature for a desired duration, depending on the material of the component <b>100</b>. In another non-limiting example, the apparatus <b>10</b> with the composite component <b>100</b> therein is placed in an oven and heated to a desired temperature prior to inflating the bladder <b>12</b>. Then, the bladder <b>20</b> is inflated and the flange <b>102</b> is formed. For other component material, it may not be necessary to heat the composite component <b>100</b> for curing. In certain examples, the component <b>100</b> may not need to be cured.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, in embodiments of the invention, the pressure element <b>14</b>, the forming element <b>13</b>, the composite component <b>100</b>, and/or the reaction element <b>15</b> may be detachable so that the composite component <b>100</b> can be detached from the mandrel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In certain embodiments, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> may further comprise a first release film <b>18</b> disposed between the mandrel <b>11</b> and the composite component <b>100</b> to facilitate the detachment of the component <b>100</b> from the mandrel <b>11</b> after the flange <b>101</b> is formed and/or cured.
