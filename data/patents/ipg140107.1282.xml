<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to German Patent Application No.102010056390.0, filed Dec. 28, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The technical field relates to a front region of a vehicle and a vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">From publication U.S. Pat. No. 6,467,822 B1, a vehicle with an energy-absorbing structure having a spoiler is known in this regard. The spoiler is produced of one piece with the bumper or fixed on the bumper. To improve the protection of pedestrians, this spoiler is limited in its yield along the vehicle by a support, which is fixed on the vehicle. The support is fixed at a radial distance behind the spoiler. The spoiler is arranged below a front radiator block, while the energy-absorbing structure is arranged upstream of a front radiator block in a middle region of the front radiator block in driving direction.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This front region of a vehicle was specially designed in order to protect pedestrians. A front region designed thus however cannot prevent that initially the foot region of a pedestrian in the event of a collision is struck by the spoiler in the lower front region and possibly trapped between spoiler and road surface. In the process, a high loading of the longitudinal and cruciate ligaments of the knee joint can occur in the knee joint when the upper body topples over in the direction of the engine hood and in addition, an extreme angling-off of the knee occurs. This was established in a plurality of comparative tests using an artificial leg structure having the appropriate measuring devices in the ligament regions of the knee and in an angling-off region of the knee as well as in the lower leg and in the thigh.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one object is to reduce the loads on the knee in the event of collision accidents involving pedestrians and to create a catching region of a vehicle that more greatly protects the knee of a pedestrian in the event of a collision accident. In addition, other objects, desirable features, and characteristics will become apparent from the subsequent summary and detailed description, and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, a front region of a vehicle is described, which comprises an upper front region, a middle front region, and a lower front region. The upper front region comprises an engine hood, front regions of mudguards, headlamps, or driving direction indicators. The middle front region comprises an impact energy-absorbing region and has molding elements in driving direction. The molding elements interact with energy absorbing, yielding structures. The yielding structures are plastically deformable. The lower front region comprises a molding apron and is elastically deformable.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This front region of a vehicle has the advantage that because of the elastic deformability of the lower front region the lower leg and the foot of a pedestrian, which in the event of a collision initially collides with the lower front region is sprung back into a more favorable position for the loading of the knee with the same force with which this region of a leg impacts. Following an elastic deformation, the deformed components of the lower front region directly spring back into their original shape and by doing so prevent both the stretching of the lateral ligaments of the knee as well as the angling-off of the knee. The molding elements are preferably arranged upstream of an upper region of a front radiator block in driving direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the molding apron covers a lower region of the front radiator block and is arranged below the front radiator block. The lower front region is preferably held free of components that are not elastically deformable, in particular their intake manifolds, radiator grille and fog lamps. Thus, it is ensured that upon a front-end traffic accident only the provided molding apron, which interacts spring-elastically deformable with the vehicle underbody, is arranged in the lower front region and no interfering components that are not elastically deformable can be found in this region any longer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the molding apron comprises an elastic material and is to the middle impact energy-absorbing front region fixed transversely to the driving direction. The lower marginal region of the molding apron, however, is arranged freely suspended, so that the elastic deformability of the elastic material of the molding apron can come into full effect. The foot and lower leg region of a pedestrian is resiliently pivoted away by the freely suspended and elastically deformable material of the molding apron with the same force in driving direction so that the load is taken off the knee joint.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, it is additionally provided that the molding apron comprises an elastic material and supports itself elastically on the vehicle underbody. In this case, the molding apron with its lower edge is not only freely suspended, but additionally comprises elastic components with which the molding apron is elastically supported on the vehicle underbody. These elastic elements can be designed very differently. In an embodiment, elastically resilient elements are arranged between the molding apron and the vehicle underbody. These resilient elements can be leaf springs that are pre-bent U-shaped, spring clips or even helical springs, which on one side are fastened to the lower margin of the vehicle apron and with a second end hinged on the vehicle underbody.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the vehicle underbody comprises a cross member and an energy-absorbing crash box towards the molding apron. The elastically resilient elements are arranged upstream of the crash boxes in driving direction. This has the advantage that pedestrians are protected from major injuries in the event of head-on collisions and in the case of major collision accidents with objects and with correspondingly higher speed the impact energy-absorbing crash boxes become active after the elastically resilient elements before further units such as a front radiator block and others are impaired or damaged through the head-on accident.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, it is provided in an embodiment that between the molding apron and the vehicle underbody rubber-elastic buffers with hollow profiles are arranged. Such rubber-elastic buffers are particularly suited since these are extremely yielding and yet regain their original shape extremely rapidly. This rapid regaining helps reduce overloading of the knee joint. It is possible, in addition, to arrange buffers of rubber-elastic foams between the molding apron and the vehicle underbody. Such foam rubber components can be produced in relatively any shape and adapted to the shape of the molding apron as well as to the structural requirements of the vehicle underbody.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, an elongated rubber-elastic buffer is arranged between the molding apron and the vehicle underbody transversely to the driving direction with a hollow profile. Such an elongated rubber-elastic buffer in the shape of a rubber hose has the advantage that there are no intermediate spaces that are not cushioned by the rubber-elastic element. In addition, it is also possible here to arrange an elongated buffer instead of the hollow profile, which comprises rubber-elastic foam or a foam rubber strand.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Instead of these merely resilient solutions, a hose-shaped airbag is arranged in a further embodiment on the lower margin of the molding apron transversely to the driving direction. Such an airbag has the advantage that it not only resiliently accelerates ankles and lower leg of a pedestrian in driving direction, but that moreover it can angle-off the lower leg and foot region of the pedestrian even further in driving direction, so that the angling-off of the knee joint and the ligament stretching of the knee joint are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A vehicle is provided with a front region according to any one of the mentioned embodiments. The vehicle has the advantages as per the application already mentioned in connection with the front region, which are not mentioned again at this point to avoid repetitions. The vehicle can be a passenger car with a combustion engine and/or with an electric motor.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit application and uses. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the receding background or summary or the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic perspective representation of a front region of a vehicle <b>1</b> in the shape of a passenger car according to an embodiment. The front region of this vehicle <b>1</b> comprises an upper front region <b>2</b>, a middle front region <b>3</b>, and a lower front region <b>4</b>. The upper front region <b>2</b> comprises an engine hood <b>5</b> and front regions of mudguards <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> as well as headlamps <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>. The middle front region <b>3</b> comprises an impact energy-absorbing region shown in the following figures and has molding elements in driving direction A, such as for example a radiator grille, which cover the impact energy-absorbing region.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Such molding elements interact with the impact energy-absorbing, yielding structures and in the embodiment shown are arranged upstream of a front region of a front radiator block in driving direction A, as is shown by the following Figures. The yielding, impact energy-absorbing structures are plastically deformable in this middle region. The lower front region <b>4</b> comprises a molding apron <b>12</b>, which, in the embodiment shown, covers a lower region of the front radiator block and is additionally arranged below the front radiator block. The molding apron <b>12</b> interacts with a vehicle underbody in an elastically deformable manner in driving direction A, as is shown by the following Figures.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic diagram of the front region of the vehicle <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> before a collision with a pedestrian. Here, a flexible test leg <b>30</b> of the pedestrian is shown with measuring points in the foot region <b>27</b>, in the lower leg region <b>24</b>, in the knee joint region <b>25</b> and in the thigh region <b>26</b>. With the help of these measuring points, a loading during the angling-off of the foot region <b>27</b> as well as an angling-off between lower leg region <b>24</b> and thigh region <b>26</b> of the knee joint region <b>25</b> can be recorded and ultimately, beyond this, instances of ligament stretching, particularly of the lateral ligaments in the knee joint region <b>25</b>, can be recorded upon a collision with a front region of the vehicle <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">During such impact tests with the test leg <b>30</b> it has been shown that there is the risk that the foot region <b>27</b> is trapped in the lower front region during the impact, causing overstretching of the lateral ligaments of the knee joint region <b>25</b> and overloading the knee joint region, particularly the lateral ligaments, through excessive angling-off in the knee joint region <b>25</b>. With <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a vehicle front region of the vehicle <b>1</b> is now shown, wherein an impact energy-absorbing structure <b>10</b>, which is plastically deformable and thus removes impact energy, is arranged upstream of a cross member <b>16</b> in driving direction A.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the lower front region <b>4</b> a crash box <b>17</b> of a vehicle substructure <b>13</b> and a resilient element <b>15</b> are arranged in driving direction A. In the lower front region <b>4</b>, a molding apron <b>12</b> interacts with the resilient element <b>15</b>, which, as shown by the interrupted lines, is initially preloaded by the lower leg region <b>24</b> and the foot region <b>27</b> during a collision. However, allows the molding apron <b>12</b> to spring-elastically swing back in arrow direction B, so that the foot region <b>27</b> and the lower leg region <b>24</b> of the molding apron <b>12</b> with the resilient force cannot only enter to a limited degree, but are timely thrown back again. Thus, taking the load off the knee join region <b>25</b> and preventing a bending over of the ankles in the foot region <b>27</b>. Such resilient elements, which are arranged upstream of the crash boxes <b>17</b>, can be arranged distributed in the lower front region <b>4</b> of the vehicle transversely to the driving direction.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Instead of crash boxes <b>17</b>, which by themselves are energy absorbing and plastically deformed during major impact forces and remove impact energy in the process, a lower cross member, which is in connection with the vehicle underbody <b>13</b>, can hold the resilient elements for elastic yielding of the molding apron in the lower front region. The molding apron <b>12</b> covers a lower region of the front radiator block <b>11</b> and also extends below the front radiator block <b>11</b>, in order to cover or screen the vehicle underbody <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic diagram of the front region of the vehicle <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with a molding apron <b>12</b> of elastic material. In this case, the molding apron <b>12</b> is fixed on a lower edge <b>28</b> of the middle front region <b>3</b> and is freely suspended subject to the covering of the lower region of the front radiator block <b>11</b> and of the vehicle underbody <b>13</b>. Because of the elastic properties of the separating apron <b>12</b> in the lower front region in the event of an impact of a lower leg and foot region of a pedestrian, said front region will swing back in the arrow direction B with the same force with which the pedestrian has impacted the lower region with the elastic molding apron.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a schematic diagram of the front region of the vehicle <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with different additional resilient elements in the lower front region <b>4</b>, which can be arranged between the lower edge <b>22</b> and the vehicle underbody <b>13</b>. For example, this can be a leaf spring <b>29</b> bent U-shaped or a spring clip <b>31</b> or a helical spring <b>32</b>, which support the lower edge <b>22</b> of the molding apron <b>12</b> at a plurality of points transversely to the driving direction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a schematic diagram of the front region of the vehicle <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with an additional buffer <b>18</b>, which has a rubber-elastic hollow profile <b>19</b>, which is either arranged at individual points, transversely to the driving direction, between the lower edge <b>22</b> of the molding apron <b>12</b> and the vehicle underbody <b>13</b> or is provided as elongated rubber-elastic hose <b>21</b> along the lower edge <b>22</b> of the molding apron <b>12</b>. Here, the cross section of the rubber-elastic hollow profile <b>19</b> is oval.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a schematic diagram of the front region of the vehicle <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with an additional elastic element of a rubber-elastic foam rubber <b>20</b>. This element of foam rubber <b>20</b> can be oval shaped similar to the rubber-elastic hollow profile that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The foam rubber material is marked in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by a corresponding hatch.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a schematic diagram of the front region of the vehicle <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with an additional airbag <b>23</b> on the lower edge <b>22</b> of the molding apron <b>12</b> of the lower front region <b>4</b>. Above an elongated airbag <b>23</b>, along the lower edge <b>22</b> of the molding apron <b>12</b>, an element of elastic foam rubber <b>20</b> is additionally arranged upstream in driving direction A, which for example is fixed to crash boxes <b>17</b> in the lower front region <b>4</b> of the vehicle <b>1</b>. In the event of a collision with a pedestrian not only an elastic resetting force, but additionally a pivoting-out of the airbag <b>23</b> in arrow direction B occurs, which effectively protects the ankles of the pedestrian.</p>
