<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire, more particularly to a tread-reinforcing band formed by spirally winding a specially treated organic fiber cord.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to improve the high-speed durability of a pneumatic tire such as passenger car tire, motorcycle tire and the like, a tread reinforcing band made of a spirally wound cord is widely used in the tread portion alone or in combination with a breaker.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Usually, nylon fiber cords are used as the cords of such a tread reinforcing band because of the following reason. During vulcanizing a green tire in a mold, the inside of the green tire is pressurized by the use of an inflatable bladder to press the outer surface of the green tire onto the inner surface of the mold. Therefore, if the band is not stretched or the amount of stretch is insufficient, the tread rubber is not fully pressed against the inner surface of the mold. As a result, the tire uniformity is deteriorated and vibrations are liable to occur during running especially high speed running. Further, in the worst case, molding defects occur in the tread portion. Accordingly, in order to secure a sufficient stretch during vulcanization, nylon fiber cords which are relatively low in the modulus and thus stretchable during vulcanization are widely used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, pneumatic tires are nowadays in urgent need of effective weight reductions to improve fuel economy or to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to reduce the weight of a tread reinforcing band, if the low modulus nylon fiber cords used in a band is decreased in the number and/or thickness, then it becomes difficult to secure the necessary strength, especially the high-speed durability of the tire.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If high-strength cords such as aromatic polyamide fiber cords are used as the band cords, the weight of the band can be reduced, but the above-mentioned problems arise since the conventional high-strength cords such as aromatic polyamide fiber cords have very high moduli and are hard to stretch during vulcanization as well as during use in the vulcanized tire.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a pneumatic tire, in which the tread-reinforcing band is formed by spirally winding a specially treated organic fiber cord to enable a weight reduction of the band.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, a pneumatic tire comprises</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a carcass extending between a pair of bead portions through a tread portion and a pair of sidewall portions, and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a band made of at least one spirally wound cord disposed radially outside the carcass in the tread portion, wherein</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">the band cord consists of materially identical high-strength high-modulus organic filaments, and the band cord is obtainable by the following process (1) or (2):</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">(1) the high-modulus organic filaments are divided into a plurality of bunches, the bunches are each first twisted separately from each other, the first twisted bunches are each subjected to a dip-and-stretch treatment, and the treated bunches are second twisted together; or</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">(2) the high-modulus organic filaments are divided into a plurality of bunches, the bunches are each first twisted separately from each other, the first twisted bunches are each subjected to a dip-and-stretch treatment, some of the treated bunches are second twisted together to form a core, and at least one remaining treated bunch is twisted around the core, whereby the band cord has a load-elongation curve comprising a low-modulus zone between the origin and a boundary point and a high-modulus zone between the boundary point and the cord breaking point, and the boundary point is in an elongation range between 1% and 7%, and the ratio EH/EL of a nominal elastic modulus EH of the high-modulus zone and a nominal elastic modulus EL of the low-modulus zone is in a range of from 2.0 to 10.0.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the boundary point P is defined as a point on the load-elongation curve J of which elongation percentage is the same as that of the intersecting point P<b>0</b> between two tangential lines T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> to the load-elongation curve J at the original point (elongation=0) and the breaking point P<b>1</b> of the cord.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The nominal elastic modulus EL of the low-modulus zone S<b>1</b> is defined by the slope of a line drawn between the origin O and the boundary point P. The nominal elastic modulus EH of the high-modulus zone S<b>2</b> is defined by the slope of a line drawn between the boundary point P and breaking point P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The above-mentioned high-strength high-modulus organic filaments are, for example, aromatic polyamide filaments, fully aromatic polyester filaments, polyvinyl alcohol filaments whose strength is not less than 15 g/dtex, carbon filaments, polyketone filaments, rayon filaments and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As described above, the band cord is formed by first twisting each of the filament bunches, and subjecting the first-twisted bunches to a dip-and-stretch treatment, and then second twisting the treated bunches together. By making these processes in this order, the cord is provided with an elongation characteristic having a low-modulus zone and a high-modulus zone as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in full line,</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">If the cord is formed in the following order [first twisting each of the filament bunches, second twisting the first-twisted bunches together into the cord, and then subjecting the second twisted bunches (namely the cord) to the dip-and-stretch treatment], then the load-elongation curve j becomes almost linear from the original point to the breaking point P<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in broken line and the cord is provided with a completely different elongation characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this invention, therefore, in spite of a cord made of high-strength high-modulus organic filaments, a sufficient stretch can be obtained during tire vulcanization, and as a result, a deterioration in the tire uniformity can be avoided. Further, because of the high-strength high-modulus organic filaments, the thickness of the cord can be decreased while maintaining the necessary cord strength. Accordingly, the weight of the band can be decreased to achieve a tire weight reduction without sacrificing the high-speed durability and the like.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail in conjunction with accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the present invention, pneumatic tire <b>1</b> comprises a tread portion <b>2</b>, a pair of sidewall portions <b>3</b>, a pair of bead portions <b>4</b> each with a bead core <b>5</b> therein, a carcass <b>6</b> extended between the bead portions <b>4</b> through the tread portion <b>2</b> and sidewall portions <b>3</b>, and a band <b>9</b> disposed radially outside the crown portion of the carcass <b>6</b> in the tread portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this embodiment, the tire <b>1</b> is a radial tire for passenger cars provided in the tread portion <b>2</b> with a breaker <b>7</b>, and the band <b>9</b> is disposed on the radially outside of the breaker <b>7</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The carcass <b>6</b> is composed of at least one ply <b>6</b>A of cords arranged radially at an angle of 75 to 90 degrees with respect to the tire equator.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For the carcass cords, organic fiber cords such as polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphtarete, fully aromatic polyester), nylon (aliphatic polyamide), rayon and the like are suitably used in the case of passenger car tires. But, steel cords can be used too, depending on the tire size, usage and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, the carcass is composed of a single ply <b>6</b>A of PET cords arranged radially at 90 degrees, and the cord count is set in a range of from 40 to 60 ends/5 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The carcass <b>6</b> is composed of at least one ply <b>6</b>A of cords arranged radially at an angle of 75 to 90 degrees with respect to the tire equator. For the carcass cords, organic fiber cords such as polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, fully aromatic polyester), nylon (aliphatic polyamide), rayon and the like are suitably used in the case of passenger car tires. But, steel cords can be used too, depending on the tire size, usage and the like. In this embodiment, the carcass is composed of a single ply <b>6</b>A of PET cords arranged radially at 90 degrees, and the cord count is set in a range of from 40 to 60 ends/5 cm. The carcass ply <b>6</b>A extends between the bead portions <b>4</b> through the tread portion <b>2</b> and sidewall portions <b>3</b>, and is turned up around the bead core <b>5</b> in each of the bead portions from the inside to the outside of the tire to form a pair of carcass ply turnup portions <b>6</b><i>b </i>and a carcass ply main portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>therebetween. Between each of the carcass ply turnup portions <b>6</b><i>b </i>and the ply main portion <b>6</b><i>a</i>, there is disposed a bead apex <b>8</b> made of a hard rubber extending radially outwardly from the bead core <b>5</b> while tapering towards its radially outer end.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The breaker <b>7</b> is disposed radially outside the crown portion of the carcass <b>6</b>, and composed of at least two plies <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B each made of parallel cords laid at an angle of 15 to 40 degrees with respect to the tire equator. For the breaker cords, high-strength cords such as steel cords, high modulus organic fiber cords such as polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and aromatic polyamide and the like can be used. With respect to the tire equator, the cords in the radially inner ply <b>7</b>A are inclined towards one direction, and the cords in the radially outer ply <b>7</b>B are inclined towards the opposite direction to the above-mentioned one direction. The radially inner ply <b>7</b>A is the widest ply of which width defines the width WB of the breaker <b>7</b>. The radially outer ply <b>7</b>B is smaller in width than the inner ply <b>7</b>A. In this embodiment, the breaker <b>7</b> is composed of the two cross plies <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B of steel cords, and extends all over the width of the tread portion.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The band <b>9</b> is composed of at least one ply <b>9</b>A of at least one cord <b>10</b> wound spirally at an angle of not more than 5 degrees with respect to the tire circumferential direction. The ply <b>9</b>A can be a full-width ply covering the substantially entire width of the breaker <b>7</b>, namely, not less than 95% of the breaker width WB, or a pair of axially spaced edge plies each covering one of the axial edge portions of the breaker <b>7</b>. Thus, the band <b>9</b> can be the full-width ply(s) only, or the axially spaced edge plies only, or a combination of the full-width ply(s) and the edge plies.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment, the band <b>9</b> is made up of a single full-width ply, and the width w of the band <b>9</b> is almost same as the width WB of the breaker <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this embodiment, in order to improve the manufacturing efficiency, the band ply <b>9</b>A is formed by spiral winding a tape <b>13</b> of unvulcanized rubber <b>12</b> in which a plurality of parallel cords <b>10</b> are embedded along the length thereof as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Of course it is possible to wind a single cord <b>10</b> alone or a tape of unvulcanized rubber <b>12</b> in which a single cord <b>10</b> is embedded along the length thereof. In the case of the tape <b>13</b>, the number of the cords embedded therein is at most 10, usually 4 to 6.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In any case, the angles of the windings of the band cord(s) are not more than 5 degrees with respect to the tire circumferential direction in order to improve the tire uniformity and to provide a strong hoop effect for the tread portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The tire <b>1</b> is manufactured by first making the green tire by assembling raw tire components including the band, and then vulcanizing the green tire in a mold as usual. During vulcanizing the green tire in the mold, a bladder put inside the green tire is inflated to press the outer surface of the green tire onto the inner surface of the mold. Therefore, although it is desirable that the band is hard to stretch in the finished tire, the raw band has to be stretched during vulcanization in order that the outer surface of the tread portion is fully pressed onto the tread molding face of the mold. For that purpose, in general, about 2% elongation is required for the band cord, therefore the cord modulus should be relatively low in a cord elongation range between 0% and about 2%.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To achieve such a double modulus cord as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the load-elongation curve J of the band cord <b>10</b> has to be provided with a low-modulus zone S<b>1</b> and a high-modulus zone S<b>2</b> of which boundary point P is in an elongation range of from 1.0 to 7.0%, and the nominal modulus ratio EH/EL is not less than 2.0 but not more than 10.0.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If the load of the band cord <b>10</b> at 1% elongation is more than 60 N, the stretch during vulcanization becomes insufficient. If the load at 1% elongation is less than 20 N, although a sufficient stretch can be obtained, in the finished tire the hoop effect of the band is decreased and the high speed durability tends to deteriorate. Therefore, the load at 1% elongation is preferably set in a range of from 20 to 60 N.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If the load of the band cord <b>10</b> at 3% elongation is less than 225 N, there is a tendency that the rigidity of the tread portion becomes insufficient and as a result the steering stability is deteriorated. If the load at 3% elongation is more than 431 N, the rigidity becomes excessively increased and the ride comfort is decreased. Therefore, the load at 3% elongation is preferably set in a range of from 225 to 431 N.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In order to reduce the weight of the band, the band cord <b>10</b> is made up of a plurality of materially identical high-strength high-modulus organic filaments (f).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As such high-strength high-modulus organic filaments (f), for example, aromatic polyamide filaments, fully aromatic polyester filaments, polyvinyl alcohol filaments whose strength is not less than 15 g/dtex, carbon filaments, polyketone filaments, rayon filaments and the like can be used. Among them, aromatic polyamide filaments are especially preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If materially different organic filaments are incorporated into one cord, which usually results in coexistence of a high-modulus filament and a low-modulus filament, thus, the load applied to the cord is unevenly shared therebetween, and one of them is first broken and then the other is broken as the load concentrate thereon. Thus, on the whole the cord tends to become weak when compared with the cord according to the present invention having the same weight.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The band cord <b>10</b> is made up of a plurality of dip-and-stretch treated strands <b>22</b> (hereinafter dipped strands <b>22</b>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the band cord <b>10</b> is made up of two dipped strands <b>22</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> showing another example, the cord <b>10</b> is made up of four dipped strands <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The number of the dipped strands <b>22</b> is at least two, preferably at most 8, more preferably 6 or less.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In any case, each of the strands <b>22</b> is formed by first-twisting a bunch <b>21</b> of a plurality of the organic filaments (f).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Then, the first-twisted filament bunch <b>21</b> is subjected to a dip-and-stretch treatment K.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the dip-and-stretch treatment K comprises a dip process Ka, a drying process Kb, a stretch process Kc, and a relax process Kd.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The dip process Ka is such that the first-twisted filament bunch <b>21</b> is dipped into a solution of a resin to coat the surfaces of the organic filaments. For example, resorcinol formalin latex can be used as the solution.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the case of organic filaments inferior to adhesion with rubber such as aromatic polyamide and fully aromatic polyester, it is preferable that an additive to improve the adhesion such as epoxy compounds, isocyanate compounds, urea compounds and the like is added into the solution.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also it is preferred to subject the bunch <b>21</b> to a two-bath dipping process, where first dipped into a solution or emulsion of the above-mentioned additive to improve the adhesion and then dipped into the above-mentioned solution of the resin.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The drying process Kb is such that the dipped filament bunch <b>21</b> is dried by heating it to a specific temperature controlled within a range of from 100 to 160 degrees C. for 60 to 300 seconds until completely or almost completely dried, while applying a tension of 0.1 to 1.5 g/dtex.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The stretch process Kc is such that the filament bunch <b>21</b> is stretched by applying a specific tension in a range of 0.1 to 1.5 d/dtex for example 0.2 g/dtex, while heating it to a specific temperature controlled within a range of from 215 to 255 degrees C. for 30 to 120 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The relax process id is such that the filament bunch <b>21</b> is gradually cooled to room temperature, while gradually decreasing the above-mentioned applied tension.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With this dip-and-stretch treatment K, the dipped strand <b>22</b> is accomplished. Then, directly or indirectly after reeled, the treated strand <b>22</b> is fed to the next process (1) or (2).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The process (1) is utilized to make the example cord shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this process, the two or more strands <b>22</b> are second twisted together into the final cord <b>10</b>. Thus, the second twist is the last twist.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">All of the strands <b>22</b> have the same first twist directions which are opposite to the second twist direction.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is possible that all of the strands <b>22</b> have the same first twist numbers, but in this example, in order to increase of the ratio EH/EL, the dipped strands <b>22</b> include at least two types of strands: one is a low-twist strand <b>22</b>A whose first twist number N is a minimum value Nmin, and another is a high-twist strand <b>22</b>B whose first twist number N is a maximum value Nmax, wherein the ratio Nmin/Nmax is preferably not more than 0.9, more preferably not more than 0.8, but, preferably not less than 0.5. In this case, in view of the compatibility between the fatigue resistance of the cord and the nominal elastic modulus EH of the high-modulus zone, the second twist number M of the cord <b>10</b> is preferably not less than the minimum value Nmin and not more than the maximum value Nmax. It is especially preferable that the second twist number M is equal to the minimum value Nmin.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As to the thickness of the strand (or the total dtex number of the filaments therein), it is possible that all of the strands <b>22</b> have the same thickness. But, it is also possible that the strands <b>22</b> have different thicknesses. In the later case, accordingly the cord is composed of at least one thicker strand <b>22</b><i>a </i>and at least one thinner strand <b>22</b><i>b</i>. Preferably, the first twist number of the thinnest dipped strand <b>22</b><i>b </i>is set at the maximum value Nmax, and the first twist number of the thickest dipped strand <b>22</b><i>a </i>is set at the minimum value Nmin. This also facilities the increase of the ratio EH/EL.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The process (2) is utilized to make another example cord <b>10</b> which is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, made up of at least one dipped strand <b>22</b><i>c </i>(in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> two dipped strands <b>22</b><i>c</i>) forming a core <b>25</b>, and at least one dipped strand <b>22</b><i>s </i>(in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> two dipped strands <b>22</b><i>s</i>) forming a sheathe <b>26</b> around the core <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In this cord structure, it is preferable that the ratio Ds/Dc of the total dtex number Ds of the strand <b>22</b><i>s </i>forming the sheathe to the total dtex number DC of the strand <b>22</b><i>c </i>forming the core is not less than 2.3; and</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">the first twist number Ns of the sheath strand <b>22</b><i>s </i>is less than the first twist number NC of the core strand <b>22</b><i>c</i>, and the ratio Ns/Nc is in a range of from 0.07 to 0.11.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the case that the core <b>25</b> is made up of a single strand <b>22</b><i>c</i>, a plurality of strands <b>22</b><i>s </i>are second twisted around the core <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the case that the core <b>25</b> is made up of a plurality of strands <b>22</b><i>c</i>, these strands <b>22</b><i>c </i>are second twisted into the core <b>25</b>. And then at least one strand <b>22</b><i>s </i>is second twisted around the core <b>25</b> in the same direction as the second twist direction of the core. The second twist number M of the sheath strand <b>22</b><i>s </i>is less than the first twist number Nc of the core strand <b>22</b><i>c </i>and in a range of from 0.5 to 1.2 times the first twist number Ns of the sheath strand <b>22</b><i>s. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the case of the core <b>25</b> made up of a plurality of strands <b>22</b><i>c</i>, the second twist of the core strands <b>22</b><i>c </i>may be omitted substantially because the sheathe <b>26</b> can prevent the core strands <b>22</b><i>c </i>from loosing.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In any case, the position of the boundary point P and the value of EH/EL can be adjusted by changing the thickness, first twist number and second twist number of the strands <b>22</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0097">As apparent from the comparisons between Reference tires and Example tires, in particular comparisons of Ex. 1 with Ref. 5, Ex. 2 with Ref. 6, and Ex. 4 with Ref. 7&#x2014;each pair being the same in the dtex number, first twist number and second twist number&#x2014;, owning to the dip-and-stretch treatment carried out between the first twisting process and the second twisting process, the Example cords were provided with the remarkable double modulus zones, and a necessary stretch could be obtained during tire vulcanization, and as a result, the tires could be molded without problem and displayed excellent performances. By contrast, in the case of Reference tires 3-7, molding defects were occured, and the tires had no commercial value.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0098">Aside from passenger car tires, the present invention can be applied to various tires as well, for example, motorcycle tires, SUV tires and the like. For example, in the case of motorcycle tires provided with no breaker <b>7</b>, the band <b>9</b> is directly disposed on the radially outside of the crown portion of the carcass <b>6</b>.</p>
