<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for producing a polyether polyol and a process for producing a rigid foamed synthetic resin.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Rigid polyurethane foams and rigid polyisocyanurate foams (hereinafter collectively referred to as &#x201c;rigid foamed synthetic resins&#x201d;) are widely produced by reacting a polyol component with a polyisocyanate component in the presence of a foam stabilizer, a catalyst and a blowing agent. By virtues of their good heat insulating properties and molding versatility, rigid foamed synthetic resins are suitably used as heat insulators for various apparatus and buildings. These rigid foamed synthetic resins are produced by spraying, slab stock molding, injection molding or other molding methods.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, spraying is mostly employed to produce rigid foamed synthetic resins as heat insulators at construction sites. In spraying, a polyol system solution containing a polyol, a blowing agent and the like and a polyisocyanate compound are pumped separately and sprayed from a spray gun onto walls and other surfaces so that they react to form a foam on them. An advantage of spraying is that walls and other surfaces of any shape can be covered with insulators of a desired thickness. Among the spraying techniques, multilayer spraying can form a thick heat insulating barrier with good heat insulating properties by spraying a rigid foamed synthetic resin twice or more in layers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, rigid foamed synthetic resins having lower densities are desired because they would be produced from smaller amounts of raw materials and, hence, at lower cost and they would be light enough to be transported easily. However, as the density decreases, they develop a problem with dimensional stability and become mechanically weak and likely to shrink. Therefore, it is necessary to develop low density rigid foamed synthetic resins with excellent mechanical strength and dimensional stability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">From the standpoint of fire prevention, as a building material, rigid foamed synthetic resins are required to have flame retardancy. Especially, when they are formed by spraying, flame retardancy is required in order to prevent welding sparks at construction sites from starting a fire.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At present, for production of rigid foamed synthetic resins, as blowing agents, hydrofluorocarbons (such as HFC-245fa, HFC-365mfc, hereinafter referred to as HFCs) are mainly used. However, considering their adverse impact on the environment, it is desired to reduce the use of HFCs. Therefore, techniques for reducing the use of HFCs have been explored by using water as a blowing agent to compensate for the reduction of HFCs. However, because the foam density attained with a HFC can be attained with much less water, there is a problem that if water is used instead of an HFC at the sacrifice of the solvency of the HFC, a polyol, a blowing agent, a foam stabilizer, a catalyst and other necessary additives form a viscous polyol system solution which adversely affects moldability and workability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Besides, there is another problem that as the water content in the polyol system solution increases, the polyol system solution becomes less miscible with a highly hydrophobic polyisocyanate compound, and molding defects tend to occur. Especially, the above-mentioned problems with the use of water as a blowing agent are remarkable in spray molding, and there is a strong demand that these problems be solved at the same time as achievement of long-sought reduction of densities of rigid foamed synthetic resins and better flame retardancy.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, polyether polyols obtained from the products of Mannich condensation reaction of phenols, aldehydes and alkanolamines are advantageous in terms of mechanical strength and flame retardancy and highly evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Documents 1 to 5 mentioned below disclose Mannich polyols obtained by using Mannnich condensation products from phenols, aldehydes and alkanolamines.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">However, Mannich polyols obtained by conventional processes tend to have high viscosities and form viscous polyol system solutions. Viscous polyol system solutions has a problem that they do not mix well with polyisocyanate compounds as raw materials at the time of foaming and impair workability, and solution to the problem is strongly demanded.</p>

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&#x3c;Production of Polyether Polyol (A)&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">The process for producing a polyether polyol (A) of the present invention starts with reaction of a phenol component, an aldehyde component and an alkanolamine component (hereinafter sometimes also referred to as Mannich condensation reaction) to obtain a reaction product containing a Mannich condensation product. The reaction product is supposed to contain unreacted reactants remaining after the reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">The phenol component is at least one member selected from the group consisting of phenol and phenol derivatives having a hydrogen atom at least one ortho-position to the phenolic hydroxyl group. Namely, it is required only to have a hydrogen atom at least one ortho-position to the phenolic hydroxyl group and may be phenol or a phenol derivative. The phenol component may be a single species or a combination of two or more species</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">As phenol derivatives, alkylphenols having a hydrogen atom at one or more ortho-positions to the phenolic hydroxyl group and having at least one C<sub>1-15 </sub>alkyl group in place of at least one of the other hydrogen atoms. The alkyl group(s) may be present at the ortho-, meta- or para-position. The alkylphenols have from 1 to 4 alkyl groups, preferably from 1 to 2 alkyl groups, particularly preferably one alkyl group, instead of hydrogen atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">The alkyl groups in the alkylphenols preferably have from 1 to 10 carbon atoms. As the alkylphenols, nonylphenol and cresol are preferably used. Nonylphenol is particularly preferred in view of improvement of the miscibility of the polyol (A) with the polyisocyanate compound (I) and better cell appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">As the aldehyde component, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde or a mixture of them is used. Among them, formaldehyde is preferred in view of improvement of the adhesiveness of the rigid foam. Formaldehyde may be used in any form such as an aqueous formalin solution, a methanol solution and paraformaldehyde. When paraformaldehyde is used, it may be heated to produce formaldehyde, and the formaldehyde may be used for the reaction in this step, and the molar amount of paraformaldehyde to be used is calculated in terms of formaldehyde.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">The alkanolamine component is at least one member selected from the group consisting of monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and 1-amino-2-propanol. Among them, diethanolamine is particularly preferred in view of the balance between improving the strength of the resulting rigid foam and lowering the viscosity of the polyol (A).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">In the present invention, as to the proportion of the raw materials, at least 0.3 mol and less than 0.9 mol, preferably at least 0.4 mol and less than 0.85 mol, particularly preferably at least 0.4 mol and less than 0.8 mol, of the aldehyde component is used in relation to 1 mol of the phenol component. If the aldehyde component is at least 0.3 mol, the resulting rigid foam tends to have good dimensional stability. If the aldehyde component is less than 0.9 mol, the resulting polyol (A) tends to have a low viscosity and hence is easily miscible with the polyisocyanate compound (I).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">The alkanloamine is used in an amount of from 1.5 to 3.5 mol, preferably from 2 to 3.5 mol, in relation to 1 mol of the phenol component. It is preferred that the amount is within the range of from 1.5 to 3.5 mol, because a low-viscosity polyol system solution which is easily miscible with the polyisocyanate compound (I) tends to be obtained, and a rigid foam with better dimensional stability and frame retardancy can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">In the present invention, the contribution of the proportion of the aldehyde component to the low viscosity of the polyol (A) is supposed to be large for the following reason. The reason will be explained in reference to an alkylphenol having an alkyl group R at the para-position as the phenol component, formaldehyde as the aldehyde component and diethanolamine as the alkanolamine component, but applies to other compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">When less than 0.9 mol of the aldehyde component is used in relation of 1 mol of the phenol component in the reaction of the phenol component, the aldehyde component and the alkanolamine component, the Mannich condensation product represented by the formula (i) from the 1:1 (molar ratio) reaction of the phenol component and the aldehyde component is more likely to form than the Mannich condensation product represented by the following formula (iii) from the 1:2 (molar ratio) reaction of the phenol component and the aldehyde component and the polycyclic compound represented by the formula (iv), and the unreacted alkylphenol represented by the formula (ii) is likely to remain. In the formula (iv), n is an integer of from 1 to 3.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">The compound represented by the formula (i) is less likely to give a Mannich polyol having a high viscosity than the compound represented by the formula (iii) or (iv). The presence of the unreacted phenol compound represented by the formula (ii) lowers the viscosity of the resulting Mannich polyol (the polyol (A)).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">Therefore, use of less than 0.9 mol of the aldehyde component in relation of 1 mol of the phenol component lowers the viscosity of the resulting polyol (A) and hence the viscosity of the polyol system solution containing the polyol (A).</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0048">The Mannich condensation reaction in the present invention can be carried out by known methods, and preferably by mixing the phenol component, the aldehyde component and the alkanolamine component and heating the mixture at from 50 to 150&#xb0; C., preferably at from 80 to 130&#xb0; C. They can be mixed by the following methods (1) to (3).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">(1) Mix the phenol component, the aldehyde component and the alkanolamine component all at once;</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">(2) Add the aldehyde component to a mixture of the phenol component and the alkanolamine component;</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">(3) Add the phenol component to a mixture of the aldehyde component and the alkanolamine component.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">The method (2) is the best because polycyclic compounds are hardly formed, and the second best is the method (3).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">It is preferred to remove the water produced by the Mannich condensation reaction or attributed to use of an aqueous formalin solution from the reaction product by an appropriate method, for example, to a residual water content of about 1 mass % by vacuum dehydration at an internal pressure of the reactor of 10-500 mmHg at 100 to 150&#xb0; C. Water may be removed before or after the addition of an alkylene oxide, but preferably before the addition of an alkylene oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">In the present invention, the polyether polyol (A) is obtained by adding an alkylene oxide to the Mannich condensation product as the initiator (S1).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">It is preferred to add from 2 to 30 mol, particularly from 4 to 20 mol, of an alkylene oxide to the initiator (S1) in relation to 1 mol of the phenol component used in the Mannich condensation reaction. When the alkylene oxide is added in an amount of at least 2 mol, the resulting polyol (A) tends to have a low hydroxyl value and a low viscosity. When the alkylene oxide is added in an amount of less than 30 mol, rigid foams obtained by using the resulting polyol (A) are unlikely to shrink.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">The alkylene oxide (sometimes referred to as AO) used for the ring-opening addition polymerization to the initiator (S1) is at least one member selected from ethylene oxide (sometimes referred to as EO), propylene oxide (sometimes referred to as PO) and butylenes oxide. Among them, it is preferred to use EO and/or PO, particularly EO and PO.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">When PO and EO are used in combination, they may be polymerized in blocks or randomly or block polymerization and random polymerization may be combined. In the case of block polymerization, the AOs are subjected to ring-opening addition polymerization preferably in the order PO, EO, or in the order EO, PO, EO. Ring-opening addition polymerization in this order is preferred because a polyol (A) having primary hydroxyl groups as predominant hydroxyl groups which is highly reactive with the polyisocyanate compound (I) can be obtained, and hence, a rigid foam with better appearance can be obtained. In addition, the adhesiveness of the resulting rigid foam improves.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">The ratio (EO+PO)/AO of the sum of EO and PO to the AOs subjected to the ring-opening addition polymerization to the initiator (S1) is preferable from 50 to 100 mass %, particularly from 80 to 100 mass %, particularly preferably 100 mass %. When the ratio is within this range, it is possible to keep down the viscosity of the polyol and easily secure the mechanical strength of the resulting rigid foam.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">The ratio EO/(EO+PO) of EO to the sum of EO and PO is preferably from 50 to 100 mass %, particularly preferably from 50 to 80 mass %. When the ratio is within this range, it is possible to keep down the viscosity of the polyol and easily secure the mechanical strength of the resulting rigid foam. Especially, it is preferred that the polyol is capped with ethylene oxide, because it has terminal primary hydroxyl groups and hence is active enough to react rapidly to cause foaming.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">When the polyol (A) consists of two or more species, the (EO+PO)/AO ratio and the EO/(EO+PO) ratio mentioned above means those in the whole polyol (A).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">The polyol (A) preferably has a hydroxyl value of from 200 to 800 mgKOH/g, particularly from 200 to 550 mgKOH/g, particularly preferably from 250 to 450 mgKOH/g. As the polyol (A), two or more species may be used in combination, as long as each species has a hydroxyl value within the above-mentioned range.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">It is preferred that the hydroxyl value of the polyol (A) is below the lower limit of the above-mentioned range, because the content of the oxyalkylene chain derived from the alkylene oxides in the polyol (A) increases, and hence the polyol (A) tends to have a lower viscosity. Further, a less brittle and more adhesive rigid foam is obtained. On the other hand, it is preferred that the hydroxyl value of the polyol (A) is above the lower limit of the above-mentioned range, it is possible to secure the mechanical strength of the resulting rigid foam and improve the dimensional stability.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">The process for producing a polyol (A) of the present invention can give a polyol (A) having a viscosity of at most 800 mPa&#xb7;s, preferably at most 600 mPa&#xb7;s, more preferably at most 500 mPa&#xb7;s at 25&#xb0; C.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0065">The process for producing a rigid foamed synthetic resin according to the present invention comprises a reaction and foaming step of reacting a polyol composition (P) with a polyisocyanate compound (I) in the presence of a blowing agent, a foam stabilizer and a catalyst.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0066">The polyol composition (P) (hereinafter also referred to simply as the composition (P)) comprises the polyol (A). The content of the polyol (A) in the composition (P) is preferably from 20 to 100 mass %, more preferably from 30 to 99 mass %, particularly preferably from 30 to 60 mass %. When the content is within this range, the resulting foam has favorable mechanical strength, heat resistance and flame retardancy, and cracking of the foam can be prevented. It also shows a good activity in spraying, and a heat insulating barrier with a uniform thickness can be formed on a wall by spraying with good workability. Further, in the case of multilayer spraying, since foam layers adhere to one another well, good workability is attained.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0073">It is preferred that the hydroxyl value of the polyol (C) is below the upper limit of the above-mentioned range, because the resulting form is less brittle and more adhesive, and the polyol (C) tends to have a low viscosity and hence mixes well in the composition (P). Further, a high isocyanate index can be set when the polyol system solution and the polyisocyanate compound (I) are used in a predetermined volume ratio in spraying. On the other hand, when the hydroxyl value of the polyol (C) is above the lower limit of the above-mentioned range, the resulting foam is unlikely to shrink.

As the foam stabilizer, a silicone-type foam stabilizer or a fluorinated compound type foam stabilizer is preferred and is commercially available. The amount of the foam stabilizer can be adjusted appropriately, but it preferably from 0.1 to 10 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the composition (P).</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">[Other Additives]</p>

<p id="h-0021" num="0000">[Reaction and Foaming Step]</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0138">In the reaction foaming step, it is preferred to prepare a polyol system solution containing the composition (P) and the blowing agent and a solution containing the polyisocyanate compound (I) separately and mixing them to allow them to react. The foam stabilizer and the catalyst may be incorporated in the polyol system solution or the solution containing the polyisocyanate compound (I). However, it is preferred to incorporate the foam stabilizer and the catalyst in the polyol system solution in order to prevent separation of the polyol system solution and thereby attain stable performance.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0139">According to the present invention, because the polyol (A) has a low viscosity, and hence the composition (P) has a low viscosity, it is possible to obtain a low-viscosity polyol system solution, for example, having a viscosity at 25&#xb0; C. of at most 500 mPa&#xb7;s, preferably at most 450 mPa&#xb7;s, more preferably at most 400 mPa&#xb7;s.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0140">Although the lower limit of the viscosity of the polyol system solution is not particularly set, it is preferably from at least 100 mPa&#xb7;s, more preferably at least 150 mPa&#xb7;s, in view of the strength of the resulting foam.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0141">The use of the low viscosity polyol system solution improves the miscibility with the polyisocyanate compound (I) and enables formation of a smoother rigid foam by spraying.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0142">Especially, in the case of spraying, it is preferred that the difference in viscosity between the solution containing the polyisocyanate compound (I) and the polyol system solution is as low as possible in order to prevent the spray gun as the mixing device from clogging and prevent the mixing ratio from fluctuating largely. Because the preferred viscosity of the solution containing the polyisocyanate compound (I) at 25&#xb0; C. is from 50 to 450 mPa&#xb7;s, the polyol system solution is preferred to have a viscosity of from 50 to 450 mPa&#xb7;s, too.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">[Application]</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0143">The process for producing a rigid foam of the present invention is suitable for applications suited for low-viscosity polyol system solutions, especially for spraying.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0144">In foam formation by spraying, the polyol system solution containing the composition (P), the blowing agent, the foam stabilizer, the catalyst and necessary additives is prepared, and then the polyol system solution and the solution containing the polyisocyanate compound (I) are reacted as they are sprayed onto a surface to be covered.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0145">Since it is possible to form rigid foams by spraying directly at construction sites, spray foaming has advantages that foams are formed at lower construction cost, that the resulting foams can closely cover even irregular surfaces, and that it is possible to form multilayer rigid foams. Therefore, spray foaming is suited for building, construction and housing applications and often used to thermally insulate walls and ceilings with rigid foams. Specific examples of its applications are insulators for apartment buildings, office buildings, prefabricated cold storage warehouses, especially, the production process of the present invention is suited for heat insulation of apartment buildings, office buildings and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0146">Among various known spray foaming methods are known, particularly preferred is air-less spray foaming in which the polyol system solution and the solution containing the polyisocyanate compound (I) are mixed in the mixing head to cause foaming. The temperature of the solution mixture in the mixing head is preferably from 30 to 50&#xb0; C. If the temperature of the solution mixture is too high, the resulting foam tends to contain too small cells and hence thin ribs, and tends to be weak.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0147">The production process of the present invention is applicable to other methods than spraying, such as slab stock molding and injection molding. Especially, in injection molding into sashes of bay windows, because the polyol system solution has a low viscosity, strong and dimensionally stable rigid foams can be formed with good operability and workability.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">&#x3c;Rigid Foam&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0148">A rigid foam produced by the process of the present invention preferably has a density (core density) of 15 to 40 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, more preferably from 20 to 35 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The rigid foam density (core density) of the rigid foam can be controlled by adjusting the amount of the blowing agent and can be decreased by using a large amount of the blowing agent. However, when water is used as the blowing agent, the preferred amount of water is restricted because the miscibility of the polyol system solution with the isocyanate compound (I) has to be considered, and the polyol system solution and the isocyanate compound (I) are usually mixed in a volume ratio of 1:1 in spray foaming.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0149">According to the present invention, by virtue of the use of the polyol (A), strong and dimensionally stable rigid foams with good moldability having a rigid foam density (core density) within the above-mentioned range can be formed with good workability.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0150">According to the present invention, the low viscosity polyol (A) is obtained by reacting the phenol component, the aldehyde component and the alkanolamine component and then adding an alkylene oxide to the resulting reaction product by using at least 0.3 to 0.9 mol of the aldehyde component in relation to 1 mol of the phenol component, and by using the polyether polyol (A), the low-viscosity polyol composition (P) can be obtained. As a result, it is possible to prevent increase in the viscosity of the polyol system solution by the use of water as a blowing agent and attain good workability and operability. Because the difference in viscosity between the polyol system solution and the polyisocyanate compound (I) is little, the two are miscible and strong and dimensionally stable rigid foams can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0151">Especially, in spray foaming, since the low viscosity polyol system is sprayed in the form of a fine mist into a wide-angle mist pattern, it is easy to spray uniformly and surface smoothness improves.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0152">Further, the polyol (A) contains a Mannich condensation product as the initiator (S1). Because Mannich condensation products contribute to improvement of flame retardancy, the use of the polyol (A) improves the resulting rigid foam. Especially, from the standpoint of prevention of a fire from welding sparks at construction sites and fire prevention as a building material, rigid foams are preferred to have excellent flame retardancy.</p>

<p id="p-0202" num="0214">The results shown in Table 3 indicate that in Examples 1-9, though water was used alone as the blowing agent, the polyol system solutions had low viscosities, and spray workability, moldability and miscibility at the time of spray foaming were good. The resulting rigid foams, though having low densities, were excellent in compression strength, dimensional stability and flame retardancy. Furthermore, excellent foams with low densities were also obtained by simple foaming.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0215">In contrast, in Examples 10 and 11, because the polyols (A) were obtained by using intiators (S1) obtained by reacting from 1.5 to 2.2 mol of an aldehyde component per 1 mol of an phenol component, the polyols (A) and the polyol system solutions obtained therefrom had high viscosities and hence showed poor miscibility with the polyisocyanate compound (I), and spray workability was poor. The cells in the resulting rigid foams were not uniform, and the foams were low compression strengths and poor dimensional stability.</p>
