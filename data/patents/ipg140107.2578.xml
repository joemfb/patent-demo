<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of electronics, and more particularly to thermoelectric device structures and related methods.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thermoelectric materials may be used to provide cooling and/or power generation according to the Peltier effect. Thermoelectric materials are discussed, for example, in the reference by Venkatasubramanian et al. entitled &#x201c;<i>Phonon</i>-<i>Blocking Electron</i>-<i>Transmitting Structures</i>&#x201d; (18<sup>th </sup>International Conference On Thermoelectrics, 1999), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Application of solid state thermoelectric cooling may be expected to improve the performance of electronics and sensors such as, for example, RF receiver front-ends, infrared (IR) imagers, ultra-sensitive magnetic signature sensors, and/or superconducting electronics. Bulk thermoelectric materials typically based on p-Bi<sub>x</sub>Sb<sub>2-x</sub>Te<sub>3 </sub>and n-Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3-x</sub>Se<sub>x </sub>alloys may have figures-of-merit (ZT) and/or coefficients of performance (COP) which result in relatively poor thermoelectric device performance.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The performance of a thermoelectric device may be a function of the figure(s)-of-merit (ZT) of the thermoelectric material(s) used in the device, with the figure-of-merit being given by:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>ZT</i>=(&#x3b1;<sup>2</sup><i>T/&#x3c3;K</i><sub>T</sub>),&#x2003;&#x2003;(equation 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where &#x3b1;, T, &#x3c3;, K<sub>T </sub>are the Seebeck coefficient, absolute temperature, electrical conductivity, and total thermal conductivity, respectively. The material-coefficient Z can be expressed in terms of lattice thermal conductivity (K<sub>L</sub>), electronic thermal conductivity (K<sub>e</sub>) and carrier mobility (i), for a given carrier density (&#x3bc;) and the corresponding &#x3b1;, yielding equation (2) below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Z=&#x3b1;</i><sup>2</sup>&#x3c3;/(<i>K</i><sub>L</sub><i>+K</i><sub>e</sub>)=&#x3b1;<sup>2</sup><i>/[K</i><sub>L</sub>/(&#x3bc;&#x3c1;<i>q</i>)+<i>L</i><sub>0</sub><i>T</i>)],&#x2003;&#x2003;(equation 2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where, L<sub>0 </sub>is the Lorenz number (approximately 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>V<sup>2</sup>/K<sup>2 </sup>in non-degenerate semiconductors). State-of-the-art thermoelectric devices may use alloys, such as p-Bi<sub>x</sub>Sb<sub>2-x</sub>Te<sub>3-y</sub>Se<sub>y </sub>(x&#x2248;0.5, y&#x2248;0.12) and n-Bi<sub>2</sub>(Se<sub>y</sub>Te<sub>1-y</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>(y&#x2248;0.05) for the 200 degree K to 400 degree K temperature range. For certain alloys, K<sub>L </sub>may be reduced more strongly than &#x3bc; leading to enhanced ZT.
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A ZT of 0.75 at 300 degree K in p-type Bi<sub>x</sub>Sb<sub>2-x</sub>Te<sub>3 </sub>(x&#x2248;1) was reported forty years ago. See, for example Wright, D. A., Nature vol. 181, pp. 834 (1958). Since then, there has been relatively modest progress in the ZT of thermoelectric materials near 300 degree K (i.e., room temperature). A ZT of about 1.14 at 300 degree K for bulk p-type (Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.25 </sub>(Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.72 </sub>(Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0 03 </sub>alloy has been discussed for example, in the reference by Ettenberg et al. entitled &#x201c;<i>A New N</i>-<i>Type And Improved P</i>-<i>Type Pseudo</i>-<i>Ternary </i>(<i>Bi</i><sub>2</sub><i>Te</i><sub>3</sub>)(<i>Sb</i><sub>2</sub><i>Te</i><sub>3</sub>)(<i>Sb</i><sub>2</sub><i>Se</i><sub>3</sub>) <i>Alloy For Peltier Cooling</i>,&#x201d; (Proc. of 15<sup>th </sup>Inter.

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to some embodiments of the present invention, a method of forming a thermoelectric device may include forming a first electrically conductive trace, and bonding a thermoelectric element to the first electrically conductive trace. After bonding the thermoelectric element to the first electrically conductive trace, a metal post may be formed on the thermoelectric element so that the thermoelectric element is between the first electrically conductive trace and the metal post. After forming the metal post, the metal post may be bonded to a second electrically conductive trace so that the metal post is between the second electrically conductive trace and the thermoelectric element.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Bonding the thermoelectric element to the first electrically conductive trace may include providing a first solder material between the thermoelectric element and the first electrically conductive trace and reflowing the first solder material. Bonding the metal post to the second electrically conductive trace may include providing a second solder material between the metal post and the second electrically conductive trace and reflowing the second solder material. Moreover, the first and second solder materials may be different. More particularly, the first solder material may have a first reflow temperature, and the second solder material may have a second reflow temperature less than the first reflow temperature. In addition, the metal post may have a thickness of at least about 15 &#x3bc;m (micrometers) between the thermoelectric element and the second electrically conductive trace.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The thermoelectric element may be a first thermoelectric element, and the metal post may be a first metal post.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the present invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the sizes and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element, or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly. Also, as used herein, &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; refers to a direction that is substantially orthogonal to a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting of the present invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Examples of embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Accordingly, these terms can include equivalent terms that are created after such time. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the present specification and in the context of the relevant art, and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>

For example, each seed layer <b>207</b> may include an adhesion layer (such as a chromium layer) on the layer <b>201</b><i>a</i>, a barrier layer (such as a nickel layer) on the adhesion layer, and a passivation layer (such as a gold layer) on the barrier layer, so that the adhesion layer is between the barrier layer and the layer <b>201</b><i>a</i>, and so that the adhesion and barrier layers are between the passivation layer and the layer <b>201</b><i>a</i>. Each solder layer <b>209</b> may be a layer of a single element solder, a binary solder, a ternary solder, etc. For example, each solder layer <b>209</b> may be a layer of tin (Sn) having a thickness in the range of about 5 &#x3bc;m (micrometer) to about 10 &#x3bc;m (micrometer).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to some embodiments of the present invention, a lift-off pattern may be formed on portions of the layer <b>201</b><i>a </i>of thermoelectric material with the lift-off pattern exposing portions of the layer <b>201</b><i>a </i>on which the seed layer <b>207</b> will be formed. The seed layer may then be formed (for example by evaporation) on the lift-off pattern and on exposed portions the layer <b>201</b><i>a</i>, and the lift-off pattern may then be removed together with portions of the seed layer thereon.

The solder layers <b>209</b> may then be selectively formed on the seed layer <b>207</b> (for example, using a plating template that is subsequently removed).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to some other embodiments of the present invention, a continuous seed layer may be formed on the layer <b>201</b><i>a </i>of thermoelectric material, and the solder layers <b>209</b> may be formed on the continuous seed layer. For example, the separate solder layers <b>207</b> may be selectively formed using a plating template that is subsequently removed. After forming the separate seed layers <b>207</b>, the continuous seed layer may be patterned (for example, using a photoresist mask and/or the separate solder layers <b>209</b> as an etch mask) to provide the separate seed layers <b>207</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A mesa etch mask may then be provided on the seed layers <b>207</b> and/or solder layers <b>209</b> to selectively expose portions of the layer <b>201</b><i>a </i>of the thermoelectric material between the seed layers <b>207</b>. A mesa etch (for example, using a wet chemical etch) may then be performed on exposed portions of the layer <b>201</b><i>a </i>to provide separate thermoelectric elements <b>201</b> on the substrate <b>203</b><i>a </i>and the mesa etch mask may then be removed to provide the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>. In an alternative, the seed layers <b>207</b> and/or the solder layers <b>209</b> may be used to mask the layer <b>201</b><i>a </i>during the mesa etch without using a separate mesa etch mask. According to some embodiments of the present invention, a surface of each thermoelectric element <b>201</b> (in a plane parallel to a surface of the substrate <b>203</b><i>a </i>and perpendicular with respect to the cross sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>) may be substantially square with dimensions of about 600 &#x3bc;m (micrometer) by about 600 &#x3bc;m (micrometer).

Because a spacing between thermoelectric elements <b>201</b> (determined by the mesa etch mask and mesa etch) is greater than a spacing between diced portions <b>203</b> of the substrate (determined by the dicing operation), contact between a dicing saw (or other dicing equipment) and the thermoelectric elements <b>201</b> may be reduced and/or eliminated. Accordingly, edges/sidewalls of the thermoelectric elements <b>201</b> may be offset relative to edges/sidewalls of the respective diced portions <b>203</b> of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">P-type thermoelectric elements <b>201</b> formed form a p-type thermoelectric layer <b>201</b><i>a </i>may thus be used to provide p-type thermoelectric elements <b>201</b>-<i>p </i>as discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

During subsequent assembly steps, the portions <b>203</b> of the substrate may be removed (for example, after soldering the thermoelectric elements to a first or primary header). By maintaining the portions <b>203</b> of the substrate until after a later assembly step, the portions <b>203</b> of the substrate may aid in handling of the thermoelectric elements and/or protect the thermoelectric elements.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Many separate thermoelectric elements <b>201</b> of a same conductivity type (i.e., p-type or n-type) may thus be formed on a same substrate <b>203</b><i>a</i>, and then separated using mesa etch and dicing operations as discussed above. Accordingly, one or a plurality of substrates may be used to form p-type thermoelectric elements, and one or a plurality of substrates may be used to form n-type thermoelectric elements, and separately formed p-type and n-type thermoelectric elements can then be assembled into a same thermoelectric device as discussed in greater detail below.</p>
