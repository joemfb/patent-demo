<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This present invention concerns a device for protection of the data and executable codes of a computer system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One is familiar with systems used for the protection of data, and in particular, for example, the protection of transmitted data, and for performing authentication, in a reliable manner, of the person who has transmitted a message. Such a device is known through patent application EP 0 037 762 for example. However, such a device required a signature calculation to be performed in a portable object of the chip card type, then comparing the result of the calculation effected with the signature transmitted with the message, in order to then deliver to the outside world a &#x201c;yes&#x201d; or &#x201c;no&#x201d; result allowing authentication of the person who transmitted the message as the person who was in possession of a chip card whose confidential codes matched the confidential codes of the device that performed the authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">We are also familiar, from French patent application FR 2 526 977, with a device that allows authentication or certification of at least one information item contained in a memory of an electronic medium. Such a device and process employs a chip card, and can be used to calculate a result from knowledge of the data item stored in the electronic medium and of a parameter correlative to the position of the data item in the memory of the support. The same calculation is effected at the other end of the transmission by the device that transmitted the information, and the result supplied by one of the ends is compared in order to ensure that the registration has been completed correctly in the memory of a portable electronic medium such as the card.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a device conducts remote communication between a terminal equipped with a security module and a chip card in which one wishes to record an information item sent by this terminal. This takes no account of the problems of security at the level of the computer system of the terminal itself, and the certification and the authentication of the data recorded in the memory of the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">We are also familiar, from patent application EP 0 285 520, with a process and a device for routing the confidential codes between two security modules connected by a communication resource. This routing of confidential codes allows one to ensure the confidentiality of these keys by transmitting the keys in an encrypted manner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Finally, we are also familiar, from patent application EP 0 252 850, with a process and a device to certify the authenticity of a data item transmitted between two devices connected locally or remotely over a transmission line. The device and the process add, to the information to be transmitted, a predetermined condition that is independently of the value of the data item to be transmitted. This predetermined condition, together with the information to be transmitted, constitutes the message that is encrypted before transmission, and then decrypted on reception. After decryption, the receiver separates the received message into two fields and applies the same predetermined condition to one of the two fields, and if this predetermined condition is satisfied, the system considers that the transmission has taken place correctly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, most of the devices of the prior art have as their objective either to secure transmitted data from one terminal to another, or to authenticate a transmitter in relation to a receiver, or to allow access to a service by authenticating a person as being authorised to have access to the service.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The objective of the invention, contrary to that of the prior art, is to protect the data and the executable codes of a computer system by using one or more of the following functions for authenticating the integrity of the codes and the data, and to maintain the confidentiality of the codes and the data.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This objective is attained by the fact that the device for protection of the data and executable codes of any fixed or portable computer system and with a memory medium to be protected is characterised in that the security and protection device is located physically between the computer system and the memory medium to be protected and containing the data and executable codes, in order to provide the computer system with access to the data and codes to be protected after execution of the protection functions independently of the machine code executed by the protected computer system and, for the execution of these functions, requires no interaction with the processor of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another particular feature, the proposed protection functions concern the authorisation of access, and the integrity and the confidentiality of the data and codes to be protected.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another particular feature, the data and codes are stored either on a fixed medium (of the RAM or flash memory type for example) or on a removable medium (hard disk, USB key, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another particular feature, the memory medium can be logically partitioned into several independent partitions which are seen as so many physical partitions by the system.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another particular feature, the operating system of the device has two operating modes that are independent and not simultaneous, namely an administrator mode and a user mode.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another particular feature, the operating system of the device runs the process for activation of the device at the time of its connection to the system when it is switched on.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another particular feature, the activation process necessitates the authentication of the user or of the administrator.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the remainder of this document, the terms authentication, integrity and confidentiality will have the following meanings.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Authentication: The purpose of authentication is to ensure that the codes to be executed and the data to be manipulated, contained in the device or protected by it, are made available to the appropriate physical person. This authentication must not be capable of being bypassed by any malicious person or system.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Integrity of the codes and the data: This integrity has as its objective to guarantee to the physical person that the codes and the data presented by the device are indeed those expected by the person concerned. This integrity must not be capable of being infringed by any malicious person or system.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Confidentiality of the codes and the data: This confidentiality has as its objective to ensure that the codes and data are accessible only when the device is in operation and when the physical person has been correctly authenticated. This confidentiality must not be capable of being infringed by any malicious person or system.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to achieve all of the points mentioned, the invention first calls upon the creation of a special cryptographic component (<b>1</b>) in the form of a SOC (System On Chip). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this component (<b>1</b>) includes several cryptographic blocks shown with the reference <b>12</b>, with the various blocks being as follows:

</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0071">The interfaces (E/S/Sgs) (<b>11</b>) of the device with the memory medium (MP) and the system are of the parallel type (processor bus, PCMCIA, etc.) or of the serial type (USB, PCI-X, etc.) or of the wireless type (Wireless USB).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0072">The media (<b>13</b>) for storage of the data and executable codes can be a fixed medium (of the RAM of flash memory type, for example) or a removable medium (hard disk, USB key, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0073">The operation of this device will now be described in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0074">The activation process of the security device (<b>1</b>) is effected by the security operating system during its connection to the system (<b>2</b>) or when it is switched on.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0075">During its operation, the operating system of the security device (<b>1</b>) implements two operating modes that are independent and not simultaneous, and for each of these necessitates authentication either of the user (user mode) or of the administrator for the creation mode of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0076">The first mode is therefore the administrator mode, whose authentication is generated by the cryptographic block (bcad).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0077">The second mode is the user mode (cryptographic block bcau).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0078">In the administrator mode, during the phase for configuration or initialisation of the device, it is possible to determine, in particular, the size of the authentication data, the cryptographic mechanisms employed, the number of partitions and attributes, the diverse authorisations for a user, and the generation of the data partly by the device and partly by the user (or the administrator) or entirely by the device. The right of the user to change the configuration of the partitions can also be configured by the administrator and all the elements resulting from the configuration will be stored for use by the security operating system (OSS) of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0079">During the initialisation phase of the device, at least one part of the cryptographic elements employed are brought to the knowledge of the user. These elements are specific to the user and to the administrator, and are also unique to each device. They must be supplied to the device which, from these elements, will be able to regenerate, by cryptographic mechanisms, of the diversification type for example, a system of keys that are used to perform the authentication of the user, independently of the computer system. A parameter indicating to the operating system of the device that the authentication data are either generated entirely by the device or generated partly by the device and partly by the user (or the administrator), is stored by the administrator during the initialisation phase.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0080">During initialisation of the device, in the first case, the device generates the authentication data and presents a part of this to the user on a display unit built into the device. In the second case, the device generates the authentication data partly from data within the device and the remainder from data entered by the user directly on the device.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0081">In order to render this authentication mechanism independent of the computer system (<b>2</b>) and specific to each device, the security device (<b>1</b>) will generate a system of keys that can be activated only by the making available by the user of cryptographic elements brought to the knowledge of the device during the phase for creation of the user in the device.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0082">Once creation has been completed in administrator mode, the cryptographic block (<b>12</b>) is activated, and any use in user mode or in administrator mode necessitates a prior authentication. The authentication data are not stored in the device when it is switched on. For this, the device stores only a part of the data that has been used by the hashing function that generated the authentication data. Reconstruction of the authentication data therefore necessarily requires the entry of the missing data by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0083">Once the cryptographic block (<b>12</b>) has been activated, the latter acts with the processor (P) of the security device (<b>1</b>) in physical separation from the media for storage of the codes (msc) and data (msd) and can make these visible (or not) to the computer system. Access to these media cannot be effected directly by the computer system but always and necessarily through the cryptographic component (<b>12</b>) and only after authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0084">The field of application of the component (<b>1</b>) concerns any information system in which any processor accesses any external memory medium (<b>4</b>) to be protected that contains the code to be executed as well as the data to be manipulated. The invention allows one to have, in a single device, interposed between the processor system (P) and the memory to be protected (MP), all of the security functions that will allow one, before transmitting the information contained in the memory (<b>3</b>) to the processor (P), to check the right of access and the integrity of the code or of the data, as well as to ensure their protection in terms of confidentiality and/or integrity. The device also includes, in addition to the integrity verification function, a function that prevents access by the system to the changed data or codes on detection of a fraudulent or unexpected change to the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0085">Depending on the technology used, and the level of integration desired for the component or the part component, that is for the part integrated circuit with security functions (PCIFS), the security chip (PuDS), or the security device (DS), forming the device can be implemented:
