<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Application claims priority of Taiwan Patent Application No. 099142312, filed on Dec. 6, 2010, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a battery separator, and in particular relates to a battery separator with good thermal stability.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the progress of the electronic industry, batteries have been broadly applied to all kinds of things, such as mobile phones, digital cameras, laptops, or even electric vehicles. Therefore, demands of the batteries constantly increase. While pursuing improvement of performance of the batteries, there is an increased concern for battery safety.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A typical battery includes electrodes, an electrolyte, and a separator. Ions formed at the electrode are transported in the electrolyte to form a current, such that chemical energy is transformed to electric energy. A lithium-ion battery having high energy density is one of a main power source of electric vehicles due to its high energy density. However, when the energy density of the battery increases, the power and size of the battery may also increase, such that a great amount of heat is produced. Without an effective way to release the heat, temperature of the battery may be increased, resulting in an explosion of the electrolyte. Therefore, the safety of the battery is a high concern.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, a battery separator plays an important role in a lithium-ion battery. A battery separator is placed between two electrodes to prevent physical contact between the two electrodes, such that the safety of the battery may be improved. Furthermore, the battery separator should be chemical resistant and electrochemical resistant, such that the performance of the battery won't be affected.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A detailed description is given in the following embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An embodiment of the invention provides a multilayer battery separator, comprising: a porous polyethylene (PE) film; and a porous thermal resistant film selected from a group consisting of: a weight ratio of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and cellulose being 90/10-40/60; a weight ratio of polyvinylidene fluoride and polyethylene glycol (PEG) being 99/1-85/15; and polyimide (PI); and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment of the invention provides a method for manufacturing a multilayer battery separator, comprising: providing a porous polyethylene film; coating a thermal resistant film onto the porous polyethylene film to form a composite film using a wet process, wherein the porous thermal resistant film is selected from a group consisting of: a weight ratio of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and cellulose being 90/10-40/60; and a weight ratio of polyvinylidene fluoride and polyethylene glycol (PEG) being 99/1-85/15; polyimide (PI); and combinations thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following description is of the best-contemplated mode of carrying out the invention. This description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention and should not be taken in a limiting sense. The scope of the invention is best determined by reference to the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A multilayer battery separator having thermal shutdown properties and good thermal stability to improve safety of a lithium-ion battery is provided. After a polyolefin film is made, a porous thermal resistant film is applied to the polyolefin film to form a composite battery separator having thermal shutdown properties and good thermal stability. The porous thermal resistant film may be such as polyvinylidiene fluride (PVDF)/cellulose, polyvinylidiene fluride/polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyimide (PI), or combinations thereof. Polyvinylidiene fluride may include polyvinylidiene fluride and its derivatives. The derivatives of polyvinylidiene fluride may include polyvinylidiene fluride-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HEP) copolymers, polyvinylidiene fluride-trifluorochloroethylene copolymers, derivatives thereof, or combinations thereof. Cellulose may include cellulose acetate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, derivatives thereof, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A dry process is used to form a polyethylene film. High density polyethylene particles are placed into a twin screw extruder with a temperature set at 180&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. and extruded through a T-die with a temperature set at 180&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. After cooling, a precursor film with a width of 20 cm is formed. The precursor film is heated in an oven at a temperature of 180&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. for 30 min to 120 min, and then subjected to mechanical stretching. First, a cold drawing is performed at room temperature, and then a hot drawing is performed at a temperature of 80&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C. to form a porous film. Finally, a heat setting process is proceeded at a temperature of 80&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C. to form a porous polyethylene film.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The porous thermal resistant film is coated onto the porous polyethylene film to form a composite film by a wet process. The wet process may include spin coating, casting, bar coating, blade coating, roller coating, wire bar coating, dip coating, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantages of using the composite film as a battery separator may include adjustable permeability, thermal shutdown properties, and good thermal stability. Therefore, the safety of a battery is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The porous polyethylene film is placed between two electrodes to separate the electrodes, wherein a thickness of the porous polyethylene film may be between about 10 &#x3bc;m and 25 &#x3bc;m. The porous polyethylene film has an appropriate pore size, such that ions inside the battery can have a better transportation rate. In one embodiment, the porous ethylene film has a Gurley value of between about 5 sec/10 cc and 200 sec/10 cc, preferably between about 10 sec/10 cc and 100 sec/10 cc. When the porous polyethylene film has the Gurley value of less than 5 sec/10 cc, the large pore size of the porous polyethylene film results in a high transportation rate of the ions inside the battery. Although the battery can therefore have a high power, the battery temperature may increase too fast. When the porous polyethylene film has a Gurley value of larger than 200 sec/10 cc, the small pore size of the porous polyethylene film results in low ion transportation and therefore a low charging/discharging rate of the battery. The polyethylene of the porous polyethylene film may have a weight-average molecular weight Mw of between about 100,000 and 500,000, preferably between about 150,000 and 400,000. The polyethylene of the porous polyethylene film may have a density of between about 0.935 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and 0.975 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably between about 0.940 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and 0.970 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The porous polyethylene film may have a thermal shutdown temperature of between about 125&#xb0; C. and 135&#xb0; C. That is, when the temperature inside the battery reaches of over 125&#xb0; C. to 135&#xb0; C., the porous polyethylene film is shutdown and the ions inside the battery can no longer be transported. However, although the porous polyethylene film can be shutdown, the temperature inside the battery may not stop increasing immediately. If the temperature keeps increasing, the porous polyethylene film may meltdown and break. Therefore, the separator of the invention further includes a porous thermal resistant film that can resist high temperatures, such that even when the porous polyethylene film melts down and breaks, the separator won't lose its function.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, the average pore size of the porous thermal resistant film should be no less than the average pore size of the porous polyethylene film. Therefore, before the temperature inside the battery reaches the thermal shutdown temperature of the porous polyethylene film, the porous thermal resistant film will not affect the ion transportation rate inside of the battery. The porous thermal resistant film may have a thickness of between about 5 &#x3bc;m and 50 &#x3bc;m. The porous thermal resistant film may have a Gurley value of between 5 sec/10 cc and 40 sec/10 cc preferably. When the porous thermal resistant film has a Gurley value of larger than 40 sec/10 cc, the small pore size of the porous thermal resistant film results in decreasing the charging/discharging rate of the battery. When the porous thermal resistant film has the Gurley value of lower than 5 sec/10 cc, the pore size of the porous thermal resistant film is too large to control the ion transportation rate. In other words, when the porous polyethylene film melts down and breaks due to the high temperature inside the battery, the ions inside the battery can transport freely.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the porous thermal resistant film is formed of PVDF/cellulose. The porous thermal resistant film includes about 40-90 wt % of the PVDF and about 10-60 wt % of the cellulose. When the porous thermal resistant film includes over 90 wt % of the PVDF, a pore size of the porous thermal resistant film may be too large. For example, if the porous thermal resistant film is completely formed of PVDF, ions inside the battery can be transported freely after the porous polyethylene film is broken. That is, because the pore size of the porous thermal resistant film is too large, the transportation rate of the ions is not controlled, such that the separator loses its function even though the PVDF film still exists, and the temperature inside the battery keeps rising to result in dangerous condition. When the porous thermal resistant film includes less than 40 wt % of the PVDF, the pore size of the porous thermal resistant film may be too small, drastically affecting the charging/discharging rate of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, the porous thermal resistant film is formed of PVDF/polyethylene glycol. The porous thermal resistant film includes about 85-99 wt % of the PVDF and about 1-15 wt % of the polyethylene glycol. When the porous thermal resistant film includes over 99 wt % of the PVDF, the pore size of the porous thermal resistant film may be too large. When the porous thermal resistant film includes less than 85 wt % of the PVDF, the pore size of the porous thermal resistant film may be too small.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In still another embodiment, the porous thermal resistant film is formed with polyimide (PI).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the porous thermal resistant film has a thermal meltdown temperature or a glass transition temperature of over 150&#xb0; C., preferably of over 160&#xb0; C. That is, the function of the separator can be retained at a temperature of about 150&#xb0; C., preferably at a temperature of about 160&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, the battery separator described above may be applied to a lithium-ion battery. In another embodiment, the battery separator may be applied to a nickel hydride battery. In still another embodiment, the battery separator may be applied to the automobile industry. Comparing the batteries within common electronic products such as mobile phones or laptops, the batteries of electric vehicles require higher charging speed and must be extremely safe.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Compared to a conventional battery separator, the battery separator of the invention is safer. Although the conventional battery, such as those made of non-woven fabrics, has good mechanical strength, its pore size is too big to control ion transportation rate. Also, although the conventional separator is thermal resistant, it does not serve to improve the safety of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the battery can have an appropriate ion transportation rate by adjusting the pore sizes of the porous polyethylene film and the porous thermal resistant film. Furthermore, when the battery is overheated, the porous polyethylene film will shutdown to prevent ions from further reacting, such that the temperature inside the battery can lower. However, if the temperature of the battery does not decrease immediately due to the breakage of the porous polyethylene film, the ion transportation rate can still be controlled by the porous thermal resistant film of the battery separator because of its appropriate pore size. Therefore, the safety of the battery is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Advantages of the battery separator of the invention may include current controlling properties, insulating characteristics, thermal shutdown ability, good mechanical strength, or good thermal stability. Breakage of the separator resulting from electrode expansion, power decreasing resulting from compression, short-circuit of the battery resulting from weak thermal resistant, or other problems may not occur in the battery of the invention.</p>

A weight ratio of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and cellulose was 60/40. First, high density polyethylene particles were melted and extruded to form a film. A heating treatment was performed to increase crystallinity of the film, and then a tensile machine was used to stretch the film and generate small pores inside the film.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The Gurley value was measured by an ASTM-726(B) of a Gurley Densometer (Model 4120). The definition of the Gurley value was the time (by second) for 10 c.c of air to flow through a 1-sq-in. area of test material, under a pressure of 12.2 inch WG.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The tensile strength was measured by an ASTM-D638. The method of measuring the puncture strength is described below. The film was fixed between two hollow metal films.
