<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0002">The present invention relates to a thermoplastic resin foam having fine bubbles in the inside thereof, and a production method of the thermoplastic resin foam and a light reflecting material thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0003">Synthetic resin films or sheets, which reflect light, have been conventionally used for backlights of electrical spectacular signs, lighting apparatuses, displays, or the like. For example, light reflecting plates, which are obtained by processing synthetic resin films or sheets into stereoscopic shapes in order to suppress brightness unevenness, have been proposed (for example, see Patent Literature 1).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0004">However, when the thermoplastic resin foam films or sheets are processed into stereoscopic shapes, the films or sheets are deformed due to strain in molding or constriction after molding. Accordingly, a means has been proposed, which prevents a light reflecting plate from deforming by fixing a light reflecting plate subjected to shape processing and a metallic casing (For example, see Patent Literature 2).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0005">In recent years, power saving and high efficiency have been required in the fields of lighting apparatuses, liquid crystal displays, and the like. Therefore, a resin film or sheet having a higher reflectivity has been desired. In particular, needs for space saving has been enhanced in the fields of electrical spectacular signs and displays, and it has been required to make a resin film or sheet, which reflects light, thinner. It is hard to make the above described light reflecting plate meet the requirements when making a thinner product.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0006">Accordingly, a thermoplastic resin foam film or sheet having many fine bubbles or pores in the inside thereof has been proposed as a synthetic resin film or sheet, which reflects light (for example, see Patent Literature 3). The thermoplastic resin foam film or sheet has a mean bubble diameter as fine as approximately 10 &#x3bc;m, and therefore exhibits a high reflectance.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">However, a foam sheet having a mean bubble diameter of approximately 10 &#x3bc;m has a problem that transmitted light increases when the sheet is made thin. Therefore, a desired reflectivity cannot be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The present invention is contemplated for solving the above described problem and providing a thermoplastic resin foam and a light reflecting material having a high reflectance when made thin, as well as a method of producing the thermoplastic resin foam.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">The present inventors intensively studied in order to solve the above described problems; as a result, they found that a thermoplastic resin foam having a high reflectivity even when formed into a thin film can be produced by adding a specific melt-type crystallization nucleating agent to a thermoplastic resin, and thereby solving the problem. The present invention was attained based on this finding.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0030">Other and further features and advantages of the invention will appear more fully from the following description.</p>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">The thermoplastic resin foam of the present invention is obtained by foaming a resin composition obtained from a crystalline thermoplastic resin (A) containing a melt-type crystallization nucleating agent (B). Firstly, in the thermoplastic resin foam of the present invention, the crystalline thermoplastic resin (A) will be described.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(A) Crystalline Thermoplastic Resin</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0032">The term &#x201c;crystalline&#x201d; means that resin molecules form a regular configurational structure (crystal structure) in a certain temperature range of Tg or higher. Such crystallinity is defined based on a crystallization calorie by a differential scanning calorimeter. Being crystalline in the present invention means having 5.0 J/g or more of a calorie calculated from an exothermic peak (crystallization peak), when a thermoplastic resin is heated at a melting temperature or more and then the temperature is dropped at 10&#xb0; C./min. The crystallization calorie is preferably 10.0 J/g or more, and more preferably 50 J/g or less.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0033">Examples of the crystalline thermoplastic resin (A) that can be used in the present invention include a polyester, a polyamide, a white linear-type polyphenylene sulfide, a syndiotactic polystyrene, and a polyether ketone. Among them, a polyester is particularly preferable. In the present invention, a crystalline thermoplastic resin may be used singly, or two or more kinds thereof may be used in mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034">Examples of the above-mentioned polyester include copolymer polyesters such as a poly(ethylene isophthalate/terephthalate), a poly(butylene isophthalate/terephthalate), a poly(ethylene terephthalate/naphthalate), a poly(butylene isoterephthalate), and a poly(butylene isonaphthalate), in addition to a poly(butylene terephthalate), a poly(ethylene terephthalate), a poly(ethylene naphthalate), and a poly(butylene naphthalate). Among them, a poly(ethylene terephthalate) resin is particularly preferable from the viewpoints of crystallinity and a foaming property.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">In the present invention, a thermoplastic resin is preferably non-crosslinked from the viewpoint of recycling. The thermoplastic resin in the present invention preferably has a mass fraction of a crosslinked portion in the thermoplastic resin (hereinafter, also referred to as a crosslinking degree in the specification) of less than 10%. A crosslinking agent or a crosslinking aid may be added as long as the crosslinking degree of a thermoplastic resin is less than 10%.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(B) Melt-Type Crystallization Nucleating Agent</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">The term &#x201c;melt-type crystallization nucleating agent&#x201d; indicates a nucleating agent which is characterized by melting and dispersing in a resin in melt-kneading when added to a thermoplastic resin and being coagulated and solidified in a temperature-dropping coagulation step.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0037">In the present invention, the melt-type crystallization nucleating agent (B) is molten and dispersed to the crystalline thermoplastic resin (A) in molding. In temperature-dropping solidification or gas impregnation after molding, the melt-type crystallization nucleating agent (B) deposits in the crystalline thermoplastic resin (A). As a result, the melt-type crystallization nucleating agent (B) is crystallized. In the foaming step, the deposited melt-type crystallization nucleating agent (B) is the starting point of formation of a bubble nucleus. As a result, a foam having fine pores with a mean bubble diameter of less than 1 &#x3bc;m uniformly in the inside thereof can be obtained. Such a foam is molded and a reflecting material having a high reflectivity can be thus obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0038">A melt-type crystallization nucleating agent used in the present invention is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include N,N&#x2032;-dicyclohexyl-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxamide, trimesic acid tris(t-butylamide), trimesic acid tricyclohexylamide, trimesic acid tri(2-methylcyclohexylamide), trimesic acid tri(4-methylcyclohexylamide), 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid dianilide, 1,4-cyclohexanoic acid dicarboxylic acid dicyclohexylamide, 1,4-cyclohexanoic acid dicarboxylic acid di(2-methylcyclohexylamide), 1,4-cyclohexanoic acid dicarboxylic acid dibenzylamide, 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid dicyclohexylamide, 1,2,3,4-butane tetracarboxylic acid tetracyclohexylamide and 1,2,3,4-butane tetracarboxylic acid tetraanilide. These substances may be used singly, or two or more kinds thereof may be used in mixture. Among these examples, N,N&#x2032;-dicyclohexyl-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxamide is preferable from the viewpoints of transparency and a particle diameter of a generated crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039">A specific gravity of a thermoplastic resin foam in the present invention is preferably 0.7 or less, more preferably 0.65 or less, and further more preferably 0.5 or less. In the present invention, a large specific gravity, that is, decrease of an expansion ratio, leads to lowering of a reflectivity due to reduction of a bubble ratio, and lowering of moldability or decrease of a down-sizing effect.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0040">In the present invention, a blending amount of (B) is 0.1 to 2 part(s) by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the crystalline thermoplastic resin (A). The blending amount is preferably 0.25 to 1.5 part(s) by mass. When the blending amount of the melt-type crystallization nucleating agent is too small, a crystal nucleus generated by undergoing a crystallization step of a melt-type crystallization nucleating agent due to gas impregnation is hardly generated and a bubble diameter distribution of a foam thus becomes large. When the blending amount of the melt-type crystallization nucleating agent is too large, since crystallization excessively proceeds, a crystalline nucleus becomes too large and has a grain shape, and functions as a bubble nucleating agent are insufficient, a high expansion ratio cannot be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041">In the present invention, various additives such as a crystallization accelerating agent, a foam nucleating agent, an oxidation inhibitor, an antistatic agent, an anti-ultraviolet agent, a light stabilizer, a fluorescent brightening agent, a pigment, a dye, a compatibilizing agent, a lubricating agent, a reinforcing agent, a flame retardant, a plasticizer, a thickening agent, and a thinning agent can be suitably blended to a thermoplastic resin (A) before foaming within the range not damaging the object of the present invention. Further, a resin containing the above described additives may be laminated to the obtained thermoplastic resin foam, or a coating material containing the above described additives may be applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0042">A method of producing the thermoplastic resin foam of the present invention will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0043">A crystalline thermoplastic resin (A) and a melt-type crystallization nucleating agent (B) are melt-kneaded using, for example, a kneader or an extruder, thereby preparing a resin composition. Kneading conditions such as a kneading temperature and a kneading time can be suitably set to a temperature at which the crystalline thermoplastic resin (A) and the melt-type crystallization nucleating agent (B) are molten. The thus-obtained resin composition is formed into a sheet using an extruder or the like thereby to obtain a resin sheet, and the resin sheet and a separator are overlapped and rolled to be formed into a roll. The roll is maintained in a pressurized inert gas atmosphere, thus letting the resin sheet contain the inert gas. Further, the resin sheet containing the inert gas is heated at the softening temperature of the crystalline thermoplastic resin (A) or more under normal pressure thereby to be foamed. A thermoplastic resin foam is thus obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0044">Examples of the inert gas include helium, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and argon. A permeation time of an inert gas and an impregnation amount of an inert gas until a resin sheet attains a saturated state are different depending on a kind of a resin to be foamed, a kind of an inert gas, a permeation pressure and a sheet thickness. Among these examples, carbon dioxide is preferable from the viewpoint of permeability of a gas into a resin (speed, solubility).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0045">In addition, an organic solvent may be contained in the resin sheet before containing an inert gas in a roll made of the resin sheet and a separator in a pressurized inert gas atmosphere in this method.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0046">Examples of the organic solvent include benzene, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl formate, acetone, acetic acid, dioxane, m-cresol, aniline, acrylonitrile, dimethyl phthalate, nitroethane, nitromethane, and benzyl alcohol. Among them, acetone is preferable from the viewpoints of handling property and economical efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047">In the present invention, a mean diameter of a bubble present in the thermoplastic resin foam according to the present invention is less than 1 &#x3bc;m. In particular, the mean diameter is preferably 0.75 &#x3bc;m or less, and particularly preferably 0.5 &#x3bc;m or less. When the mean bubble diameter is too large, a desired high reflectivity cannot be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0048">In the present invention, the total reflectivity at a light wavelength of 550 nm of the thermoplastic resin foam is preferably 98% or more by an aluminum oxide ratio. In particular, the total reflectivity is preferably 100% or more, and particularly preferably 101% or more. The term &#x201c;total reflectivity&#x201d; mentioned herein is a relative value shown with a reflectivity of an aluminum oxide white plate (210-0740: manufactured by Hitachi High-Tech Fielding Corporation) being set at 100% at a wavelength of 550 nm, using a spectrophotometer (U-4100: manufactured by Hitachi High-Tech Fielding Corporation).</p>
