<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Embodiments of the invention provide time-domain link adaptation in power line communications. In one embodiment, the cyclic prefix length and position is adjusted with an OFDM symbol to overlap a periodic impulse noise pulse, thereby allowing the data carried in the symbol to be detected at a receiver. The cyclic prefix may be adjusted to provide a pattern that yields an integer number of OFDM symbols in one zero crossing period. The data rate used for the symbols overlapping the zero-crossing period may be zero or very low. A high data rate may be used for symbols outside the zero-crossing period because those symbols will not be affected by the periodic impulse noise.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the invention are directed, in general, to communication systems and, more specifically, to time domain link adaptation in power line communications.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has been agreed that the G.hnem will use OFDM and will have the ability to adapt to channel conditions. Further, it is well known that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) changes with frequency. Consequently, it is necessary to use receiver feedback to adapt the coding scheme and adapt the modulation scheme on different subcarriers. It may also be necessary to adapt the transmit power.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Periodic impulse noise often occurs on power lines due to the zero-crossings of the AC mains. This noise may be introduced, for example, by a triac or a zero-crossing sense resistor in a dimmer circuit. These periodic impulse noise pulses may interfere with the transmission of data in power line communication systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the invention provide a system and method that identifies a duration and period of an impulse noise on a power line. A transmitter generates a plurality of Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols to be transmitted from a first device to a second device over the power line. Each of the OFDM symbols has a cyclic prefix. The plurality of OFDM symbols are synchronized by the transmitter so that the impulse noise occurs during the cyclic prefix of one or more of the OFDM symbols. The OFDM symbols are then transmitted over the power line. The impulse noise may be caused, for example, by the zero crossing of an AC mains signal. The power line may be a low voltage power line. The first device may be a base node in a power line communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, a method and system identify a duration and period of an impulse noise on a power line. A transmitter generates a plurality of OFDM symbols to be transmitted from a first device to a second device over the power line. Each of the OFDM symbols has a cyclic prefix. The size of the cyclic prefix in the plurality of OFDM symbols is selected to ensure approximately an integer number of OFDM symbols per zero-crossing cycle. A first group of OFDM symbols is transmitted and overlap, at least in part, the impulse noise on the power line. The first group of OFDM symbols has a first data rate. A second group of OFDM symbols that do not overlap the impulse noise are transmitted on the power line. The second group of OFDM symbols has a second data rate. The first data rate is a relatively low data rate and may be no data per symbol. The second data rate is a relatively high data rate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The impulse noise may be caused by the zero crossing of an AC mains signal. The size of the cyclic prefix in the plurality of OFDM symbols may be selected to ensure 14 OFDM symbols per zero crossing. Alternatively, the size of the cyclic prefix in the plurality of OFDM symbols may be selected to ensure 23 OFDM symbols per zero crossing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Feedback information may be received from a receiver. In one embodiment, the feedback comprises data identifying a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each of a block of signals. The first group of OFDM symbols may be identified based upon symbols having an SNR above a threshold level. The second group of OFDM symbols may be identified based upon symbols having an SNR below a threshold level.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, an apparatus comprises a transmitter and a processor. The transmitter is adapted to generate a plurality of OFDM symbols, each having a cyclic prefix. The processor is coupled to the transmitter and is adapted to receive feedback data from a receiver. The feedback data may comprise a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each of a block of OFDM symbols. The processor may determine a data rate to use for each symbol based upon the feedback data. The transmitter may be further adapted to generate symbols having a low data rate if the symbols will be transmitted during a high SNR period and to generate symbols having a high data rate if the symbols will be transmitted during a low SNR period. The low data rate may be that no data is transmitted.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the invention apply time-domain link adaptation in power line communication networks using G.hnem or other standards, such as PRIME or G3. For example, the G.hnem standard specifies frequency-domain bit-allocation tables to combat frequency-selectivity of the channel response and noise energy. However, it is known that the noise is time-selective and often synchronous with the zero crossings of the AC mains and, consequently, periodic. Time-domain link adaptation may be used to combat such periodic noise.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates periodic noise that occurs in one embodiment of a power line communication system. AC mains signal <b>201</b> is carried on the power lines. The frequency of the AC main signal <b>201</b> may be, for example, 60 Hz in the United States or 50 Hz in other countries. Noise peaks <b>202</b> may occur at the zero crossings of the AC mains signal <b>201</b>. These noise peaks <b>202</b> may be caused by the voltage change at the zero crossings in certain devices or switches on the power line network.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a periodic noise spike <b>301</b> on a power line that is caused, for example, by an AC mains zero crossing. Symbol <b>302</b> is transmitted on the power line at the same time as noise spike <b>301</b>. If the cyclic prefix (CP) <b>303</b> in symbol <b>302</b> is selected properly, then the CP <b>303</b> will overlap noise spike <b>301</b>, but the data <b>304</b> carried in symbol <b>302</b> will not be affected by periodic noise spike <b>301</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a symbol <b>302</b> that begins at the same time as periodic noise spike <b>301</b>, it will be understood that this is not required and that, in other embodiments, symbol <b>302</b> may begin prior to periodic noise spike <b>301</b> and have a CP <b>303</b> that overlaps the periodic noise spike <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the cyclic prefix length in the OFDM signals on the power line network are selected to ensure that an integer number of OFDM symbols or close to an integer number of OFDM symbols overlap the zero crossings. TABLE 1 lists suggested values of the total guard interval based upon the tone spacing for G.hnem OFDM. The cyclic prefix lengths are fixed values instead of periodic patterns as may be used in other embodiments. The use of fixed cyclic prefix lengths yields nearly an integer number of symbols. For example, in the Cenelec-A band, with 30 samples at 400 kHz as the total guard interval, 14 symbols span 10.01 ms. With respect to the AC mains, the symbols drift at 10 &#x3bc;s per half-period for this configuration. This is well within the tolerance of the AC mains frequency itself and, therefore, this drift can be tolerated. Similarly, for the FCC band, a 68-sample guard interval only leads to a drift of 4.17 &#x3bc;s per half-mains period.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Certain benefits may be achieved by synchronizing the symbol period to the AC mains zero crossings. In one embodiment, the interleaver length is selected based on the AC mains period. This achieves most of the interleaving gains for the case of periodic impulsive noise. For example, the interleaver length for the Cenelec-A band may be chosen to be an integer number of OFDM symbols, whose span does not exceed 10 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, the symbol length may be selected to be equal to or very close to a divisor of the zero-crossing duration. For example, given the symbol period T<sub>sym </sub>and the number of symbols N<sub>sym</sub>, the zero crossing period T<sub>zc </sub>can be expressed as T<sub>sym</sub>&#xd7;N<sub>sym</sub>+T<sub>rem</sub>, where T<sub>sym</sub>/2&#x2266;T<sub>rem</sub>&#x3c;T<sub>sym</sub>/2. The value of T<sub>sym </sub>may be selected so that T<sub>rem </sub>is close to zero in one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One potential benefit of synchronizing symbols to AC mains is time-domain link adaptation. For example, to handle the case where impulsive noise is much longer than the cyclic prefix, such as if periodic noise pulse <b>301</b> was much longer than CP <b>303</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the system could instead use time-domain link adaptation as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A block of N symbols (e.g. <b>402</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>402</b>-N) is transmitted on the power line. A few symbols (<b>402</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>402</b>-<b>2</b>) in the block are affected by impulsive noise <b>401</b>, which may be caused by AC mains zero crossings. Using simple receiver feedback, the transmitter can adapt the data rate in each symbol <b>402</b> to the SNR for that symbol <b>402</b>. For example, no data might be transmitted in the symbols <b>402</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>402</b>-<b>2</b>, which are affected by the impulse noise <b>401</b>. In another embodiment, a very low data rate and/or highly redundant data may be transmitted in symbols <b>402</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>402</b>-<b>2</b> so that the receiver might be able to detect the data despite impulse noise <b>401</b>. On the other hand, outside of impulse noise <b>401</b>, the maximum data rate may be transmitted in the remaining (N&#x2212;2) symbols in the block (e.g. <b>402</b>-<b>3</b> (not shown) to <b>402</b>-N). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates time-domain link adaptation, where a smaller data rate is transmitted on symbols affected by the impulsive noise.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The link adaptation process mentioned above is a time-domain equivalent of frequency-domain link adaptation, such as adapting modulation parameters on different tones in response to channel variations or narrowband interference. In powerline communications, periodic impulsive noise is a dominant noise source. Therefore, time-domain link adaptation may be equally effective as, and should be combined with, frequency-domain link adaptation. In an extreme case, a system may use two-dimensional link adaptation for cases where the periodic impulsive noise is also frequency selective and concentrated on a few tones.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Implementation of the method described herein requires only receiver feedback of the phase on which AC mains is present and the SNR profile across different symbols. The method does not require the transmitter to synchronize symbol start with the zero crossing.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In other embodiments, different variations are possible based on the general principle of time-domain link adaptation. If some symbols have such high noise levels that those symbols cannot be used, then in those symbols: (i) dummy data can be transmitted, (ii) only pilots can be transmitted, (iii) neither pilot nor data may be transmitted, or (iv) neither pilots nor data may be transmitted and the pilot phase may not count up.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates simulation results for a system assumed to have a 3.5 ms impulse noise duration with 10 ms impulse noise period. The Frame Error Rates (FER) for two scenarios are compared in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Curve <b>501</b> (marked with circles) represents performance without time-domain link adaptation when packets with DQPSK+rate &#xbd; convolution code+repetition 2 code are used. Due to the impulsive noise, 3.5 ms of the symbols are erased at the receiver out of every 10 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Curve <b>502</b> (marked with diamonds) denotes system performance with time-domain link adaptation applied. In the simulated system, it is assumed that no symbols are sent when impulse noise occurs. For example, there will be no transmission for a 3.5 ms duration overlapping the impulse noise during every 10 ms. In the periods when impulse noise does not occur, the transmitter sends packets with DQPSK+rate &#xbd; convolutional code.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">These simulation results show that approximately 1.5 dB gain may be achieved if time-domain link adaptation is used. Additionally, the time-domain link adaptation saves the transmit energy during the erased portions of the received signal by simply not transmitting in those periods. The main reason for this advantage is that the coding architecture does not easily handle the case of unequal input SNRs. Link adaptation offers a method of achieving the best performance gains from the current coding architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates simulation results for another embodiment using time-domain link adaptation. As noted above, synchronizing the impulse noise with the symbol boundary is not required. For example, consider the case where 5.5 symbols out of 14 symbols are erased due to periodic impulsive noise. For completeness, both coherent and differential modulations are considered in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Curves <b>601</b> and <b>602</b> curves represent coherent modulation, and curves <b>603</b> and <b>604</b> represent differential modulation. In both cases, time-domain link adaptation yields performance gains of more than 3 dB, while preserving the data rate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the comparison shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the net data rate is the same. With time domain link adaptation (<b>601</b>, <b>603</b>), the QPSK+rate-&#xbd; combination is transmitted roughly in 8.5 out of 14 symbols. Thus, the spectral efficiency&#x2014;without accounting for any other overhead&#x2014;is (8.5/14) or approximately 0.6 b/s/Hz. This is compared against a system that transmits QPSK+rate-&#xbd;+repetition-&#xbd; combination that transmits all the time (i.e. no time-domain adaptation shown in curves <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>) yielding a spectral efficiency of 0.5 b/s/Hz. Thus, the curve with time domain link adaptation actually lowers error rates for the same additive noise level, while at the same time achieving around 30% higher spectral efficiency. The intuitive reason for this is the nature of the FEC (Forward Error Correction) design. The concatenated code with repetition approaches capacity on an additive noise channel, but does not optimally handle the erasure channel. When 50% of the bits are erased, the resultant loss in performance is more than 3 dB for the concatenated code. Viewed differently, the current coding architecture (like many other coding architectures) does not easily handle the case of unequal input SNRs. Link adaptation offers a method of achieving the best performance gains from the current coding architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Two drawbacks of time-domain link adaptation have been noted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">First, time-domain link adaptation is a link adaptation technique and, therefore, does not work for broadcast and multi-cast data. However, such packets are transmitted with low modulation and coding schemes and, for such cases, interleaving depths of greater than 10 ms can easily be obtained with existing interleavers and without increasing memory loss. In any case, alternative proposals for the interleaver also require some form of receiver feedback to select the Reed Solomon code rates depending on the noise model.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Second, time-domain link adaptation requires sophisticated receiver feedback to work. To be more precise, the feedback requirements are given below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The receiver provides feedback comprising some compressed form of SNR on each of 14 or 23 symbols (depending on Cenelec or FCC bands) with respect to a known reference point. This may be either (i) the zero crossing duration of the AC mains line to which the receiver is connected, or (ii) the start of the first symbol received from the transmitter to which the feedback is being sent.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The transmitter receives above feedback identified above and determines the bit allocation for each of the 14 or 23 symbols in one period. In the simplest form, some of the symbols are blanked and do not carry any information bits. This pattern is signaled in the header and is then repeated for all the data symbols. Reference to AC mains is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The cyclic prefix length embodiment includes a proposed carrier spacing for the G.hnem standard, but would work with other carrier spacing as well. Furthermore, the gains of choosing a cyclic prefix pattern that yields integer number of OFDM symbols in one zero crossing period are described above. Performance results with time-domain link adaptation are also shown above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It has been agreed that G.hnem will use OFDM and will have the ability to adapt to channel conditions. Further, it is well known that SNR changes with frequency. Consequently, it is necessary to use receiver feedback to adapt the coding scheme, and adapt the modulation scheme (and possibly also the transmit power) on different subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Link adaptation itself can be a complicated process involving data processing and signaling at multiple locations. The following discussion breaks down the link adaptation issue into smaller components to facilitate understanding.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Link adaptation can be broken down into the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Step one&#x2014;Receiver Measurement and Feedback. In this step, the receiver measures the channel quality on various subcarriers or groups of subcarriers and feeds the channel quality data back to the transmitter. The following data needs to be identified:</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Link quality metric: The link quality metric should enable estimation of the maximum data rate that can be achieved given the channel and noise conditions. The rawest form of the link quality metric is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on each subcarrier or group of subcarriers. Based on the subcarrier SNR, near-optimum choices may be made for the modulation scheme for individual subcarriers, coding scheme across all subcarriers, and (optionally) the power distribution across subcarriers. The optimum choices may also vary depending on the size of the data to be transmitted. Since the receiver does not have access to this information, in one embodiment, the receiver feeds back a compressed version of the signal-noise-ratio on different subcarriers as link quality metric. It is possible to define a reversible mapping between the SNR and spectral efficiency/capacity. These quantities could be used instead of SNR.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Frequency Granularity: Adjacent subcarriers often have correlated signal-to-noise ratios. This fact can be used to design compress the feedback signal. In one embodiment, one link quality metric is calculated for a sub-band of adjacent carriers. The sub-band size may be chosen adaptively, or it may be fixed for a given band. In addition to improving the efficiency of signaling, the use of sub-bands also enables more accurate estimates of signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to this, other compression schemes may be used to exploit correlation between adjacent sub-bands.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Initiation of Link Quality Report: Since the statistics of the channel and noise both vary slowly, feedback may be done occasionally. This may be done either by (i) aperiodic polling by the transmitter and corresponding response by the receiver, (ii) aperiodic update by the receiver in response to measured variations in the noise or signal level, or (iii) pseudo-periodic (i.e. as periodic as possible, given network traffic conditions) update configured by the transmitter&#x2014;for example, during connection setup. All three options may be supported by a standard, such as G.hnem, by defining corresponding LLC (Logical Link Control) packets.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Step two&#x2014;Calculation of Bit Allocation and Code Rate. With frequency-selective CQI (Channel-Quality Indication) reporting, different vendors might have their own method of calculating the bit allocation or modulation on each tone and the coding scheme to be used. To achieve some uniformity, the standard may specify the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) calculation procedure only for a few simple cases, such as, for example, when the SNR is the same throughout the band. The standard may also specify a few other cases of narrowband interference and impulsive noise. The signaling should support a broad range of possible choices, with the following properties.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Step three&#x2014;Signaling. For each frame, the transmitter may signal the current modulation and coding scheme to the receiver. The signaling scheme should incur low overhead, while at the same time ensuring robustness and flexibility in the choice of MCS.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Per-frame signaling or signaling with memory: A basic choice to make is the &#x201c;memory&#x201d; in the signaling process. In a memoryless approach, all information about the bit allocation and coding for a given scheme are contained in that frame. Thus, each frame can have independent bit allocations from other frames. Another alternative is to set up a table of bit allocation and coding schemes, and refer to the index in that table. In such a method, the bit allocation can only be decoded by the intended receiver, and only after the transmitter identity is known.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The latter approach is useful only when the number of sub-bands is large. For example, it may be better to use per-frame signaling for the Cenelec bands, even if table-based signaling is used for the FCC band.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Number of Sub-bands: Increasing the number of sub-bands enables finer tuning to channel conditions, but the incremental advantage of additional sub-bands diminishes beyond a point. In one embodiment, the number of sub-bands is restricted in the available bandwidth to sixteen or fewer in the Cenelec bands, and twenty-four or fewer in the FCC band.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Compression Techniques: Irrespective of which signaling approach is used, the bit allocation and coding scheme indicators for different sub-bands should be compressed to achieve efficient signaling. For the bit allocation table, the target should be to achieve one bit of signaling per sub-band. Thus, with sixteen sub-bands, the bit allocation should be conveyed in sixteen bits or less. The coding scheme may be signaled separately.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Evaluation Methodology. Variable bit allocation across tones is likely to be useful only in conditions where the noise or channel response has sharp frequency variations. To quantify the performance of any scheme, simulations may be run to obtain throughput versus SNR curves with realistic estimates of channel and noise variance estimation errors.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a process <b>700</b> for compensating for periodic impulse noise in a communication system using time-domain link adaptation. In step <b>701</b>, the system determines whether a periodic impulse noise duration is longer than a cyclic prefix (CP) of symbols. If the periodic impulse noise pulse duration is not longer than the cyclic prefix, then in step <b>702</b> the system adjusts the transmitted symbols so that the cyclic prefix overlaps the impulse noise. This allows the receiver to drop the cyclic prefix, which may be distorted by the noise, and still extract the transmitted data from the remaining portion of the symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If the periodic impulse noise is longer than the cyclic prefix, then in step <b>703</b> the receiver monitors the SNR in the received symbols. In step <b>704</b>, the receiver provides feedback to the transmitter for a block of symbols, including the SNR for each received symbol. The transmitter may use the SNR data for each symbol to identify which symbols overlap the periodic impulse noise. Using this information, the transmitter may adjust the data rate for each symbol based upon the SNR ratio in each symbol. For example, in symbols having a high SNR, the transmitter may transmit no data or some data using a very low data rate, and in symbols having a low SNR, the transmitter may transmit data at a high data rate.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It will be understood that steps <b>701</b>-<b>705</b> of the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be executed simultaneously and/or sequentially. It will be further understood that each step may be performed in any order and may be performed once or repetitiously.</p>
