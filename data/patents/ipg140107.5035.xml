<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INVENTIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example illustrating a structure of a typical communication system for providing the application service. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in case that there are a plurality of communication operators, there is provided each communication network device <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b</i>, forming its communication network, offered by the respective communication operators. Also, there is provided each additional service providing device <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>offering additional services through the communication networks connected by the respective communication network devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this communication system, a user using the digital processing device <b>100</b> can limitedly access the only communication network devices <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>of the communication operator that the user subscribed to. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, if the user of the digital processing device <b>100</b> subscribes to an A communication operator, the user can access the only communication network device <b>110</b><i>a </i>provided by the A communication operator.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">This is not only because frequency bands different from each other per communication operator are used or signal transmitting methods are different from each other but also because the user can limitedly access the only communication network device of the communication operator that the user subscribes to, by the subscriber identity module included in the digital processing device. However, this description is based on the only case of restricting the communication network device that can be accessed by the subscriber identity module.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The user, who desires to receive the additional service through the digital processing device, can be connected to the communication network device <b>111</b><i>a </i>only after accessing the communication network device <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the communication operator that the user subscribed to and undergoing the authenticating operation by using a subscriber identity module included in the digital processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In case that the digital processing device, for example, the portable terminal employs the AMP (Advanced Mobile phone service)/CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) method, the user must store an electronic serial number (ESN) for communicating with a base station in an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) inside of the portable terminal or couple an external chip or card, stored with the ESN, to the portable terminal, in order to receive the communication service.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Beside that, identity information of a communication service subscriber and a mobile network code (MNC), which is the code of the subscribed communication operator, must be stored to receive the communication service. A subscriber identity module (SIM) refers to the device or the program storing the ESN and the MNC. Accordingly, the user who desires to use the additional service can receive the additional service only after subscribing to a specific communication operator.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Also, the user is permitted to access the only communication network device of the communication operator that the user subscribed to. Thus, the user can receive the additional service provided by the communication operator offering the communication network or provided by the additional service providing device connected to the only communication network device of the communication operator.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The communication network devices of the respective communication operators must be connected to each other in order to receive the additional service from the additional service providing device connected to the only communication network device of another communication operator. The additional service can be provided, only in case that the connection network device <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the communication operator subscribed by the user provides authentication information to the connection network device <b>110</b><i>b </i>of another communication operator.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Accordingly, since the additional service provider is restricted to provide the additional service, the additional service provider is subordinated to the communication operator and is unable to independently provide the additional service to the user of the digital processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Beside that, since the user of the digital processing device is permitted to use the limited additional service provided by the communication operator that the user subscribed to or must undergo an additional authenticating operation, it is limited to use various additional services.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Hereinafter, some embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Identical or corresponding elements will be given the same reference numerals, regardless of the figure number for easy general understanding.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, a digital processing device refers to an electronic device having its compact size enough to make it handy for a user to carry in order to perform a function such as a video game and mobile communication. For example, the digital processing device can include not only a mobile communication terminal, a personal digital assistant (PDA) and a portable multimedia player (PDA) but also a laptop computer having a recent communication function and portability caused by its miniaturization.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, the additional service, which refers to the service accessing a communication network and receiving information such as a video game, music and a broadcasting program, is different from a communication service directly provided by an operator who provides a communication network such as mobile communication and wireless Internet. An additional service provider is called a contents provider (CP) or a service provider (SP).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">First, the configuration of a digital processing device including an additional service identity module in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of a digital processing device <b>200</b> including an additional service identity module in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the digital processing device <b>200</b> can include an input unit <b>210</b>, a display unit <b>220</b>, a transmitting and receiving unit <b>230</b>, a control unit <b>240</b>, a subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> and an additional service identity unit <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The input unit <b>210</b> is means for receiving a control command and a function selecting command, for controlling the operation of the digital processing device. For example, the input unit <b>210</b> is realized as a plurality of key buttons (e.g. a number/character key and a symbol key of &#x2018;*&#x2019; or &#x2018;#&#x2019;) and at least one function key (e.g. a menu key, a confirming key and a key for accessing wireless Internet) or in a form of a touch screen. Specially, the input unit <b>210</b> can be inputted with a command selectively driving the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> and the additional service identity unit <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The display unit <b>220</b> performs the function of displaying video data, image data, character data and number data. For example, the display unit <b>220</b> can be a liquid crystal display (LCD).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The transmitting and receiving unit <b>230</b>, which is connected to the additional service providing device through a communication network device forming the communication network, transmits information (e.g. an additional service providing request command), inputted through the input unit <b>210</b>, to the additional service providing device. Also, the transmitting and receiving unit <b>230</b> can receive and transfer to the control unit <b>240</b>, data (e.g. data of the additional service corresponding to the additional service providing request information) corresponding to information (e.g. additional service providing request information), inputted from the additional service providing device through input unit <b>210</b> and transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The control unit <b>240</b> performs the function controlling each element (e.g. the input unit <b>210</b>, the display unit, the transmitting and receiving unit <b>230</b>, the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> and additional service identity unit <b>260</b>) of the digital processing device <b>200</b>. According to a command, inputted through the input unit <b>210</b>, selecting one of the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> and additional service identity unit <b>260</b>, the control unit <b>240</b> generates a control signal driving selected one.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> and the additional service identity unit <b>260</b> generates a communication network access request message by using a mobile network code included in the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> and the additional service identity unit <b>260</b>, respectively, according to the control signal. The generated communication network access request message is transferred to the transmitting and receiving unit <b>230</b> and is transmitted to the communication network (more particularly, a device forming the communication network).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The subscriber identity unit <b>250</b>, which includes a device or a program, designated as a subscriber identity module, stores the authentication, charging and security information of a communication service subscriber and provides the information to the communication network device. The subscriber identity module also stores a mobile network code (MNC), which is information defining a communication operator. The subscriber identity module can be mounted in a form of a chip inside or outside of the digital processing device <b>200</b> or be installed in a form of a program in the digital processing device <b>200</b>, to be included in the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The additional service identity unit <b>260</b>, which includes a device or a program, designated as a subscriber identity module, stores the authentication, charging and security information of an additional service subscriber and provides the information to the additional service providing server or the additional service providing device. Like the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b>, an additional service identity module also stores a mobile network code (MNC), which is information defining a communication operator. The additional service identity module can be mounted in a form of a chip inside or outside of the digital processing device <b>200</b> or be installed in a form of a program in the digital processing device <b>200</b>, to be included in the additional service identity unit <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one embodiment, the additional service identity module, which is to be identified differently from the subscriber identity module, refers to a program or a device, storing the MNC and authentication information of an additional service provider for providing the additional service.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The subscriber identity module (SIM, or user identity module (UIM)), which is a form of a card capable of being used in the mobile communication terminal or a module capable of being mounted inside thereof, refers to a chip or program storing information such that a variety of information can be provided. The subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> includes and drives the subscriber identity module. The additional service identity unit, similarly to the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b>, also includes and drives the additional service identity module.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A part stored with information is stored in the form of the chip or card outside of the digital processing device. The generation of a request message with use of the actually stored information can be performed by a program pre-stored in the digital processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">For example, in case that the program, storing an only additional service MNC for providing the additional service to the chip, is pre-installed in the digital processing device, it is recognized that the chip stored with the additional service MNC is the additional identity module and the additional service identity unit <b>260</b>, which is the program generating an additional service request message by mounting the additional service identity module, is driven. Accordingly, the subscriber identity unit <b>260</b> and the subscriber identity module are merely recognized according to the realized form.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The subscriber identity module, in the case of receiving a mobile communication service especially through the mobile communication terminal, is to be provided with the mobile communication service through the only mobile communication terminal of each mobile communication operator. The present invention is not limited to the mobile communication terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Through the mobile network code (MNC) included in the subscriber identity module, the communication network device of the communication operator is connected to the only digital processing device that a user subscribed to a specific communication operator by the subscriber identity module</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, if the user using the mobile communication attempts to make a call by using the mobile communication terminal, a communication network access request message is received from the mobile communication terminal including the MNC.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In accordance with the MNC included in the communication network access request message, a communication device of the mobile communication operator recognizes that the terminal making the call is the mobile communication terminal subscribed to its mobile communication service and provides the corresponding call service.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Besides that, the additional service identity module refers to a chip or a program, storing information necessary to provide the services such as the authentication, charging and security information of an additional service subscriber requested to provide the addition service and includes a virtual MNC of the additional service provider providing the additional service.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In this description, the term, virtual MNC, is used to be distinguished from the MNC included in the subscriber identity module. However, the virtual MNC does not necessarily consist of only numbers indicating a specific phone number like the MNC included in the subscriber identity module.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Accordingly, in case that the additional service can be connected to a specific phone number and be received, the virtual MNC indicates the number (e.g. 700-000) referring to the operator providing the additional service. In case that the additional service can be provided by a specific web server, the virtual MNC can indicate the uniform resource locator (URL) or IP address of the web server.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Meanwhile, the additional service identity unit <b>260</b> can be mounted inside of the digital processing device <b>200</b>, and the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> can mounted outside of the digital processing device <b>200</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Particularly, in case that the communication network is the mobile communication network of the WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) or GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) method, it is employed as the standard to allow the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> to be mounted in the form of the card in the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Accordingly, in case that the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b>, mounted in the outside, is inserted into the digital processing device, the mobile communication service is received by using the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b>.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The difference between the communication system in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention and the typical communication system will be described with reference to these elements of the communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">First, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the case of receiving the additional service through the digital processing device <b>100</b>, the communication network devices <b>110</b> and <b>110</b><i>b</i>, which is connectable to the digital processing device <b>100</b>, are limited to the communication network device (e.g. <b>110</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the communication operator that a user subscribed to.</p>

<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The digital processing device <b>200</b> including the additional service identity module according to one embodiment of the present invention can structure the additional service identity module by including the virtual MNC of the additional service provider, to thereby be capable of receiving various additional services without the subscription to the communication service of a specific communication operator. Accordingly, the additional service provider can provide the additional service to the user of the digital processing device independently of the communication operator.

<p id="p-0144" num="0143">As described above, the additional service identity module <b>300</b> can be mounted inside of the digital processing device <b>200</b>, and the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> can be mounted outside of the digital processing device <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In this case, the order of identifying the additional service identity module <b>300</b> and the subscriber identity unit <b>250</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Since the additional service identity module is mounted in the inside in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the additional service identity module is called an inside-mounted subscriber identity module (SIM) or a default SIM.

<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, first, it is identified that the outside-SIM is inserted into and is connected to the digital processing device <b>200</b> in a step represented by S<b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The connection of the outside-mounted SIM can be identified by transferring an interrupt signal, provided from an outside SIM connection unit by the connection of the outside-mounted SIM, to the control unit of the digital processing device <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">If the connection of the outside-mounted SIM is not identified, information (e.g. authentication information, security information and charging information) necessary to access the communication network is read from the built-in default SIM in a step represented by S<b>802</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0152">By further including the built-in default SIM in the digital processing device <b>200</b> that can use the communication method based on the output-mounted SIM as the standard (e.g. WCDMA), the user can omit the troublesome process connecting the SIM one by one whenever the device receiving the communication service is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">By further including the charging information in the SIM, even though the mobile communication operators are different from each other, the communication network device of each mobile communication operator can communicate with the digital processing device <b>200</b> of the user though the default SIM and recognize location information of the user's digital processing device <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Accordingly, although the user does not subscribe to the communication service of a specific communication operator, the user can receive various communication services, for example, special services, regardless of the subscription to the communication service, such as an emergency service and a lost article finding service.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">According to at least one embodiment of the present invention, a user of the digital processing device can receive an additional service without his or her subscription to a specific communication operator.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Since it is possible that the user of the digital processing device receives the additional service without the subscription to the specific communication operator, an additional service provider is able to independently provide the additional service to the user.</p>
