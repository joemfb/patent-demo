<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0082296, filed on Aug. 18, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a transparent display device using a bistable mode of a cholesteric liquid crystal as a drive mode of a reflector, and a driving method of the transparent display device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Flat panel display technology started with the development of liquid crystal display (LCD). With the marvelous advances in technology, flat panel display technology has been applied to most display fields ranging from small-sized mobile devices to notebook computers, monitors, televisions (TVs), and other large-sized display devices. In recent years, transparent display devices are increasingly becoming attractive because they can display information and background at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A transparent display device includes a high-transmittance screen to make a back surface of the screen visible. Generally, a transparent display device includes a backlight unit, a light guide plate, a liquid crystal panel, and a color filter. Technologies for transparent display devices are disclosed in Korean Patent Registration No. 10-0962109 entitled &#x201c;REFLECTIVE PLATE, BACKLIGHT UNIT AND LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY INCLUDING THE SAME&#x201d;, Korean Patent Public No. 10-2011-0014904 entitled &#x201c;TRANSPARENT DISPLAY DEVICE&#x201d;, and Japanese Patent Publication No. 2004-333999 entitled &#x201c;REFLECTION-TYPE LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The transparent display devices disclosed in the above t documents require relatively high power consumption. On the other hand, low reflectivity in a reflective mode of a transparent display device makes it difficult to implement high resolution. Accordingly, there is a demand for a transparent display technology having high power efficiency in a transparent mode and providing high reflectivity in a reflective mode.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a transparent display device and a driving method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention discloses a transparent display device which may include a light guide plate transmitting incident light impinging from its exterior or its back surface and reflecting backlight light impinging from its side surface to its front surface; and an active reflector disposed on the back surface of the light guide plate and including a cholesteric liquid crystal layer transmitting the incident light in a planar phase in a transparent mode.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention also discloses a driving method of a transparent display device using a cholesteric liquid crystal layer as an active reflector which may include detecting a display mode; and providing, to the active reflector, a phase change pulse for changing a phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal layer to any one of a focal conic phase and a planar phase according to the display mode. The cholesteric liquid crystal layer may operate as a transparent mode in the planar mode.</p>

It will be understood that for the purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;at least one of X, Y, and Z&#x201d; can be construed as X only, Y only, Z only, or any combination of two or more items X, Y, and Z (e.g., XYZ, XYY, YZ, ZZ)</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view of a transparent display device <b>100</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, the transparent display device <b>100</b> includes a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel <b>110</b>, a light guide plate (LGP) <b>120</b>, an active reflector <b>130</b>, a reflector driver <b>140</b>, and a backlight light source <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The LCD panel <b>110</b> may include, for example, a thin film transistor LCD (TFT-LCD). Although not shown, the LCD panel <b>110</b> may include a first substrate including a thin film transistor (not shown) and a pixel electrode electrically connected to the thin film transistor, black matrixes arranged at regular intervals to block light impinging from a light source, and a color filter pattern disposed between the black matrixes. In addition, the LCD panel <b>110</b> may include a second substrate including an overcoat film disposed on the color filter pattern. A liquid crystal layer inserted between the first substrate and the second substrate may be included in the LCD panel <b>110</b>. However, the LCD panel <b>110</b> may adapt at least one of various display devices which are configurable with a transparent display.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The light guide plate <b>120</b> scatters incident light impinging from the backlight light source <b>150</b> in a reflective mode. Thus, a uniform surface light source is shown when viewed in front of the transparent display device <b>100</b>. Although not shown, a plurality of patterns (e.g., concave patterns) may be formed on a back surface of the light guide plate <b>120</b>. The patterns scatter the incident light from the light source <b>150</b> to generate a uniform surface light source. However, the light guide plate <b>120</b> transmits lights impinging from a back surface of the transparent display device <b>100</b>. In a transparent mode, an image may be displayed by transmitted light impinging from the back surface of the light guide plate <b>120</b> or ambient light.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The active reflector <b>130</b> operates in a transparent mode or a reflective mode according to a display mode. The active reflector <b>130</b> includes at least two transparent electrodes and a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) layer disposed between the transparent electrodes. The cholesteric liquid crystal layer is set to have transmission and reflection characteristics according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. That is, the cholesteric liquid crystal layer operates in a transparent mode in a planar phase and in a reflective mode in a focal conic phase through adjustment of pitches of liquid crystal pixels. The planar phase and the focal conic phase correspond to a bistable mode of a cholesteric liquid crystal. Therefore, if a pulse is applied at least once without continuing to apply a voltage to transparent electrodes, the cholesteric liquid crystal layer shifts to a phase corresponding to the bistable mode. A phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal layer, which corresponds to the bistable mode formed once, is continued even under the condition that an additional voltage is not applied. These characteristic of the cholesteric liquid crystal will be described in detail later with reference to accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal layer may shift to any one of a homeotropic phase and focal conic and planar phases that are bistable states. The homeotropic phase is a state in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned in a direction perpendicular to a transparent electrode surface. The homeotropic phase is generated when a strong electric field is applied to the cholesteric liquid crystal layer. The planar phase is a state in which a helical axis of a cholesteric liquid crystal cell is arranged in a direction perpendicular to the transparent electrode surface. The focal conic phase is a state in which helical axes of cholesteric liquid crystal cells are arranged in random directions in relation to the transparent electrode surface.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the transparent display device described thus far, the active reflector <b>130</b> includes a cholesteric liquid crystal layer using a planar phase as a transparent mode. In addition, a focal conic phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal layer is used as a reflective mode of the transparent display device. The planar phase and the focal conic phase correspond to a bistable mode of a cholesteric liquid crystal. Thus, transition to the transparent mode or the reflective mode may be done by applying a pulse without continuing to supply a voltage. The bistable mode formed once may be maintained before a separate voltage is applied. Thus, it will be expected that power efficiency will increase in the transparent display device <b>100</b> adopting the active reflector <b>130</b> according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In addition, high reflectivity in a focal conic phase may be provided through adjustment of a cell pitch of the cholesteric liquid crystal.

As described above, the pitch p<sub>0 </sub>of a liquid crystal cell may be adjusted by using Chiral dopant. Thus, it will be understood that the cholesteric liquid crystal is used as a transparent mode in the planar phase through the adjustment of the pitch p<sub>0 </sub>of the liquid crystal cell.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graphic diagram illustrating transmission characteristics for an applied voltage of a cholesteric liquid crystal according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, transmittance of a long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal for a voltage applied to a transparent electrode is shown. The term &#x2018;long pitch&#x2019; means that a pitch p<sub>0 </sub>of a cholesteric liquid crystal cell is greater than 500 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the voltage applied to the transparent electrode is less than about 5 volt, the cholesteric liquid crystal is maintained at the planar phase. The transmittance of the cholesteric liquid crystal in the planar phase may be maintained at a size of about 12 arbitrary units.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">On the other hand, when a voltage applied to the transparent electrode is within the range from about 5 volts to about 14 volts, the cholesteric liquid crystal transitions to a focal conic phase. The transmittance characteristic of the cholesteric liquid crystal is transformed into a U shape as the voltage increases within a range from about 5 volts to about 14 volts. When a voltage of about 10 volts is applied to the transparent electrode, the transmittance of the cholesteric liquid crystal decreases to about 8 arbitrary units.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When a voltage of about 14 volts or higher is applied to the transparent electrode, the cholesteric liquid crystal transitions from a focal conic phase to a homeotropic phase. The transmittance of the cholesteric liquid crystal returns to about 12 arbitrary units in the homeotropic phase.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The transmission characteristics of a long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal according to the present invention have been described above. According to the long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal, there is substantially no difference between the transmittance in the planar phase and the transmittance in the homeotropic phase. A high voltage should be continuously applied to the transparent electrode to maintain the homeotropic phase. However, the planar phase and the focal conic phase are continuously maintained even when the applied voltage is cut off after a pulse is provided only once, i.e., a bistable state. Thus, the planar phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal may be used as a transparent mode of an active reflector (<b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the focal conic phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal may be used as a reflective mode thereof. Since continuously applying a voltage to the transparent electrode is not required in the transparent mode or the reflective mode, it is expected that power consumption of the transparent display device adopting the active reflector <b>130</b> will be reduced, according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graphic diagram illustrating other transmission characteristics for a wavelength of an incident light of the cholesteric liquid crystal according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a curve &#x201c;A&#x201d; stands for a transmission characteristic in a planar phase of a long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal and a curve &#x201c;B&#x201d; stands for a transmission characteristic of a cholesteric liquid crystal of a general cell pitch. These transmission characteristics will now be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The transmission characteristic for incident light of a long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal may be represented by the curve &#x201c;A&#x201d;. It is assumed that a long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention has a cell pitch p<sub>0 </sub>of about 611.8 nm. A selectively reflected wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>0 </sub>of the long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal in the planar phase becomes a wavelength band of about 1000 nm according to the foregoing equation 1. As illustrated, the transmittance of the long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal in a visible region is maintained at a high transmittance of 70 percent or greater. The transmittance gradually decreases in an infrared region and becomes a minimum with respect to incident light having a wavelength of about 1000 nm. Thus, it will be understood that the planar phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal having a cell pitch p<sub>0 </sub>of about 611.8 nm may be sufficiently used as a transparent mode of an active reflector.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">On the other hand, the transmission characteristic of a cholesteric liquid crystal using the planar phase as a reflective mode is represented by the curve &#x201c;B&#x201d;. In this case, the cholesteric liquid crystal cell has a cell pitch of about 334 nm. A selectively reflected wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>0 </sub>of the cholesteric liquid crystal in the planar phase becomes a wavelength band of about 550 nm according to the foregoing equation 1. As illustrated by the curve &#x201c;B&#x201d;, the transmittance of the cholesteric liquid crystal in the visible region is remarkably lower than that represented by the curve &#x201c;A&#x201d;. The minimum transmittance of about 40 percent is exhibited with respect to incident light having a wavelength of about 550 nm. Thus, it will be understood that the planar phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal having a cell pitch p0 of about 335.4 nm has a relatively poor transmittance characteristic with respect to visible light.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It has been described with reference to the figures above that a planar phase of a long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal may be used as a transparent mode of an active reflector (<b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). However, a cell pitch p<sub>0 </sub>need not be long in order to provide high transmittance with respect to a visible region in a planar phase. The cell pitch p<sub>0 </sub>may be remarkably reduced such that a selectively reflected wavelength in the planar phase is adjusted to be disposed within the infrared region. Even under this setting, high transmittance may still be maintained in the visible region in the planar phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal.</p>

In case of a long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal, the planar phase <b>310</b> is used to a transparent mode for transmitting visible light. When a strong electric field is applied to a cholesteric liquid crystal having the planar phase <b>310</b>, phase transition occurs. A reset voltage V<sub>RST</sub>, which is a high voltage, may be supplied to a transparent electrode to apply the strong electric field to the cholesteric liquid crystal. When the high voltage is applied to the transparent electrode, a phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal transitions from the planar phase <b>310</b> to the homeotropic phase <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The homeotropic phase <b>320</b> is a phase where axes of liquid crystal molecules are arranged parallel to an electric field. A strong, continuous electric field may be applied to constantly maintain the orientation of axes of polarized liquid crystal molecules. Thus, if the electric field disappears, the phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal transitions from the homeotropic phase <b>320</b> to the planar phase <b>310</b>. On the other hand, a middle voltage V<sub>M </sub>relatively lower than the reset voltage V<sub>RST </sub>is supplied to change the phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal from the homeotropic phase <b>320</b> to the focal conic phase <b>330</b>.</p>

However, the phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal transitions to the homeotropic phase <b>320</b> when the reset voltage V<sub>RST </sub>is applied in the focal conic phase <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Display mode conversion between a transparent mode and a reflective mode may be accomplished through phase transition between the planar phase <b>310</b> and the focal conic phase <b>330</b> of the cholesteric liquid crystal.

After the reset voltage V<sub>RST </sub>is applied to transparent electrodes disposed at both ends of the cholesteric liquid crystal, the middle voltage V<sub>M </sub>is applied to perform the phase transition from the planar phase <b>310</b> to the focal conic phase <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">On the other hand, after the reset voltage V<sub>RST </sub>is applied to the transparent electrodes disposed at both ends of the cholesteric liquid crystal, a voltage of 0 volt is applied to perform the phase transition from the focal conic phase <b>330</b> to the planar phase <b>310</b>.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a reflector driver (<b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) controls an active reflector (<b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) according to a display mode. This will be described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At S<b>110</b>, the reflector driver <b>140</b> receives a display mode Dis_mode. The display mode Dis_mode may be received from an upper controller (not shown) for controlling a transparent display device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">At S<b>120</b>, an operation branch occurs according to the received display mode Dis_mode. When the display mode Dis_mode is a transparent mode, the flow proceeds to S<b>130</b>. On the other hand, when the display mode Dis_mode is a reflective mode, the flow proceeds to S<b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At S<b>130</b>, the reflector driver <b>140</b> generates a pulse for changing a phase of a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) from a focal conic phase to a planar phase. For example, a reset voltage (V<sub>RST</sub>) pulse of the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> may be generated. The generated pulse may be applied to transparent electrodes disposed at both sides of the cholesteric liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At S<b>140</b>, the reflector driver <b>140</b> generates a pulse for changing the phase of the cholesteric liquid crystal CLC from the planar phase to the focal conic phase. For example, high-voltage bipolar pulses &#xb1;V<sub>RST </sub>of the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and subsequent middle-voltage pulses &#xb1;<sub>M </sub>may be generated. In some cases, the bipolar pulses &#xb1;V<sub>RST </sub>and &#xb1;V<sub>M </sub>may be generated twice or more. The generated pulse may be applied to the transparent electrodes disposed at both sides of the cholesteric liquid crystal. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the case where the display mode signal Dis_mode is received only when the display mode is to be changed, other variations are possible. For example, the display mode signal Dis_mode may be constantly received, and the display mode may switch from transparent to reflective only when the display mode signal Dis_mode indicates the switch.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> are graphic diagrams illustrating reflection characteristics in a planar phase of a pitch-adjusted cholesteric liquid crystal according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates reflection characteristics for a wavelength of incident light of a long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates reflection characteristics of a wavelength of incident light of a short-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal. The long-pitch liquid crystal includes a liquid crystal cell whose pitch p<sub>0 </sub>is greater than 500 nm, and the short-pitch liquid crystal includes a liquid crystal cell whose pitch p<sub>0 </sub>is less than 250 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, a cholesteric liquid crystal generally has the shape of a curve <b>410</b> in the case where a planar phase is used as a reflective mode. That is, the cholesteric liquid crystal exhibits the maximum reflectivity in a visible region when using the planar phase as a reflective mode. However, if a long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal is formed by adjusting a cell pitch, the maximum reflectivity in the planar phase is exhibited in an infrared region. This characteristic is shown by the curve <b>420</b>. That is, it will be understood that the transmission characteristics of visible light are sufficiently improved in the planar phase of the long-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal to use the planar phase as the transparent mode.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows the case where a cell pitch of a cholesteric liquid crystal is reduced. It will be understood that transmission characteristics in the visible region are improved in a planar phase of the short-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal. The cholesteric liquid crystal generally has the shape of the curve <b>410</b> in the case where the planar phase is used as the reflective mode. That is, the maximum reflectivity is exhibited in the visible region when using the planar phase as the reflective mode. However, if a short-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal is formed by reducing a cell pitch, the maximum reflectivity in the planar phase is exhibited in an ultraviolet region. This characteristic is shown by a curve <b>430</b>. That is, it will be understood that the transmission characteristics of visible light are sufficiently improved in the planar mode of the short-pitch cholesteric liquid crystal to use the planar phase as the transparent mode.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, it will be understood that light transmission/reflection characteristics may be controlled by adjusting a pitch of a liquid crystal cell.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">According to the present invention as described above, since a transparent mode and a reflective mode are implemented in a bistable mode of a liquid crystal, high power efficiency can be provided. Moreover, since superior transmission characteristics for a visible region may be provided by adjusting pitches of liquid crystal cells, a high-definition transparent display device can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
