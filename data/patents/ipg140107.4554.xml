<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A passive optical network (PON) is one system for providing network access over &#x201c;the last mile.&#x201d; The PON is a point-to-multi-point (P2MP) network comprised of an optical line terminal (OLT) at the central office, an optical distribution network (ODN), and a plurality of optical network units (ONUs) at the customer premises. In some PON systems, such as Gigabit PON (GPON) systems, downstream data is broadcasted at about 2.5 Gigabits per second (Gbps) while upstream data is transmitted at about 1.25 Gbps. Other PON systems, such as ten Gigabit PON (XGPON) systems, may have a downstream bandwidth of about ten Gbps and an upstream bandwidth of at least about 2.5 Gbps. Further, some PON systems, such as Ethernet PON (EPON) systems, may support Ethernet technology.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology is a high-bandwidth and/or high-speed data transmission technology implemented using twisted pair wires, e.g. unshielded twisted pairs to provide bandwidth for digital communications over existing subscriber lines. For example, DSL technologies include Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), ADSL Version 2 (ADSL2), ADSL2 plus (ADSL+), Very-high-bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL), and VDSL Version 2 (VDSL2). DSL may deliver high-speed data services from a distribution center, or central office (CO), to a plurality of customer premise equipments (CPEs).</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It should be understood at the outset that although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below, the disclosed systems and/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Systems based on DSL and PON technologies are attractive candidates for mobile backhaul due to their availability, relatively high bandwidth, and low cost. In these systems, data are exchanged between a distribution or AN and a customer premise node. Combining these technologies with microcells and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) base stations may extend a mobile network, which may protect investments in the &#x201c;last-mile&#x201d; network and provide a cost-effective cellular backhaul to support third generation (3G) or fourth generation (4G) systems.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Mobile backhaul systems require frequency and time synchronization with sub-microsecond precision. Synchronization methods such as the PTP defined in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1588-2008 standard, which is incorporated herein by reference, have been designed to distribute Time of Day (ToD) data and hence synchronize clocks across packet transport networks. A boundary clock (BC) scheme may maintain the time scale used in a domain based on multiple PTP ports in the domain. A TC scheme is a domain independent mechanism designed to synchronize nodes across the network and provide corrections for a residence time across network components, such as bridges, routers, or repeaters. A residence time across network components is the transit time of a data packet through the network components. A residence time for a particular network component is a transit time of a data packet entering and exiting the particular network component. The TC is configured to measure the time taken for a PTP event message to transit a device or network component and provide this information to clocks receiving the PTP event message. However, the AN and the customer premise node in PON and DSL systems are not geographically co-located, which may pose a challenge for implementing a TC scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Disclosed herein is a system and method for implementing a TC scheme between nodes in mobile backhaul networks, such as PON and DSL systems. The TC scheme may enable PON and DSL network components or devices to support PTP in compliance with IEEE 1588-2008 standard. Specifically, the transit time of a PTP event message across a device may be measured and forwarded to a plurality of clocks receiving the PTP event message. A first PTP engine at an upper layer at a first node, e.g., an AN, may trigger the first node to create a first timestamp using a local clock upon receiving a PTP event message. This timestamp may be transmitted to a second node, e.g., a customer premise node. Upon receiving the PTP event message, a second PTP engine at an upper layer at of the second node may trigger the second node to create a second timestamp using a local clock. Upon receiving the first and second timestamp, the second node may then report the residence time between the two timestamps and update a PTP packet header with the residence time.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first and second nodes may be any devices that forward packets within a packet transport network. The nodes may be the originator or final recipient of the packets or may be nodes that forward received packets to other nodes. The nodes may have different properties, such as physical structure, capacity, and/or transmission speed. The first node may correspond to an AN, and the second node may correspond to a customer premise node, for instance, in a PON system or a DSL system. In embodiments of PON systems, the AN may be an OLT and the customer premise node may be an ONU.

The PON <b>100</b> may be a communications network that does not require any active components to distribute data between the OLT <b>110</b> and the ONUs <b>120</b>. Instead, the PON <b>100</b> may use the passive optical components in the ODN <b>130</b> to distribute data between the OLT <b>110</b> and the ONUs <b>120</b>. In an embodiment, the PON <b>100</b> may be a Next Generation Access (NGA) system, such as a XGPON system, which may have a downstream bandwidth of about ten Gbps and an upstream bandwidth of at least about 2.5 Gbps.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, the OLT <b>110</b> may be any device that is configured to communicate with the ONUs <b>120</b> and another network (not shown). Specifically, the OLT <b>110</b> may serve as an AN that acts as an intermediary between the other network and the ONUs <b>120</b>. For instance, the OLT <b>110</b> may forward data received from the network to the ONUs <b>120</b>, and forward data received from the ONUs <b>120</b> onto the other network. Although the specific configuration of the OLT <b>110</b> may vary depending on the type of PON <b>100</b>, in an embodiment, the OLT <b>110</b> may comprise a transmitter and a receiver.

For instance, the ONUs <b>120</b> may forward data received from the OLT <b>110</b> to the customer, and forward data received from the customer onto the OLT <b>110</b>. Although the specific configuration of the ONUs <b>120</b> may vary depending on the type of PON <b>100</b>, in an embodiment, the ONUs <b>120</b> may comprise an optical transmitter configured to send optical signals to the OLT <b>110</b> and an optical receiver configured to receive optical signals from the OLT <b>110</b>. Additionally, the ONUs <b>120</b> may comprise a converter that converts the optical signal into electrical signals for the customer, such as signals in the Ethernet or asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) protocol, and a second transmitter and/or receiver that may send and/or receive the electrical signals to a customer device. In some embodiments, ONUs <b>120</b> and optical network terminals (ONTs) are similar, and thus the terms are used interchangeably herein. The ONUs may be typically located at distributed locations, such as the customer premises, but may be located at other locations as well.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Another component of the PON <b>100</b> may be the ODN <b>130</b>.

In an embodiment, the optical fiber cables, couplers, splitters, distributors, and/or other equipment are passive optical components. Specifically, the optical fiber cables, couplers, splitters, distributors, and/or other equipment may be components that do not require any power to distribute data signals between the OLT <b>110</b> and the ONUs <b>120</b>. The ODN <b>130</b> typically extends from the OLT <b>110</b> to the ONUs <b>120</b> in a branching configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but may be alternatively configured in any other configuration.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Nodes within a packet transport network, e.g., the PON <b>100</b> and/or the DSL system <b>200</b> may have to synchronize their clocks with the clocks in other nodes within the network. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a diagram of a TC synchronization scheme <b>300</b>. In the TC synchronization scheme <b>300</b>, packet timestamps may be used to achieve time network synchronization between two nodes, e.g., absolute time synchronization. The TC synchronization scheme <b>300</b> may comprise an AN <b>302</b>, a first PTP engine <b>304</b>, a customer premise node <b>306</b>, a second PTP engine <b>308</b>, a first interface <b>310</b>, a second interface <b>312</b>, a first timestamp module <b>332</b> and a second timestamp module <b>334</b>. The components of the TC synchronization scheme <b>300</b> may be arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The AN <b>302</b> may comprise a local clock that may be synchronized to a Master Clock of the network. The AN <b>302</b> and the customer premise node <b>306</b> may be coupled to a communication link (not shown) via the first interface (i.e., a network facing interface) <b>310</b> and the second interface (i.e., a customer side facing interface) <b>312</b> which may be port-facing interfaces. The first interface <b>310</b> may be located at a determined point facing an ingress port in the AN <b>302</b> and the second interface <b>312</b> may be located at a determined point facing an egress port in the customer premise node <b>306</b>. Specifically, the first interface <b>310</b> may be coupled to the network and the second interface <b>312</b> may be coupled to a customer node or device.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Initially, the AN <b>302</b> may transmit a PTP event message <b>322</b> to the customer premise node <b>306</b>. When the PTP event message <b>322</b> transverses or crosses the first interface <b>310</b>, the first PTP engine <b>304</b> may trigger the first timestamp module <b>332</b> in the AN <b>302</b> to create a first timestamp, T<b>1</b>, based on the local clock of the AN <b>302</b> and transmit T<b>1</b> to the customer premise node <b>306</b>. In an embodiment, T<b>1</b> may be transmitted in an Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) message. In another embodiment, T<b>1</b> may be transmitted via an in-band mechanism. When the PTP event message <b>322</b> reaches the customer premise node <b>306</b> and crosses the second interface <b>312</b>, the second PTP engine <b>308</b> may trigger the second timestamp module <b>334</b> in the customer premise node <b>306</b> to create a second timestamp, T<b>2</b>, using the local clock of the customer premise node <b>306</b>, which may also be synchronized to the Master Clock of the network. The customer premise node <b>306</b> may receive T<b>1</b> and compute a residence time based on T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b>.

After receiving the PTP packet <b>322</b> and computing the residence time, the customer premise node <b>306</b> may add or update a correction field in a PTP packet header in the PTP event message <b>322</b>. The updated PTP event message <b>322</b> may then be forwarded or used for achieving time synchronization in the network based on the TC scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, the TC synchronization scheme <b>300</b> may be implemented in a PON, such as the PON <b>100</b>.

The method <b>400</b> may begin at block <b>410</b>, where a first timestamp, (e.g., T<b>1</b>), may be received. The first timestamp may be received from an AN, e.g., the OLT <b>110</b> or the Exchange <b>202</b>. The first timestamp may be created based on a local clock of the AN, after receiving a trigger from an upper network layer at the AN, e.g., a PTP engine, to indicate that a PTP event message, e.g., the PTP event message <b>322</b>, has crossed a network facing interface, e.g., the first interface <b>310</b>. At block <b>420</b>, the first timestamp may be recorded, e.g., in a local memory coupled to the costumer node. At block <b>430</b>, the costumer node may receive a trigger from an upper network layer at the customer node, e.g., a PTP engine. The trigger may be received from the upper network layer to indicate that the PTP event message has crossed a customer facing interface, e.g., the second interface <b>312</b>.
