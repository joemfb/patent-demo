<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to a gas turbine engine, and more specifically to a turbine blade with platform cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a gas turbine engine, such as a large frame heavy-duty industrial gas turbine (IGT) engine, a hot gas stream generated in a combustor is passed through a turbine to produce mechanical work. The turbine includes one or more rows or stages of stator vanes and rotor blades that react with the hot gas stream in a progressively decreasing temperature. The efficiency of the turbine&#x2014;and therefore the engine&#x2014;can be increased by passing a higher temperature gas stream into the turbine. However, the turbine inlet temperature is limited to the material properties of the turbine, especially the first stage vanes and blades, and an amount of cooling capability for these first stage airfoils.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first stage rotor blade and stator vanes are exposed to the highest gas stream temperatures, with the temperature gradually decreasing as the gas stream passes through the turbine stages. The first and second stage airfoils (blades and vanes) must be cooled by passing cooling air through internal cooling passages and discharging the cooling air through film cooling holes to provide a blanket layer of cooling air to protect the hot metal surface from the hot gas stream.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Prior art turbine rotor blades provide cooling for the platform using several methods. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show film cooling holes <b>13</b> that open onto the hot surface of the platform <b>11</b> on a pressure side of the airfoil <b>12</b> supplied with cooling air from the dead rim cavity located below the platform. Film cooling holes supplied from the dead rim cavity requires a higher dead rim cavity pressure than the platform external hot gas pressure. The higher pressure in the dead rim cavity induces a high leakage flow around the blade attachment region and therefore causes engine performance to decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> shows another method for cooling blade platforms that uses cooling channels <b>14</b> with a long length to diameter ratio to provide convection cooling of the platform hot surface. These long cooling channels are drilled into the platform from the edge side and into the airfoil cooling core. Drilling the convection cooling holes produces unacceptable stress levels and yields a low blade life. This shortened blade life is primarily due to the large mass at the front and back end of the blade attachment which constrains the blade platform edge expansion. The cooling channels are oriented transverse to the primary direction of the stress field so that high stress concentrations associated with the cooling channels are formed at the entrance and exit locations.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A turbine rotor disk with rotor blades secured within slots of the rotor disk, and the rotor disk includes a radial extension that occupies a space where a dead rim cavity would be formed. The radial extension includes a cooling air chamber with impingement cooling holes that are directed to produce impingement cooling to the blade platforms.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The cooling air chamber is supplied from a cooling air passage with both the chamber and the passage being formed on one side of the rotor disk and enclosed by a cover plate secured to that side of the rotor disk.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a prior art turbine blade with platform cooling produced using the long length to diameter ratio cooling channels. The suction side includes a long channel <b>21</b> that branches off into smaller channels <b>22</b> to provide cooling for the suction side surface of the platform. The pressure side includes several long channels <b>23</b> each supplied from an inlet connected to the dead rim cavity. The applicant has identified a hot spot <b>25</b> that results in the cooling channels of the prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> blade. The straight cooling channels in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> blade are not able to provide cooling for this hot spot area <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To provide better cooling for the blade platform and to eliminate the hot spot identified by the applicant, the blade rotor disk is formed with an extension that forms an impingement cooling chamber that discharges impingement cooling air to the backside surface of the platform. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows this design and includes a turbine rotor disk <b>33</b> formed with a live rim cavity <b>26</b> for each turbine rotor blade <b>12</b>. The rotor disk <b>33</b> is formed with a radial extension <b>36</b> that includes a cooling air chamber <b>28</b> formed underneath the platforms <b>11</b> of the blades <b>12</b>. The radial extension <b>36</b> will occupy the previous formed dead rim cavity of the rotor disk design. Impingement cooling holes <b>29</b> connect to the cooling air chamber <b>28</b> and discharge impingement cooling air to the backside of the platforms <b>11</b>. A cooling air supply hole <b>27</b> supplies cooling air to the cooling air chamber <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a side view of the platform cooling circuit of the present invention. The rotor disk <b>33</b> includes the radial extension with the cooling air chamber <b>28</b> that opens onto one of the two sides of the rotor disk. In this embodiment, the cooling air chamber <b>28</b> opens onto the front side and is enclosed by a front cover plate <b>34</b>. The cooling air supply channel <b>27</b> is formed on the same side of the rotor disk and is also enclosed by the cover plate <b>34</b>. An aft cover plate <b>35</b> is secured onto the aft side of the rotor disk <b>33</b>. the arrangement of impingement cooling holes <b>28</b> connect to the cooling air chamber <b>28</b> and direct impingement cooling air to the backside of the platforms <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In operation, cooling air supplied to the turbine rotor disk will flow into the live rim cavities <b>26</b> and through the blade cooling channel <b>32</b> to provide cooling for the interior of the blade <b>12</b>. Cooling air is also supplied to the cooling air supply channel <b>27</b> and flows into the cooling air chamber <b>28</b>, where the cooling air is then discharged through the impingement holes <b>29</b> to provide backside impingement cooling to various areas of the two adjacent platforms <b>11</b>. The spent impingement cooling air then flows through a blade mate face gap <b>31</b> forms between adjacent platforms <b>11</b> to be joined with the hot gas stream passing through the blades. This produces purge air to prevent hot gas ingestion below the platforms <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As a result of the platform cooling circuit of the present invention, the hot spot formed on the prior art blade platform is eliminated. Also, both the blade platform and the rotor disk are cooled using the same cooling air which doubles the use of the cooling air. Because the rotor disk is also cooled, the rotor disk can be formed from a lower cost material than in the prior art.</p>
