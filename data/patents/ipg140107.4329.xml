No. 8,315,142, which is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/905,407 filed on Sep. 28, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,111,603 and claims priority from Japanese application JP 2006-266353 filed on Sep. 29, 2006, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to control of laser waveform upon reproduction of information in an optical disk apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an optical disk apparatus using a laser beam emitted from a laser diode to read information of mark and space recorded in an optical disk, it is important to decide binary information of mark and space without error. However, there is a problem that noise such as mode hop noise and return light noise is produced in the laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a method of reducing such noise, JP-A-2000-149302 discloses a method named high-frequency superposition. Further, as a method of controlling the laser power upon reproduction, JP-A-2005-216395 discloses a method named automatic power control (APC).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, optical disks having different standards such as CD, DVD, Blu-Ray disc (hereinafter abbreviated to BD) and HD-DVD are taken to the market. These optical disks are not compatible with one another, although optical disk apparatuses dealing with recording and reproduction for CD, DVD and BD and optical disk apparatuses dealing with recording and reproduction for CD, DVD and HD-DVD are taken to the market in consideration of user's convenience. However, an optical disk apparatus dealing with recording and reproduction of both of BD and HD-DVD is not taken to the market yet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is considered as a cause of the reason that there are different points on the standards between the optical disks conforming to the BD standards (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;optical disks 1&#x201d;) and the optical disks conforming to the HD-DVD standards (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;optical disks 2&#x201d;) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The relation of the wavelength of the laser beam (405 nm for both of BD and HD-DVD) and the numerical aperture of lens (0.85 for BD and 0.65 for HD-DVD) prescribed in the standards is considered as being particularly a problem among them.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the wavelength of the laser beam is &#x3bb; and the numerical aperture of lens is NA, it is known that a spot diameter of the laser beam on the optical disk is proportional to:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(&#x3bb;/NA)&#x2003;&#x2003;(expression 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
and a spot area on the optical disk of the laser beam is proportional to:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(&#x3bb;/NA)<sup>2</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;(expression 2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
That is, the spot areas on the optical disk are different between the BD standards and the HD-DVD standards. The reproduction laser power values for the BD standards and the HD-DVD standards are made different to be 0.3 mW and 0.5 mW, respectively, so that the power of the laser beam per unit area is made substantially equal.
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the characteristics (amplitude and frequency) of the high-frequency signal superposed in order to reduce noise of the laser beam are fixed, satisfactory reproduction can be made for one optical disks, although there arises a problem that satisfactory reproduction cannot be made for the other optical disks and more particularly there arises a problem that data recorded on the optical disk is destroyed.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The problem is solved by the present invention described in Claims.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, erasure of recorded data or destruction of the information recording layer caused by irradiating the information recording surface of the optical disk with excessive laser power upon information reproduction can be prevented for two kinds of optical disks having the same laser wavelength for use in reproduction and the different numerical apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The causes for the above problem are now examined in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the optical disks having the standards that the wavelengths of the laser beam are the same and the numerical apertures of lens are different as the relation of the BD standards and the HD-DVD standards are defined as an optical disk 1 and an optical disk 2, respectively, and the relation of the numerical apertures of lens NA<sub>1 </sub>and NA<sub>2 </sub>is NA<sub>1</sub>&#x3e;NA<sub>2</sub>, the relations of the spot areas S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2 </sub>of the laser beam on the optical disks and the reproduction laser powers P<sub>1 </sub>and P<sub>2 </sub>are given by the following two expressions:

</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There is considered an optical disk apparatus which can make reproduction for both the optical disks 1 and 2.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It will be understood from the expression 4 that the reproduction laser power is required to be changed when the optical disk 1 is reproduced and when the optical disk 2 is reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">At this time, when a high-frequency signal having a preferable amplitude for the optical disk 2 is superposed in reproduction of the rewritable optical disk 1, there is a possibility that the irradiation energy per unit area reaches the erasure power of the optical disk 1, so that recorded data is erased. In other words, although the amplitude set value of the high-frequency signal does not cause the problem for a larger spot area S<sub>2 </sub>on the optical disk 2, the problem is caused for the smaller spot area S<sub>1 </sub>on the optical disk 1.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The cause is considered that energy per unit area given by the reproduction laser power P<sub>1 </sub>and the peak power of the high-frequency signal superposed thereon is equal to energy per unit area given by the erasing laser power for the optical disk 1, so that recorded data is erased. This is considered to be the cause of the above-mentioned problem that the recorded data on the other optical disk is destroyed by irradiation of the excessive laser power.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">On the other hand, when attention is paid to the specific laser, it has been found that the optimum amplitude and frequency of the high-frequency signal superposed in order to reduce laser noise depend on the laser power. That is, it has been found that it is desired to change the amplitude and frequency of the high-frequency signal when the laser power value is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">From the foregoing, when the numerical apertures are different in two kinds of the standards for optical disks using the laser having the same wavelength, that is, when it is necessary to change the reproduction laser power, it has been found that the characteristics (amplitude and frequency) of the high-frequency superposition are also required to be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments for solving the above problems are now described in detail.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since the laser having the same wavelength and an optical pickup having the same optical path length are used for reproduction of the optical disks 1 and 2, it is supposed that the signal selection circuit <b>204</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> selects the output of the OSC2 to be outputted even during the period <b>702</b> that the high-frequency signal is superposed.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the optical spot area for the optical disk 1 is about 0.6 times the optical spot area for the optical disk 2 and accordingly if the optical disk is irradiated with the same laser power, the laser power per unit area of the optical disk 1 is 1/0.6&#x2248;41.7 times as compared with the optical disk 2. Since the reproduction laser power C<b>1</b> (0.3 mW) is set to about 0.6 times of the reproduction laser power C<b>2</b> (0.5 mW), the laser powers per unit area for the average reproduction laser powers C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are substantially equal.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">However, when the influence on the increased laser power per unit area by the HFamp2 superposed during the period <b>702</b> is compared with the influence on the increased laser power per unit area by the HFamp2 superposed during the period <b>602</b>, the former is larger than the latter and accordingly the laser power per unit area at the high-frequency peak part during the period <b>702</b> is sometimes larger than that during the period <b>602</b>. In other words, there is a possibility that the recording layer of the optical disk 1 is irradiated with excessive laser power depending on the set value of the HFamp2 and there is a possibility that the recorded data is destroyed or the recording layer of the optical disk is deteriorated at part <b>705</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In order to avoid such problem, the signal selection circuit <b>204</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> selects the output of the OSC1 to be outputted so that the relation of the laser beam waveform, the laser beam power and the driving current value in the period <b>703</b> is satisfied upon reproduction of the optical disk 1. At this time, &#x201c;HFamp1&#x201d; and &#x201c;HFfreq1&#x201d; outputted by the OSC1 are set as follows:

Further, solid line <b>502</b> shows the relation of the average laser power and the average laser driving current in the period that the high-frequency signal is superposed on the laser driving current as shown in the period <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the periods <b>702</b> and <b>703</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for example.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the laser beam waveforms upon the high-frequency superposition are similar to each other as shown in the periods <b>602</b> and <b>703</b>, the power values such as the peak laser power average value of the superposed high-frequency signal are put on the same straight line in the area where the laser power is changed linearly to the driving current. Accordingly, the relation of I/L at each level of Ppk<b>1</b> and Ppk<b>2</b> is previously calculated and the laser power and the laser driving current value at each level may be set in accordance with the laser spot diameter on the recording surface of the optical disk to be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart showing processing of the embodiment. When the optical disk is mounted in the optical disk apparatus (step <b>801</b>), an optical pickup head is moved to a predetermined reproduction position in order to prevent data recorded on the optical disk from being destroyed (step <b>802</b>) and setting of reproduction for the optical disk 2 is made as described by expressions 13, 14 and 15 (step <b>803</b>). Then, it is judged whether the optical disk is the optical disk 2 or not (step <b>804</b>).

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The reason why the kind of the optical disk is discriminated in the setting of reproduction for the optical disk 2 is that the optical spot diameter for the optical disk 2 is larger than that for the optical disk 1 and accordingly the laser power per unit area on the optical disk is reduced even if the high-frequency superposed peak power is the same, so that destruction of the recorded data can be avoided.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, in the embodiment, the amplitude &#x201c;HFamp1&#x201d; of the high-frequency superposed signal of the optical disk 1 is calculated by the expression 11, although the amplitude HFamp1 satisfying the following conditions may be set:</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an optical disk apparatus according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The like elements to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are designated by like numerals and description thereof is omitted. Numeral <b>901</b> denotes a monitor diode for detecting laser emission power in order to perform the automatic power control (APC) and the signal band of the monitor diode is sufficiently low as compared with the high-frequency signal superposed on the reproduction laser beam. The signal <b>902</b> detected by the monitor diode <b>901</b> is supplied to a laser power control circuit <b>903</b>. The detailed configuration of the laser power control circuit <b>903</b> and a laser driver <b>905</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The like elements to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> are designated by like numerals and description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the laser power control circuit <b>903</b>, a reproduction laser power target value corresponding to the optical disk is set to a reproduction power target value generation circuit <b>1001</b> by the microcomputer <b>114</b> in accordance with the discrimination result of the optical disk by the optical disk discrimination circuit <b>112</b>. A difference between this set value and an output <b>902</b> of the monitor diode is calculated by a subtractor <b>1002</b> to be outputted as a difference value <b>904</b>. The reproduction laser driving current is generated on the basis of the difference value <b>904</b> through an amplifier <b>1003</b>. Further, in a high-frequency current generation circuit <b>1004</b>, a variable gain amplifier <b>1005</b> controlled by the difference value <b>904</b> controls the amplitude set value with respect to the amplitude value set in the high-frequency amplitude control circuit <b>1302</b> in accordance with the output of the optical disk discrimination circuit <b>112</b>. The coefficient ratio of the variable gain amplifier to the difference value <b>904</b> may be the ratio of values shown by the solid lines <b>502</b> and <b>503</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> of the first embodiment, for example. Consequently, satisfactory high-frequency superposition corresponding to the optical disk reproduction power can be realized and mis-erasure of data upon reproduction can be prevented while correcting change in the relation of I/L due to change in temperature within the optical disk apparatus and at the periphery of laser and deterioration due to aging.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow chart showing processing of the embodiment. When the optical disk is mounted (step <b>1101</b>), the setting for the target value of the reproduction power target value generation circuit <b>1001</b> is set to P<b>1</b> or P<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the setting for the amplitude and the frequency of the high-frequency current generation circuit <b>1004</b> are set in common to the first and second optical disks 1, 2. In the embodiment, the setting based on the blue laser is made and a switch <b>1006</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is turned off, so that the output of the high-frequency current generation circuit <b>1004</b> is cut off. In this state, laser noise is superposed on the reproduction signal and accordingly the signal quality (S/N) is deteriorated, although the signal band of the focus error signal and the tracking error signal used mainly in discrimination of the optical disk is as sufficiently low as several kHz, so that the signal quality can be relatively easily improved by means of a low-pass-filter (LPF) or the like. By using the signal having the quality thus improved, the optical disk can be discriminated with performance of the same degree as that of the discrimination of the optical disk using the reproduction waveform on which the high-frequency signal is superposed. The high-frequency signal is not superposed as described above, so that mis-erasure of the recorded data on the optical disk and deterioration of the recording layer of the optical disk at the time that the peak power of the laser beam is excessive upon the high-frequency superposition can be avoided. In this state, discrimination of the optical disk is carried out (step <b>1102</b>) and when the optical disk is judged to be the optical disk 2 (Yes of step <b>1103</b>), the target value of the reproduction power target value generation circuit <b>1001</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is set to the reproduction power P<b>2</b> of the optical disk 2 (step <b>1105</b>). When it is judged not to be the optical disk 2, that is, when it is judged to be the optical disk 1 (No of step <b>1103</b>), the target value of the reproduction power target value generation circuit <b>1001</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is set to the reproduction power P<b>1</b> of the optical disk 1 (step <b>1104</b>). Then, the output of the high-frequency current generation circuit <b>1004</b> is made effective by the switch <b>1006</b> (step <b>1106</b>) and the reproduction processing is started (step <b>1107</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow chart showing processing of a fourth embodiment of the present invention. The circuit configuration of the embodiment is the same as that of the third embodiment and description thereof is omitted. In the embodiment, there is considered the case where the numerical aperture NA in reproduction is different in each layer of a multi-layer optical disk in which the blue laser is used to reproduce information. When the optical disk is mounted (step <b>1201</b>) or when the reproduction layer of the optical layer is changed (step <b>1202</b>), the following setting is made (step <b>1203</b>) as preparation for reproduction of a layer to be reproduced (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;target layer&#x201d;):

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">At this time, the switch <b>1006</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is turned off, so that the output of the high-frequency current generation circuit is cut off. Then, focusing on the target layer is made (step <b>1204</b>). When the focusing on the target layer can be confirmed, the switch <b>1006</b> is turned on to make effective the output of the high-frequency current generation circuit (step <b>1205</b>). Then, start tracking control (step <b>1206</b>) and the reproduction processing is started (step <b>1207</b>). Consequently, destruction of the data recorded on the layer other than the target layer or deterioration of the recording layer caused by the high-frequency superposed peak power upon the focusing can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">In the embodiments, the high-frequency signal is superposed on the laser driving signal upon reproduction, although it is needless to say that the present invention described in the embodiments can be applied even when reproduction is made for generation of a servo signal in recording or when the laser beam of the reproduction power level is emitted upon formation of space in recording.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">Further, in the embodiments, the characteristics of the high-frequency signal superposed on the laser driving signal upon reproduction are changed, although the output of the high-frequency signal may be stopped if circumstances require, that is, the high-frequency signal having an amplitude reduced to zero may be used and the high-frequency signal is not limited to the waveform as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">It should be further understood by those skilled in the art that although the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention, the invention is not limited thereto and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.</p>
