<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to wireless communication. In particular, the present invention relates to exchange of information related to capabilities and charging for such capabilities, such as capabilities associated with assisted satellite positioning.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section is intended to provide a background or context to the invention that is recited in the claims. The description herein may include concepts that could be pursued, but are not necessarily ones that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Location services based on the location of mobile devices are becoming increasingly widespread. Assistance data for assisted navigation systems, such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS), Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and Galileo) have been specified and standardized for cellular systems. The delivery of such assistance data can be built on top of cellular system-specific control plane protocols including, e.g., the radio resource location services protocol (RRLP) for GSM networks, the radio resource control (RRC) layer of layer 3 in wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) networks, and IS-801 for CDMA networks, standardized in 3GPP/3GPP2.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) has defined a user plane protocol referred to as secure user plane location (SUPL). SUPL employs user plane data bearers for transferring location assistance information such as GNSS assistance data for carrying positioning technology-related protocols between a user terminal (e.g., a mobile communication device) and its operating network. SUPL is intended to be an alternative and a complement to the existing standards based on signaling in the mobile network control plane. SUPL assumes that a mobile or other network can establish a data bearer connection between a terminal and some type of location server. The use of a user plane protocol becomes especially appealing in case of IP networks where the data bearer is available by nature.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">SUPL includes a mechanism for the terminal to report its capabilities to the network element providing assistance. This capability report includes an indication, whether the terminal is capable to perform, for instance, SUPL-enabled terminal (SET) assisted AGPS (Assisted Global Positioning System), SET-based AGPS or E-CID (Enhanced Cell-ID). Moreover, the report contains information on which satellite systems (such as GLONASS, Galileo, etc.) and signals (such as GLONASS L1, GLONASS L2, etc.) the terminal is capable of supporting. This information indicates the network element, which assistance data it can provide the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The current solution, in which the terminal reports its capabilities to the network, is sufficient for the known purposes, in which there is either:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0008">one terminal and one assistance server providing the terminal assistance data; or</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0009">one terminal, one assistance server and the other terminal, of which position the first terminal is able to query.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">In the latter case the first terminal requests the location of the other terminal periodically and the network element queries the position of the other terminal. There is no interaction between the two terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">In order to provide advanced Location Based Services (LBS), the first terminal may wish to request the location of the other terminal at certain Quality-Of-Service level (for example, using some particular positioning technology) or request GNSS measurements on certain signals. However, in many instances, the user of the first terminal may be unable to receive necessary information to obtain the desired service.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">Similar to SUPL, in OMA SUPL 2.0, when the positioning session is initiated, the SET is required to report its capabilities to the assistance server (SLP). This report indicates the assistance server, which GPS positioning methods (e.g., SET-assisted AGPS, SET-based AGPS, Autonomous GPS), GANSS positioning methods (e.g., SET-assisted, SET-based, Autonomous) and RAN-based methods (e.g., AFLT, E-CID, E-OTD, OTDOA) the SET supports. Moreover, the support for different satellite systems (e.g., such as Galileo, GLONASS, etc.) and signals (Galileo E1, Galileo E5a, GLONASS G1, GLONASS G2, etc.) is reported. However, there is no similar signaling the other way round. This means that the SLP cannot report (and SET cannot request) the SLP's capabilities to the terminal.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, details and descriptions are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these details and descriptions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">As noted above, in many cases, the user of the first terminal may be unable to obtain a desired service for lack of being able to receive necessary information. For example, in some cases, the first terminal may request high-accuracy position of the second terminal. In many cases, the second terminal may be unable to provide such information for a number of reasons, such as:</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">1) the second terminal does not have the capability to provide such service due to hardware or software restrictions;</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">2) the second terminal has the capability but has not subscribed to the appropriate service; and</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">3) the second terminal has the capability and a valid subscription, but the second terminal is unable to provide the information because, for example, GNSS signal conditions may be such that the terminal cannot determine its position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">Without exchange of capability information, the user of the first terminal may receive in the above three cases the same indication as in a case of no-returned position. Further, the user of the first terminal would have no information based on which the user of the first terminal could modify the request, e.g., use another method, request termination, etc. The exchange of subscription information between the first and second terminals is not possible either.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">Embodiments of the present invention provide solutions for such cases. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, exchange of capability information and/or service-subscription information between two or more terminals is provided. In one embodiment, the users are provided with control on the positioning methods and Quality-Of-Service for positioning events taking place between two or more terminals. In one embodiment, the users are provided with a capability to subscribe to capabilities on-the-fly on behalf of the other terminal. In one embodiment, exchange of information between two or more terminals is provided in such a way that an assistance server stores capability information and/or service-subscription information. One embodiment includes a charging mechanism wherein the requesting terminal may cover more than its own direct positioning costs.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, exchange of capability and/or subscription information between the two or more terminals includes at least information on the supported GNSSs, GNSS signals, measurement types (e.g., code phase, carrier phase), supported positioning methods (assisted GNSS (AGNSS), Cell-ID, high-accuracy positioning), costs and cost structures of the services and subscriptions to the associated services. For example, if the second terminal has a subscription to a Virtual Reference Station (VRS) allowing the terminal to be positioned at high absolute accuracy, this is indicated in the subscription exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a flow chart is provided illustrating an exemplary process by which the user of a first terminal may locate a second terminal in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In accordance with the exemplary process <b>100</b>, the user of the first terminal wishing to locate a second terminal (block <b>110</b>) requests capabilities and subscriptions of the second terminal (block <b>120</b>). The capabilities and subscriptions of the second terminal are shown to the user of the first terminal (block <b>130</b>). In various embodiments, the information may be displayed to the user of the first terminal through a user interface (UI). In one embodiment, the information is displayed to the user of the first terminal in terms of quality-of-service and cost. The user of the first terminal can then make decisions on the desired actions (block <b>140</b>). For example, if the user of the first terminal determines that no suitable capabilities exist, the session may be terminated (block <b>160</b>). On the other hand, the user of the first terminal may select one or more of the available services and, if necessary, accept the charges for any associated costs. The desired service is then requested for the second terminal and, if necessary, one or more services may be subscribed for the second terminal (block <b>150</b>). The session may then be initiated (block <b>170</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary process <b>200</b> by which the user of a first terminal may locate the second terminal in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. In accordance with the exemplary process <b>200</b>, the user of the first terminal wishing to locate a second terminal (block <b>210</b>) requests capabilities and subscriptions of the second terminal (block <b>220</b>). In the illustrated example, the user of the first terminal is provided with a list of options indicating services or capabilities available at no cost and services or capabilities available with a payment (block <b>230</b>). For example, the user may be provided with information indicating that <b>10</b>-meter accurate position is available at no cost, but 0.1-meter accurate position is available at a cost. In this regard, the second terminal may have a capability for high-accuracy positioning, but not a subscription for the appropriate service. The user of the first terminal may then select the appropriate service (block <b>240</b>), which may include buying a subscription for the second terminal to high accuracy positioning for a limited period of time. A linkage to the charging functionalities may be provided in embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">If, at block <b>240</b>, the user of the first terminal determines that no suitable capabilities exist, the session may be terminated (block <b>260</b>). On the other hand, the user of the first terminal may select one or more of the available services and, if necessary, accept the charges for any associated costs. The desired service is then requested for the second terminal and, if necessary, one or more services may be subscribed for the second terminal (block <b>250</b>). The session may then be initiated (block <b>270</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary flow diagram related to the exemplary process described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The messages which may be required for setting up the connections and protocols are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The first four messages (<b>310</b>-<b>316</b>) are related to the exchange of information relating to capabilities and/or subscription. In this regard, in one embodiment, the information is exchanged between the first terminal <b>301</b> and the second terminal <b>305</b> through an assistance server <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">In another embodiment, the information may be exchanged directly between the first terminal <b>301</b> and the second terminal <b>305</b>. Thus, the assistance server <b>303</b> may be either eliminated or bypassed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">In still another embodiment, the assistance server <b>303</b> may be a part of a terminal. For example, the assistance server <b>303</b> may be a mobile server located in the first terminal <b>301</b> or the second terminal <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">Messages <b>318</b>-<b>322</b> are related to subscribing high-accuracy positioning capability for the second terminal <b>305</b>. Another exchange of information related to capability and/or subscription then occurs (<b>324</b>-<b>330</b>). The first terminal <b>301</b> then requests high-accuracy location from the second terminal <b>305</b> (<b>332</b>-<b>334</b>). The second terminal <b>305</b> may then set up a high-accuracy positioning session with the same assistance server <b>303</b> or another assistance server (not shown). The second terminal <b>305</b> then starts reporting location data back to the first terminal <b>301</b> on a periodic basis (<b>336</b>-<b>342</b>). While the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates two instances of such reporting, those skilled in the art will understand that the number and frequency of such instances may vary in various embodiments and are contemplated within the scope of the present invention. The session may then be terminated (<b>344</b>-<b>346</b>), for example, at the request of the first terminal <b>301</b>, at the request of the second terminal <b>305</b>, or upon expiration of the subscription.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram which schematically illustrates an exemplary case in which multiple users may locate a given terminal. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the capability and/or subscription information of a target terminal <b>405</b> may be stored on an assistance server <b>403</b>. In this manner, users at one or more terminals <b>401</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may exchange such information through the assistance server. In this regard, the need to query the target terminal <b>405</b> is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">As noted above, currently, the SET does not have information on the capabilities of the assistance server. The lack of the SLP capability report highlights that the computational as well as other capabilities of the terminals have been very limited in the past. Moreover, the variety of positioning methods as well as assistance data has been smaller. Previously, the assistance server was given more control in the positioning session in deciding which positioning method to use and what assistance to provide to the SET.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">However, the situation is changing in terms of the capabilities of SETs, available positioning methods and assistance data. New GNSS-based positioning methods include Real-Time Kinematics and Precise Point Positioning, both providing highly accurate positioning services. New types of assistance data include high accuracy orbit models as well as real-time ionosphere maps, both contributing to higher accuracy and availability of navigation services. In this new environment, it is desirable for the SET to know what assistance data and support is available from the assistance server. This ensures the use of the most efficient positioning method and assistance by the SET all the time.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">Currently, the SET does not have information on the capabilities of the assistance server. Hence, if the SET user wishes to locate himself or herself using the best possible accuracy, the terminal needs to request assistance data blindly. If the request fails, the SET user cannot be notified whether the failure was due to a temporary error, in which case a new attempt can be made, or if certain required assistance data type is not available, in which case another positioning method should be chosen. With increasing number of options available for positioning, the situation of the SET not knowing about available assistance can lead to a contradiction in the functioning of the SET.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">Moreover, the different types of assistance data may be charged differently. In this case, it may be desirable that the SET can request information on the availability of different assistance data and possibly also on the charging. The problem in the current solution is that the only option for the SET is to request for the assistance data and then either receive the data or an error. Again, in such a case the SET user cannot be notified of the cause of the failure (e.g., a general error, lack of assistance or lack of subscriptions, etc.). Moreover, charging indication cannot be provided to the user beforehand.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the SET may receive information indicative of the capabilities of the assistance server. In this regard, an assistance server capability report may be provided to indicate, for example, (1) assistance data available; (2) the format in which the assistance is available for appropriate types of assistance data; (3) the GNSSs for which the assistance is available for appropriate types of assistance data; (4) the GNSSs and signals for which the assistance is available for appropriate types of assistance data; (5) the accuracy at which the assistance is available for appropriate types of assistance data; (6) the subset of assistance data available for appropriate types of assistance data; or (7) any combination of the above capability indications and a terminal acting based upon the assistance server capability. Further, based on the assistance server capabilities, terminal capabilities and/or user preferences, a terminal may choose the combination of available assistance data that provides the best fit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary set <b>500</b> of assistance data that SUPL 2.1 supports in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The structure of the exemplary set of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is also exemplary. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the assistance data is divided into &#x201c;Common Elements&#x201d; <b>510</b> that are independent of GNSSs and signals and &#x201c;Generic Elements&#x201d; <b>520</b> that may be GNSS and/or signal dependent. The assistance data may be of various types. The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows three exemplary types of assistance data. Of course, in other embodiments, the assistance data may be divided into any number of data types.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">Referring now to the &#x201c;Common Elements&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, reference time <b>511</b> and reference location <b>512</b> are basic types of assistance and are typically always available. Reference time <b>511</b> may be provided, for instance, based on cellular frame timing&#x2014;GNSS time relationships. Reference location <b>512</b> may be provided based on, for example, current serving cellular network cell.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">Further, the availability of high-accuracy reference location <b>513</b> or Earth-orientation parameters (EOP) <b>514</b> is not self-evident. The availability of high-accuracy reference location <b>513</b> notifies the SET that the SLP has access to assistance data for high-accuracy positioning (such as, for example, Real-Time Kinematics). A notification to the SET that assistance data is available may indicate the availability of this type of data (e.g., GNSS-independent and only one type).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">A notification to the SET of the format in which the assistance is available for appropriate types of assistance data may refer to, for example, atmosphere models <b>515</b> or ionosphere models <b>536</b> (e.g., several types, GNSS-independent). Ionosphere models <b>536</b> come in different formats. For example, one type is the global Klobuchar model in GPS broadcast. Galileo broadcast uses the NeQuick model. Moreover, there are regional high-accuracy ionosphere models and maps of which availability may also change depending upon the location of the SET.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">A notification to the SET of the GNSSs for which the assistance is available for appropriate types of assistance data may refer to, for example, navigation models <b>521</b>. The orbit models <b>532</b> may be provided per satellite and are generally signal-independent. Hence, it should be indicated that, for example, navigation models are available for GPS but not for GLONASS. For orbit models, for example, it may insufficient to indicate only for which GNSSs they are available, and it may also be required to indicate in which format. This is because there are several different parametrizations for the same orbit. For example, GPS satellite orbits are readily available in Keplerian format in GPS broadcast or in high-accuracy format in sp3-format from the International GNSS Service (IGS). It is also possible that charging is based on the accuracies. Finally, the navigation model may also include clock models, which may be available per signal.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">A notification to the SET of the availability of the GNSSs and signals for which the assistance is available for appropriate types of assistance data may refer to, for instance, Differential GNSS (DGNSS) assistance <b>522</b>. Differential GNSS <b>522</b> is a technique to give the SET data to correct the GNSS measurements in order to achieve better accuracy. The corrections are signal-specific. The same also applies to, for instance, Real-Time Integrity <b>523</b> and Data Bit Assistance <b>524</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">A notification to the SET of the availability of the accuracy at which the assistance is available for appropriate types of assistance data may refer to, for instance, accuracies at which orbit models are available, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">A notification to the SET of the availability of the subset of assistance data for appropriate types of assistance data may refer to, for example, Reference Measurements <b>525</b>. Even though the assistance server may be able to provide full set of Reference Measurements for GPS L1 signal, it may not be able to provide Carrier Phase, but only Code Phase measurements to GPS L2 signal. Hence, with Reference Measurements <b>525</b>, it may be necessary to indicate for which GNSSs and for which signals the different subsets are available. This assistance data, therefore, may also require any combination of the above capability notifications.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an exemplary flow diagram <b>600</b> for OMA SUPL 2.1 in an SET-initiated case in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The SET <b>601</b> first sends the assistance server (SLP) <b>603</b> SUPL START <b>612</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the messages are illustrated as compatible with SUPL 2.0. Thus, the SET <b>601</b> is capable of SUPL 2.1 (or higher) messaging. If the SLP <b>603</b> is also capable of doing this, it responds with SUPL 2.1 message, SUPL CONTINUE <b>614</b>. Those of skill in the art will understand that the name of the message is irrelevant and that only its use and content matters. SUPL CONTINUE <b>614</b> may include, among other, an indication for the SET <b>601</b> that the SLP <b>603</b> is capable of SUPL 2.1 messaging and potentially also able to provide the novel assistance data types available over SUPL 2.1. For this purpose, the message may also contain an information element for SLP capabilities. It is advantageous and natural that the SET receives the SLP capabilities as early in the session as possible.</p>
