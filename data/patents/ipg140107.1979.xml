<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to touch panels and method for making the same, particularly, to a carbon nanotube based touch panel and a method for making the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, various electronic apparatuses such as mobile phones, car navigation systems have advanced toward high performance and diversification. There is continuous growth in the number of electronic apparatuses equipped with optically transparent touch panels in front of their display devices such as liquid crystal panels. A user of such electronic apparatus operates it by pressing a touch panel with a finger or a stylus while visually observing the display device through the touch panel. Thus a demand exists for such touch panels which superior in visibility and reliable in operation. Due to a higher accuracy and a low-cost of the production, the resistance-type touch panels have been widely used.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A conventional resistance-type or capacitance-type touch panel includes a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) layer as an optically transparent conductive layer. However, the ITO layer is generally formed by means of ion-beam sputtering and etched by laser beam, and the method is relatively complicated. Furthermore, the ITO layer has poor wearability, low chemical endurance and uneven resistance in an entire area of the panel. Additionally, the ITO layer has a relatively low transparency. All the above-mentioned problems of the ITO layer produce a touch panel with low sensitivity, accuracy, and brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed, therefore, is to provide a touch panel and a method for making the same which can overcome the short come described above.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;one&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">References will now be made to the drawings to describe, in detail, various embodiments of the present touch panels and method for making the same.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a touch panel <b>10</b> of one embodiment includes a substrate <b>12</b>, an adhesive layer <b>13</b>, a transparent conductive layer <b>14</b>, at least one electrode <b>16</b>, and a conductive trace <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The touch panel <b>10</b> defines two areas: a touch-view area <b>10</b>A and a trace area <b>10</b>B. The touch-view area <b>10</b>A is typically a center area of the touch panel <b>10</b> which can be touched and viewed to realize the control function. The trace area <b>10</b>B is usually a periphery area of the touch panel <b>10</b> which can be used to support the conductive trace <b>18</b>. The touch-view area <b>10</b>A has a relatively large area. The trace area <b>10</b>B is located on at least one side of the touch-view area <b>10</b>A. The positional relationship of the touch-view area <b>10</b>A and the trace area <b>10</b>B can be selected according to need. In one embodiment, the shape of the touch panel <b>10</b> is a rectangle, and the positional relationship of the touch-view area <b>10</b>A and the trace area <b>10</b>B is given as below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, the trace area <b>10</b>B can be an annular region on the periphery, and the touch-view area <b>10</b>A is a square region on the center and surrounded by the trace area <b>10</b>B. For example, the trace area <b>10</b>B can be a strip-shaped region on one side of the touch panel <b>10</b>, and the touch-view area <b>10</b>A is rest of the touch panel <b>10</b> except the trace area <b>10</b>B. For example, the trace areas <b>10</b>B can be two strip-shaped regions on opposite sides of the touch panel <b>10</b>, and the touch-view area <b>10</b>A is the region between the trace areas <b>10</b>B. For example, the trace area <b>10</b>B can be an L-shaped region on adjacent two sides of the touch panel <b>10</b>, and the touch-view area <b>10</b>A is the rest of the touch panel <b>10</b> except the trace area <b>10</b>B. For example, the trace area <b>10</b>B can be a U-shaped region on three adjacent sides of the touch panel <b>10</b>, and the touch-view area <b>10</b>A is the rest of the touch panel <b>10</b> except the trace area <b>10</b>B. In one embodiment, the touch-view area <b>10</b>A is the center region having a shape the same as that is the shape of touch panel <b>10</b> and surrounded by the trace area <b>10</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The adhesive layer <b>13</b> is located on a surface of the substrate <b>12</b>. The transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> is located on a surface of the adhesive layer <b>13</b>. Both the adhesive layer <b>13</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> are located only on the touch-view area <b>10</b>A. The electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> are located on a surface of the substrate <b>12</b> and only on the trace area <b>10</b>B. Because the adhesive layer <b>13</b> is located only on the touch-view area <b>10</b>A and the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> are located only on the trace area <b>10</b>B, the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> can have a relative large thickness substantially same as the thickness of the adhesive layer <b>13</b>. The thickness of transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> is very small and can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">If the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> are located on the adhesive layer <b>13</b>, following problems will be caused. When the thickness of the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> is too small, the conductivity and durability of the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> will be low and short. When the thickness of the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> is too great, the surface of the touch panel <b>10</b> will be too rough. The electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> can have the same thickness which is equal to the total thickness of the adhesive layer <b>13</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b>. The thickness of the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> can be in a range from about 1 micrometer to about 500 micrometers. In one embodiment, the thickness of the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> can be in a range from about 100 micrometers to about 200 micrometers. In one embodiment, the thickness of the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> can be in a range from about 1 micrometer to about 2 micrometers. In one embodiment, the thickness of the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> is about 1.5 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, because the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> is located only on the touch-view area <b>10</b>A and the conductive trace <b>18</b> is located only on the trace area <b>10</b>B, the conductive trace <b>18</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> do not overlap. Because the conductive trace <b>18</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> have no overlapping part, no capacitance signal interference will be produced between the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> when the touch-view area <b>10</b>A is touched by a finger or a stylus. Thus, the accuracy of the touch panel <b>10</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The electrode <b>16</b> is located on at least one side of the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> and electrically connected with the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b>. The position of the electrode <b>16</b> depends on the work principle of the touch panel <b>10</b> and the detection methods of the touch-point. The number of the electrode <b>16</b> depends on the area and resolution of the touch panel <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, the touch panel <b>10</b> includes six electrodes <b>16</b> spaced from each other, arranged on one side of the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b>. The electrodes <b>16</b> can be made of material such as metal, carbon nanotube, conductive silver paste, or ITO. The electrodes <b>16</b> can be made by etching a metal film, etching an ITO film, or printing a conductive silver paste. The conductive trace <b>18</b> is electrically connected with an external circuit (not shown). The conductive trace <b>18</b> includes a plurality of conductive wires. The conductive trace <b>18</b> can be made of material such as metal, conductive silver paste, or ITO. The conductive trace <b>18</b> can be made by etching a metal film, etching an ITO film, or printing a conductive silver paste. In one embodiment, both the conductive trace <b>18</b> and the electrodes <b>16</b> are made of conductive silver paste and made by printing conductive silver paste concurrently. The conductive silver paste can include about 50% to about 90% (by weight) of the metal powder, about 2% to about 10% (by weight) of the glass powder, and about 8% to about 40% (by weight) of the binder.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The substrate <b>12</b> can be flat or curved and configured to support other elements. The substrate <b>12</b> is insulative and transparent. The substrate <b>12</b> can be made of rigid materials such as glass, quartz, diamond, plastic or any other suitable material. The substrate <b>12</b> can also be made of flexible materials such as polycarbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate acrylic (PMMA), polyimide (PI), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), polyether polysulfones (PES), polyvinyl polychloride (PVC), benzocyclobutenes (BCB), polyesters, or acrylic resin. In one embodiment, the substrate <b>12</b> is a flat and flexible PET plate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> includes a carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotube film can be a substantially pure structure of the carbon nanotubes, with few impurities and chemical functional groups. A majority of the carbon nanotubes are arranged to extend along the direction substantially parallel to the surface of the carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film can be single-walled, double-walled, or multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The length and diameter of the carbon nanotubes can be selected according to need, for example the diameter can be in a range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 50 nanometers and the length can be in a range from about 200 nanometers to about 900 nanometers. The thickness of the carbon nanotube film can be in a range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 100 micrometers, for example in a range from about 100 nanometers to about 200 nanometers. The carbon nanotube film has a good flexibility because of the good flexibility of the carbon nanotubes therein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The carbon nanotubes of the carbon nanotube film can be arranged orderly to form an ordered carbon nanotube structure or disorderly to form a disordered carbon nanotube structure. The term &#x2018;disordered carbon nanotube structure&#x2019; includes, but is not limited to, to a structure where the carbon nanotubes are arranged along many different directions, and the aligning directions of the carbon nanotubes are random. The number of the carbon nanotubes arranged along each different direction can be almost the same (e.g. uniformly disordered). The carbon nanotubes in the disordered carbon nanotube structure can be entangled with each other. The term &#x2018;ordered carbon nanotube structure&#x2019; includes, but is not limited to, to a structure where the carbon nanotubes are arranged in a consistently systematic manner, e.g., the carbon nanotubes are arranged approximately along a same direction and/or have two or more sections within each of which the carbon nanotubes are arranged approximately along a same direction (different sections can have different directions).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the carbon nanotube film is a free-standing structure. The term &#x201c;free-standing structure&#x201d; means that the carbon nanotube film can sustain the weight of itself when it is hoisted by a portion thereof without any significant damage to its structural integrity. Thus, the carbon nanotube film can be suspended by two spaced supports. The free-standing carbon nanotube film can be laid on the epitaxial growth surface <b>101</b> directly and easily.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> is a single carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of successive and oriented carbon nanotubes joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. The carbon nanotube film is a free-standing film. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of successively oriented carbon nanotube segments joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. Each carbon nanotube segment includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes parallel to each other, and combined by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. Some variations can occur in the carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are oriented along a preferred orientation. The carbon nanotube film can be treated with an organic solvent to increase the mechanical strength and toughness and reduce the coefficient of friction of the carbon nanotube film. A thickness of the carbon nanotube film can range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 100 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> can include at least two stacked carbon nanotube films. In other embodiments, the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> can include two or more coplanar carbon nanotube films. Additionally, when the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are aligned along one preferred orientation, an angle can exist between the orientations of carbon nanotubes in adjacent films, whether stacked or adjacent. Adjacent carbon nanotube films can be combined by only the van der Waals attractive force therebetween. An angle between the aligned directions of the carbon nanotubes in two adjacent carbon nanotube films can range from about 0 degrees to about 90 degrees. When the angle between the aligned directions of the carbon nanotubes in adjacent stacked carbon nanotube films is larger than 0 degrees, a plurality of micropores is defined by the carbon nanotube film. Stacking the carbon nanotube films will also add to the structural integrity of the carbon nanotube film.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The carbon nanotube film can be made by the steps of: growing a carbon nanotube array on a wafer by chemical vapor deposition method; and drawing the carbon nanotubes of the carbon nanotube array to from the carbon nanotube film. During the drawing step, the carbon nanotubes are joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween along the drawing direction. The carbon nanotube film has the smallest resistance along the drawing direction and the greatest resistance along a direction perpendicular to the drawing direction. Thus, the carbon nanotube film is resistance anisotropy. Furthermore, the carbon nanotube film can be etched or irradiated by laser. After being irradiated by laser, a plurality of parallel carbon nanotube conductive strings will be formed and the resistance anisotropy of the carbon nanotube film will not be damaged because the carbon nanotube substantially extending not along the drawing direction are removed by burning. Each carbon nanotube conductive string comprises a plurality of carbon nanotubes joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The adhesive layer <b>13</b> is configured to fix the carbon nanotube film on the substrate <b>12</b>. Part of the carbon nanotubes of the carbon nanotube film are embedded in the adhesive layer <b>13</b> and part of the carbon nanotubes are exposed from the adhesive layer <b>13</b>. In one embodiment, most of the carbon nanotubes are embedded in the adhesive layer <b>13</b>. The adhesive layer <b>13</b> is transparent and can be made of materials such as hot plastic or UV (Ultraviolet Rays) glue, for example PVC or PMMA. The thickness of the adhesive layer <b>13</b> can be in a range from about 1 nanometer to about 500 micrometers, for example, the thickness is in a range from about 1 micrometer to about 2 micrometers. In one embodiment, the adhesive layer <b>13</b> is a UV glue layer with a thickness of 1.5 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a method for making the touch panel <b>10</b> of one embodiment includes the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">step (S<b>10</b>), providing a substrate <b>12</b>, wherein the substrate <b>12</b> defines two areas: a touch-view area <b>10</b>A and a trace area <b>10</b>B;</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">step (S<b>30</b>), placing a carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> on a surface of the adhesive layer <b>13</b>, and solidifying the adhesive layer <b>13</b> to fix the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">step (S<b>40</b>), removing part of the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> and the part of the adhesive layer <b>13</b> that are on the trace area <b>10</b>B to obtain a transparent conductive layer <b>14</b> and expose part of the substrate <b>12</b> that is on the trace area <b>10</b>B; and</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">step (S<b>50</b>), forming an electrode <b>16</b> and a conductive trace <b>18</b> on the exposed part of the substrate <b>12</b> that is on the trace area <b>10</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In step (S<b>10</b>), the substrate <b>12</b> is a flat glass plate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In step (S<b>20</b>), the adhesive layer <b>13</b> can be any adhesive which can be solidified on a certain condition. The adhesive layer <b>13</b> is transparent and can be made of materials such as hot plastic or UV glue, for example PVC or PMMA. The adhesive layer <b>13</b> can be formed by spin-coating, spraying, or brushing. In one embodiment, a UV glue layer with a thickness of 1.5 micrometers is formed on the substrate <b>12</b> by spin-coating.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In step (S<b>30</b>), the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> can be formed by transfer printing a preformed carbon nanotube film, filtering and depositing a carbon nanotube suspension, or laying a free-standing carbon nanotube film. In one embodiment, the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> is drawn from a carbon nanotube array and then placed on the adhesive layer <b>13</b> directly. The carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> can be infiltrated into the adhesive layer <b>13</b> after being placed on the adhesive layer <b>13</b>. In one embodiment, part of the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> is infiltrated into the adhesive layer <b>13</b>, and part of the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> is exposed through of the adhesive layer <b>13</b>. Furthermore, a step of pressing the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> can be performed after step (S<b>30</b>) to allow more carbon nanotubes of the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> to infiltrate into the adhesive layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The method for solidifying the adhesive layer <b>13</b> depends on the material of the adhesive layer <b>13</b>. The thermoplastic adhesive layer <b>13</b> can be solidified by cooling, the thermosetting adhesive layer <b>13</b> can be solidified by heating, and the UV glue adhesive layer <b>13</b> can be solidified by irradiating with ultraviolet light. In one embodiment, because part of the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> is infiltrated into the adhesive layer <b>13</b>, the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> is fixed by the adhesive layer <b>13</b> during solidifying the adhesive layer <b>13</b>. In one embodiment, the adhesive layer <b>13</b> is UV glue layer and solidified by ultraviolet light irradiating for about 2 seconds to about 30 seconds, for example, irradiating for about 4 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In step (S<b>40</b>), part of the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> that is on the trace area <b>10</b>B and part of the adhesive layer <b>13</b> that is on the trace area <b>10</b>B are removed. The removing step can be performed by a method such as laser-beam etching, ion-beam etching, or electron-beam etching. In one embodiment, a laser beam <b>15</b> is controlled by a computer (not shown) to etch the part of the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> and the part of the adhesive layer <b>13</b> that are on the trace area <b>10</b>B. The part of the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> on the trace area <b>10</b>B is removed, and the part of the carbon nanotube film <b>19</b> on the touch-view area <b>10</b>A is maintained to form the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In step (S<b>50</b>), the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> can be made by a method such as screen printing, chemical vapor deposition, or magnetron sputtering. In one embodiment, the electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> are formed only on the trace area <b>10</b>B and have the same thickness which is equal to total thickness of the adhesive layer <b>13</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b>. The electrode <b>16</b> and the conductive trace <b>18</b> are formed concurrently by printing conductive silver paste. The conductive silver paste can include about 50% to about 90% (by weight) of the metal powder, about 2% to about 10% (by weight) of the glass powder, and about 8% to about 40% (by weight) of the binder.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, a step of planarizing the exposed part of the substrate <b>12</b> on the trace area <b>10</b>B can be performed before step (S<b>50</b>), because the exposed part of the substrate <b>12</b> on the trace area <b>10</b>B will has a rough surface caused by etching. The step of planarizing can be performed by mechanical polishing or coating an insulating layer. The step of planarizing allows the exposed part of the substrate <b>12</b> on the trace area <b>10</b>B fit for printing conductive silver paste.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, an optically clear adhesive (OCA) layer and a cover lens can be applied on the touch panel <b>10</b> to cover the transparent conductive layer <b>14</b>, the electrode <b>16</b>, and the conductive trace <b>18</b>. Thus, a touch screen is obtained.</p>

Furthermore, a second mask layer (not shown) can be applied to cover the first mask layer <b>17</b> before applying the adhesive layer <b>13</b> and removed after applying the adhesive layer <b>13</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In step (M<b>10</b>), the shape and size of the target areas <b>120</b> can be selected according to need. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in one embodiment, the surface of the substrate <b>12</b> is divided into nine target areas <b>120</b> arranged in an array of three rows and three columns by four cutting lines <b>121</b>. The target areas <b>120</b> have the same shape and size. The touch-view area <b>10</b>A is typically a center area of the touch panel <b>10</b> which can be touched and viewed to realize the control function. The trace area <b>10</b>B is usually a periphery area of the touch panel <b>10</b> which can be used to support the conductive trace <b>18</b>.

The adhesive layer <b>13</b> is an UV glue layer with a thickness of 1.5 micrometers and formed on the substrate <b>12</b> by spraying. Furthermore, a second mask layer (not shown) can be applied to cover the first mask layer <b>17</b> before applying the adhesive layer <b>13</b> and removed after applying the adhesive layer <b>13</b>. Thus, the adhesive layer <b>13</b> will not remain on the first mask layer <b>17</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
