<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A cascode common source and common gate LNAs operating at 60 GHz are introduced and described. The cascode common source LNA is simulated to arrive at an optimum ratio of upper device width to the lower device width. The voltage output of the cascode common source LNA is translated into a current to feed and apply energy to the mixer stage. These input current signals apply the energy associated with the current directly into the switched capacitors in the mixer to minimize the overall power dissipation of the system. The LNA is capacitively coupled to the mixer switches in the I and Q mixers and are enabled and disabled by the clocks generated by the quadrature oscillator. These signals are then amplified by a differential amplifier to generate the sum and difference frequency spectra.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is related to the co-filed U.S. application Ser. No. 13/312,820 entitled &#x201c;An Injection Locked Divider with Injection Point Located at a Tapped Inductor&#x201d; both filed on Dec. 6, 2011, which are invented by the same inventor as the present application and incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has allotted a spectrum of bandwidth in the 60 GHz frequency range (57 to 64 GHz). The Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig) is targeting the standardization of this frequency band that will support data transmission rates up to 7 Gbps. Integrated circuits, formed in semiconductor die, offer high frequency operation in this millimeter wavelength range of frequencies. Some of these integrated circuits utilize Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS), Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) or GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) technology to form the dice in these designs. At 60 GHz, the interface issues between the LNA and the mixer are presented.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) is the primary technology used to construct integrated circuits. N-channel devices and P-channel devices (MOS device) are used in this technology which uses fine line technology to consistently reduce the channel length of the MOS devices. Current channel lengths are 40 nm, the power supply of VDD equals 1.2V and the number of layers of metal levels can be 8 or more.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cost is a driving force in electronic products. Integration of circuit has allowed many more devices into the die. In addition, massive computation is typically requires when operating wireless systems. This has forced analog designers to introduce their circuit techniques into 8 layer metal CMOS processes more geared for digital logic manipulation rather than analog functions. The design of high speed analog circuits (60 GHz) in the 8 layer 40 nm CMOS process is a difficult task that requires innovation, careful design and analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional techniques in high frequency circuit design can unnecessarily waste energy. Any technology being pushed to the limit, as in the design of 60 GHz receiver frond-ends that includes an LNA (Low Noise Amplifier) and mixer, makes these energy losses more pronounced. These losses influence target objectives and can cause the chip or die to fail meeting the specifications. New circuit techniques are required to reduce these energy losses and allow the circuit to achieve 60 Ghz operation in the WiGig specification.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various embodiments and aspects of the inventions will be described with reference to details discussed below, and the accompanying drawings will illustrate the various embodiments. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the present invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order to provide a concise discussion of embodiments of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One of the embodiments of the disclosure is a common source LNA interfacing to a mixer where the mixer responds to input current signals generated by the output of the LNA. An output signal spectrum is developed across the resonant circuit load of the LNA and is coupled to a mixer. The signal spectrum of the input signal is amplified and generates an output signal spectrum that is carried within the current signals being applied to the mixer. The voltage output of the LNA's load is translated to a current output that is applied to the input of the mixer. These input current signals apply the energy associated with the current directly into the mixer to minimize the overall power dissipation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another embodiment uses a series peaking inductor coupling the cascode devices of the LNA together. The area occupied by the inductors are orders of magnitude larger that the area occupied by the devices in the LNA. A device represents a CMOS transistor where the transistor can be either P or N-type channel transistor. In addition, the physical displacement between the upper cascode device and the lower cascode device of the LNA can be quite large. A series peaking inductor formed from a wide metal layer is used to couple the drain of the lower cascode device to the source of the upper cascode device. A capacitance can be added to the wide trace of the inductor to form a bandpass filter in order to pass those frequencies of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another embodiment of the invention is the adjustment of the width of the top cascode device with respect to the width of the bottom input device in the cascode LNA to adjust the optimum (NF) Noise Figure and the center frequency of the resonant circuit to the desired frequency of operation. The NF can be further improved 0.16 dB by reducing the width of the upper cascode device below the width of the lower cascode device. In addition, the center carrier frequency of the LNA is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An additional embodiment uses the impedance of the mixer to reduce the Q (or quality factor) of the resonant circuit. By reducing the Q, the bandwidth of the receiver is increased. The adjustment of the width of the top cascode device and the load of the impedance of the mixer reduces the Q and eliminates the need for either a capacitive or resistive array to perform this function thereby reducing the introduction of unnecessary parasitic elements. This allows the receiver to meet the requirements for the WiGig initiative at a reduced power.</p>

The gate of M<sub>2 </sub>is coupled to an AC ground by the capacitor C<sub>2 </sub>and to the power supply VDD by the inductor L<sub>4</sub>. At DC, the impedance of the inductor L<sub>4 </sub>is zero causing the gate of M<sub>2 </sub>to be coupled to a power supply (VDD). In general, the inductance of L<sub>4 </sub>can be minimized, and in some cases, the inductor L<sub>4 </sub>can be replaced by a short. The configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>is known as the common gate. The drain of device M<sub>2 </sub>is coupled to VDD by the inductor L<sub>6</sub>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>presents a cascode common gate structure. The cascode structure comprises the two stacked devices, M<sub>4 </sub>and M<sub>3</sub>, and couples to VSS and VDD through the inductors, L<sub>8 </sub>and L<sub>9</sub>. Typically, these inductors can occupy an area 50 um on a side while the devices can be incorporated into an area of 5 um on a side. The area occupied by these inductors compared to the area occupied by the devices can be two orders of magnitude larger. This illustrates that the placement of the inductors play a very important role in determining just how close the devices in the cascode structure can be placed next to one another. The input is applied at in<sub>3 </sub>through the inductor L<sub>7 </sub>to the gate of M<sub>4 </sub>while the output is provided at out<sub>3</sub>. Quite often, the two devices of the cascode cannot be placed next to each other. Thus, a metal interconnect may be required to couple the drain of M<sub>1 </sub>to the source of M<sub>3</sub>.

The resistor R<sub>1 </sub>acts as a low pass filter to stabilize the voltage from the diode connected device M<sub>b1 </sub>and applies the voltage to the gate of device M<sub>4</sub>. The device M<sub>4 </sub>is configured in a common source configuration while the device M<sub>3 </sub>is in a common gate configuration. The voltage at node <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> is nearly constant reducing the miller feedback capacitance for the device M<sub>4</sub>. Because the miller capacitance is reduced in this circuit, the cascode configuration allows a higher bandwidth.</p>

The cascode structure comprises the two stacked devices, M<sub>8 </sub>and M<sub>7</sub>, and couples to VSS and VDD through the inductors, L<sub>13 </sub>and L<sub>15</sub>. A current mirror is formed by devices M<sub>b3 </sub>and M<sub>8 </sub>controlled by I<sub>bias3 </sub>and applied to the gate of device Mg. The resistor R<sub>5 </sub>acts as a low pass filter to stabilize the voltage from the diode connected device M. The area occupied by the inductors can be two orders of magnitude larger than the area occupied by the devices. Often these two devices cannot be placed next to each other. Thus, a metal interconnect is used to couple the drain of M<sub>8 </sub>to the source of M<sub>7</sub>. This interconnect, if modeled as a resistor, can decrease the gain of the circuit. By increasing the width of this metallic interconnect, the resistance is decreased at the expense of increased capacitance. However, another feature of this interconnect becomes more prominent: its self-inductance, L<sub>16</sub>. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>illustrates the substitution of the resistor model of R<sub>3 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>by the inductor L<sub>16</sub>. This inductance can now be used as a peaking inductor which resonates with the corresponding capacitance of the interconnect and devices loading this interconnect. The function of the peaking inductor and capacitive load forms a band-pass filter which is adjusted to operate at 60 GHz. Thus, although the placement of the two cascode devices are displaced from one another on the die, the peaking inductor can minimize the loss of the resistive component in the interconnect between the cascode devices and provide a band-pass function.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the input is applied at in<sub>5 </sub>and arrives at the gate of M<sub>8 </sub>through the inductor L<sub>14 </sub>while the output is provided at out<sub>5</sub>.

By increasing the width of this metallic interconnect, the resistance is decreased at the expense of increased capacitance. However, as before, another feature of this interconnect becomes more prominent: its self-inductance, L<sub>20</sub>.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Ideally, the LNA would like to pass all frequencies equally over the targeted spectrum range from 57 Ghz to 64 GHz and block all other frequencies. However this condition is very difficult to achieve. Typically, a resonant circuit (comprising an inductor, capacitor and resistance) is also known as an RLC tuned circuit. The response of a resonant circuit is measured near the center frequency &#x3c9;<sub>c </sub>of the RLC resonant circuit. The bandwidth B is given as B=(&#x3c9;<sub>c</sub>)/Q. The term Q is known as the quality factor.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As Q is decreased, the bandwidth of the resonant circuit increases while the gain decreases. This allows a resonant circuit to be adjusted so the bandwidth covers the desired spectrum range and the LNA can amplify any signal within the bandwidth, but the gain of the LNA has been decreased while the noise increased. On the other hand, as Q is increased, the bandwidth of the resonant circuit decreases while the gain increases. This creates a very selective bandpass circuit where only a portion of the desired spectrum would be captured.</p>

As the R decreases, Q decreases. A resistive array formed by R<sub>7 </sub>and R<sub>8 </sub>can be switched into the RLC resonant circuit by enabling switches S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2 </sub>(as shown by the arrows) to provide a dynamic resistance adjustment to the RLC resonant circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>. The switch S<sub>1 </sub>or S<sub>2 </sub>can be an MOS device that is enabled (to provide a path) and can couple the resistance of R<sub>7 </sub>or R<sub>8 </sub>into the parallel RLC resonant circuit. When the resistive array is enabled to place either or both R<sub>7 </sub>or R<sub>8 </sub>in parallel with R<sub>a, </sub>the resistance of the resonant circuit decreases and decreases the Q thereby increasing the bandwidth.

Increasing C, decreases &#x3c9;<sub>c </sub>and vice versa. A capacitor array formed by C<sub>4 </sub>and C<sub>5 </sub>can be switched into the parallel RLC resonant circuit by enabling switches S<sub>5 </sub>and S<sub>6 </sub>(as shown by the arrows) to provide a dynamic capacitance adjustment to the RLC resonant circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e</i>. The parasitic portion of C the RLC resonant circuit is given by C<sub>a </sub>while the resistance R is given by the parasitic values R<sub>a</sub>. The capacitive switching array of the common source in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e </i>is provided by the two disabled switches S<sub>5 </sub>and S<sub>6 </sub>that can be enabled to place either or both C<sub>4 </sub>or C<sub>5 </sub>in parallel with C<sub>a </sub>causing C to increase which decreases the &#x3c9;<sub>c</sub>. The center frequency is then shifted to lower frequencies.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The common gate cascade LNA is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>f</i>. The capacitive switching array of the common gate is provided by the two enabled switches S<sub>7 </sub>and S<sub>8 </sub>that can be disabled (as shown by the arrows) to remove either or both C<sub>6 </sub>or C<sub>7 </sub>from being in parallel with C<sub>b </sub>causing the C in the RLC resonant circuit to decrease which increases the &#x3c9;<sub>c. </sub>The center frequency is shifted to higher frequencies. Although only two capacitors with two switches have been show, the number of switches and capacitors can be varied while the weight of the capacitors can be binary weighted in value. Inserting/removing the capacitors by switch enablement/disablement provides the dynamic portion of the C in the RLC resonant circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e </i>(common source) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>f </i>(common gate). Similar elements that have been identified with the same label in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e </i>are similar components while those with the same label in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>f </i>are similar components.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The capacitive arrays occupy an area which introduces undesired capacitance into the network. The parasitic capacitances of the array elements introduces a dynamic capacitance C<sub>d </sub>that can be comparable to the parasitic capacitance C<sub>a </sub>of the resonant circuit causing the center frequency &#x3c9;<sub>c</sub>=1/&#x221a;(L(C<sub>a</sub>+C<sub>d</sub>)) to be controlled by the both terms C<sub>d </sub>and C<sub>a</sub>. This additional dynamic capacitance can prevent the LNA from reaching the target frequency of 60 GHz. Similarly, the resistive arrays also introduce undesired parasitic capacitances because of their physical layout in the die. Thus, this parasitic capacitance introduced by the use of either the resistive or capacitive array makes the tuning or adjusting of the bandwidth and center frequency of the RLC resonant circuit more difficult for the WiGig bandwidth. The additional dynamic capacitance introduced into the parallel resonant circuit will make it more difficult for the circuit to operate at 60 GHz. A different inventive approach of adjusting the bandwidth and center frequency will be required.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">One inventive approach in an attempt to overcome this barrier is to remove the capacitive array in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e </i>and the resistive array in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c </i>altogether thereby eliminating the additional dynamic capacitance of their layout. The requirement to adjust the bandwidth and center frequency of the RLC resonant circuit will be adjusted using two innovative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The first innovative adjustment involves sizing the width of the upper cascade device while maintaining the lower cascade device at the same width. This adjustment of the upper cascade transistor width causes the center frequency of the parallel resonant RLC circuit to shift. As the width of the upper cascade device is decreased relative to the lower cascade device, the center frequency of the parallel resonant RLC circuit decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The second innovative adjustment involves coupling the resonant circuit of the LNA to a switched capacitance circuit. The switched capacitor includes a switch whose gate is driven by a clock and where the switch drives a capacitive load. This switched capacitor circuit includes a mixer switch (MOS device) and capacitive load of the differential amplifier. The switched capacitor circuit places a resistance across the resonant circuit and is given by R=1/(Cf<sub>&#x398;</sub>) where C is the capacitive gate load of the differential amplifier and f<sub>&#x398;</sub> is the clock frequency of the quadrature oscillator. This resistive component can be used to adjust the Q or bandwidth of the parallel resonant RLC circuit of the LNA.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Then, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e</i>, assuming that the capacitive array of C<sub>4 </sub>and C<sub>5 </sub>is removed, the width of the M<sub>7 </sub>device can be adjusted with respect to the M<sub>8 </sub>device to adjust the center frequency. The resistance of the switched capacitor can be used to adjust the Q or bandwidth of the parallel resonant RLC circuit. These size changes and adjustments are made final using simulation results to cover all process, temperature and voltage variations. After final layout and die fabrication, the operation of this inventive circuit technique has been confirmed by actual measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The results of decreasing the channel width of M<sub>7 </sub>with a parasitic capacitive load are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. The upper cascode device (M<sub>7</sub>) in the common source LNA of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e </i>was varied in width while the width of the lower device (M<sub>8</sub>) remained constant and the circuit was simulated to determine the NF (Noise Figure) and the Gain of the common source LNA. The dashed and solid lines in all of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>correspond to two different ratios of the width of the upper device (M<b>7</b>) to the width of the lower device (M<b>8</b>) or W<sub>M7</sub>/W<sub>M8</sub>. These two ratios have been reduced to a common denominator of 8. The ratio W<sub>M7</sub>/W<sub>M8 </sub>of the dashed line is 6/8 while that of the solid line corresponds to a ratio of 5/8.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>provides the NF at (WCS) Worst Case Slow Case (longer channel lengths, low power supply voltage and high temperature). The dotted line shows a minimum in the NF at about 68 GHz while the solid line shifts the minimum towards 63 GHz. Thus, as the upper device is reduced to a ratio of 5/8, the NF is reduced by 0.16 dB at 60 GHz when compared to the initial ratio of 6/8. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>provides the NF results for the (BCF) Best Case Fast Case (shorter channel lengths, high power supply voltage and low temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>provides the S<b>21</b> or forward transmission coefficient (forward gain) at WCS. Note that the peak of the solid curve corresponding to a ratio of 5/8 is shifted to the left, decreasing the center frequency. At 60 GHz, the forward gain is increased by 3 dB. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>d </i>provides the S<b>21</b> results for the BCF case. Thus, for the common source LNA of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e</i>, assuming that the capacitive array of C<sub>4 </sub>and C<sub>5 </sub>is removed, the ratio of W<sub>M7</sub>/W<sub>M8 </sub>was set to 5/8. Ideally, to achieve good linearity in the LNA requires that the upper device of the cascode have a width larger than the lower device. The upper device would introduce a smaller voltage drop and increase the available swing of the signal; however, the curves of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>would then shift to the right increasing the NF and the center carrier frequency outside the desired range. The 1 db compression point is monitored to arrive at a design with an acceptable 1 db compression point where the NF is reduced, the gain is increased at 60 GHz and the bandwidth is shifted to lower frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A Gilbert mixer is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>comprising of the two devices M<sub>g1 </sub>and M<sub>g2 </sub>which are switched by the rf<sub>in </sub>and <o ostyle="single">rf</o><sub>in </sub>signals, respectively. The drain of device M<sub>g1 </sub>is coupled to the common node <b>6</b>-<b>1</b> of the first mixer switch gated by the in-phase clock (&#x398;<sub>I </sub>and its compliment). The drain of device M<sub>g2 </sub>is coupled to the common node <b>6</b>-<b>2</b> of the second mixer switch gated by the in-phase clock (&#x398;<sub>I </sub>and its compliment). The outputs of the first mixer switch are combined with the outputs of the second mixer switch as illustrated to generate the if<sub>Iout&#x2032;</sub> signal. A load attached to each of the two outputs couples the Gilbert mixer to a power supply to supply energy to the circuit. The intermediate frequency contains the sum and difference frequency spectrum between the output signal spectrum carried by the rf<sub>in </sub>and <o ostyle="single">rf</o><sub>in </sub>and the in-phase clock (&#x398;<sub>I </sub>and its compliment). Note that the energy carried by the output signal spectrum is only applied to the gates of M<sub>g1 </sub>and M<sub>g2 </sub>and this energy does not directly contribute to powering or providing energy to operate the mixer. If this energy could power the mixer, the energy usage of the mixer can potentially be minimized. A similar circuit is used to generate the if<sub>Qout&#x2032;</sub> signal except that the mixer switches are clocked by the quadrature clock (&#x398;<sub>Q </sub>and its compliment). A quadrature clock is shifted 90&#xb0; degrees from the in-phase clock.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of the invention. A quadrature oscillator generates four equally displaced clock phases: &#x398;<sub>I</sub>, <o ostyle="single">&#x398;</o><sub>I</sub>, &#x398;<sub>Q </sub>and <o ostyle="single">&#x398;</o><sub>Q </sub>at 0&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, 90&#xb0; and 270&#xb0;, respectively. The clocks &#x398;<sub>I </sub>and <o ostyle="single">&#x398;</o><sub>I </sub>are the in-phase and inverse in-phase clocks while the &#x398;<sub>Q </sub>and <o ostyle="single">&#x398;</o><sub>Q </sub>are known as the quadrature and inverse quadrature clocks. The load on each of these clock nodes is identical insuring that the clock output is evenly loaded, thereby preventing any skew between these clock signals from developing. The LNA outputs are applied to common nodes <b>6</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>4</b> of the upper and lower mixer switches. The LNA feeds the amplified signal from a source through the LNA to the coupling capacitor C<sub>coup</sub>. The capacitor C<sub>coup </sub>couples the output signal of the LNA to the common nodes <b>6</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>4</b> of the two mixer switches. Since the upper mixer switch is clocked by the in-phase clocks, only the in-phase current component I<sub>I </sub>is converted into if<sub>Iout </sub>and since the lower mixer switch is clocked by the quadrature-phase clocks, only the quadrature-phase current component I<sub>Q </sub>is converted into if<sub>Qout</sub>.</p>

Unlike the Gilbert mixer, this embodiment of mixer switches is driven by the average AC current output of the LNA to power the inventive mixer. The mixer switch M<sub>25 </sub>clocked by the one of the quadrature clocks and the load capacitance of the mixer switch M<sub>25 </sub>is the gate capacitance of M<sub>23 </sub>which together form a switched capacitor circuit. The switched capacitor presents a load resistive to the resonant circuit of the LNA according to R<sub>L</sub>=1/((C<sub>M23</sub>)(f<sub>&#x398;</sub>)) where R<sub>L </sub>is the load resistance placed in parallel to the resonant circuit, C<sub>M23 </sub>is the capacitance of the load device M<sub>23 </sub>and f<sub>&#x398;</sub> is the frequency of the quadrature clock.
