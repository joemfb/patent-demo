<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the application can include computer program code that is executable by a processor of a computer (e.g., personal computer, laptop, gaming machine, smart phone, etc.) and/or a processing unit of a server and can be accessed by a user via the computer. The computer can be in communication with the server via a network to receive and transmit information through a web-based program controlled by the application. This information, such as tournament variables, user information, and other program information, as further described below, can be stored on a computer-readable medium of the computer (e.g., a computer storage unit) and/or on a computer-readable medium of the server (e.g., a server database). In some embodiments, the entire application or a portion of the application can be stored on the computer. In other embodiments, the entire application or a portion of the application can be stored on the server and can be accessed by the computer when the server and the computer are connected via the common network.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, a user can create a tournament either directly through the application stored on the computer or through the application on the server via the web-based program. The application can allow the user to create personalized tournaments to suit the user's personal interests. For example, the user can personalize the tournament by including and defining a number of variables. In some embodiments, the variables can comprise a number of users allowed, an entry fee and prize pool, a bankroll, specific event details (e.g., tracks or races), a minimum wager amount, bet types, tournament length, and other related variables. In some embodiments, some of the different options for tournament variables can be predetermined so that the user can choose from the predetermined options for at least some of the variables.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the user can become a member of the web-based program in order to create the tournament via the application. For example, the user can create a profile. In the user's profile, the user can input their personal information including physical and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, financial institution information, and other similar biographical information. Further, the user's profile can be used to keep track of information such as wager history, withdrawal history, account history, and other financial and biographical histories. After creating a user profile, in some embodiments, the user can create tournaments, among other possible user options. Once the user creates a tournament, as described in more detail below, the tournament can be available to other users, including the user's friends or other web-based program members (e.g., users using different computers connected to the server via the network) so that others can request to join the tournament. More specifically, the user's friends or other members of the web-based program can then join the tournament, and can become contestants in the user's player made tournament.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each contestant can provide necessary funds to join the tournament, such as a bankroll and an entry fee. For example, each contestant can remit funds into a tournament bankroll account and a pool entry fee account associated with each tournament (i.e., each player made tournament can include its own pool entry fee account and its own bankroll account). Information about the bankroll accounts and pool entry fee accounts can be stored in the database on the server.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, in some embodiments, users can create personal member accounts, and information regarding the personal member accounts can be stored in the database. In some embodiments, the personal member account can function substantially as an intermediary between the users' personal funds sources (i.e., bank accounts, credit card accounts, or other similar accounts) and the bankroll and pool entry fee accounts. More specifically, in some embodiments, initially, funds can be transferred from the user's personal funds sources into the user's personal member account associated with the web-based program. Then, in some embodiments, funds can be transferred from the personal member account into the bankroll accounts and pool entry fee accounts for each tournament the user joins and/or creates.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the pool entry fee account can include a prize pool (e.g., a $10 entry from each of 10 users results in a $100 prize pool) and the prize pool can be awarded to a tournament winner or winners at the end of the tournament. For example, the entire prize pool can be awarded to the tournament winner, or can be divided among a top number of contestants. In some embodiments, the user can personalize how the prize pool is awarded during creation of the tournament (e.g., how many top contestants will receive a portion of the prize pool, how portions of the prize pool are split between top contestants, how portions of the prize pool are split in tie situations, etc.). The bankroll account can be accessed by the user throughout the tournament (e.g., to permit live betting), and whatever funds remaining in the member's bankroll account at the end of the tournament can be returned to their personal member accounts.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Moreover, in some embodiments, the web-based program can comprise both guaranteed-prize and non-guaranteed-prize tournaments. More specifically, in some embodiments, a non-guaranteed-prize tournament can comprise, as previously mentioned, tournaments where the prize pool can vary depending on the number of contestants who enter so that the minimum amount of prize money can be zero, if no users join the tournament. In some embodiments, the web-based program can guarantee the minimum amount of the prize pool, so that regardless of the number of contestants, and their respective contributions to the pool entry fees, the prize pool will include some dollar value greater than zero (i.e., a guaranteed prize pool).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The following paragraphs describe a web-based program controlled by the application according to some embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, a user can access the web-based program <b>10</b> via a computer and can &#x201c;log in&#x201d; to the application through the web-based program. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a login page <b>12</b> displayed by the web-based program <b>10</b>, as controlled by the application. In some embodiments, during the process of becoming a member of the web-based program <b>10</b>, the user can create a username and a password, so that when the user wishes to gain access to the web-based program <b>10</b>, the user can input their username and their password into the username field <b>14</b> and password field <b>16</b> on the login page <b>12</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments, the user can select from which state in the United States the user is accessing the site. For example, the user can select their current location from a &#x201c;drop-down&#x201d; current location list <b>18</b> on the login page <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to some embodiments of the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, after logging in to the web-based program <b>10</b>, the user can make their initial selections from a main-menu page <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the main-menu page <b>20</b> can be sport-specific. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in some embodiments, the main-menu page can comprise information regarding horse racing, and in other embodiments, the main-menu page can comprise information regarding other sports, such as dog racing. In some embodiments, the user can toggle between the main-menu pages <b>20</b> comprising horse racing information and the main menu page comprising information regarding dog racing by selecting horse racing <b>46</b> and greyhounds <b>48</b>, respectively, in the main menu <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the main-menu page can include a main menu <b>22</b>. The main menu <b>22</b> can include several pages to which the user can navigate. For example, the user can navigate to fantasy sports pages <b>24</b>, other games <b>26</b>, a my account page <b>28</b> (i.e., a page including the user's history and biographical information), a listing of the current day's races <b>30</b>, a listing of results from recent races <b>32</b>, a calendar of recent and future racing events <b>34</b>, a live video link <b>36</b> (i.e., users using different computers connected to the server via the network can view video images of live races through the web-based program), a store page <b>38</b>, a tournament main page <b>40</b>, a rewards page <b>42</b>, and a refer-a-friend page <b>44</b>. In some embodiments, the main-menu page <b>20</b> can comprise more options to which a user can navigate, and in other embodiments, the main-menu page <b>20</b> can comprise fewer options. Furthermore, in some embodiments, many of the different pages of the web-based program <b>10</b> can include a substantially similar main menu <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Also, in some embodiments, the main-menu page <b>20</b> can include a user-data frame <b>50</b>. More specifically the user-data frame <b>50</b> can comprise information related to the user's personal member account and other funds information. For example, the user-data frame <b>24</b> can include information such as, but not limited to, the user's personal member account balance, point balance, referral sign-ups, and lifetime referral rewards. The main-menu page <b>20</b> can further include other potentially useful information such as pick of the day (i.e., a racing expert providing helpful information on wager selection), carryover selections, and a display of track locations and schedules.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to some embodiments of the invention, if the user wishes to enter, create, or learn about tournaments, they can navigate to the tournament main page <b>40</b>. From the tournament main page <b>40</b>, the user can view a &#x201c;My Tournaments&#x201d; table <b>52</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the &#x201c;My Tournaments&#x201d; table <b>52</b> can comprise tournaments in which the user is participating. Also, in some embodiments, the tournament main page <b>40</b> can comprise a &#x201c;Featured Tournaments&#x201d; table <b>54</b> and a &#x201c;Player Made Tournaments&#x201d; table <b>56</b>. In some embodiments, the &#x201c;Featured Tournaments&#x201d; table <b>54</b> can comprise tournaments created by the web-based program in which substantially all users can participate. Further, in some embodiments, the &#x201c;Player Made Tournaments&#x201d; table <b>56</b> can comprise tournaments created by users in which other users can participate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the user can view information about tournaments, including operational parameter data, such as start dates <b>58</b>, end dates <b>60</b>, current bankrolls <b>62</b>, current rank <b>64</b> (i.e., among all contestants in the tournament), current return on investment <b>66</b> (ROI), and status <b>68</b> in the &#x201c;My Tournaments&#x201d; table <b>52</b>. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the user can view tournament names <b>70</b> and information about tournaments they have yet to join including start dates <b>72</b>, end dates <b>74</b>, entry fees <b>76</b>, bankrolls <b>78</b>, number of players participating <b>79</b>, tournament statuses <b>80</b>, and a &#x201c;starts in&#x201d; entry <b>81</b> (i.e., a countdown timer letting users know about how much time remains before the tournament begins) via the &#x201c;Featured Tournaments&#x201d; table <b>54</b> and the &#x201c;Player Made Tournaments&#x201d; table <b>56</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments, the tournament main page <b>40</b> can include a &#x201c;Top Winners&#x201d; table <b>82</b>, which can display the total prize money won by players in descending order from most earned downward.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a tournament detail page <b>84</b> displayed by the web-based program, as controlled by the application. In some embodiments, through the tournament detail page <b>84</b>, the user can view more details of particular tournaments that they joined or that they may join by selecting one of the tournaments listed in one of the tables <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. In some embodiments, the tournament detail page <b>84</b> can include generally relevant information about the selected tournament, such as, operational parameters of the selected tournament. For example, in some embodiments, the tournament detail page <b>84</b> can include information such as current players <b>86</b> (i.e., users who are already contestants in this tournament), wager history <b>88</b> of the tournament, tournament history <b>90</b>, and contest settings <b>92</b> (i.e., the operational parameters of the tournament such as bankroll, prize pool, prize distribution, bet types, etc.). In some embodiments, users can view this information in order to make informed decisions about whether they wish to join or continue to participate in the selected tournament. In some embodiments, the users viewing the tournament detail page <b>84</b> can decide to submit a request to participate in the tournament selected, although, users need not view the tournament detail page <b>84</b> to participate in the selected tournament. In some embodiments, a user may not be satisfied or find acceptable the information on the tournament detail page <b>84</b> so that the user may wish to create their own tournament with the user's own operational parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the user can navigate to a tournament creation page <b>94</b> displayed by the web-based program, as controlled by the application. Through the tournament creation page <b>94</b>, the user can create their own tournament. In some embodiments, the tournament creation page <b>94</b> can display different tournament variables <b>96</b> and different options <b>98</b> for each variable <b>96</b> from which the user can select. In some embodiments, the user can navigate to the tournament creation page by selecting a &#x201c;create new tournament&#x201d; link <b>100</b> on the tournament main page <b>84</b> or by selecting &#x201c;create tournament&#x201d; under the link to the tournament main page <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the tournament creation page <b>94</b> can comprise several different tournament variables <b>96</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the tournament variables <b>96</b> can comprise a tournament name <b>102</b>, a tournament description <b>104</b>, a maximum number of players <b>106</b>, a tournament type <b>108</b>, a number of players paid out <b>110</b> (i.e., a prize disbursement structure), a tournament fee <b>112</b> (i.e., the entry fee that feeds the prize pool), a bankroll <b>114</b>, tracks and dates <b>116</b>, bet types <b>118</b>, a minimum total number of wagers <b>120</b>, maximum total number of wagers <b>122</b>, a minimum amount per wager <b>124</b>, a maximum amount per wager <b>126</b>, minimum number of wagers for every race <b>128</b>, and a maximum number of wagers for every race <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the tournament creation page <b>94</b> can include combinations of the previously mentioned variables, and in other embodiments, the tournament creation page <b>94</b> can include other similar variables.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the tournament creation page <b>94</b> can include at least one option <b>98</b> for at least some of the variables <b>96</b>. In some embodiments, depending on the variables <b>96</b>, the options <b>98</b> can comprise different potential values. In some embodiments, the tournament creation page <b>94</b> also can include at least one field <b>97</b> corresponding to some of the variables <b>96</b>. The field <b>97</b> can be configured to receive option data input by the user. For example, in some embodiments, variables <b>96</b> such as, but not limited to, the tournament name <b>102</b> and tournament description <b>104</b> can be limited only by a maximum number of characters the user inputs, and the user can input substantially any characters for these variables <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> into the corresponding field. For some other variables <b>96</b>, such as, but not limited to the tournament type <b>108</b>, the number of players paid out <b>110</b>, the tournament fee <b>112</b>, etc., two options can include at least one pre-determined option and a custom option field <b>97</b>. More specifically, in some embodiments, some of the variables <b>96</b> can include pre-determined options <b>98</b> from which the user can select, and, in some embodiments, the user can select the custom setting and input an option into the field <b>97</b>. For example, for the bankroll option <b>114</b>, when creating a tournament, the user can select from a pre-determined list of bankroll variables (i.e., $20, $50, $100, $200, or $500) or the user can select &#x201c;custom&#x201d; and input, into the field <b>97</b>, a funds amount not present in the pre-determined list of bankroll variables (i.e., $125). In some embodiments, the operational parameters can substantially comprise the options input by the user for each of the variables so that the user's options selections generally manifest as the rules governing the player made tournament.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the user can input and/or select the options <b>98</b> for each of the variables <b>96</b> to create their own tournament. For example, the user can select whether the tournament is a bankroll-type tournament or an ROI-type tournament. More specifically, in some embodiments, the user can determine whether the overall winner of the tournament is the individual with the largest bankroll after all of the races comprising the tournament are substantially completed. In other embodiments, the user can determine whether the overall winner of the tournament is the individual who earned the largest return on their investment based on their wagers during the races comprising the tournament, as calculated by the application running the web-based program. Also, in some embodiments, the user can determine prize distribution. In some embodiments, the user can determine whether the winner receives 100% of the prize pool (i.e., a winner-takes-all tournament) or the prize pool can be divided among the top-finishing participants, be it with a top-finishing bankroll or a top-finishing ROI.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, in some embodiments, the user can input options into the select tracks and dates <b>116</b> variable by selecting races at certain tracks on certain dates. By selecting the select tracks and dates <b>116</b> variable, the user can be presented with list including real tracks and real times of real races occurring throughout North America for up to two weeks in advance. In some embodiments, the user can select tracks and dates from locations in different countries throughout the world. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a sample track and date schedule page including a schedule of dates and tracks the user can choose from after selecting the tracks and dates <b>116</b> variable. In some embodiments, the user can select at least one track and date from the list, and in other embodiments, the user can select multiple tracks and dates from the list. In some embodiments, the selected tracks and dates <b>116</b> can substantially determine the start and end of the tournament.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The server database can store information regarding tournaments, tracks, and users in database tables.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Embodiments of the present invention may be practiced with various computer system configurations including hand-held devices, microprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers and the like. The invention can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a wire-based or wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With the above embodiments in mind, it should be understood that the invention can employ various computer-implemented operations involving data stored in computer systems. These operations are those requiring physical manipulation of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared and otherwise manipulated.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Any of the operations described herein that form part of the invention are useful machine operations. The invention also relates to a device or an apparatus for performing these operations. The apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purpose, such as a special purpose computer. When defined as a special purpose computer, the computer can also perform other processing, program execution or routines that are not part of the special purpose, while still being capable of operating for the special purpose. Alternatively, the operations may be processed by a general purpose computer selectively activated or configured by one or more computer programs stored in the computer memory, cache, or obtained over a network. When data is obtained over a network the data may be processed by other computers on the network, e.g. a cloud of computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The embodiments of the present invention can also be defined as a machine that transforms data from one state to another state. The data may represent an article, that can be represented as an electronic signal and electronically manipulate data. The transformed data can, in some cases, be visually depicted on a display, representing the physical object that results from the transformation of data. The transformed data can be saved to storage generally, or in particular formats that enable the construction or depiction of a physical and tangible object. In some embodiments, the manipulation can be performed by a processor. In such an example, the processor thus transforms the data from one thing to another. Still further, the methods can be processed by one or more machines or processors that can be connected over a network. Each machine can transform data from one state or thing to another, and can also process data, save data to storage, transmit data over a network, display the result, or communicate the result to another machine. Computer-readable storage media, as used herein, refers to physical or tangible storage (as opposed to signals) and includes without limitation volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable storage media implemented in any method or technology for the tangible storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium may be any data storage device that can store data, which can thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of the computer readable medium include hard drives, network attached storage (NAS), read-only memory, random-access memory, FLASH based memory, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, CD-RWs, DVDs, magnetic tapes, other optical and non-optical data storage devices, or any other physical or material medium which can be used to tangibly store the desired information or data or instructions and which can be accessed by a computer or processor. The computer readable medium can also be distributed over a network coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code may be stored and executed in a distributed fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although the method operations were described in a specific order, it should be understood that other housekeeping operations may be performed in between operations, or operations may be adjusted so that they occur at slightly different times, or may be distributed in a system which allows the occurrence of the processing operations at various intervals associated with the processing, as long as the processing of the overlay operations are performed in the desired way.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that while the invention has been described above in connection with particular embodiments and examples, the invention is not necessarily so limited, and that numerous other embodiments, examples, uses, modifications and departures from the embodiments, examples and uses are intended to be encompassed by the claims attached hereto. The entire disclosure of each patent and publication cited herein is incorporated by reference, as if each such patent or publication were individually incorporated by reference herein.</p>
