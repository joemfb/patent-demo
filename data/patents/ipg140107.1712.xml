<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates generally to medical imaging devices used during surgical procedures to visualize a surgical area, and more particularly, to an endoscopy device having a single unitary non-slip tubing for irrigation, suction, electrical power, imaging data, and the thermal management of integral Light Emitting Diode (LED) light sources using liquid filled cooling chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typically, a health care provider may use endoscopy for the investigation of symptoms, confirmation of a diagnosis, or for giving treatment. Generally, endoscopy is used to visualize and explore an anatomical cavity. Endoscopy, when directed toward a specific anatomical application, may be referred to by terminology specific to the endoscopic application. For example, arthroscopy is generally used to visualize and explore a large joint such as the knee, hip, or the shoulder or smaller joints such as the wrist, elbow, and ankle. Accordingly, arthroscopy helps eliminate the need for conventional and relatively invasive surgery on the joints. The terms arthroscopy and endoscopy are used interchangeably and both generally relate to medical imaging devices used during surgical procedures to visualize a surgical area.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional arthroscopy entails insertion, under anesthesia, of a probe into a joint to be examined. The probe assembly typically comprises a high-definition camera and a light source. Conventional arthroscopy light sources generate light using halogen bulbs, which generate an excessive amount of heat. Excessive heat is usually managed with a fan. Said light source is attached to a fiber-optic cable to transmit the light from the light source to the arthroscope. The joint is usually distended for better visualization of the interior structures of the anatomical cavity, which is accomplished by injecting sterile irrigation fluid. Said irrigation fluid is injected into the joint through irrigation portals. The rate of flow and the pressure of the fluid are controlled by the surgeon. The irrigation fluid is subsequently sucked out under vacuum and through suction channels conveniently located into the arthroscope shaft. The suction and irrigation tubing as well as the power cable for the high definition camera are assembled at the time of surgery and connected to the appropriate units. However, they are laid down onto the surgical field, which becomes congested with several cables and wires, which may become entangled, or slide off the operative field and become contaminated. The plurality of tubing and cables attached to the arthroscope may also become cumbersome and reduce the dexterity of the surgeon.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">That main problem with conventional arthroscopy unit is that the halogen light source becomes excessively hot requiring a fan or other cooling process. Furthermore, the fiber optic light transmission cable is fragile and sustains considerable damage from repetitive sterilization process causing breakage of the individual sintered fibers and progressive loss of the transmitted light intensity. U.S. Pat. No. 7,668,450 describes the use of multiple LED light sources. However, they seem to generate a substantial amount of heat, which requires a cooling device such as an external heat sink and a Peltier device. These can be cumbersome and expensive. They may get considerably hot themselves and may inflict injury to the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">US Pat. Application Publication 2008/0064931 A1 describes one or more channels which may carry cooling fluid. However, the LED elements are mounted on aluminum or ceramic plate or substrate, which is bonded to the cooling channel. There is no direct contact of the cooling fluid with the LED elements, Furthermore; the fluid is directed across the imaging lenses to clear body fluid or tissue debris.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While these devices may be suitable for the particular purpose to which they address, they are not suitable for providing a liquid cooled integral LED light source for endoscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A major improvement provided by the instant invention is a single tube comprising irrigation/suction tubes, cable and LED power supply cable for the camera all in a singular non-slip tube attached to the outer scope unit with a simple &#x201c;Quick Connect&#x201d; mechanism.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the forgoing disadvantages inherent in conventional endoscopy units now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new liquid cooled endoscopy unit having a single irrigation and suction tubing construction and a light source capable conveniently of emitting UV light for the purpose of fluorescein endoscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new liquid cooling chamber to reduce the heat generated by the integral LED light source during an arthroscopic procedure. Furthermore, the present invention describes an endoscopy unit having single tubing for housing the power supply, camera cable and irrigation and suction drains. The new system has many of the advantages of the conventional endoscopy unit and many novel features that result in a new liquid cooled endoscopy unit comprising a single housing for irrigation suction tubing and power supply cords, which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested or even implied by any of the prior art conventional arthroscopes and is, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To attain this, the present invention generally comprises an circular LED base containing plurality of LED elements. Said circular base having a hollow core to allow sterile irrigation fluid commonly used in endoscopy procedures to circulate through and come in direct contact with the waterproofed LED elements thereby reducing any heat generated by the LED light source Unit. Said cooling chamber comprises ingress and egress irrigation channels as well as quick connect attachments for the LED power supply and camera power data cable and power supply. The LED unit comprises one or more LED light elements capable of providing sufficient white light for ease of viewing. The LED unit can also provide on demand ultraviolet blue light for fluorescein endoscopy. This being very helpful in detecting small and superficial damage to the articular cartilage that can be missed with strong conventional white light. This technique is widely used by ophthalmologists to detect superficial corneal abrasions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the present invention in order that the detailed description thereof may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced in out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of the description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other objectives and advantages of the present invention will become obvious to the reader and it is intended that these objects and advantages are within the scope of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several views, the attached figures illustrate liquid cooled endoscopy unit having a single irrigation and suction tubing which also houses the light source power supply as well as the camera cord and power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The liquid cooled endoscopy LED light source <b>5</b> as described comprises a plurality of LED light source <b>5</b> capable of providing sufficient white light for ease of viewing located within the cooling chamber <b>7</b>. Said light source can also provide ultraviolet blue light on-demand for fluorescein endoscopy. The LED light sources <b>5</b> are embedded into a circular waterproof light source base <b>6</b> which provide a hollow central portion <b>42</b> which will allow the sterile irrigation fluid to go through (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.) During its passage, the cool sterile irrigation fluid will come in direct contact with the LED light source <b>5</b> elements and reduce any excessive heat generated by the LED elements. The irrigation fluid will then be channeled to the distal tip of the arthroscope by irrigation channel <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, the LED light source is capable conveniently of emitting UV light for fluorescein endoscopy where one or more LED units are capable of producing UV light for the purpose of performing blue light fluorescein endoscopy. This inventive technique will highlight small articular and cartilaginous defect, which are not visible under conventional white light but will fluoresce vividly under blue light. This technique is readily used by ophthalmologists to detect corneal abrasions.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The circular waterproof light source base <b>6</b> is situated in the central portion of the cooling chamber <b>7</b> located at the proximal end of the arthroscope. Axially located is the optical tube <b>18</b> containing a variable number of Hopkins lenses <b>2</b>. Proximally, the optical tube <b>18</b> is attached to the eyepiece <b>19</b> via optical cone <b>9</b>. The ocular piece having a centrally located ocular lens <b>8</b> for transmission of the picture to a digital camera <b>37</b>. The cooling chamber <b>7</b> provides a quick connect extension <b>39</b> situated to the side of said chamber, where irrigation inflow port <b>14</b>, outflow port <b>11</b>, power supply connection receptacle for the LED light source <b>12</b>, and data and power connection receptacle <b>15</b> are situated. The port communicates with the suction channel <b>4</b> situated inside the shaft of the arthroscope. The optical tube <b>18</b> can be conveniently removed using threads <b>46</b> for ease of sterilization or optical maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The light generated by the LED elements will then be collected by lens <b>16</b> and transmitted to the distal tip of the arthroscope <b>17</b> via light channel <b>3</b> located in the shaft of the arthroscope.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A major improvement provided by the present invention is the elimination of multiple hoses and cables encumbering the surgical field, which may become entangled or slide off in the field and become contaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tubes, drains and cables are enclosed in a single non-slip tube <b>35</b> that is quickly and easily connected to the quick connect extension <b>39</b> of the arthroscope unit <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) Once the proximal end of the non-slip tubing <b>35</b> is inserted onto the quick connect extension <b>39</b> where each plug and tube is inserted into the corresponding port, the quick connect is then secured in place by tightening the locking nut <b>38</b>. The proximal end of the inflow tube <b>29</b> will snuggly fit into the female irrigation port located at quick connect extension <b>39</b>. The proximal end of the outflow suction tube <b>30</b> will be inserted into the corresponding female suction port <b>11</b>. Similarly, power supply cable <b>33</b> will be inserted into its corresponding female power supply receptacle and camera and power data cable <b>32</b> will be inserted into its corresponding female data and power connection receptacle <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Sealing rings <b>34</b> are situated around the base of each of the outflow and irrigation inflow ports to provide tight seals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The sealing rings <b>34</b> may be made, for example, from silicone, rubber, or any other material(s) known to provide a tight seal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, shows a cross sectional view of the non-slip single tubing <b>35</b> where the body of the tube is constructed from soft open cell foam <b>36</b>. In a different embodiment, the open cell foam <b>36</b> can be replaced with closed cell foam <b>36</b>. A protective non-slip sheath <b>41</b> covers the entire body of the tubing cable. Said sheath can be constructed from a siliconized material with appropriate surface finish to prevent sliding off once placed onto the sterile drapes of the surgical field.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Yet in another embodiment, the single tubing housing can be constructed from malleable plastic tubing or conduit without the foam core. The suction irrigation and data/power supply cords are placed within the single plastic tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The non-slip tube provides a longitudinal slice <b>40</b> situated along the entire length of the tubing at the level of the outflow suction tube <b>30</b> to allow easy and exchange incase the suction tubing is plugged by tissue debris.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the arthroscope is then attached to the digital camera <b>37</b> by inserting the proximal end of the arthroscope into the recess of the camera after aligning the camera data plug <b>44</b> and inserting it into the corresponding data receptacle <b>47</b> located onto the face of the digital camera <b>37</b>. This will align the ocular lens <b>8</b> of the arthroscope with the camera lens <b>45</b>. The arthroscope's locking rim <b>10</b> will then be firmly locked in place by the camera's locking rotating ring <b>43</b>. Other locking mechanisms known in the art may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The endoscopic imaging apparatus may be constructed from a light metallic alloy, a plastic or a composite material and may be disposable after a single use.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is to be understood that the above-described arrangements are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the disclosure. Numerous modifications and alternative arrangements may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure and the claims are intended to cover such modifications and arrangements. Thus, while the disclosure has been shown in the drawings and described above with particularity and detail, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications, including, but not limited to, variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use may be made without departing from the principles and concepts set forth herein.</p>
