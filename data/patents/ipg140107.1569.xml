<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Apparatus and methods for fabricating an interposer that may be used in testing a large number of electronic circuits or devices in parallel. The interposer may be fabricated from a plurality of modules that may be assembled into a selected shape, such that the assembled modules substantially fill the selected shape, e.g., a circle approximately the size of a semiconductor wafer. The plurality of modules may be formed from a single base shape (e.g., formed from a single injection mold). A portion of the formed modules may be machined into a first machined shape, or first and second machined shapes. The assembled modules may include only the base shape and first machined shape or first and second machined shapes. The limited number of shapes can reduce fabrication costs for an interposer.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the invention relate to probe-card interposers useful for testing a large number of integrated circuits and/or integrated circuit devices in parallel. Apparatus and methods for making probe-card interposers from a limited number of modules derived from a single base shape are disclosed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Probe-card interposers, also referred to herein as &#x201c;interposers,&#x201d; are used as a component of an electronic testing system, also referred to herein as a &#x201c;tester.&#x201d; The tester and interposer may be used for electrical testing of integrated circuits and/or integrated circuit devices. In general, the tester may generate a plurality of test signals that are routed through an interposer to specific contact points on integrated circuits or integrated devices. There may be an adapter, also referred to herein as a &#x201c;translator,&#x201d; between the interposer and circuits or devices under test. The adapter may provide a spatial mapping for signal paths on the interposer to a distribution of probes on the translator that align to the contact points specific to the devices or circuits under test. An interposer can provide a separable connection between the tester and translator, so that different translators may be used on the testing system with different circuit and device layouts.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In semiconductor manufacturing, it is generally economically advantageous to parallelize manufacturing steps for as many devices and/or circuits as possible. Accordingly, a reduction in device size and increase in wafer size beneficially results in a greater number of devices being produced with each manufacturing step. This can, however, place greater demands on the manufacturing equipment. In this regard for a tester, smaller devices can require a higher density of probes and probe circuitry in a fixed area and increase demands on alignment of probes to contact points. Large test areas may require the handling and management of a large number of signals in the tester. Reductions in device size and increase in wafer size can require interposers of larger size capable of handling a large number of test signals from the tester and response signals from the devices and circuits under test.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The inventors have recognized and appreciated that large interposers for testing large areas may be made with a high density of conductors at low cost compared to conventional approaches. The interposer may comprise modules of a small number of shapes that may be readily assembled into an interposer of a selected shape, e.g., a circle. The inventors have further recognized that the small number of shapes can be fabricated from a base shape and few shapes that are machined from the base shape. The base shape may be injection molded initially, e.g., molded in the shape of a hexagon. In some embodiments, the same base shape may be used for wafers of different sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some embodiments of the invention, an interposer comprises a plurality of modules, each module being in a shape selected from the following group: a first shape, a first portion of the first shape, and a second portion of the first shape. The plurality of modules, when assembled into the interposer, may substantially fill a circle circumscribing the interposer. As one example, the first shape may be a hexagon.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the interposer comprises a plurality of modules or blocks, each module or block being in a shape selected from a first shape or a portion of the first shape. The first shape may be a polygon having more than four sides.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments also include an interposer block useful for making an interposer. The interposer block may comprise a hexagonally-shaped element comprising a first surface, a second surface, and six edge surfaces. The block may further include at least one alignment feature near a first apex of the hexagonally-shaped element for aligning the block in an interposer comprising a plurality of the hexagonally-shaped elements. The interposer block may further comprise a plurality of conductive structures distributed across the hexagonally-shaped element.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method for fabricating an interposer, according to one embodiment of the invention, include acts of forming a plurality of modules of a first shape; and machining a portion of the plurality of modules into not more than a second shape and a third shape. Further, the first shape, second shape, and optionally third shape are selected such that modules of the first, second, and optionally third shapes may be assembled to substantially fill a circle circumscribing the assembled modules. All shapes may have common alignment features, e.g., alignment features that are located in a substantially identical arrangement on each piece and at substantially identical locations with respect to a reference location or reference locations common to each piece. The filling of the circle may comprise covering an area of the circle that is greater than 90% in some embodiments, greater than 95% in some embodiments, and yet greater than 98% in some embodiments. In some alternative embodiments, more than three pieces may be used, wherein each piece is derived from a common first shape.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Interposers, as used in testers, can participate in facilitating massively parallel interconnections between test circuitry in a tester and a large number of devices distributed on a test sample such as a wafer. The inventors have appreciated that design and fabrication of interposers may be labor or cost intensive due to a large number of electrical interconnects at high density that may be required for interposers. As an example, electronic contacts on an interposer may be required to be spaced by about 0.8 millimeter over an area approximately the size of a full wafer having a diameter of about 300 millimeters, and in some cases a diameter up to about 450 mm. The inventors have recognized that the interposer should be adapted for incorporation into a probe assembly that can accommodate a variety of circuit patterns and circuit densities, as well as provide a high number of electrical contacts (e.g., in the tens of thousands) at high density so that full-wafer testing may be performed. The inventors also appreciate that it would be desirable to minimize retooling costs associated with industry changes (e.g., scaling a tester probe assembly due to a change in semiconductor wafer size) or variations in wafer sizes from facility to facility.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In consideration of the foregoing, the inventors have conceived of methods and apparatus for making interposers from a plurality of modules derived from a single module shape. Each module may include a substantially uniform and high density of electrical contacts distributed across substantially all of the module's electrically interconnecting surfaces. The interposer may be scaled in size without substantial redesign, and with modest retooling costs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this regard, an interposer may be readily assembled into a selected shape, e.g., a circle approximately the size of a wafer, from modules of a small number of shapes. The modules may include the base shape and few additional shapes that are machined from the base shape. In one embodiment, the small number of modules consists of a base shape, comprising a hexagon, and two additional shapes, each machined portions of the hexagon. The base shape module may be injection molded, so that only one tooling cost for an injection mold is required. Additionally, each module or piece may share alignment features that are substantially identically arranged and located on each piece. The common alignment features provide for use of a single assembly machine when assembling or manufacturing each interposer module. The common alignment features also provide for use of a single test fixture to electrically test each piece.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A large size is selected for each interposer module such that few pieces in total are required for assembly of the interposer. When larger pieces are chosen, there are fewer assembly steps due to a fewer number of pieces, and there are fewer borders between assembled pieces within the area of the assembled interposer. Borders can lead to areas that are not usable for probing underlying devices. Also, fewer pieces result in less tooling for alignment features.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In overview and referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a tester <b>102</b> and probe assembly <b>140</b> is depicted in block diagram according to one embodiment of the invention. The tester and probe assembly may be used to test, in parallel, a large number of integrated circuits and/or integrated circuit devices (not shown) distributed on a test sample <b>130</b>, e.g., a wafer containing the circuits and/or devices. The testing may be carried out at frequencies down to about 10 megahertz (MHz) and/or at high frequencies, e.g., frequencies up to 100 MHz in some implementations, frequencies up to one gigahertz (GHz) in some embodiments, and yet frequencies up to tens of GHz in some embodiments. The probe assembly <b>140</b> may provide a large number of electrical interconnects that convey test signals from test circuitry (not shown) in the tester <b>102</b> to the integrated circuits and/or integrated circuit devices that are located on a test sample <b>130</b>, e.g., a wafer. The probe assembly <b>140</b> may also provide a large number of electrical interconnects that return signals from the integrated circuits and/or integrated circuit devices to test circuitry in the tester <b>102</b> for analyses. Analyses of the returned signals may provide a qualitative and/or quantitative determination of operational performance of the integrated circuits and/or integrated circuit devices. In this manner, high frequency, and high parallelism testing and analysis can be carried out over an area that conforms approximately to the size of a wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The tester <b>102</b> is shown in block diagram, and may comprise at least one signal generation source, at least one signal detector, and at least one processor for generating or altering at least one generated signal and/or processing at least one detected signal. The tester may include a large number of electrical connection pads or connection pins that may be connected to mating connection structures on the probe assembly <b>140</b>. Such a tester may be implemented using known techniques and further aspects of the tester need not be described.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The probe assembly <b>140</b> facilitates massively parallel interconnection between test circuitry in the tester <b>102</b> and a plurality of circuits and/or devices disposed on the test sample <b>130</b>. The test sample <b>130</b> may be a wafer, e.g., a customer's wafer. The probe assembly <b>140</b> may comprise a stiffener <b>105</b>, a probe interface board (PIB) <b>110</b>, an interposer <b>300</b>, and a translator <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the sealing members <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> may or may not be included with the probe assembly. In some implementations, the member <b>115</b> may comprise a stiffening bracket, and may or may not have sealing functionality. The probe assembly <b>140</b> may be assembled as a stack when used with the tester <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The stiffener <b>105</b> may comprise a rigid component to which the PIB <b>110</b>, interposer <b>300</b>, and translator <b>120</b> may be secured. The stiffener may provide mechanical features for aligning and/or fastening the probe assembly <b>140</b> to the tester <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the stiffener provides a high degree of flatness as well as rigidity to the probe assembly. The stiffener <b>105</b> may comprise a rigid material, e.g., a metal, a ceramic, a glass, a crystalline material, a rigid polymer, a composite, or any combination thereof. The stiffener may be provided to reduce flexibility of the assembled stack, as known in the art or in any other suitable way.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The probe interface board <b>110</b> may comprise a printed circuit board with mating electrical connection features that connect to the tester <b>102</b>. The PIB may include a plurality of electrical traces to route signals from the tester to one or more electrical interconnects on the interposer, and to route signals from the interposer to one or more signal detection channels in the tester <b>102</b>. The PIB <b>110</b> may be configured to attach to the stiffener <b>105</b>. The PIB <b>110</b> may be substantially planar and of any shape (e.g., round, oval, square, rectangular, star-shaped, etc.) The PIB <b>110</b> may be larger in area than the test sample <b>130</b>. Though, specific size is not critical, and in some embodiments the PIB may be smaller in area than the test sample. The PIB <b>110</b> may further include electrically conductive or contact features, e.g., pads or extending elements, on at least one surface, e.g., on a first surface facing the tester and on a second surface facing the interposer. Contact features on the second surface may come into contact with contact elements on the interposer <b>300</b>. The PIB may also include at least one alignment feature (e.g., hole, pin, tab, divot, slot, groove, etc.) for participating in aligning the PIB <b>110</b> to the stiffener <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The probe interface board <b>110</b> may include a plurality of alignment features that participate in the alignment of the PIB with other components in the probe assembly <b>140</b> including the interposer. In some implementations, the PIB may include a first plurality of alignment features (e.g., holes or slots for receiving alignment pins <b>112</b>, protruding alignment tabs, permanently attached alignment pins, divot, slot, groove etc.). Alignment pins <b>112</b> may be used to align and/or secure modules of the interposer <b>300</b> to the PIB <b>110</b> so that conductive contact elements on the interposer align to mating contact features on the PIB <b>110</b>. Although the drawing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the pins inserted into the PIB <b>110</b>, in some embodiments, the alignment pins <b>112</b> may first be inserted into the interposer modules, which are then subsequently affixed to holes in the PIB <b>110</b> using the alignment pins <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The interposer <b>300</b> may be disposed in the probe assembly <b>140</b> between the probe interface board and translator, and configured to convey electrical signals between the probe interface board and translator. The interposer may comprise a plurality of modules that may be aligned and/or secured to the PIB <b>110</b> using any suitable alignment features, e.g., aligned using alignment pins <b>112</b>. Each module of the interposer may include a plurality of conductive members that may be used to connect at least one conducting structure, e.g., a contact pad or tab, on the PIB <b>110</b> to at least one conducting structure on the translator <b>120</b>. The interposer may be substantially planar, and of any shape. In preferred embodiments, the interposer <b>300</b> may be round and approximately the size of a semiconductor wafer. The interposer <b>300</b> may be configured to be aligned to the translator <b>120</b> using mating alignment features. Though, in some embodiments, alignment features used to align interposer <b>300</b> to probe interface board <b>110</b> also may be used to align translator <b>120</b> relative to interposer <b>300</b>. Further details of the interposer modules are described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The translator <b>120</b> may be disposed adjacent the interposer and comprise a plurality of conductive elements that convey signals between the interposer and a devices or circuits distributed on the test sample <b>130</b>. The translator may include a plurality of electrical traces and contact probes for providing paths between at least one conductive structure on the interposer and at least one test point of one circuit or device on the test sample <b>130</b>. The translator may be a substantially planar structure, e.g., a printed circuit board. The translator may include alignment features for aligning the translator to the interposer <b>300</b> or to the PIB-translator sealing member <b>115</b> or to the stiffener <b>105</b>. The translator may be made using techniques known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When assembled in a stack, the translator <b>120</b>, interposer <b>300</b>, and PIB <b>110</b> may be substantially immovable with respect to each other in a lateral direction, e.g., a direction transverse to the direction of stacking (directions lying in the X, Y plane), and may or may not be movable with respect to each other in the direction of stacking (the Z direction). In this regard, the relative motion of any two of the translator <b>120</b>, interposer <b>300</b>, and PIB <b>110</b> with respect to one another in a lateral direction may be less than about 500 microns in some embodiments, less than about 200 microns in some embodiments, less than about 100 microns in some embodiments, less than about 50 microns in some embodiments, less than about 20 microns in some embodiments, and yet less than about 10 microns in some embodiments. Though, in some embodiments, the individual modules of interposer <b>300</b> may be moveable relative to the probe interface board <b>110</b> and/or translator <b>120</b>. Such movement may allow positioning of each module of interposer <b>300</b> based on alignment features, such as alignment pins <b>112</b>. In this way, tight alignment tolerances may be achieved between conductive elements within each interposer module and conductive pads on the PIB <b>110</b> and/or translator <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the probe interface board <b>110</b>, interposer <b>300</b>, and translator <b>120</b> may be held together, at least in part, using pneumatic pressure and/or vacuum and related pneumatic apparatus. As an example, a PIB-translator sealing member <b>115</b> may be disposed between the PIB <b>110</b> and translator <b>120</b> to form a pneumatic chamber in which the interposer <b>300</b> may be disposed. The sealing member <b>115</b> may comprise a ring structure having at least one gasket, seal, or O-ring forming an air-tight seal between the PIB <b>110</b> and translator <b>120</b>. The sealing member <b>115</b> may be of approximately the same thickness as the interposer <b>300</b>. Evacuation of air in the pneumatic chamber formed by the sealing member <b>115</b> may draw the translator <b>120</b> and/or PIB <b>110</b> into contact with the interposer <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the probe interface board <b>110</b>, interposer <b>300</b>, and translator <b>120</b> may be held together by mechanical fasteners, e.g., friction fit alignment pins, spring pins, camming structure, clips, screws, rivets, etc., or a combination of different types of mechanical fasteners. In this regard, the interposer <b>300</b> may include fastener retaining features to accommodate the fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A translator-wafer sealing member <b>125</b> may be used in some implementations to form a second pneumatic chamber between the test sample <b>130</b> and translator <b>120</b>. The second pneumatic chamber may be evacuated to pull at least a portion of the test sample into contact with the translator.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the probe interface board <b>110</b>, interposer <b>300</b>, and translator <b>120</b> as an assembly may be pressed into contact with the test sample <b>130</b> using mechanical means, e.g., micropositioning apparatus. In such embodiments, the translator-wafer sealing member <b>125</b> may or may not be used.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As noted above, the interposer <b>300</b> may be assembled from a limited number of types of modules sharing a common base shape. Types of interposer modules <b>200</b>, <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref>, according to one embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> depict plan views of the modules, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> depicts an elevation view of a module. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> each module comprises at least a portion of a base module shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the base shape is a hexagon, although the invention is not limited in this regard.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The inventors have conceived of selecting a base module shape that can be machined into a limited number of shapes and assembled to substantially conform to a desired size and shape of a selected interposer, e.g., a circular interposer about the size of a semiconductor wafer. In one embodiment, a base shape is chosen such that when first modules of the base shape are machined into second modules comprising a first portion of the base shape (first module <b>201</b>) and third modules comprising a second portion of the base shape (second module <b>202</b>), the first base shape modules, second and third modules may be the only module shapes used to assemble an interposer into a circle, as can be understood in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Accordingly, if the base module is formed by injection molding, only one injection mold needs to be fabricated to make all of the types of modules. In this regard, a plurality of base modules <b>200</b> can be molded from a single mold. Subsequently, a first portion of the plurality of base modules <b>200</b> can be machined into a first module <b>201</b> and a second portion of the plurality of base modules <b>200</b> can be machined into a second module <b>202</b>. The base modules <b>200</b>, first modules <b>201</b>, and second modules <b>202</b> may then be assembled into the selected shape.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, the assembled modules, as can be seen in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, may substantially fill the selected shape, e.g., substantially fill the circle. This may be useful, for example, to fill the area of a test sample <b>130</b> such as a semiconductor wafer over which integrated circuits and devices may be distributed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> depicts an embodiment in which only two module shapes may be used to form an interposer in a shape of a circle.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When used to fill a circular or oval area, at least one of the modules <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> may include an arcuate edge <b>255</b>, <b>265</b>. The arcuate edge may substantially span between two apexes of the base module shape. The arcuate edge may comprise approximately an arc segment of the circle or oval to be substantially filled with an assembly of base modules and module portions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A base module may be first formed in a shape that may differ from and/or be larger than a final base module shape <b>200</b>. For example, a module may be first formed in a large size (e.g., additional material around at least a portion of the perimeter), and machined to a final base module shape. Machining all base modules may provide better size tolerances than may be achieved from a forming process, e.g., tighter size tolerances than possible with injection-molding alone. Machining the base module may also smooth the sides of the base modules so as to remove artifacts of the molding process caused by injection molding gates. Accordingly, machining of the base module may also allow for a distribution of injection-molding gates that provide better uniformity of polymer throughout the module. Since the injection molded modules may require some machining, e.g., to meet size tolerances and/or remove artifacts, there is little additional cost in machining modules into pieces <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> that comprise portions of the base shape.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The machining of the edges of the module to remove artifacts associated with injection molding gates also beneficially reduces the distance from the edge of the module to a conductive structure <b>270</b>, <b>280</b>. This reduction in distance reduces the area at the borders of modules that is unusable for probing underlying devices. The machining of the edges of a module may reduce the distance between the module's edge and conductive structure to a value less than about 3 mm in some embodiments, less than about 2 mm in some embodiments, and less than about 1 mm in some embodiments. An edge of a module may include at least one stepped portion <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In overview, the base module <b>200</b> may comprise a block <b>205</b> of electrically insulating material (e.g., an injection-molded polymer or composite, a machined polymer or composite) formed in a selected shape. The base module may include a plurality of apexes <b>206</b> and a plurality of alignment features <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>. The module <b>200</b> may further include a plurality of conductive elements (not shown) that pass through the block providing electrical connectivity between conductive structures <b>270</b> on a first surface and conductive structures <b>280</b> on a second surface of the module. The module <b>200</b> may further include at least one fastener retaining feature <b>215</b> at a common location on each piece that may be used to retain each piece to a structure, e.g., to the PIB <b>110</b>. Any type of mechanical fastener, e.g., any of the types described above, may be used to retain each module to an adjacent or nearby structure.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the module may comprise a plurality of features <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b </i>(e.g., holes, cavities, or slots) distributed across the module, and at least one &#x201c;street&#x201d; <b>220</b> running between cavities. Conductive elements may pass through the cavities <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b </i>and connect to conductive structures <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> on opposing sides of the interposer, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. The conductive elements and conductive structures may be affixed in cavities of a module <b>200</b> after the module has been injection molded. In other implementations, the conductive elements and conductive structures may be positioned and held, and the module <b>200</b> molded around the conductive elements and conductive structures. In yet other embodiments, the conductive structures <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> may be pressed into the features <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The alignment features <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>may be used to register each module <b>200</b>, <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> to an adjacent structure, such as the PIB <b>110</b>, or a nonadjacent structure so as to align and/or hold each module in the probe assembly <b>140</b>. The alignment features may comprise holes into which alignment pins may be inserted, and may also include holes used for retaining devices, e.g., screw holes <b>215</b>. There may be one, two, three, or more alignment features on each module. In some embodiments, the alignment features are located such that the alignment features are present on each base module <b>200</b> and each portion <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> of the base module in common arrangements and locations, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>. In this regard, the location of the alignment features are not limited to locations shown in the drawings. For example, two alignment features may be located near any two of the four apexes <b>206</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. There may be mating alignment features on an adjacent structure, e.g., the PIB and/or translator, as well as other structures such as the stiffener. In some embodiments, the alignment features may comprise detents and/or tab-like or pin-like structures that have mating features on an adjacent structure (PIB <b>110</b>) or non adjacent structure (stiffener <b>105</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The incorporation of alignment features that are common to each module <b>200</b>, <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> provides for use of a single fixture and machine to insert the conductive structures <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> during manufacture of the modules. The common alignment features also provide for use of a single electrical test fixture and apparatus to electrically test each module.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At least one street <b>220</b> may be disposed on the base module <b>200</b>. A street may comprise a path or channel along a surface of the module in which there are no cavities <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b </i>or contacts <b>270</b>, <b>280</b>. A street may have a width wider than the periodic spacing between contacts, as depicted in the drawing. A street may correspond to a similar region on the PIB <b>110</b> that is used for routing signals to or from a plurality of contact features on the PIB that align to and contact with contacts <b>270</b> on an interposer module. For example, a street may correspond to a region on the PIB containing a plurality of traces.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, a street <b>220</b> may be used on a module to route electrical traces to and from conductive elements within a module <b>200</b>, <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>. In this regard, a signal arriving at one of the plurality of contacts <b>270</b> or <b>280</b> may be distributed to a plurality of other contacts within the module. In some embodiments, a region along the perimeter of a module or module portion may accommodate traces for routing signals.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Where an interposer pin <b>112</b> causes an X- or Y-directed force on the PIB <b>110</b> and/or translator <b>120</b>, contacts <b>280</b> on each side of the street can be oriented 180 degrees with respect to each other to negate or significantly reduce any force to the structure or alignment pins. Thus, orientation of the contacts <b>280</b> may be used to reduce in-plane forces within the interposer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Conductive structures <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>) may or may not couple to mating conductive elements on an adjacent component (e.g., the translator or PIB) when the PIB, interposer, and translator are assembled into a probe assembly stack. The contacts <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> may be any suitable electrically-conductive material. In some embodiments, the contacts may couple to conductive members (not shown) within the interposer that convey electrical signals (digital and/or analog) through the interposer module. In some embodiments, each contact <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> may comprise opposing ends of a same conductive element, e.g., a conductor or wire bent into a selected shape. The conductive members may be disposed in cavities <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b </i>distributed across the module <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Conductive structures <b>280</b> on a first surface of an interposer module may differ or may be the same as conductive structures <b>270</b> on a second surface of the interposer. In one embodiment, conductive structures <b>280</b> on a first surface may comprise wire-shaped or tab-shaped elements extending from the first surface. Conductive structures <b>270</b> on a second surface may comprise bumps, though the invention is not limited in this regard. The conductive structures <b>270</b> may comprise contact pads or tabs in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some implementations, conductive structures <b>280</b> may comprise a metal, alloy, or any suitable conductive material. The conductive structures may be springy or compliant. When brought into contact with an adjacent structure, the interposer may impart X- and/or Y-directed scrub forces to the ends of the contacts <b>270</b> so that the contacts break through native oxides or debris at the area in which they contact. The conductive structures <b>280</b> may comprise a material that is corrosion resistant, or include a conductive coating that is corrosion resistant. The conductive structures may include a soft non-corrosive coating (e.g., gold), so that repeated acts of contacting pads on the translator <b>120</b> to conductive structures <b>280</b> does not appreciably degrade the contact pads. The density of conductive structures may be high, e.g., on a spacing between about 2 mm and about 1 mm, between about 1 mm and about 0.5 mm, and yet between about 0.5 mm and about 0.2 mm in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some implementations, various conductive structures <b>280</b> on a first surface may extend from the first surface in at least two lateral directions, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. The phrase &#x201c;extend from a surface in a lateral direction&#x201d; refers to an extension from a surface, wherein the extension has at least one directional component parallel to the surface. The extension may further include a component normal to the surface. In this regard, a first portion of the contacts <b>280</b> may extend in a first lateral direction, and a second portion extend in a second lateral direction. The extension of contacts <b>280</b> from a surface in at least two lateral directions can reduce or cancel lateral forces on the interposer module that would tend to move or misalign the module when the contacts <b>280</b> are under compression.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Cancellation of lateral forces exerted by the plurality of conductive structures may be more clearly understood in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. When compressed, conductive structures <b>280</b> on the left (&#x2212;X) portion of the module <b>200</b> may exert &#x2212;X and +Z directed forces on the interposer block <b>205</b>. Conductive structures <b>280</b> on the right (+X) portion of the module <b>200</b> may exert +X and +Z directed forces on the interposer block <b>205</b>. If there are the same number of contacts on the left and right portions, the lateral (X) force components will cancel. The cancellation of lateral forces can reduce or eliminate a tendency for misalignment of the interposer modules <b>200</b>, <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> or interposer <b>300</b> with respect to the PIB or translator due to compression of the contacts <b>280</b> and/or <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the conductive structures <b>280</b> for a first portion (left half in the drawing) of the module <b>200</b> may extend from a surface of the module in a first lateral direction that is different from a second lateral direction for conductive structures <b>280</b> of a second portion (right half) of the module. In some embodiments, the cavities <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b </i>may be shaped (e.g., wedge-shaped) to cause or accommodate extension of contacts <b>280</b> in a selected direction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The at least two lateral directions in which conductive structures extend may be opposite or may not be opposite. In some embodiments, there may be a plurality of areal portions of conductive structures on the module <b>200</b>, wherein at least conductive structures <b>280</b> within a first areal portion extend from a surface of the module in a lateral direction different from conductive structures <b>280</b> within a second areal portion. The plurality of portions of the conductive structures may be oriented so as to substantially cancel lateral forces exerted by the plurality of conductive structures on the interposer module <b>200</b> or assembled interposer <b>300</b> when the plurality of conductive structures are compressed. The conductive structures <b>280</b> may be compressed when an interposer <b>300</b> is assembled into the probe assembly <b>140</b> and placed in contact with the translator <b>120</b>. In some implementations, the directions of lateral extension of contacts <b>280</b> may be varied or altered from contact to contact rather than from area to area.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Since circuit and device density can be high on a semiconductor wafer, there may be a large number of contacts <b>280</b> on the interposer. In some embodiments, for testing a 300-mm-diameter semiconductor wafer, between about 5,000 and about 10,000 contacts in some embodiments, between about 10,000 and about 20,000 contacts in some embodiments, between about 20,000 and about 40,000 contacts in some embodiments, and yet between about 40,000 and about 80,000 contacts in some embodiments may be required. At high contact densities, a high accuracy may be required in the locating of each conductive structure <b>280</b>. For example, contact <b>280</b> locations may be accurate to within about &#xb1;200 microns in some embodiments, about &#xb1;100 microns in some embodiments, and in some embodiments within about &#xb1;50 microns relative to the alignment features <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Alignment tolerances between contacts <b>280</b> and mating contact pads or tabs on the translator <b>120</b> can be tight, since the density of contacts <b>280</b> may be high and mating contact pads may be small. In this regard, interposer-to-translator alignment tolerances may be less than about &#xb1;200 microns, less than about &#xb1;100 microns, and in some embodiments less than about &#xb1;50 microns. In some embodiments, a material may be chosen for the blocks <b>205</b> such that the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for the interposer blocks is approximately the same as the CTE for the translator <b>120</b>. A matching of CTE's for the interposer blocks and translator can reduce thermally-induced misalignment between the interposer contacts <b>280</b> and contact pads or tabs on the translator.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Since there may be a large number of conductive structures <b>280</b> on an assembled interposer <b>300</b>, the spring force for each contact may be constrained by a maximum available force that may be applied to the interposer or translator. For example, a total of 32,500 conductive structures <b>280</b>, each requiring about 12 grams of compressive force will, in total, require about 390 kg of compressive force for the assembled interposer. Spring forces for the conductive structures <b>280</b> may be between about 1 g and about 5 g, between about 5 g and about 10 g, between about 10 g and about 20 g in some embodiments, and yet between about 20 g and about 50 g in some embodiments. The lifetime of the springy conductive structures is greater than 10,000 cycles in some embodiments, greater than 20,000 cycles in some embodiments, greater than 50,000 cycles in some embodiments, and yet greater than 100,000 cycles in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Modules assembled into an interposer are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> according to one embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an assembled interposer <b>300</b> may comprise 19 modules of three shapes manufactured from a common base shape, however the invention is not limited in this regard. There may be more or less modules. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> depicts one embodiment in which there are 7 modules of two shapes. In some embodiments, four or five shapes may be used that are manufactured from a common base shape.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The size of an assembled interposer may be smaller than, approximately the same size as, or larger than a test area on a test sample <b>130</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the assembled modules substantially fill a selected shape. The selected shape may be a circle circumscribing the assembled modules or interposer. The circle may have a diameter (D<sub>1 </sub>or D<sub>2</sub>) approximately equal to a semiconductor wafer in some embodiments. In one embodiment, the circle may have a diameter D<sub>1 </sub>of about 290 mm wherein the semiconductor wafer may have a diameter D<sub>2 </sub>of about 300 mm. Accordingly, the modules may be used in an interposer for full-wafer testing.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the selected shape of an interposer may be a circle having a diameter D<sub>1 </sub>approximately equal to a diameter of an area on a semiconductor wafer that contains all circuits and devices fabricated on the wafer. In this regard and in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the assembled interposer <b>300</b> may provide conductive structures <b>280</b> to outer most regions of the wafer where circuits and/or devices may be located. Additionally, an annular region (between D<sub>1 </sub>and D<sub>2</sub>) may be provided at the periphery of the interposer that accepts at least a portion of mounting hardware (e.g., the PIB-translator sealing member <b>115</b>) that circumscribes the interposer modules.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, it will be appreciated that there may be little wasted area along the periphery of the interposer at locations <b>245</b> where the apexes <b>206</b> of the module portions <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> abut. For example, for a selected circular area (e.g., a circle having a fixed diameter D<sub>1 </sub>that may correspond to the size of a semiconductor wafer), triangular voids would open around the periphery of the interposer between abutting module portions of the modules as the module size is reduced. In some embodiments, the assembled modules fill between about 80% and about 100% of a selected area, between about 90% and about 100% of a selected area in some embodiments, between about 95% and about 100% of a selected area in some embodiments, between about 97% and about 100% of a selected area in some embodiments, and yet between about 99% and about 100% of a selected area in some embodiments. It will be appreciated that the plurality of conductive structures <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> may fill approximately the same amount of area as the modules.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The streets <b>220</b> on an assembled interposer may align from module to module, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. A printed circuit board or other substrate to which interposer <b>300</b> is attached will have a corresponding pattern of conductive structures, such as pads to which contacts <b>270</b> and/or <b>280</b> will mate. Accordingly, the streets in interposer <b>300</b> will correspond to streets in those printed circuit boards, which can be used as routing channels. Electrical access to interior modules may be achieved along the streets if desired. In this regard, electrical access to all modules using the routing channels corresponding to streets <b>220</b> may be obtained from the perimeter of the assembled interposer.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It may also be appreciated in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> that net lateral forces on the assembled interposer <b>300</b> due to compression of the contacts <b>280</b> may substantially cancel in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Substantial cancellation of lateral forces can be appreciated in view of the symmetry of module distribution about the center of the circular area.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Having described embodiments of modules for interposers, related methods will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">One embodiment of a method <b>400</b> for fabricating an interposer is illustrated in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The method <b>400</b> may comprise acts of forming <b>410</b> modules of a first shape, machining <b>420</b> a first portion of the formed modules to a second shape, machining <b>430</b> a second portion of the formed modules to a third shape, aligning <b>440</b> and assembling <b>450</b> the modules into an interposer of a selected shape. Additional acts relating to fabrication of modules and assembly may be included. Some of the acts may be executed manually or in an automated or semi-automated manner with a programmable or computer-controlled machine.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The act of forming <b>410</b> modules of a first shape may comprise forming a plurality of base modules of a single selected shape by a machine process, such as injection molding, CNC milling, hot pressing, punching, laser cutting, or a combination thereof. The single selected shape may be a hexagon. The act of forming <b>410</b> may further comprise forming at least one or at least two alignment features in each module. In some embodiments, the act of forming <b>410</b> may further comprise forming a plurality of contact retaining features (e.g., cavities or vias) in each module. Contact retaining features may comprise any type and form of feature adapted to retain conductive structures <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> and/or corresponding conductive elements passing through the module. Acts of forming alignment features and contact retaining features may be part of the machine process of forming modules of a single selected shape, or may be separate acts performed after the act of forming <b>410</b> modules of a first shape. In some embodiments, the act of forming <b>410</b> modules of a first shape may further comprise affixing a plurality of flexible conductive structures into a plurality of contact retaining features in the modules.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The act of forming <b>410</b> modules may include selecting a limited number (e.g., two, three, or four) of shapes that may be derived from a single shape to substantially fill a selected area when assembled. The selecting of shapes may comprise selecting shapes to fill a circle approximately the size of a semiconductor wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The act of forming <b>410</b> modules may include machining each base module to remove material along at least a portion of the periphery of the module. The material may be removed for purposes of achieving size tolerances. In some implementations, the material may be removed to reduce &#x201c;dead zones&#x201d; having no contacts near abutting edges of modules. The reduction of dead zones can increase contact density at the periphery of modules.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The act of machining <b>420</b> a first portion of the modules to modules of a second shape may comprise removing a portion of a base-shape module. The act of machining <b>420</b> may comprise removing a portion by milling, grinding, cutting, or any suitable machining process or combination of machining processes. In some embodiments, the removal of a portion of a base module produces a first arc <b>255</b> on a module of the second shape. The first arc may be adapted to span a first segment of a perimeter of a selected interposer shape (e.g., a segment of a perimeter of a circle, oval, or polygon). The act of machining <b>420</b> may produce a first arc that spans approximately between two apexes of the base-shaped module.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The act of machining <b>430</b> a second portion of the modules to modules of a third shape may comprise removing a portion of a base-shape module. The act of machining <b>430</b> may comprise removing a portion by milling, grinding, cutting, or any suitable machining process or combination of machining processes. In some embodiments, the removal of a portion of a base-shape module produces a second arc <b>265</b> on a module of the third shape. The second arc may be adapted to span a second segment of a perimeter of the selected interposer shape. The act of machining <b>430</b> may produce a second arc that spans approximately between two apexes of the base-shaped module.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In forming an arc <b>255</b>, <b>265</b> on a module, the arc may pass through a cavity <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b </i>leaving a sharp or jagged edge. Subsequent milling may be done to remove the jagged and sharp features from each cavity so that the resulting arc has a stair-case shape at least in some regions of the arc.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The method <b>400</b> of fabricating an interposer may include an act of assembling <b>440</b> the interposer modules into an interposer or a probe assembly <b>140</b> or other structure that may be used as part of an interface between a tester <b>102</b> and test sample <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the act of assembling may comprise fastening each module into an interposer assembly or probe assembly (e.g., using friction pins, spring pins, screws, rivets, nuts and bolts, glue, adhesive film, or any combination thereof) such that, once fastened, the interposer modules are substantially immovable with respect to each other in a lateral direction (i.e., in a direction lying in the plane of the assembled modules) or in some embodiments, may move in a lateral direction such that positioning of each module is independently controlled based on alignment features.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The act of assembling <b>440</b> may further comprise an act of aligning that may or may not be carried out at substantially the same time as the assembling. For example, each module may be individually aligned to a selected location and fastened in a sequential manner, or all (or a group of) modules may first be aligned and then fastened. The act of aligning <b>440</b> may comprise registering each module to a location in an assembly of modules using, at least in part, alignment features on each module. As an example, the act of aligning may comprise registering each module to a location using one or more alignment pins <b>112</b>.</p>

Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d;, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.</p>
