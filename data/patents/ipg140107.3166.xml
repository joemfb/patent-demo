<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Taiwan application Serial No. 095112521, filed Apr. 7, 2006, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates in general to an organic light emitting device and a method of fabricating the same, and more particularly, to an organic light emitting device with high aperture ratio and high reliability, and a method of fabricating the same at high yield rate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a conventional organic light emitting device (OLED) and a method of fabricating the same, a thin film transistor (TFT) circuit and a light emitting device are disposed on a substrate orderly to form a display device. The display device is then sealed by a cover plate to prevent moisture from entering the display device. As a result, the light emitting device is not damaged by moisture. Because the fabrication processes of the TFT and the light emitting device are performed orderly on the same substrate, the yield rate of the substrate is obtained by multiplying the yield rate of the TFT by the yield rate of the light emitting device, which is far less than the individual yield rates. Recently, the TFT and the light emitting device are fabricated on different substrates to increase the yield rate, the aperture ratio and the reliability of the organic light emitting display. Then, the two substrates are assembled together to form the display.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional, exploded view of a conventional organic light emitting device <b>100</b> formed by assembling two substrates.

It will be apparent, however, that the embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are schematically shown in order to simplify the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an organic light emitting device and a method of fabricating the same according to embodiments of the present invention, after a first substrate and a second substrate are assembled together, a second electrode in a light-emitting region of the second substrate does not directly contact the electrical connecting units of the first substrate.

Thin film transistors on the TFT substrate could be p-type metal oxide semiconductor (PMOS), n-type metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) or complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors. Fabrication of the thin film transistors could be performed by amorphous silicon or LTPS (low temperature polysilicon) technology.</p>

The organic light emitting device (OLED) <b>200</b> is formed by assembling a first substrate <b>30</b> and a second substrate <b>40</b>. The device <b>200</b> includes one or more pixels. Each pixel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) includes one or more sub-pixels each of which, in turn, includes a light-emitting region <b>3</b> and a non light-emitting region <b>4</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each pixel in this embodiment includes four sub-pixels including a red light-emitting region (R<b>1</b>), a green light emitting region (G<b>1</b>), a blue light emitting region (B<b>1</b>) and another red light emitting region (R<b>2</b>). In each sub-pixel (R<b>1</b>, G<b>1</b>, B<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b>), a barrier wall <b>44</b> is located in the non light-emitting region <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, several transistors and a first connecting electrode <b>34</b> are disposed on the first substrate <b>30</b>. The transistors are electrically connected to each other and include switching transistors (not shown in drawings) and driver transistors <b>32</b>. The first connecting electrode <b>34</b> is electrically connected to one of the transistors, such as a source or a drain of the driving transistor <b>32</b>. Furthermore, the first connecting electrode <b>34</b> could be made of metal, metal alloy, metal oxide, metal adhesive, structure coated with a conductive metal layer or a conductive multilayer. In the present embodiment, a connecting body <b>36</b> (made of electrically conductive or nonconductive material) is enclosed by the first connecting electrode <b>34</b>. The connecting body <b>36</b> protrudes from the first substrate <b>30</b> and projects towards the second substrate <b>40</b>. Also, the connecting body <b>36</b> is positioned corresponding to a second connecting electrode <b>47</b> of the second substrate <b>40</b>. After the two substrates are assembled together, the first connecting electrode <b>34</b> is electrically connected to the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> so as to electrically connect the transistors on the first substrate <b>30</b> and the respective sub-pixels of the second substrate <b>40</b>. In an embodiment, after the two substrates are assembled together, the first connecting electrode <b>34</b> is in direct contact with the second connecting electrode <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It should be noted that the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> is disposed in the non light-emitting region <b>4</b> of the second substrate <b>40</b>. In an embodiment, the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> includes a conductive multilayer (including a lower electrode <b>471</b> and an upper electrode <b>473</b>) and an organic layer <b>472</b> enclosed by the conductive multilayer. The lower electrode <b>471</b> could be made of transparent conductive material, such as metal, metal alloy, and metal oxide. The organic layer <b>472</b> could be a single layer or a multilayer selected from the group consisting of a hole injection layer (HIL), a hole transport layer (HTL), an emitting layer (EL), an electron transport layer (ETL), an electron injection layer (EIL) and a carrier blocking layer. In practical application, the organic layer <b>472</b> and the light emitting layer <b>42</b> in the light-emitting region <b>3</b> could have the same structure. Moreover, the upper electrode <b>473</b> is preferably selected from the group consisting of aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), lithium/aluminum fluoride (LiF/Al) with a double-layer structure and other conductive materials. When the first substrate <b>30</b> and the second substrate <b>40</b> are assembled together, the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> is electrically connected to the respective first connecting electrode <b>34</b>. As a result, the drain or the source of the driving transistor <b>32</b> of the first substrate <b>30</b> is electrically connected to the respective pixel electrode, such as first electrode <b>41</b>, of the second substrate <b>40</b>, for providing electrical signals to the light emitting device on the second substrate <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first electrode <b>41</b>, a light emitting layer <b>42</b>, an insulating layer <b>43</b>, and a second electrode <b>45</b> are disposed in the light-emitting region <b>3</b> of each sub-pixel on the second substrate <b>40</b>. The first electrode <b>41</b> could be made of transparent conductive materials, such as metal, metal alloy and metal oxide. The light emitting layer <b>42</b> may include light-emitting layers for emitting red light, green light and blue light.

The second electrode <b>45</b> could be made of aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), or a double-layer structure such as lithium/aluminum fluoride (LiF/Al), or other conductive materials. The insulating layer <b>43</b> electrically isolates the light emitting layers <b>42</b> and the first electrodes <b>41</b> of each subpixel from the adjacent sub-pixels. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the barrier wall <b>44</b> is formed on the insulating layer <b>43</b> for enclosing the second connecting electrode <b>47</b>, so that the second electrode <b>45</b> in the light emitting region <b>3</b> and the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> in the non light-emitting region <b>4</b> of the same subpixel are electrically isolated from each other. The insulating layer <b>43</b> disposed between the barrier wall <b>44</b> and the second substrate <b>40</b> increases the adhesion of the barrier wall <b>44</b> to the substrate <b>40</b>. Alternatively, the barrier wall <b>44</b> can be formed directly on the second substrate <b>40</b>. There is no particular limitation on the location of the barrier wall <b>44</b> in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As discussed above, in each sub-pixel of the second substrate <b>40</b>, the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> in the non light-emitting region <b>4</b>, in accordance with an embodiment, includes a lower electrode <b>471</b>, an organic layer <b>472</b> and an upper electrode <b>473</b>. The lower electrode <b>471</b> is formed on the second substrate <b>40</b> and electrically connected to the first electrode <b>41</b> in the light-emitting region <b>3</b>. The organic layer <b>472</b> is formed on the lower electrode <b>471</b>. The upper electrode <b>473</b> covers the organic layer <b>472</b> and is electrically connected to the lower electrode <b>471</b>. When the first substrate <b>30</b> and the second substrate <b>40</b> are assembled together, the first connecting electrode <b>34</b> protruding from the first substrate <b>30</b> and towards the second substrate <b>40</b> is electrically connected to the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> through, e.g., direct contact between the first connecting electrode <b>34</b> and the second connecting electrode <b>47</b>. As a result, a driving signal is transmitted to the first electrode <b>41</b> of the respective subpixel on the second substrate <b>40</b> through the second connecting electrode <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment suitable for practical fabrication, the lower electrode <b>471</b> in the non light-emitting region <b>4</b> and the first electrode <b>41</b> in the light-emitting region <b>3</b> of the second substrate <b>40</b> could be made of the same material.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart of a method of fabricating the organic light emitting device <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. First, as shown in step <b>401</b>, a first substrate <b>30</b> is provided, and several transistors (including driver transistors <b>32</b>) are formed on the first substrate <b>30</b>. The transistors are electrically connected to each other. Next, as shown in step <b>402</b>, for each transistor used for transmitting signals to the second substrate <b>40</b>, a first connecting electrode <b>34</b> is formed on the first substrate <b>30</b> and electrically connected to the transistor. The first connecting electrode <b>34</b> protrudes from the first substrate <b>30</b>. Afterwards, as shown in step <b>403</b>, the second substrate <b>40</b> including several sub-pixels is provided. Each sub-pixel includes a light-emitting region <b>3</b> and a non light-emitting region <b>4</b>. A second connecting electrode <b>47</b> is formed in the non light-emitting region <b>4</b> of each subpixel. In an embodiment, the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> includes a conductive multilayer (including a lower electrode <b>471</b> and an upper electrode <b>473</b>) and an organic layer <b>472</b> enclosed by the conductive multilayer. Later, as shown in step <b>404</b>, the first substrate <b>30</b> and the second substrate <b>40</b> are assembled together so as to electrically connect each first connecting electrode <b>34</b> and the respective second connecting electrode <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the step of fabricating the components on the second substrate <b>40</b>, the lower electrode <b>471</b> in the non light-emitting region <b>4</b> and the first electrode <b>41</b> in the light-emitting region <b>3</b> could be formed at the same time and from the same material. Similarly, the organic layer <b>472</b> in the non light-emitting region <b>4</b> and the light emitting layer <b>42</b> in the light-emitting region <b>3</b> could be formed at the same time and from the same material. Additionally, the upper electrode <b>473</b> and the second electrode <b>45</b> could be formed at the same time and from the same material. In an embodiment where the organic layer <b>472</b> and the light emitting layer <b>42</b> have the same structure and are formed at the same time, when the emitting layer <b>42</b> is formed by evaporation using a mask, the mask need not cover the region of the second connecting electrode <b>47</b>, and this process could be performed by one of the following methods:</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">(1) By forming the upper electrode <b>473</b> and the organic layer <b>472</b> from molecules that have different size and kinetic energy, so that the area in the region of the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> covered by the upper electrode <b>473</b> is larger than the area covered by the organic layer <b>472</b>. In other words, the target of the upper electrode <b>473</b> is formed by smaller molecules with larger kinetic energy during the evaporation process, such that the edge of the upper electrode <b>473</b> is directly connected to the edge of the lower electrode <b>471</b> adjacent to the bottom of the barrier wall <b>44</b>. As a result, the upper electrode <b>473</b> and the lower electrode <b>471</b> are directly contacted and electrically connected together. In operation, electric current flows to the lower electrode <b>471</b> from the upper electrode <b>473</b> accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">(2) By positioning the evaporation source of the second electrode <b>45</b> and the upper electrode <b>473</b> closer to the second substrate <b>40</b> than the evaporation source of the organic layer <b>472</b> and the light emitting layer <b>42</b> during the evaporation process. As a result, the area of the organic layer <b>472</b> in the region of the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> is smaller than that of the upper electrode <b>473</b>, so that it is easier to electrically connect the upper electrode <b>473</b> and the lower electrode <b>471</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">(3) By forming the angle between the barrier wall <b>44</b> and the surface of the insulation layer <b>43</b> (or the horizontal plane or the surface of the second substrate) to be small, it is easy to electrically connect the upper electrode <b>473</b> and the lower electrode <b>471</b>. The angle is preferably less than 70&#xb0;, and more preferably between 40&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;, and most preferably between 55&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> does not include the organic layer <b>472</b>, the mask, e.g., a metal mask, used for forming the organic light emitting layer <b>42</b> has to cover the connecting or non light-emitting region <b>4</b>. Due to inherent inaccuracy of the positioning process and fabrication process of the metal mask, the metal mask has to cover a larger area than the connecting region <b>4</b>. As a result, the light-emitting region <b>3</b> is reduced, and the aperture ratio is lowered greatly. This has a serious effect on the fabrication process (i.e. making the fabrication more difficult), and the cost of the metal mask increases significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Therefore, a metal mask that does not cover the region of the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> is preferably used, and the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> is preferably formed by using one of the three methods described above. The area of the light-emitting region <b>3</b> does not need to be reduced, and driving signals from the first substrate <b>30</b> can be successfully transmitted to the respective subpixels on the second substrate <b>40</b>. Hence, the organic light emitting device <b>200</b> has a high aperture ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the two substrates are assembled together, the first connecting electrode <b>34</b> contacts, preferably directly, the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> within the non light-emitting region <b>4</b>. Therefore, the light emitting device in the light-emitting region <b>3</b> is not damaged according to embodiments of the invention. Additionally, the second connecting electrode <b>47</b> includes the organic layer <b>472</b>, so that there is no need for the metal mask used for forming the light emitting layer <b>42</b> to cover the region of the second connecting electrode <b>47</b>. Therefore, the OLED with a high aperture ratio could be obtained. As stated above, the organic light emitting device and the method of fabricating the same have high yield rate, high aperture ratio and high reliability.</p>
