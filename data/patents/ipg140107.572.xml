<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An inkjet head manufacturing method includes the following steps. Firstly, a multilayered structure with a plurality of microstructure layers is provided. The alignment check holes of the microstructure layers are concentric and have different diameters. Then, the microstructure layers are stacked together and the microstructure layers are aligned with each other according to the concentric and different-diameter alignment check holes, wherein a dry film layer is sandwiched between every two adjacent microstructure layers. The preset slots of the microstructure layers are collectively defined as inlet flow channels, ink chambers, pressure cavities and outlet flow channels. Then, the multilayered structure is assembled and positioned through the dry film layers by a thermal compression process. Then, a cutting knife is used to linearly cut the actuator plate over a spacer between every two adjacent pressure cavities and along a path parallel with rims of the pressure cavities.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a piezoelectric inkjet technology, and more particularly to an inkjet head manufacturing method by utilizing a piezoelectric inkjet technology.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With increasing development of an inkjet technology, the inkjet technology is not only used in the traditional printer market but also used in flat panel displays and semiconductor manufacturing processes in recent years. However, for reducing the fabricating cost and saving the process time, researchers are seeking new inkjet technologies. As known, a piezoelectric inkjet technology is one of the most widely-used new inkjet technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C. The inkjet head manufactured by the conventional piezoelectric inkjet technology has a multilayered structure <b>1</b>. The multilayered structure <b>1</b> is formed by perform a metal fusion bonding process to stack several layers of stainless steel plates. The multilayered structure <b>1</b> comprises a plurality of inkjet units <b>10</b>. Each inkjet unit <b>10</b> comprises an inlet flow channel <b>101</b> for introducing an ink liquid, an ink chamber <b>102</b> for storing the ink liquid, a pressure cavity <b>103</b>, an outlet flow channel <b>104</b>, a nozzle hole <b>105</b> and other microstructures. In addition, a vibration film plate <b>106</b> is disposed over the inlet flow channel <b>101</b>, the ink chamber <b>102</b>, the pressure cavity <b>103</b>, the outlet flow channel <b>104</b> and the nozzle hole <b>105</b> of each inkjet unit <b>10</b>. Corresponding to the location of the pressure cavity <b>103</b>, an actuator plate <b>107</b> is disposed over the vibration film plate <b>106</b>. Since the inkjet unit <b>10</b> is formed by stacking several layers of stainless steel plates, the dimension precision of fabricating the stainless steel plates should meet with stringent requirements. Moreover, during the process of assembling these stainless steel plates, the assembling error should be controlled to be lower than an acceptable level. If the assembling error is too high, the outlet flow channel <b>104</b> corresponding to the nozzle hole <b>105</b> is readily blocked. In addition, the nozzle hole <b>105</b> is usually produced by etching a nozzle hole plate with a thickness smaller than 200 micrometer and a tolerance around 10 micrometer, the edge size of the nozzle hole plate is readily changed because of etchant concentration, etching time or other parameters. Due to the assembling error of assembling so many layers of stainless steel plates, the nozzle hole <b>105</b> is prone to dislocation. That is, the location of the nozzle hole <b>105</b> is deviated. Under this circumstance, the outlet flow channel <b>104</b> is shrunken and becomes non-upright, and thus it is difficult to eject the ink. In addition, since the ink droplets of the ink liquid are not uniformly-sized, the printing quality is deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The conventional inkjet unit <b>10</b> is assembled by the metal fusion bonding process. Hereinafter, the process of assembling the conventional inkjet unit <b>10</b> will be illustrated as follows. Firstly, the surfaces of the stainless steel plates are plated with gold. Then, these plates are successively stacked together in the predetermined order. Then, a thermal compression process is performed to diffuse the gold atoms between every two adjacent plates. Afterwards, the fusion bonding action of these plates is completed. Although this assembling process has good bonding efficacy, there are still some drawbacks. For example, since the fusion bonding process is carried out at a high temperature (e.g. 500&#x2dc;1000&#xb0; C.) under the anaerobic environment, it is difficult and expensive to install the equipment. In addition, the heating jig for facilitating thermal compression should be carefully selected. If the heating jig is not proper, the heating jig is easily suffered from deformation, degradation or even crack. That is, since the heating jig is severely cracked or adhered, the depletion rate is very fast. In addition to the high replacement cost of the heating jig, the mass production quality is unstable. As known, gold is increasingly expensive, the fusion bonding process is not easily in a batch-wise manner, and the fusion bonding efficacy and yield are affected by the surface treatment. Due to these reasons, the fabricating cost of producing the inkjet units by the metal fusion bonding process is gradually increased.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">After the actuator plate <b>107</b> is stacked as the uppermost layer of the multilayered structure <b>1</b>, the actuator plate <b>107</b> is cut according to the profile of the pressure cavity <b>103</b>. The resulting structure of the inkjet head with a plurality of inkjet units <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. During the process of cutting the actuator plate <b>107</b> of the multilayered structure <b>1</b>, the inkjet units <b>10</b> are classified into a first inkjet unit group <b>11</b> and a second inkjet unit group <b>12</b>. The inkjet units <b>10</b> of the first inkjet unit group <b>11</b> and the second inkjet unit group <b>12</b> are arranged in a staggered form. In addition, the pressure cavity of each inkjet units <b>10</b> in the actuator plate <b>107</b> has a rectangular rim <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, the actuator plate <b>107</b> is cut by a laser cutting process. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, which schematically illustrates the multilayered structure of a conventional inkjet head before a laser cutting process is performed. For performing the laser cutting process, the rectangular rims <b>133</b> of the inkjet units <b>10</b> of the first inkjet unit group <b>11</b> and the second inkjet unit group <b>12</b> should be precisely positioned one by one. Then, the actuator plate <b>107</b> is cut into a plurality of small actuator pieces corresponding to the locations of the pressure cavities <b>103</b> of respective inkjet units <b>10</b>. During the laser cutting process is performed, the cutting positions should be precisely controlled and the power needs to homogenized, the rectangular rims <b>133</b> of the inkjet units <b>10</b> should be precisely aligned, and the cutting depth and width should be precisely controlled. If the cutting depth is too large, the vibration film plate <b>106</b> underlying the actuator plate <b>107</b> is possibly damaged. Whereas, if the width is improperly controlled, the adjacent inkjet units <b>10</b> are adversely affected. Consequently, before the laser cutting process is performed, the laser wavelength, energy, duration and other parameters should be preset in order to achieve the desired size of the actuator plate <b>107</b>. In other words, before the laser cutting process is performed, it is time-consuming and complicated to set these cutting parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For producing the plurality of actuator pieces by the laser cutting process, the rectangular rims <b>133</b> are cut one by one. Since the inkjet units <b>10</b> of the first inkjet unit group <b>11</b> and the second inkjet unit group <b>12</b> are arranged in a staggered form, the laser cutting action needs to be stopped whenever one of the rectangular rims <b>133</b> is cut. The next laser cutting action is done when the next rectangular rim <b>133</b> is aligned. Since it takes much time to repeatedly align the start point of each actuator pieces, the conventional process of cutting the actuator plate <b>107</b> is very long. Moreover, since the cutting speeds at the start point, end point or the turning portion are different, the non-homogeneous power usually results in uneven cutting depth, low yield and high cost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, the laser machine is more expensive than other cutting machines. If the laser power is unstable during the laser cutting process is performed, a great deal of heat will be generated. Under this circumstance, the magnetic flux intensity and the physical intensity of the actuator plate <b>107</b> are adversely affected.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there is a need of providing an improved method of manufacturing an inkjet head so as to obviate the drawbacks encountered from the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides an inkjet head manufacturing method for solving the problems arising from the metal fusion bonding process and solving the problems of setting the laser wavelength, energy, duration and other parameters before the laser cutting process is performed. By the manufacturing process of the present invention, the assembling error arising from the etchant concentration, etching time or other parameters during the process of producing the nozzle hole will be minimized. Since the misalignment problem of the assembled inkjet unit is reduced, the size of the ink droplets of the ink liquid becomes more uniform, and the printing quality will be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an inkjet head manufacturing method. The inkjet head manufacturing method includes steps of: (a) providing a multilayered structure with a plurality of microstructure layers, wherein a plurality of slots and a plurality of alignment check holes are formed in each microstructure layer, wherein the alignment check holes of the microstructure layers are concentric and have different diameters; (b) stacking the microstructure layers together and aligning the microstructure layers with each other according to the concentric and different-diameter alignment check holes, wherein a dry film layer is sandwiched between every two adjacent microstructure layers, wherein the preset slots of the microstructure layers are collectively defined as inlet flow channels, ink chambers, pressure cavities and outlet flow channels, wherein the pressure cavities are symmetrical and parallel with each other; (c) fixing the aligned multilayered structure by a heating jig, and assembling and positioning the multilayered structure through the dry film layers by a thermal compression process; (d) attaching an actuator plate on the multilayered structure at positions corresponding to the symmetrical and parallel pressure cavities, and using a cutting knife to linearly cut the actuator plate over a spacer between every two adjacent pressure cavities and along a path parallel with rims of the pressure cavities, thereby producing an inkjet head with a plurality of symmetrical inkjet units.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention will now be described more specifically with reference to the following embodiments. It is to be noted that the following descriptions of preferred embodiments of this invention are presented herein for purpose of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to be limited to the precise form disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> schematically illustrates an inkjet head structure according to a first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating the inkjet head structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and taken along the line B-B. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The inkjet head structure <b>2</b> comprises a plurality of inkjet units <b>20</b>, which are symmetrical and parallel with each other. The inkjet unit <b>20</b> has a multilayered structure comprising a plurality of microstructure layers in a stack arrangement, wherein a dry film layer is sandwiched between every two adjacent microstructure layers. Each inkjet unit <b>20</b> comprises a nozzle hole layer <b>201</b>, an intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b>, a communication layer <b>203</b>, a pressure cavity layer <b>204</b>, an actuator layer <b>205</b> in a stack arrangement. In addition, a dry film layer <b>206</b> is sandwiched between every two adjacent layers.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A method of manufacturing an inkjet head structure will be illustrated in more details as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Firstly, in the step (a), a multilayered structure with a plurality of microstructure layers is provided, wherein a plurality of slots and a plurality of alignment check holes are formed in each microstructure layer. In addition, the alignment check holes of the microstructure layers are concentric and have different diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> again. The multilayered structure comprises a nozzle hole layer <b>201</b>, an intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b>, a communication layer <b>203</b>, a pressure cavity layer <b>204</b> and an actuator layer <b>205</b>. The nozzle hole layer <b>201</b> has a nozzle hole <b>2011</b> and a plurality of alignment check holes <b>201</b><i>a</i>. The intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> comprises a first plate <b>2021</b>, a second plate <b>2022</b>, a third plate <b>2023</b>, a fourth plate <b>2024</b>, a fifth plate <b>2025</b> and a sixth plate <b>2026</b>. Similarly, a plurality of slots (e.g. the slots <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) and a plurality of alignment check holes <b>2021</b><i>a</i>, <b>2022</b><i>a</i>, <b>2023</b><i>a</i>, <b>2024</b><i>a</i>, <b>2025</b><i>a </i>and <b>2026</b><i>a </i>are formed in these plates <b>2021</b>&#x2dc;<b>2026</b>. The communication layer <b>203</b> comprises an inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> and a communication hole layer <b>2032</b>. Similarly, a plurality of slots (e.g. the slots <b>207</b> and <b>210</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) and a plurality of alignment check holes <b>2031</b><i>a </i>and <b>2032</b><i>a </i>are formed in the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> and the communication hole layer <b>2032</b>. A slot (e.g. the slot <b>209</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) and a plurality of alignment check holes <b>204</b><i>a </i>are formed in the pressure cavity layer <b>204</b>. The actuator layer <b>205</b> comprises a vibration film plate <b>2051</b> and an actuator plate. For clarification and brevity, the actuator plate is described in the later step and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, but the actuator plate is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Similarly, a plurality of alignment check holes <b>2051</b><i>a </i>are formed in the vibration film plate <b>2051</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, the nozzle hole <b>2011</b> of the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b> is produced by a micro-electroforming process. Since the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b> has a large dimension and is made of metallic material, the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b> is readily suffered from wrinkles or deformation or sometime unable to restore the original state. In some embodiment, the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b> is made of polyimide (PI) because polyimide is difficultly suffered from deformation. Moreover, if the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b> is made of polyimide (PI), the nozzle hole <b>2011</b> of the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b> may be produced by an excimer laser process, wherein the thickness thereof is 25 micrometer or 50 micrometer. Regardless of whether the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b> is produced by the micro-electroforming process or the excimer laser process (PI nozzle hole layer), the size of the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b> is reduced. In such way, the possibility of causing wrinkles or deformation will be minimized. Since the area is reduced, the fabricating cost is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this embodiment, the intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> and the communication layer <b>203</b> are stainless steel plates. Moreover, in the multilayered configuration, the alignment check holes <b>201</b><i>a</i>, <b>2021</b><i>a</i>, <b>2022</b><i>a</i>, <b>2023</b><i>a</i>, <b>2024</b><i>a</i>, <b>2025</b><i>a</i>, <b>2026</b><i>a</i>, <b>2031</b><i>a</i>, <b>2032</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>2051</b><i>a </i>are concentric and have different diameters. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and in the ascending order, the alignment check hole <b>201</b><i>a </i>of the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b>, the alignment check hole <b>2021</b><i>a </i>of the first plate <b>2021</b>, the alignment check hole <b>2022</b><i>a </i>of the second plate <b>2022</b>, the alignment check hole <b>2023</b><i>a </i>of the third plate <b>2023</b>, the alignment check hole <b>2024</b><i>a </i>of the fourth plate <b>2024</b>, the alignment check hole <b>2025</b><i>a </i>of the fifth plate <b>2025</b>, the alignment check hole <b>2026</b><i>a </i>of the sixth plate <b>2026</b>, the alignment check hole <b>2031</b><i>a </i>of the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b>, the alignment check hole <b>2032</b><i>a </i>of the communication hole layer <b>2032</b>, the alignment check hole <b>204</b><i>a </i>of the pressure cavity layer <b>204</b> and the alignment check hole <b>2051</b><i>a </i>of the vibration film plate <b>2051</b> are sequentially shown. That is, the alignment check hole <b>2051</b><i>a </i>of the vibration film plate <b>2051</b> has the largest diameter, and the alignment check hole <b>201</b><i>a </i>of the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b> has the smallest diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Firstly, in the step (b), the microstructure layers are stacked together and aligned with each other by using the concentric and different-diameter alignment check holes. In addition, a dry film layer is sandwiched between every two adjacent microstructure layers. Consequently, the preset slots of these microstructure layers are collectively defined as inlet flow channels, ink chambers, pressure cavities and outlet flow channels, wherein the pressure cavities are symmetrical and parallel with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> again. The alignment check holes <b>201</b><i>a</i>, <b>2021</b><i>a</i>, <b>2022</b><i>a</i>, <b>2023</b><i>a</i>, <b>2024</b><i>a</i>, <b>2025</b><i>a</i>, <b>2026</b><i>a</i>, <b>2031</b><i>a</i>, <b>2032</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>2051</b><i>a </i>of the microstructure layers are concentric and have different diameters. By utilizing the alignment check holes, these microstructure layers may be aligned with each other. That is, after these microstructure layers are stacked together, the misalignment problem will be avoided. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a dry film layer <b>206</b> is sandwiched between every two adjacent microstructure layers. In this embodiment, after a dry film layer <b>206</b> is sandwiched between the first plate <b>2021</b> of the intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> and the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b>, several dry film layers <b>206</b> are sequentially and respectively sandwiched between two adjacent ones of the second plate <b>2022</b>, the third plate <b>2023</b>, the fourth plate <b>2024</b>, the fifth plate <b>2025</b> and the sixth plate <b>2026</b>, and thus the flow channel layer <b>202</b> is produced. Then, an additional dry film layer <b>206</b> is sandwiched between the sixth plate <b>2026</b> of the intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> and the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> of the communication layer <b>203</b>, and a further dry film layer <b>206</b> is sandwiched between the communication hole layer <b>2032</b> and the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> so as to produce the communication layer <b>203</b>. After the intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> and the communication layer <b>203</b> are stacked together, the preset slots are collectively defined as inlet flow channels <b>207</b>, ink chambers <b>208</b> and outlet flow channels <b>210</b>. Moreover, a dry film layer <b>206</b> is sandwiched between the pressure cavity layer <b>204</b> and communication hole layer <b>2032</b> of the communication layer <b>203</b>, and an additional dry film layer <b>206</b> is sandwiched between the actuator layer <b>205</b> and the pressure cavity layer <b>204</b>. After the communication layer <b>203</b>, the pressure cavity layer <b>204</b> and the actuator layer <b>205</b> are stacked together and the pressure cavity layer <b>204</b> is capped by the vibration film plate <b>2051</b> of the actuator layer <b>205</b>, the preset slots are collectively defined as pressure cavities <b>209</b>. In such way, a channel structure is formed within the multilayered configuration. Moreover, the pressure cavities <b>209</b> are symmetrical and parallel with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this embodiment, the dry film layer <b>206</b> is made of photosensitive resist material. For example, the dry film layer <b>206</b> is acrylic dry film layer (i.e. acrylic resin) with an aqueous solvent resistant property, or an epoxy dry film layer (i.e. epoxy resin) for solvent and curable ink. The dry film layers <b>206</b> may be used as bonding layers. Moreover, for complying with the flow channels or slots overlying or underlying the dry film layers <b>206</b>, suitable slots may be defined in the dry film layers <b>206</b> by a photolithography process.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this embodiment, the preset slots of the plates of the intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> and the communication layer <b>203</b> are collectively defined as the outlet flow channels <b>210</b>, which are tapered flow channel structures. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the areas of the slots in the intermediate flow channel layer <b>2032</b> and the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> of the communication layer <b>203</b> and the plates <b>202</b>&#x2dc;<b>62021</b> of the intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> are gradually reduced in the direction from the pressure cavity <b>209</b> to the nozzle hole <b>2011</b>. Along the tapered direction, the flow channel area of the upstream microstructure layer is larger than the flow channel area of the adjacent downstream microstructure layer. That is, the areas of the slots for the outlet flow channel <b>210</b> are arranged in descending order: the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b>, the intermediate flow channel layer <b>2032</b>, the sixth plate <b>2026</b>, the fifth plate <b>2025</b>, the fourth plate <b>2024</b>, the third plate <b>2023</b>, the second plate <b>2022</b> and the first plate <b>2021</b>. That is, the slot in the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> has the largest area, and the slot in the first plate <b>2021</b> has the smallest area. Since the areas of the outlet flow channel <b>210</b> are gradually reduced in the direction from the pressure cavity <b>209</b> to the nozzle hole <b>2011</b>, the tapered flow channel structure of the outlet flow channel <b>210</b> may guide the ink liquid along a flowing direction at an accelerated flow speed. Moreover, due to the tapered flow channel structure of the outlet flow channel <b>210</b>, uniformly-sized ink droplets of the ink liquid can be quickly ejected out of the nozzle hole <b>2011</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Then, in the step (c), the aligned multilayered structure is fixed by a heating jig, and the multilayered structure is assembled and positioned through the dry film layers by a thermal compression process.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After the multilayered structure is fixed by the heating jig, the bottom layer and the top layer of the multilayered structure are subject to thermal treatment and pressured treatment (i.e. a thermal compression process) at the temperature in the range of about 150 to 200&#xb0; C. and under the pressure of 3&#x2dc;6 kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>for about 1 hour. Until the temperature is cooled down to about room temperature under the pressured condition, the multilayered structure is assembled and positioned through the dry film layers.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Afterwards, in the step (d), an actuator plate is attached on the multilayered structure at the positions corresponding to the symmetrical and parallel pressure cavities. Then, a cutting knife is used to linearly cut the actuator plate over a spacer between every two adjacent pressure cavities and along a path parallel with rims of said pressure cavities. Afterwards, the inkjet head with a plurality of symmetrical inkjet units is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the actuator layer <b>205</b> comprises a vibration film plate <b>2051</b> and an actuator plate <b>2052</b>. The actuator plate <b>2052</b> is attached on the vibration film plate <b>2051</b>. In an embodiment, the actuator plate <b>2052</b> is made of piezoelectric material such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT). After the actuator plate <b>2052</b> is attached on the vibration film plate <b>2051</b>, the locations of the actuator plate <b>2052</b> correspond to the plurality of pressure cavities <b>209</b>. In addition, each pressure cavity <b>209</b> has a rectangular shape, and having a first rim <b>209</b><i>a</i>, a second rim <b>209</b><i>b</i>, a third rim <b>209</b><i>c </i>and a fourth rim <b>209</b><i>d</i>. The first rim <b>209</b><i>a </i>of one pressure cavity <b>209</b> is aligned with the pressure cavity <b>209</b> of a symmetrical pressure cavity <b>209</b> (see the enlarged portion of FIG. A). That is, after the actuator plate <b>2052</b> is attached on the vibration film plate <b>2051</b>, the first rim <b>209</b><i>a</i>, the second rim <b>209</b><i>b</i>, the third rim <b>209</b><i>c </i>and the fourth rim <b>209</b><i>d </i>of each pressure cavity <b>209</b> are collectively defined as a virtual rectangle. These virtual rectangles are symmetrical and parallel with each other. By using a cutting knife to linearly cut the actuator plate <b>205</b> at the region over a spacer between every two adjacent pressure cavities <b>209</b> along a path parallel with the rim <b>209</b><i>a </i>of one pressure cavity <b>209</b> and the rim <b>209</b><i>c </i>of a corresponding pressure cavity <b>209</b>, an inkjet head with a plurality of symmetrical and parallel inkjet units <b>20</b> is produced. In such way, the cutting time period and the cutting path of using the cutting knife are reduced, and the cutting process is more time-saving. Moreover, since the actuator plate is linearly cut by the cutting knife, the cutting process of the present invention is time-saving and cost-effective when compared with the conventional laser cutting process required to repeatedly align the rectangular rims and preset the cutting parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Moreover, the process of using the cutting knife to cut the actuator plate may be performed in an air-cooled or gas-cooled environment. Consequently, the cutting process is maintained at a uniform temperature below 100&#xb0; C. Under this circumstance, the problems of deteriorating the magnetic flux intensity and the physical intensity of the actuator plate because of unstable laser power during the conventional laser cutting process is performed will be avoided. According to the present invention, the actuator plate <b>2052</b> is cut by a cutting knife. The thickness of the cutting knife is dependent on the thickness of the actuator plate <b>2052</b>. Preferably, the thickness of the cutting knife is smaller than the thickness of the actuator plate <b>2052</b>. In an embodiment, the thickness of the cutting knife is 50 micrometer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. After the cutting process is performed, the actuator plate <b>2052</b> is not completely disconnected. Consequently, by changing an electric field applied to each actuator plate <b>2052</b>, the vibration film plate <b>2051</b> is correspondingly moved, and the volume of the pressure cavity <b>209</b> is correspondingly changed. In a case that the ink liquid stored within the ink chambers <b>208</b> is introduced to the pressure cavity <b>209</b> through the inlet flow channels <b>207</b>, the ink fluid is compressed by the pressure cavity <b>209</b>. Consequently, the ink fluid is forced to flow toward the outlet flow channel <b>210</b>, and then ejected out through the nozzle hole <b>2011</b> to perform an inkjet printing task.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">From the above discussion, the inkjet head manufacturing method of the present invention can be produced in a batch-wise manner by a single thermal compression process. However, if the layer number of the inkjet unit is too large, some problems possibly occur. For example, since the thermal conduction become unstable, the bonding efficacy is impaired and the alignment error between adjacent layers is increased. Under this circumstance, the stability of the inkjet printing task is adversely affected. Moreover, before the thermal compression process is performed, the pretreatment (e.g. fabrication of the microstructure layers, application of dry film layers and the fixture of all microstructure layers by the heating jig) is very complicated. The complicated pretreatment may increase the material cost and time cost. For solving these drawbacks, numerous embodiments of the inkjet head manufacturing method are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> schematically illustrates an inkjet head structure according to a second embodiment of the present invention. For comparing the inkjet head structure of this embodiment with the multilayered structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the actuator plate is not shown. In this embodiment, the dry film layers <b>206</b> having specified thickness, and a multilayered dry film layer <b>206</b> is disposed on some of the plates. In such way, the number of the plates of the inkjet unit <b>20</b> will be reduced, and the overall thickness is close to the multilayered structure of the above embodiment. For example, if the thickness of the dry film layer <b>206</b> is 30 micrometer, the intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> has two plates less than the intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The lost part may be complemented with the dry film layer <b>206</b>. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> again. The intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> comprises a first plate <b>2021</b>, a second plate <b>2022</b>, a third plate <b>2023</b> and a fourth plate <b>2024</b>. A two-layered dry film layer <b>206</b> is sandwiched between every two adjacent ones of these plates. Moreover, the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is replaced by a three-layered dry film layer <b>206</b>. Consequently, the layer number of the inkjet unit <b>20</b> may be reduced from 11 to 8 while the overall thickness of the inkjet unit <b>20</b> is substantially unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates an inkjet head structure according to a third embodiment of the present invention. For comparing the inkjet head structure of this embodiment with the multilayered structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the actuator plate is not shown. For reducing the number of the plates of the inkjet unit <b>20</b>, the lower-precision plates (i.e. the first plate <b>2021</b>, the second plate <b>2022</b>, the third plate <b>2023</b>, the fourth plate <b>2024</b>, the fifth plate <b>2025</b> and the sixth plate <b>2026</b> of the intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> may be consolidated into two layers of plates. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the intermediate flow channel layer <b>202</b> of this embodiment comprises a first plate <b>2021</b> and a second plate <b>2022</b>. On the other hand, the higher-precision layers (e.g. the nozzle hole layer <b>201</b>, the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> and the intermediate flow channel layer <b>2032</b> of the communication layer <b>203</b>, the pressure cavity layer <b>204</b> and the actuator layer <b>205</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) are maintained in the multilayered structure of this embodiment. Consequently, the layer number of the inkjet unit <b>20</b> may be reduced from 11 to 7.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically illustrates an inkjet head structure according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. For comparing the inkjet head structure of this embodiment with the multilayered structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the actuator plate is not shown. In comparison with the inkjet unit <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> is replaced by the multilayered dry film layer <b>206</b>. Consequently, the layer number of the inkjet unit <b>20</b> may be reduced to 6. For preventing the thickness deviation of the inkjet unit <b>20</b> in comparison with the inkjet unit <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the dry film layer <b>206</b> used in the inkjet unit <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or <b>5</b> is as thin as possible. However, if the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is replaced by the thin dry film layer <b>206</b>, so many dry film layers <b>206</b> are necessary. As known, it is time-consuming to install so many dry film layers <b>206</b>. In this embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> is replaced by the three layers of dry film layers <b>206</b>, wherein the thickness of each dry film layer <b>206</b> is 30 micrometer. Alternatively, the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b> is replaced by the two layers of dry film layers <b>206</b>, wherein one dry film layer <b>206</b> has a thickness of 30 micrometer, and the other dry film layer <b>206</b> has a thickness of 50 micrometer. In some other embodiments, different layer number of dry film layers with different thicknesses may be used to replace the inlet flow layer <b>2031</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> schematically illustrates an inkjet head structure according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. For comparing the inkjet head structure of this embodiment with the multilayered structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the actuator plate is not shown. In comparison with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the pressure cavity layer <b>204</b> and the actuator layer <b>205</b> of the inkjet unit <b>20</b> of this embodiment are consolidated into a single actuator layer <b>205</b>&#x2032;. Consequently, the layer number of the inkjet unit <b>20</b> may be reduced to 5.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">From the above description, the multilayered structure of the inkjet head of the present invention is assembled and positioned through the dry film layers by a thermal compression process in replace of the conventional metal fusion bonding process. Since the dry film layers are used as the gluing layers, the metal plates of all layers are not necessarily plated with gold, and the fabricating cost is largely reduced. Moreover, since the multilayered structure is assembled by the simple thermal compression equipment and in batch-wise manner, the production is more efficiency. Since the areas of the outlet flow channel are gradually reduced in the direction from the pressure cavity to the nozzle hole, the tapered flow channel structure of the outlet flow channel may guide the ink liquid along a flowing direction at an accelerated flow speed. Due to the tapered flow channel structure of the outlet flow channel, uniformly-sized ink droplets of the ink liquid can be quickly ejected out of the nozzle hole. Moreover, since the alignment check holes of different microstructure layers are concentric and have different diameters, the alignment check holes are utilized to assist in alignment. In such way, after these microstructure layers are stacked together, the misalignment problem will be avoided, and thus the inkjet unit can maintain the normal inkjet function. Moreover, since the pressure cavities of the plurality of inkjet units are symmetrical and parallel with each other, the cutting process may be performed by using a cutting knife to linearly cut the actuator plate. In comparison with the laser cutting process, the cutting process of the present invention is time-saving and precisely controlled because it is not necessary to preset the laser cutting parameters before the cutting process is performed. Moreover, the cutting machine used in the present invention is more cost-effective than the conventional laser machine. In other words, the inkjet head manufacturing method of the present invention is more advantageous.</p>
