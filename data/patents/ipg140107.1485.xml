<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Application is a National Stage filing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 of International Application No. PCT/EP2007/058755, filed Aug. 23, 2007, which in turn claims the benefit of priority based on German Patent Application No. 10 2006 039 618.9, filed Aug. 24, 2006, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, as is fully set forth herein. International Application No. PCT/EP2007/058755 has been published in German, but not English, as International Publication No. WO 2008/023043A1, on Feb. 28, 2008.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a machining device, particularly for the production of dental replacement parts or models thereof. The machining device comprises a workpiece holder and at least one machining tool, which together form a machining chamber for a workpiece mounted therein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">EP 0 455 853 B1 discloses a machining device for the production of dental replacement parts, in which machining device the feed axis of the workpiece is located horizontally in the machining chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">DE 199 28 002 C1 discloses a tabletop unit in a horizontal configuration. Due to the horizontal disposition of the workpiece axis, the space requirements in terms of depth increase relatively to the size of the machining chamber, and the quantity of coolant accommodated is limited due to the flat construction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide a machining device, particularly for the production of dental replacement parts or models thereof, which comprises an enlarged machining chamber and thus makes it possible to fabricate large dental restorations. The present invention is thus intended to make allowance for the space available in the dental premises and in the dental laboratory, in particular the depth dimension of the table and the height available between the table and the wall units. The standard depth dimension of the table is between 0.5 m and 0.6 m; the available height is usually between 0.4 m and 0.6 m.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A machining device of the invention, particularly for the production of dental replacement parts or models thereof, comprises a workpiece holder and at least one machining tool disposed in a machining chamber for a workpiece mounted therein, in which the feed axis of the workpiece as it travels into the machining chamber is inclined at an angle to the horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inclination of the feed axis is such that the workpiece is situated above the workpiece holder. This therefore results in a negative angle relative to the horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The arrangement of the feed axis of the workpiece at a downward slant from the horizontal permits a minimization in the space requirements of the machining device so that the depth and height of the housing can be restricted to dimensions that correspond to standard dimensions of the device in dental premises and in the dental laboratory. At the same time, very large restorations can be fabricated, since the slant makes it possible to provide the machining chamber with larger dimensions while the depth of the housing remains the same. A feed axis inclined at an angle of 45&#xb0; results in a feed path that is longer by a factor of 1.41, while the depth of the machining chamber remains unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Due to the inclined disposition of the feed axis, the workpiece axis is disposed away from the sump composed of coolant and the swarf formed in the machining chamber, so that the bearings of the workpiece axis do not come into contact with the coolant.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inclined disposition of the workpiece axis further makes it possible to insert the workpiece into the workpiece holder in a direction akin to the direction of view.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It has been found that it is not at all easy to insert a workpiece into a horizontally or vertically aligned chuck. The inclined arrangement thus results in faster positioning of the workpiece against the chuck, and the time taken to load the machining device is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantageously, the angle of inclination can range from 30 to 60 degrees and is preferably 45 degrees. This enables a compromise to be reached between the space requirements in terms of depth and the space requirements in terms of height.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously, the machining chamber is disposed in a housing enclosing the at least one machining tool and its holder, the workpiece holder and its guide, and a machine bed. A compact device can thus be provided which has smooth surfaces and can be easily cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Advantageously, the machine bed can be disposed in the housing in a slanting configuration, and a container for the coolant can be provided below the machining chamber and in front of the machine bed, which simplifies draining of the coolant from the machining chamber. Furthermore, the slant allows for the use of a container for the coolant having a sufficiently large volume and of appropriate height, which makes for improved settling behavior of the swarf and thus increases the time interval to exchange the container.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantageously, the machining device can be in the form of a tabletop unit.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is particularly advantageous when the machining device comprises a cover that surrounds the machining chamber over an arc of at least 150 degrees. A cover having such an opening angle makes it possible to observe the machining process from the front and rear sides.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Advantageously, a storage space is provided in the housing laterally below the machining chamber, which storage space is accessible from the front of the housing. The inclined disposition of the workpiece axis thus provides additional space in the housing laterally below the machining chamber where, for example, drawers can be mounted for accommodating accessories.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The machining device shown in front view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is in the form of a tabletop unit; that is to say, this machining device is placed on an existing table (not shown) or worktop. The machining device comprises a housing <b>1</b>, to which vertically adjustable feet <b>2</b> are attached for setting up and aligning the machining device on a firm support. In the upper half of the housing there is provided a machining chamber <b>3</b>, which is disposed approximately centrally in the housing <b>1</b>. In the machining chamber <b>3</b> there is shown a workpiece <b>4</b>, which is replaceably mounted in a workpiece holder <b>5</b>. Inside the machining chamber <b>3</b> there is deposed a machining tool <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> on each side of the workpiece <b>4</b>, each of the machining tools <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> being mounted in a tool holder <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The machining chamber <b>3</b> is closed by a cover <b>35</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), of which only the handle <b>10</b> is shown. The cover itself is transparent and pivots about an axis, which is located in a plane extending parallel to the plane of the drawing. This will be explained in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The guides and drives for the tool holders <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> are disposed laterally next to the machining chamber <b>3</b>, but these guides and drives are hidden by the closed housing <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the lower portion of the housing <b>1</b> there can be provided drawers or flaps <b>11</b> to <b>13</b> which are accessible from the front. For this purpose, a handle <b>14</b> is provided on the drawer <b>12</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a cross-section of the machining device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> taken along line A-A. In the machining chamber <b>3</b>, the workpiece <b>4</b> is disposed in a workpiece holder and can be displaced along a feed axis <b>21</b>. As the workpiece <b>4</b> is displaced along the feed axis <b>21</b>, the workpiece <b>4</b> is guided past the machining tool <b>7</b>, and the machining tool <b>7</b> can be adjusted on the tool holder <b>9</b> relatively to the workpiece <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The tool <b>7</b> and the tool holder <b>9</b> can be designed as a four-axis system. In the present case, it would then be possible to move the tool <b>7</b> toward and away from the workpiece <b>4</b> as well as transversely or obliquely to the feed axis <b>21</b> along the workpiece <b>4</b>, for instance, by swiveling the tool holder <b>9</b> about the axis of rotation X. The same applies to the machining tool (not shown) disposed on the other side of the workpiece <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, provision can be made for the workpiece holder <b>5</b> and thus the workpiece <b>4</b> mounted therein to rotate about the feed axis <b>21</b>, for instance, in order to be able to produce undercuts in this spatial direction. For this purpose, a motor <b>41</b> is provided, which drives a rod <b>42</b> that has external teeth and is mounted in the machine bed and in turn drives a gear <b>43</b>, which is non-rotatably connected to the workpiece holder <b>5</b>. Even in the case of longitudinal displacement of the workpiece holder <b>5</b> in the direction of the feed axis <b>21</b>, i.e. along the arrow <b>44</b>, the length of the rod <b>42</b> is such that rotation of the workpiece holder <b>5</b>, as shown by the arrow <b>45</b>, is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The feed of the workpiece <b>4</b> along the feed axis <b>21</b> is brought about by insertion of the workpiece holder <b>5</b> into the machining chamber <b>3</b> caused by a drive <b>46</b> adapted to drive a spindle <b>47</b> guided inside the workpiece holder in a spindle nut (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The workpiece holder <b>5</b> is mounted in a machine bed <b>25</b>, which merges into a boundary wall <b>26</b> of the machining chamber <b>3</b>. The workpiece holder <b>5</b> is sealed from the machining chamber <b>3</b> in the region of the opening in the machining chamber <b>3</b> so that no coolant, chipping or swarf can pass from the machining chamber <b>3</b> into the machine bed <b>25</b>. This opening <b>27</b> is at a higher position than the coolant sump <b>28</b> and an aperture <b>29</b> in the boundary wall <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The coolant sump <b>28</b> can flow through the aperture <b>29</b> in the boundary wall <b>26</b> into a container <b>30</b> disposed below the machining chamber <b>3</b>, which container <b>30</b> is disposed in front of the machine bed <b>25</b> and can be removed from the housing <b>1</b> by way of a flap <b>12</b>, which can be opened using the handle <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The coolant container can cooperate with a pump (not shown), in order to recycle the coolant collected in the container <b>30</b> in filtered form into the machining chamber <b>3</b>. This pump can be disposed, for example, in the drawer <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and to the side of the machine bed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The machining device stands with its housing <b>1</b> on a horizontal plate <b>31</b>. The feed axis <b>21</b> is inclined by an angle &#x3b1; of from 30&#xb0; to 60&#xb0;, preferably 45&#xb0; relative to the horizontal plane of the plate. This arrangement ensures, on the one hand, that the workpiece holder <b>5</b> is not located in the coolant sump <b>28</b> and, on the other hand, that a sufficiently large container <b>30</b> can be provided for the coolant.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, given heights H and depths T are taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The machining chamber <b>3</b> is closed by a cover <b>35</b>, which can be swiveled about a hinge joint <b>36</b> by means of the handle <b>10</b>. The cover <b>35</b> can extend, as shown in the exemplary embodiment, through an angle &#x3b2; of more than 180&#xb0; and can be opened through an angle &#x3b3; about its swivel joint <b>51</b>. The cover section that extends beyond 180&#xb0; does not follow the circular arc, but rather extends not more than tangentially to the circular arc. The opening angle &#x3b3; is between 80&#xb0; and 110&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">After the cover <b>35</b> has been opened, the workpiece holder <b>5</b> is accessible from the front of the housing <b>1</b> (from the left of the drawing) and the machined workpiece <b>4</b> can be removed from the inclined workpiece holder <b>5</b>, and a new workpiece inserted. Due to the inclined disposition of the workpiece holder <b>5</b>, the insertion of the new workpiece is effected in the direction of movement of the operator, thereby facilitating &#x201c;threading&#x201d; of the workpiece <b>4</b> into the workpiece holder <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">By virtue of the fact that the cover <b>35</b> can extend from a point in front of the front side of the housing <b>1</b> to the rear side of the housing <b>1</b>, the machining process can be watched and monitored from both sides.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The machine bed <b>25</b> and the boundary wall <b>26</b> connected thereto are held firm in the housing <b>1</b>. For this purpose, the housing <b>1</b> is attached at suitable locations to the machine bed <b>25</b> and to the boundary wall <b>26</b>, for example, by screws.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The vertically adjustable feet <b>2</b> can be formed in such a way that the transmission of vibrations, whether mechanical or acoustic, to the plate <b>31</b> is damped.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The container <b>30</b> is accommodated in a storage space <b>32</b>, which can extend below the machining chamber <b>3</b> and in front of the machine bed <b>25</b> over the width of the housing <b>1</b> and is however located at least directly below the machining chamber <b>3</b>. In this storage space it is also possible to accommodate small parts in addition to the container <b>30</b> for the coolant, for example, with the help of drawers or flaps comprising removable inserts.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An aperture <b>29</b> leading to the container <b>30</b> located below the machining chamber is provided at the lowest point of the machining chamber.</p>
