<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example sling system <b>10</b> in use. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates sling system <b>10</b> supported up on a shoulder of the person all connected at opposite ends to a piece of equipment, shown as an archery bow <b>11</b>. Sling system <b>10</b> is configured to be easily and intuitively attached and detached from a piece of equipment while supporting the piece of equipment from one's shoulder with less damage to the piece of equipment and with less noise. Sling system <b>10</b> generally comprises sling strap assembly <b>12</b> and attachment straps <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate sling strap assembly <b>12</b> and one of attachment straps <b>14</b>, respectively, in more detail. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, sling strap <b>12</b> is configured to be attached to attachment strap <b>14</b> at opposite ends and to extend from attachment strap <b>14</b> over and about a shoulder of a person. Sling strap assembly <b>12</b> includes sling strap <b>16</b>, pad <b>18</b> and keyhole clips <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Sling strap <b>16</b> comprises one or more strips or straps of material, such as nylon. Sling strap <b>16</b> extends through an optional pad <b>18</b>. In example embodiment, sling strap <b>16</b> includes a buckle <b>22</b> to facilitate length adjustment of sling strap <b>16</b>. In other embodiments, buckle <b>22</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Keyhole clips <b>20</b> comprising clips coupled to opposite ends of sling strap <b>16</b>. For purposes of this disclosure, the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; shall mean the joining of two members directly or indirectly to one another. Such joining may be stationary in nature or movable in nature. Such joining may be achieved with the two members or the two members and any additional intermediate members being integrally formed as a single unitary body with one another or with the two members or the two members and any additional intermediate member being attached to one another. Such joining may be permanent in nature or alternatively may be removable or releasable in nature. The term &#x201c;operably coupled&#x201d; shall mean that two members are directly or indirectly joined such that motion may be transmitted from one member to the other member directly or via intermediate members.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, each keyhole clip <b>20</b> includes a first opening <b>26</b> and a second opening <b>28</b>. Opening <b>28</b> is in communication or is connected to opening <b>26</b> and is smaller than opening <b>26</b> in at least one dimension. Although illustrated as being circular, one or both of openings <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may have different shapes, such as slots, ovals, squares, rectangles and the like. In the example illustrated, clips <b>20</b> are formed from a rigid material such as nylon <b>46</b> and have openings <b>30</b> through which strap <b>16</b> extends and is stitched together to secure clips <b>20</b> to strap <b>16</b>. In other embodiments, clips <b>20</b> are formed from other materials and may be secured to strap <b>16</b> in other manners.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Attachment strap <b>14</b> comprises a member configured to be secured to a component that is to be carried using sling strap <b>12</b>. In the example illustrated, attachment strap <b>14</b> is configured to be removably and manually attached about the component without requiring tools, adhesives or additional fasteners. The term &#x201c;removably&#x201d; or &#x201c;removable&#x201d; means that attachment strap <b>14</b> may be withdrawn and separated from the component without severing, damaging or leaving adhesive remnants on the component. Attachment strap <b>14</b> is configured to allow attachment strap <b>14</b> to be manually separated or removed from the component in the above defined &#x201c;removable&#x201d; fashion without tools. In other embodiments, attachment strap <b>14</b> may be bonded, fastened, captured, sewn or otherwise secured or retained with respect to the component. In one embodiment, attachment strap <b>14</b> is configured to be secured with respect to a riser of a bow. In other embodiments, attachment strap <b>14</b> may be secured to other components such as backpacks, carriers, rifles (artillery), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown by FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C, attachment strap <b>14</b> comprises body <b>40</b>, head <b>42</b>, neck <b>44</b>, neck <b>46</b>, collar <b>48</b>, insert <b>50</b>, apertures <b>52</b>, wall <b>54</b>, handle tab <b>56</b> and post <b>58</b>. Body <b>40</b> comprises elongate strap the elastomeric material having rubber-like properties. In embodiments where attachment strap <b>14</b> is to wrap about a riser of a bow, body <b>40</b> has a length between a centerline of head <b>42</b> and an outermost aperture <b>52</b> such that body <b>40</b> may be wrapped about the riser with at least the outermost aperture <b>52</b> being able to receive head <b>42</b>. Because body <b>40</b> is formed from a relatively soft, compressible or elastomeric material, body <b>40</b> may be easily wrapped about a component, allowing some degree of stretching during wrapping, without scratching a component while frictionally resisting relative movement with respect to the component. In addition, body <b>40</b> may more easily conform to various shapes of a component being wrapped while dampening noise and vibration. Such dampening may be especially beneficial in applications such as hunting or wildlife observation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Head <b>42</b> projects from one side of body <b>40</b>.
