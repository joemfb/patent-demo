<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A utility knife includes a handle, a blade holder assembly, a spare blade carrier, a spare blade dispenser, and an actuator. The blade holder assembly is constructed and arranged to hold a blade at a position of use at one end of the handle. The spare blade carrier is disposed in the handle, and is configured to carry a plurality of spare blades. The spare blade dispenser is constructed to separate one of the spare blades from the plurality thereof and present the one separated blade to the user. The actuator is operatively associated with the blade dispenser, wherein movement of the actuator moves the blade dispenser to separate the one spare blade from the plurality to present the one separated blade to the user.</p>

In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the lock <b>80</b> is manually actuated by the user in the direction of an arrow D (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) to unlock the actuator <b>20</b> to enable the movement of the actuator <b>20</b>. When the lock <b>80</b> is actuated or moved in the direction of the arrow D, the latch member <b>240</b> of the lock <b>80</b> also move in the direction of the arrow D to move the projections <b>246</b> outwardly from the recess <b>244</b> of the engagement portion <b>242</b>. When the projections <b>246</b> are moved outwardly from the recess <b>244</b> of the engagement portion <b>242</b>, the actuator <b>20</b> is unlocked and is moved from the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the lock <b>80</b> includes a pair of resilient arms <b>147</b> joined with a body portion <b>147</b>A of the lock <b>80</b>, and having a protrusion portion <b>149</b> on the ends thereof. The spring arms <b>147</b> are not visible in the view provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, as they are behind the protrusion <b>149</b>. In one embodiment, the protrusion portions <b>149</b> of each resilient arms <b>147</b> are constructed and arranged to bear against the inner surface <b>122</b> of the first handle portion <b>48</b>, when the lock <b>80</b> is moved from the lock position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) to the unlock position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) and this movement stresses the spring arms <b>147</b>. Once the user stops actuating the lock <b>80</b> in the direction of the arrow D, the resilient spring arms <b>147</b> are constructed and arranged to return the lock to the position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The actuator <b>20</b> is spring biased away by the spring tab <b>248</b> from the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) into a first intermediate position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. In the first intermediate position (after the lock <b>80</b> is released), the spring arm <b>248</b> remains engaged with surface portion <b>268</b>, but is straightened out when tension in the spring arm (or tab) <b>248</b> is released. This release of tension and straightening of the spring tab <b>248</b> automatically &#x201c;pops&#x201d; the actuator <b>20</b> open to the first intermediate position when the lock <b>80</b> is released. In one embodiment, the spring biasing action pivots the actuator <b>20</b> from the handle <b>12</b> (e.g., or from the first position of the actuator) by approximately five degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">After reaching this position, the user manually pivots the actuator <b>20</b> about a pivot axis F from the first intermediate position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) to a second intermediate position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). In one embodiment, the actuator <b>20</b> comprises the pivot pin <b>74</b> connected with the handle <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the pivot pin <b>74</b> pivotally connects the spare blade carrier <b>16</b> and the actuator <b>20</b> to the handle <b>12</b>. The spare blade carrier <b>16</b> is pivotally movable relative to the handle <b>12</b>. The pivotal movement of the actuator <b>20</b> causes the pivotal movement of the carrier <b>16</b>. Specifically, when the actuator <b>20</b> is in the second intermediate position, an engagement surface <b>252</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) of the actuator <b>20</b> is engaged with an engagement structure <b>254</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) on the spare blade carrier <b>16</b>. The engagement structure <b>254</b> may comprise a bar or link extending between the connecting members <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> of the blade carrier <b>16</b> (the bar is hidden from view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, when the actuator <b>20</b> is manually pivotable about the pivot axis F beyond the second intermediate position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>); such movement of the actuator <b>20</b> (via surface <b>252</b>) exerts force on the engagement structure <b>254</b> of the carrier <b>16</b> and, thus, pivotally moves the carrier <b>16</b> upwardly, in a counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, about the axis F. Also, as the actuator <b>20</b> is manually pivotable about the pivot axis F beyond the second intermediate position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>), the movement of the spare blade carrier <b>16</b> and the spare blade dispenser <b>18</b> disposed therewithin causes the fixed engagement member or pin <b>114</b> of the second handle portion <b>50</b> to ride along the moving opening or slot <b>116</b> of the spare blade dispenser <b>18</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>). Specifically, the fixed engagement member or pin <b>114</b> extends through the engagement member receiving opening <b>140</b> in the side wall <b>88</b> of the spare blade carrier <b>16</b>, so as to be received in the slot <b>116</b> formed on the side surface of the blade dispenser <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, the blade dispenser <b>18</b> is constructed and arranged to pivotally move along with the spare blade carrier <b>16</b>. During this movement, the slot <b>116</b> is pivotally moved as well. As will be appreciated from the drawings and description, the engagement member <b>114</b> riding within the slot <b>116</b> causes (cams) the blade dispenser <b>18</b> to also move outwardly (in the direction of arrow &#x201c;G&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) as it pivots. The slot <b>116</b> of the spare blade dispenser <b>18</b> moves from a first position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>), wherein the engagement member <b>114</b> is closer to a first end <b>256</b> of the slot <b>116</b> to a second position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>), wherein the engagement member <b>114</b> is closer to a second end <b>258</b> of the slot <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The slot <b>116</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, is disposed at an intermediate position between the first and the second positions where the engagement member <b>114</b> is located at an intermediate region of the slot <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows the slot <b>116</b> in the second position. As the engagement member <b>114</b> rides along the slot <b>116</b> (i.e., as the slot <b>116</b> moves from the first position to the second position), the engagement member <b>114</b> moves the spare blade dispenser <b>18</b> outwardly, in the direction in the direction of an arrow G, relative to the spare blade carrier <b>16</b>. This outwardly movement of the spare blade dispenser <b>18</b> causes the projection <b>102</b> on the spare blade dispenser <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to move relative to the carrier <b>16</b>, to engage the one spare blade <b>34</b> and to move the spare blade <b>34</b> relative to the carrier <b>16</b> and any remaining blades <b>32</b> in the carrier <b>16</b>. As noted earlier, the spring <b>276</b> generally presses or biases the plurality of the blades <b>32</b> in the carrier <b>16</b> towards the spare blade dispenser <b>18</b> so as to place the blade <b>34</b> that is in contact with the dispenser <b>18</b> in the ejecting position.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows the actuator <b>20</b> in a position, wherein the blade dispenser <b>18</b> presents the one spare blade <b>34</b>, which is separated from the plurality of blades <b>32</b> in the carrier <b>16</b>, to user.</p>

The user can store the used blade <b>96</b> separately from the plurality of blades <b>32</b> disposed in the carrier <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the used blade <b>96</b> is placed in the used blade storage space <b>94</b> of the carrier <b>16</b>. The actuator <b>20</b> can then be manually pivotable about the pivot axis from the second position to the first intermediate position. Once the actuator <b>20</b> is at the first intermediate position, the actuator <b>20</b> is moved slightly pressed downwardly so that engagement portion <b>242</b> of the actuator <b>20</b> pushes the latch member <b>240</b> outwardly against the spring bias caused by the resilient arms <b>147</b> of the lock <b>80</b> so that the recess <b>244</b> of the engagement portion <b>242</b> engages with the projections <b>246</b> on the latch member <b>240</b>, thus locking the actuator <b>20</b> in the closed position.</p>

As the assembled first and second portions <b>500</b> and <b>502</b> are moved towards the assembled grip portion <b>490</b> and the cover portion <b>492</b>, the protrusion portion <b>508</b> of the cover portion <b>492</b> is received in the opening <b>506</b> of the first portion <b>500</b>, with the two springs <b>496</b> located on opposite sides of the protrusion portion <b>508</b>. Also, the hook-shaped portions <b>523</b> of the cover portion <b>492</b> move outwardly in the direction of arrows S to allow the assembled first and second portions <b>500</b> and <b>502</b> to pass therebeyond. The hook-shaped portions <b>523</b> of the cover portion <b>492</b> return to their original form to engage with the pair of grooves <b>525</b> located on the first portion <b>500</b>, thus, connecting the assembled grip portion <b>490</b> and the cover portion <b>492</b> with the assembled first and second portions <b>500</b> and <b>502</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The operation of the retractable blade slider <b>304</b> is explained with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56-59</figref>. As a force is applied by a user to the grip portion <b>490</b> to move the grip portion <b>490</b> and the cover portion <b>492</b> attached to the grip portion <b>490</b> (e.g., in a forward direction), the pair of hook-shaped portions <b>523</b> of the cover portion <b>492</b> engage with and ride along the pair of grooves <b>525</b> located on the first portion <b>500</b> to enable a relative movement between the first portion <b>500</b> and the cover portion <b>492</b>. This relative movement between the first portion <b>500</b> and the cover portion <b>492</b> at least partially compresses one of the springs <b>496</b> (via the protrusion <b>508</b>), and causes the cam surface <b>531</b> of the engageable portion <b>527</b> to engage with the portion <b>533</b> of the movable member <b>494</b>, thereby forcing the movable member <b>494</b> away from the series of notches <b>480</b> on the top wall portion <b>478</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>) of the barrel <b>334</b>. The spring <b>498</b> located under the movable member <b>494</b> is compressed, when the movable member <b>494</b> is forced away from the series of the notches <b>480</b> on the top wall portion <b>478</b> of the barrel <b>334</b>. Also, the relative movement between the first portion <b>500</b> and the cover portion <b>492</b> causes the protrusion portion <b>508</b> of the cover portion <b>492</b> to move in the opening <b>506</b> by forcing one of the springs <b>496</b> against a portion <b>507</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 59</figref>) of the opening <b>506</b>. Once the movable member <b>494</b> is forced away from the series of the notches <b>480</b> on the top wall portion <b>478</b> of the barrel <b>334</b>, the retractable blade slider <b>304</b> is free to move the blade assembly <b>310</b> through the opening <b>314</b> at one end <b>316</b> of the body <b>302</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>). After a desired length of the blade assembly <b>310</b> is extended out of the opening <b>314</b>, the force applied on the grip portion <b>490</b> may be released by the user. This causes the spring <b>498</b> located under the movable member <b>494</b> to return to its original form and force the movable member <b>494</b> to engage with one of the notches <b>480</b> on the top wall portion <b>478</b> of the barrel <b>334</b>, thus, securing the blade assembly <b>310</b> at the desired length. In this position, the movable member <b>494</b> also engages with the groove <b>529</b> located between the pair of cam surfaces <b>531</b> and <b>535</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Similarly, when retracting the blade assembly <b>310</b> into the cartridge <b>318</b>, a force is applied by a user to the grip portion <b>490</b> to move the grip portion <b>490</b> and the cover portion <b>492</b> attached to the grip portion <b>490</b> (e.g., in a rearward direction). The pair of hook-shaped portions <b>523</b> of the cover portion <b>492</b> engage with and ride along the pair of grooves <b>525</b> located on the first portion <b>500</b> to enable a relative movement between the first portion <b>500</b> and the cover portion <b>492</b>. This relative movement between the first portion <b>500</b> and the cover portion <b>492</b> compresses the other of the springs <b>496</b>, and causes the other cam surface <b>535</b> of the engageable portion <b>527</b> to engage with the movable member <b>494</b> forcing the movable member <b>494</b> (against the bias of spring <b>498</b>) away from the series of notches <b>480</b> on the top wall portion <b>478</b> of the barrel <b>334</b> causing the retractable blade slider <b>304</b> to move the blade assembly <b>310</b> into the cartridge <b>318</b>.</p>
