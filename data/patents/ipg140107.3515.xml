<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a multi-channel measuring device, especially an oscilloscope and a corresponding measurement method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Switching between different channels of measuring devices is conventionally implemented with dedicated keys allocated to the individual channels. However, this frequently leads to operating errors, because an allocation of the signal connected to the respective channel is not possible without further difficulty. Only an actual measurement and display of the respective signal allows the type of signal to be recognized, and thus allows an allocation. Accordingly, an operational error is frequent, and an avoidance of such an error occupies a significant amount of the user's time.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 6,791,545 B2 shows an oscilloscope and a corresponding measurement method, which allow a preview of the anticipated displays of the oscilloscope. However, only a preview of different measurement methods is shown, for example, a histogram measurement or an amplitude measurement. The connection of several different signals to the oscilloscope and the display of associated preview images is not disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, DE 10 2006 023 914 A1 discloses a measuring device, which displays preview displays of several different signals simultaneously. In this context, however, the display of the reduced displays of the diagrams is provided in a separate display region. This leads to a reduced display of the diagrams. Moreover, the different diagrams cannot be positioned freely. The diagrams can only be arranged at predetermined positions of the display. Furthermore, a superimposed display of diagrams, which allows comparisons of the signals, is not shown.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention is based upon the object of providing a measuring device and a measurement method, which allow a rapid, reliable measurement of the signals on several different channels of a measuring device. In particular, an unambiguous allocation of the respective signals to the channels of the measuring device and a very good legibility of the measured results are important in this context.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object is achieved according to the invention for the measuring device by the features of the independent claim <b>1</b> and for the measurement method by the features of the independent claim <b>19</b>. Advantageous further developments form the subject matter of the dependent claims referring back to these claims.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The measuring device according to the invention provides a display device, a processing unit and at least one measurement channel. The processing unit measures the measurement signal of the at least one measurement channel. The display device displays the measurement signal of the at least one measurement channel as diagrams. In this context, several diagrams can be displayed simultaneously. The display device additionally displays preview diagrams. The preview diagrams are reduced displays of the diagrams. The several diagrams can be displayed superimposed and/or side by side and/or one below the other. The several diagrams can be displayed at different, preferably arbitrary positions of the display device. Accordingly, the anticipated image of each diagram can be read from the preview diagram. An evaluation of the measured values is possible before displaying the diagram. A large volume of information can be displayed simultaneously. Comparisons between different diagrams are possible. Switching to and fro between different diagrams can be avoided. Great flexibility of use is possible as a result of the arbitrary positioning.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The processing unit preferably derives several diagrams from the measurement signal of the at least one measurement channel. Accordingly, different displays of a signal are possible, which leads to a very clear overview and a large volume of displayable information.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The processing unit preferably measures several measurement signals of several measurement channels. Accordingly, different signals can be compared with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The processing unit advantageously derives one measurement signal simultaneously from the measurement signals of several measurement channels. Accordingly, for example, sums or differences of several available signals can be displayed in a common diagram. This increases the legibility of the information for the user and reduces the number of additional processing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The preview diagrams are preferably hidden as required. Space for the display of the diagrams can therefore be obtained on the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The preview diagrams are preferably simplified displays of the diagrams. The preview diagrams are advantageously real-time images of the diagrams. Accordingly, a clear overview of the preview diagrams can be achieved, because the reduced diagrams, the preview diagrams, contain less information than the diagrams. Furthermore, the real-time display allows a reliable estimate of the anticipated diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The selection of the diagrams to be displayed is preferably implemented by selecting the corresponding preview diagrams. In the case of an already implemented display of the associated diagram, a re-selection of a preview diagram, preferably triggers a removal of the associated diagram from the display device. Accordingly, before displaying different diagrams, a selection of the diagram to be observed is possible. An overview of several preview diagrams allows the user a simple and rapid selection. A simple intuitive choice of the diagram is guaranteed in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">By preference, the arrangement of the diagrams on the display device is implemented by positioning of the preview diagrams at given positions of the display device. Accordingly, the subdivision of the display device can be adjusted in an intuitive manner. A training of the user of the measuring device is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The display device is preferably a touch-sensitive screen. The selection and positioning of the preview diagrams on the display device can preferably be implemented by touching and displacement of the preview diagrams. Accordingly, the subdivision of the diagrams on the display device can be adjusted in a particularly simple manner. A safe and intuitive allocation of the diagrams to the signals is guaranteed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The measuring device preferably provides a pointing instrument (mouse). The selection and positioning of the preview diagrams can preferably be implemented by selection and displacement of the preview diagrams with the pointing instrument. Accordingly, the user can make use of the very widely available input instrument for arranging the diagrams on the display device. This therefore guarantees a simple and intuitive operation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">By preference, the positioning of the diagrams is implemented by selection and displacement of the preview diagrams to given regions of the display device or to given regions of already displayed diagrams. A displacement of a preview diagram on the display device, without a previous display of a diagram, preferably brings about the display of a diagram corresponding to the preview diagram over largely the entire display device. A displacement of a preview diagram to the middle of an already displayed first diagram preferably brings about a superimposition of the first diagram and of the second diagram corresponding to the preview diagram. A displacement of a preview diagram to the edge of an already displayed first diagram preferably brings about a reduction of the first diagram and a display of the second diagram corresponding to the preview diagram in the area freed by the reduction. The reduction is preferably implemented in such a manner that the display of the second diagram takes place at the side of the edge of the first diagram, to which the preview diagram has been displaced. This guarantees an unambiguous arrangement of the diagrams, which can be readily comprehended by the user. A simple and rapid operation of the measuring device is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With the display of a diagram, the preview diagram corresponding to the respective diagram is preferably hidden or replaced by configuration parameters. In this manner, a safe allocation of the displayed diagrams to the channels of the measuring device is guaranteed. Furthermore, configuration parameters of the displayed signals can be read off and readily allocated by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The display device advantageously displays the preview diagrams with a degree of transparency determined by processing unit. The display device preferably displays the preview diagrams superimposed over the diagrams. Accordingly, the visibility of the complete signals of the different diagrams is guaranteed. By contrast with a display of the preview diagrams in their own separate region of the display device, the diagrams can be displayed in an enlarged manner, which improves the overview and legibility.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Moreover, the measuring device preferably provides an operating unit with at least one operating element. Each displayed diagram is preferably displayed in a color distinguishable from the colors of the displays of the other diagrams. The at least one operating element can advantageously be illuminated and/or backlit with colors at least similar to the colors of the diagrams. In this manner, a very simple allocation of the operating element to individual displayed diagrams is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The operating unit of the measuring device preferably provides several operating elements. The several operating elements can preferably be illuminated and/or backlit with colors at least similar to the colors of the diagrams. Precisely one diagram displayed by the measuring device is preferably an active diagram. The last positioned or changed diagram is preferably the active diagram. At least one operating element is preferably illuminated or backlit in a color similar to the color of the active diagram. Accordingly, a simple allocation of the respective operating elements to the currently active diagram is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The active diagram can preferably be changed by selecting a diagram on the display device. With a change of the active diagram, the illumination or backlighting of at least one operating element preferably changes to a color similar to the color of the active diagram. This guarantees that the correct operating elements are always illuminated or backlit in the color of the currently active diagram.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the general structure of a measuring device is outlined. The structure and functioning of the measuring device according to the invention and the functioning of the measurement method according to the invention are shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-10</figref>. In some cases, a presentation and description of identical elements in similar drawings has not been repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a view of an exemplary measuring device <b>1</b>. A measuring device <b>1</b> provides a display device <b>2</b>, a processing unit <b>4</b> and a plurality of channels. A single-channel embodiment of the measuring device is also conceivable. Signals are transmitted via a plurality of connections <b>3</b> to the measuring device <b>1</b>. The processing unit <b>4</b> measures the signals and displays the measured results in the form of diagrams on the display device <b>2</b>. The processing unit <b>4</b> also implements calculations on the measured results occurring before the display by the display device <b>2</b>. Accordingly, for example, a combination of several measurement signals to form one measurement signal is conceivable. The measuring device <b>1</b> is controlled by means of a pointing instrument <b>5</b> and an operating unit <b>6</b> with several operating elements <b>7</b>. Furthermore, a control of the measuring device <b>1</b> through the touch-sensitive display device <b>2</b> is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides a view of the display device <b>2</b> of a first exemplary embodiment of the measuring device <b>1</b> according to the invention. A diagram <b>15</b> is displayed on the display device <b>2</b>. The diagram <b>15</b> in this view contains only the coordinate system <b>16</b>. A plurality of preview diagrams <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> is presented superimposed over the diagram. In this context, the preview diagrams <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> display the signals measured on the individual channels of the device in a simplified and reduced form. The preview diagrams <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> in this context are real-time images of anticipated diagrams. Since the diagram <b>15</b> currently displays no signal, the preview diagrams <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of all available channels are displayed. The markings of the diagram <b>15</b> and the coordinate system <b>16</b> in this case are displayed in a neutral colour, because no signal is displayed in the diagram <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides a view of the display device <b>2</b> of a second exemplary embodiment of the measuring device <b>1</b> according to the invention. The display of the allocated signal <b>20</b> as a diagram <b>15</b> is brought about by selecting one of the preview diagrams <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. In this context, the selection is implemented by means of a pointing instrument <b>5</b> or the touch-sensitive display device <b>2</b>. The diagram <b>15</b> is now displayed on the display device <b>2</b> of the measuring device <b>1</b>. The diagram <b>15</b> contains the coordinate system <b>16</b> and the signal <b>20</b>. The signal <b>20</b>, the markings of the diagram <b>15</b> and the coordinate system <b>16</b> are displayed in the same colour here. A plurality of preview diagrams <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> is displayed superimposed over the diagram <b>15</b>. In the place of the preview diagram <b>11</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the channel number <b>111</b> is displayed, because the signal <b>20</b> corresponds to the preview diagram <b>11</b>. Accordingly, it is evident, to which channel number <b>111</b> the displayed signal <b>20</b> corresponds. A display of the channel number <b>111</b> and of the associated signal <b>20</b> in the same colour additionally simplifies this allocation. The display of additional signal configuration parameters alongside the channel number <b>111</b> instead of the preview diagram <b>11</b> is conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides a view of the display device <b>2</b> of a third exemplary embodiment of the measuring device <b>1</b> according to the invention. If a further preview diagram <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> is selected in addition to the first preview diagram <b>11</b>, a positioning guide <b>34</b> is displayed superimposed over the present diagram <b>15</b>. Through a positioning of the selected preview diagram <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> in the middle sector <b>35</b> of the positioning guide <b>34</b>, the signal allocated to the selected preview diagram <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> is displayed superimposed over the already displayed signal <b>20</b>. A positioning of the selected preview diagram <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> in one of the lateral sectors <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> leads to a reduction of the already displayed diagram <b>15</b> and a positioning of the diagram allocated to the selected preview diagram <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> at the corresponding side of the already displayed diagram <b>15</b>. A partially transparent display of the preview diagrams <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> or respectively of the allocated channel numbers or configuration parameters in order to improve the overview is also conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides a view of the display device <b>2</b> of a fourth exemplary embodiment of the measuring device <b>1</b> according to the invention. Here, the result of the selection of the preview diagram <b>12</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and a positioning of the same in the middle sector <b>35</b> of the positioning guide <b>34</b> is displayed. After the positioning of the second signal <b>40</b>, which corresponds to the preview diagram <b>12</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is displayed in a further diagram superimposed over the signal <b>20</b>. Since the diagrams are completely superimposed here, they are referred to by the common reference <b>15</b>. Instead of the preview diagrams <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which correspond to the two signals <b>20</b>, <b>40</b> now displayed, the channel numbers <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> are displayed. In this context, the display of the respective signal <b>20</b>, <b>40</b> is implemented in the same colour as the display of the channel number <b>111</b>, <b>121</b>. Accordingly, an easy allocation is also guaranteed with several displayed signals. Before the positioning of the second signal <b>40</b>, the originally displayed signal <b>20</b> and the corresponding diagram were active. In consequence, the signal <b>20</b>, the markings of the diagrams <b>15</b> and the coordinate system <b>16</b> were displayed in the same colour. After the positioning of the second signal <b>40</b> in the diagrams <b>15</b>, the active signal or respectively diagram changes to the last positioned signal <b>40</b> and its associated diagram <b>15</b>. Accordingly, the color of the markings of the diagrams <b>15</b> and of the coordinate system <b>16</b> also change.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> provides a view of the display device <b>2</b> of a fifth exemplary embodiment of the measuring device <b>1</b> according to the invention. The result of the selection of the preview diagram <b>12</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and a positioning of the same in the lower sector <b>32</b> of the positioning guide <b>34</b> is displayed here. The diagram <b>15</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is displayed here as a reduced diagram <b>15</b>. Additionally, a further diagram <b>51</b> is displayed below it. In the first diagram <b>50</b>, the signal <b>54</b> allocated to the first preview diagram <b>11</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is displayed. In the second diagram <b>51</b>, the signal <b>55</b> allocated to the second preview diagram <b>12</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is displayed. Each of the displayed diagrams <b>50</b>, <b>51</b> in this context provides its own coordinate system <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>. Here also, the two corresponding preview diagrams <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are no longer displayed. Instead, the respective numbers <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> of the allocated channel are also displayed here. The channel numbers <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> and the corresponding signals <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> are also displayed in the same colour here. The markings of the diagrams <b>50</b>, <b>51</b> and the coordinate systems <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> are also displayed here in the colour of the respectively displayed, active diagram <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>. Since only one signal <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> is displayed in each diagram <b>50</b>, <b>51</b> here, the colour of this signal <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> is the colour allocated to the respective diagram <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> provides a view of the display device <b>2</b> of a sixth exemplary embodiment of the measuring device <b>1</b> according to the invention. Here, the result of the selection of the preview diagram <b>12</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and of a positioning of the same in the right-hand sector <b>31</b> of the positioning guide <b>34</b> is displayed. The diagram <b>15</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is displayed here as a reduced diagram <b>60</b>. Additionally, a second diagram <b>61</b> is displayed alongside it. The signal <b>64</b> allocated to the first preview diagram <b>11</b> is displayed in the first diagram <b>60</b>. The signal <b>65</b> allocated to the second preview diagram <b>12</b> is displayed in the second diagram <b>61</b>. Each of the displayed diagrams <b>60</b>, <b>61</b> in this context provides its own coordinate system <b>62</b>, <b>63</b>. Here also, the two corresponding preview diagrams <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are no longer displayed. Instead, the respective numbers <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> of the associated channel are also displayed here. The colour scheme corresponds to the colour scheme shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> provides a view of the display device <b>2</b> of a seventh exemplary embodiment of the measuring device <b>1</b> according to the invention. If a further signal is to be displayed on the display device <b>2</b> in the form of a diagram, a further preview diagram <b>13</b> is selected. Through provisional positioning of the preview diagram <b>13</b> over the diagram <b>61</b>, the positioning guide <b>66</b> appears superimposed over the diagram <b>61</b>. As already explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a final positioning of the preview diagram <b>13</b> in one of the five sectors <b>67</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>69</b>, <b>690</b>, <b>691</b> is possible and in each case triggers a different arrangement of the diagrams on the display device <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> provides a view of the display device <b>2</b> of an eighth exemplary embodiment of the measuring device <b>1</b> according to the invention. With the positioning of the third preview diagram <b>13</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in the lower sector <b>69</b> of the positioning guide <b>66</b>, the diagram <b>61</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is reduced and displayed as diagram <b>71</b>. This contains the signal <b>79</b> and the coordinate system <b>75</b>. The additional diagram <b>72</b> is displayed in the free space on the display device <b>2</b>. The diagram <b>72</b> contains the signal <b>81</b> and the coordinate system <b>77</b>. As already explained before, the preview diagram <b>13</b> is no longer displayed. Instead, the channel number <b>131</b> is shown matched in colour to the signal <b>81</b>. As already shown with reference to the other drawings, in this exemplary embodiment also, the colour of the coordinate systems <b>74</b>, <b>75</b>, <b>77</b>, the markings and the preview diagram <b>14</b> or respectively the channel numbers <b>111</b>, <b>121</b>, <b>131</b> correspond to the colours of the signals <b>64</b>, <b>79</b>, <b>81</b> in the diagrams <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> provides a view of the display device <b>2</b> of a ninth exemplary embodiment of the measuring device <b>1</b> according to the invention. If, starting from the situation displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the fourth preview diagram <b>14</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is selected and positioned in the right-hand lower corner of the display device <b>2</b>, the arrangement of diagrams <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>90</b>, and <b>91</b> displayed here on the display device <b>2</b> is obtained. Each of the diagrams <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> in this context provides its own coordinate system <b>74</b>, <b>75</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>93</b>. Each of the diagrams <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> displays its own signal <b>64</b>, <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>94</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the preview diagrams and channel numbers have been hidden in order to obtain more space for the display of the diagrams <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>. An alternative transparent display would also be conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In order to hide a diagram again, the currently active diagram can be hidden by means of the operating element <b>7</b>. As an alternative, if the allocated diagram is displayed, the respective diagram can be hidden by re-selecting a preview diagram or a channel number. In this context, if the last diagram at a position were hidden, that is to say, if no superimposed diagram is present, the corresponding diagram is removed from the display device <b>2</b> and, if possible, the diagram, which was reduced in favour of the diagram to be hidden is restored to its original size. If this is not possible, the adjacent diagram is enlarged accordingly. If the diagram to be hidden is the only diagram displayed by the display device <b>2</b>, it is not hidden but continues to be displayed, wherein the signal of the diagram is hidden.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The invention is not restricted to the exemplary embodiment displayed. As already mentioned, different measuring devices can be used. For example, oscilloscopes and also spectrum analysers are conceivable. All of the features described or shown in the drawings can be combined with one another as required within the framework of the invention.</p>
