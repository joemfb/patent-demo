<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for increasing the luminous efficacy of a white light emitting diode (WLED), comprising introducing optically functional interfaces between an LED die and a phosphor, and between the phosphor and an outer medium, wherein at least one of the interfaces between the phosphor and the LED die provides a reflectance for light emitted by the phosphor away from the outer medium and a transmittance for light emitted by the LED die. Thus, a WLED may comprise a first material which surrounds an LED die, a phosphor layer, and at least one additional layer or material which is transparent for direct LED emission and reflective for the phosphor emission, placed between the phosphor layer and the first material which surrounds the LED die.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention is related to semiconductor light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and in particular presents optimized optical designs aimed at improving the luminous efficacy of white-light emitting diodes (WLEDs) used for lighting applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, there exists a multitude of WLED packaging configurations in the state of the art. The term packaging encompasses a broad technical scope. With respect to LEDs it refers to all the fabrication steps which follow wafer processing: dicing of LED chips, transfer of these onto headers or supports to provide electrical injection and heat-sinking, integration of secondary light-emitting species, and encapsulation with transparent materials to enhance light extraction and allow device protection and passivation (this sequence of steps could be performed in different order).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the following, the term LED die is used to refer to a semiconductor chip, which includes electroluminescent primary light-emitting species (such as quantum wells or any other type of semiconductor heterostructures). The term phosphors refers to the optically pumped secondary light-emitting species, without loss of generality.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Out of the large number of ways of packaging WLEDs, there are mostly two main configurations for phosphors integration: phosphors-on-chip and remote-phosphors configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, in the phosphors-on-chip configuration <b>100</b>, the phosphors <b>102</b> are placed in the direct vicinity of the semiconductor LED die <b>104</b>, either as powders coating the chip <b>104</b> or as mixtures with resins surrounding the chip <b>104</b>, with different concentrations and geometrical dimensions. The LED die <b>104</b> is usually fixed on a reflecting header or LED cup <b>106</b>, providing electrical injection and heat-sinking, and embedded in a transparent epoxy <b>108</b> (resin, silicone, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The use of a transparent epoxy <b>108</b> allows an increase in the light extraction efficiency of the device <b>104</b> because transparent epoxies have a higher index of refraction (n) than air in the near-ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelength ranges. Light which is emitted from within the high-index semiconductor chip <b>104</b> (usually n&#x3e;2 for most semiconductors) can escape outside only if the light's angle of incidence inside the chip <b>104</b> is within the light escape cone, that is, below the critical angle for total internal reflection (TIR) &#x3b8;<sub>c</sub>. &#x3b8;<sub>c </sub>depends on the index of refraction of the medium which surrounds the LED die <b>104</b>, n<sub>out</sub>, and the refractive index of the LED die <b>104</b>, n<sub>in</sub>: &#x3b8;<sub>c</sub>=arcsin(n<sub>out</sub>/n<sub>in</sub>). The value of &#x3b8;<sub>c </sub>increases from 24&#xb0; to 35&#xb0; as the medium exterior to a GaN LED die <b>104</b> (n<sub>in</sub>=2.5) is changed from air (n<sub>out</sub>=1) to a common transparent epoxy <b>108</b> (n<sub>out</sub>=1.45).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For this increase in light extraction to occur, it is necessary that (1) the LED chip <b>104</b> and the epoxy <b>108</b> be in close contact (if even a thin layer of air or vacuum separates the LED chip <b>104</b> from the epoxy <b>108</b>, the potential increase in light extraction is cancelled), and (2) the interface <b>110</b> between epoxy <b>108</b> and external medium (usually air) be curved or shaped, such that the greatest portion of the light rays extracted from the LED die <b>104</b> and phosphors <b>102</b> impinge onto this interface <b>110</b> at incidence angles much smaller than the critical angle for total internal reflection: &#x3b8;<sub>c</sub>&#x2dc;43&#xb0; for epoxies <b>108</b> with an index of refraction &#x2dc;1.45.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The whole LED die+cup+resin+phosphors assembly can therefore be placed in a hemispherical or dome-shaped material <b>112</b> (an optic), which can be made out of a transparent epoxy or optical glass. With this shape, most light rays are incident at nearly 0&#xb0; (&#x3b8;<sub>c</sub>&#x2dc;43&#xb0;), the angle at which reflectance is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in the phosphors-on-chip configuration <b>100</b>, light rays emitted from the phosphors <b>102</b> downwards (that is, emitted towards the LED die <b>104</b> and header or LED cup <b>106</b>) are partly absorbed by the LED metal contacts and the doped semiconductor layers necessary to electrically inject the primary emitting species included in the LED chip <b>104</b>. Indeed, in order for these light rays to escape, they must propagate downwards across the LED die <b>104</b>, be reflected upwards by a sufficiently reflective layer (either included on the bottom surface of the LED die <b>104</b> or on the LED cup <b>106</b>), propagate across the LED die <b>104</b> once again, and then through the phosphors layer <b>102</b>, without being absorbed. In addition, light rays emitted by the phosphors <b>102</b> upwards, as well as the primary light extracted from the LED die <b>104</b> used to optically pump the phosphors <b>102</b>, undergo multiple reflection, refraction, and scattering events, due to the presence of large phosphor particles (usually larger than 5 &#x3bc;m in diameter), wherein the phosphor particles have indices of refraction (n&#x2dc;1.75 for rare-earths-doped YAG phosphors) which are usually different from the refractive index of the matrix in which the phosphor particles are embedded (n&#x2dc;1.45). These scattering events increase the probability of absorption of light. Finally, in this configuration <b>100</b>, phosphors <b>102</b> are in direct contact with the high temperature of the LED junction <b>114</b> under operation, which can reach temperatures larger than 150&#xb0; C. At such elevated temperatures, the degradation rate of phosphors <b>102</b> is increased and their internal quantum efficiency is usually reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These negative effects are partly eliminated by using the remote-phosphors configuration <b>200</b>. In this configuration <b>200</b>, the phosphors <b>202</b> are separated from the LED die <b>204</b>, that is, they are placed at least 200 &#x3bc;m away from the upper surface <b>204</b>s of the LED die <b>204</b>, as depicted on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This configuration <b>200</b> allows an increase in the overall luminous efficacy of WLEDs, by reducing the probability of light absorption caused by scattering and absorption by metals and doped semiconductor layers. In addition, this configuration <b>200</b> places the phosphors <b>202</b> away from the region of elevated temperature, which is in the vicinity of the LED die <b>204</b> under operation. The resin <b>206</b>, LED cup <b>208</b>, and optic <b>210</b> are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">There are different possibilities for phosphors application in a remote phosphors configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example of a remote phosphors configuration <b>300</b>, wherein the phosphors <b>302</b> are coating the dome-shaped light-extracting optic <b>304</b>. The LED die <b>306</b>, resin <b>308</b>, and LED cup <b>310</b> are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The previous configurations, and all of their possible geometries, are not restricted to be used in combination with the dome-shaped light-extracting optic <b>112</b>, <b>210</b>, or <b>304</b>. Inverted-truncated cones can also be used instead to obtain similar light-extraction performance. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the phosphors <b>400</b> are placed on top of an inverted-truncated cone-shaped optic <b>402</b>, which could be formed from a resin or optical glass, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the whole assembly <b>404</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (comprising the phosphors <b>400</b>, optic <b>402</b>, LED die <b>406</b> and LED cup <b>408</b>) is capped by another dome-shaped optic <b>410</b>. The use of such truncated cone <b>402</b> is a possible alternative to the use of hemispherical-shaped optics, because light rays extracted from the LED die <b>406</b> impinge on the sidewalls <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>of the cone <b>402</b> at angles larger than &#x3b8;<sub>c</sub>, and hence are totally internally reflected and can escape upwards through the upper surface <b>414</b> of the optic <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although the previous geometries of the remote-phosphors configuration can help to reduce light absorption, there is still a need in the art for improving light extraction efficiency by making use of alternative packaging geometries.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Indeed, when phosphors <b>202</b>, <b>400</b> are placed inside an LED cup <b>208</b>, or adjacent an inverted cone <b>402</b> made of resin, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> respectively, the phosphors <b>202</b>, <b>400</b> are embedded in and/or surrounded by a material <b>206</b>, <b>402</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>410</b> with index of refraction of about 1.45. The symmetry of this configuration implies that light emitted from inside the phosphors layer <b>202</b>, <b>400</b> propagates in nearly equal amounts upwards and downwards. Therefore, about 50% of the light emitted by the phosphors <b>202</b>, <b>400</b> must undergo reflection at the bottom <b>208</b><i>b </i>of the LED cup <b>208</b> before having the possibility to escape outside. Part of this light is therefore absorbed in the process. Actually, the amount of light emitted by the phosphors <b>202</b>, <b>400</b> downwards is slightly larger than that emitted upwards; indeed, the primary light rays (i.e. rays emitted by the LED die <b>406</b>, <b>204</b>) are incident from the bottom <b>416</b> of the phosphor layer <b>202</b>, <b>400</b> (i.e. the part of the phosphor nearest the LED die <b>204</b>, <b>406</b>), and therefore more light is emitted by the phosphors located near the bottom <b>416</b> of the phosphor layer <b>202</b>, <b>400</b> than those phosphors located near the top <b>418</b> of the phosphor layer <b>202</b>, <b>400</b>. As a consequence, the scattering of secondary light (i.e. light emitted by the phosphor <b>202</b>, <b>400</b>) propagating upwards is larger than that of secondary light propagating downwards.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With the other remote-phosphors geometry (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), the situation is nearly similar, and in addition another complication stems from the fact that a smooth upper interface separating the phosphors layer and air is present near the phosphors. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows, the smooth interface <b>600</b> only allows the light rays <b>602</b> (emitted by a light source <b>604</b> such as a phosphor particle) incident at angles smaller than &#x3b8;<sub>c </sub><b>606</b> inside the escape cone <b>608</b> to be extracted in the external medium <b>612</b> (usually air). The rest of the light rays <b>614</b>, <b>616</b> are either totally internally reflected (totally internally reflected secondary light ray <b>614</b>), or propagate downwards (transmitted secondary light ray <b>616</b>) through transparent interfaces, such as <b>618</b>, back towards the internal medium/optic <b>620</b> and the LED die <b>622</b>, in useless directions, and towards regions where the probability for light absorption is not negligible. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also shows a possible trajectory for a transmitted primary light ray <b>624</b> emitted by the LED die <b>622</b>, and transmitted into the phosphor layer <b>626</b> where the ray <b>624</b> interacts with a light source <b>604</b> such as a phosphor particle inside the phosphor layer <b>626</b>. Thus, there is a need in the art for improved packaging configurations to enhance the light extraction from phosphor layers, for example. The present invention satisfies this need.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the following description of the preferred embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Current WLEDs combine electroluminescent semiconductor chips to optically pump secondary light-emitting substances, such as inorganic phosphors (for instance, blue light can pump yellow-emitting phosphors to produce white light). The present invention provides novel packaging configurations allowing overall luminous efficacies of WLEDs to be greater than 100 lumens per Watt (lm/W), provided that both light-emitting substances possess sufficiently high internal quantum efficiencies.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Technical Description</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present invention aims at increasing WLEDs' overall luminous efficacy by reducing the probability of primary and secondary light absorption. The main optical designs aimed at improving LED luminous efficacy are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The common point of all these schemes is to reduce to a minimum the probability of light absorption. Therefore, the phosphors light source <b>700</b> (or phosphor layer <b>702</b>) are placed sufficiently far away from the LED die <b>704</b> (at a distance <b>706</b> at least equal to the lateral extent <b>708</b> of the LED die <b>704</b>). In this regard, the present invention introduces multiple optically functional (or modified) interfaces (<b>710</b>, <b>712</b>, <b>714</b>, <b>716</b>) between the die <b>704</b> and the phosphors layer <b>702</b> and between the phosphors layer <b>702</b> and the outer (or external) medium <b>718</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At least one of the interfaces, e.g. <b>710</b>, located between the phosphors layer <b>702</b> and the LED die <b>704</b> or internal medium <b>720</b> should provide a high reflectance for the secondary light emitted by the phosphors <b>700</b> downwards (to reflect reflected secondary light rays <b>722</b>), and a high transmittance for the primary light <b>724</b> emitted by the LED die <b>704</b> (to transmit transmitted primary light ray <b>724</b>). At least one of these interfaces, e.g. <b>710</b>, should be a partial reflector, or dichroic mirror, which would provide a very high transmittance for light with wavelengths comprised in the near-UV to blue range (emitted by the LED <b>704</b>), and a high reflectance for light with wavelengths comprised in the green, yellow, or red portions of the visible spectrum (emitted by the phosphors <b>700</b>). The interface <b>710</b> may be between a surface of an optic <b>726</b>, such as a dichroic mirror, and the internal medium <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Such an optical element <b>726</b> can be formed by using a dielectric multilayer, as is commonly done to form distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the calculated optical characteristics of one such dichroic mirror, obtained by stacking a 100 nm-thick silicon dioxide layer and a 80 nm-thick silicon nitride layer five times with other termination layers. In this calculation, the stack is surrounded by resin and air as if it was positioned at interface <b>710</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, with air between the optic <b>726</b> and the internal medium <b>720</b>. Several curves are shown on this plot. The curves with solid lines are the stack's reflectance (R) vs. wavelength characteristics for five different angles of incidence (wherein the 5 solid curves, from right to left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, represent R for angles of incidence 0&#xb0;, 10&#xb0;, 20&#xb0;, 30&#xb0;, and 40&#xb0;, respectively, as indicated in the legend). The curves with dash-dotted lines are the stack's transmittance (T) vs. wavelength characteristics for five different angles of incidence (wherein the 5 dash-dotted curves, from right to left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, represent T for angles of incidence 0&#xb0;, 10&#xb0;, 20&#xb0;, 30&#xb0;, and 40&#xb0;, respectively). The line <b>800</b> is a measured spectrum of a WLED combining blue and yellow light under operation. The calculation shows that it is relatively simple to form the desired optical element <b>726</b>, with the only necessary condition that the incident light rays extracted from the LED die <b>704</b> would have to be directed such that they would not have incidence angles larger than 40&#xb0; on the dichroic mirror <b>726</b>. An alternative to this could be to surround the dichroic mirror <b>726</b> in materials of similar indices of refraction (n&#x2dc;1.45-1.5), but with a slightly modified multilayer structure. Current electron-beam or plasma deposition technologies can allow large scale fabrication of such multilayers.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Another type of partial reflector can be used by introducing one or more intermediate layers with a low index of refraction, such as represented by <b>728</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Such a low-index layer <b>728</b>, for example, an air gap of thickness much larger than the wavelength of light, can introduce a useful total internal reflection for light emitted by phosphors <b>702</b>, while at the same time keeping a very high transmittance for light emitted by the LED die <b>704</b>. Indeed, light emitted by the phosphors <b>700</b>,<b>702</b> at angles larger than &#x3b8;<sub>c </sub>(&#x2dc;43&#xb0; for air/resin or glass interface) is totally internally reflected <b>730</b> (reflected secondary light ray), giving a solid-angle-averaged reflectance for such interface <b>714</b> of 75%, assuming an isotropic light source <b>700</b>. That is, 75% of the light emitted downwards would be reflected back up simply by using an air gap <b>728</b>, instead of 0% if the phosphor layer <b>702</b> is not optically decoupled from the internal medium <b>720</b>. Previously, downwards propagating light rays could only be reflected back up by the LED die <b>704</b> and highly reflective LED cup <b>732</b> where losses occur. In addition, if this layer <b>728</b> is placed sufficiently far from the LED die <b>704</b> (at a distance <b>706</b><i>b </i>at least equal to the lateral extent <b>708</b> of the LED die), and if the layer <b>728</b> is shaped as a hemispherical layer, all light rays, e.g. <b>724</b>, emitted from the LED die <b>704</b> cross this layer <b>728</b> at nearly normal incidence, and thus with minimal reflectance.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The phosphor particles <b>700</b> do not backscatter light efficiently because their sizes are usually much larger than the wavelength of light, and because of the fact that the index of refraction mismatch &#x394;n between phosphors <b>700</b> and the matrix (wherein the phosphor layer <b>702</b> comprises the matrix and the phosphors <b>700</b>) where they are embedded is not usually very large (&#x394;n&#x2dc;0.3), and reflectance at normal incidence scales like &#x394;n<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In order for the light emitted by the phosphors <b>700</b> not to be guided inside the layer <b>702</b> (thereby forming transmitted secondary light ray <b>734</b>), the upper interface <b>716</b> must be optically functionalized to become as transmissive as possible in both angular and spectral domains. One possible solution is to coat the smooth upper surface <b>736</b> of the phosphors layer <b>702</b> with an antireflection coating. Another solution is to texture the upper surface <b>736</b> with either a periodic, quasi-periodic, or quasi-random pattern. Such patterns can indeed be used to frustrate or partly cancel the total internal reflection that would occur at that interface <b>716</b> if it the surface <b>736</b> were left smooth.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">To illustrate this effect, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a comparison of Transverse Electric (TE)-polarized plane-wave transmittances into air through a planar (thick black line <b>900</b>) and a patterned (thin grey line <b>902</b>) interface (e.g. <b>716</b>), as a function of the incidence angle. The pattern consists of a square surface modulation between air (e.g. external medium <b>718</b>) and a transparent material with n=1.45 (e.g. <b>702</b>) from which the plane-wave is incident, with a periodicity of 4 &#x3bc;m, a depth of 2 &#x3bc;m, and a filling factor of 40%. If the transmittance is assumed to be isotropic in-plane, then patterning induces an increase in light extraction of 52%, as compared to the planar interface case (this number is obtained by integrating the angular transmittance curves over the subtended solid-angle). Although the transmittance of the patterned interface <b>902</b> is slightly lower than that of the planar interface <b>900</b> at low angles of incidence, the transmittance of the patterned interface <b>902</b> becomes much larger than the transmittance of the planar interface <b>900</b> at angles larger than the angle for total internal reflection (&#x3b8;<sub>c</sub>&#x2dc;43&#xb0;), and these angles are associated with a much larger portion of solid-angle.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Such patterning can be obtained in various ways. One method is to form the phosphors layer <b>702</b> from a textured mold. Another method would be to simply closely pack the phosphor particles <b>700</b>, embedding them in a transparent matrix by molding, and removing the first few tens of microns of transparent matrix by performing a selective etch, subsequent to unmolding.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The interface <b>712</b> between the intermediate layer <b>728</b> and the optic <b>726</b> could be coated with another partial reflector or dichroic mirror, such as described above, or with an antireflection coating. A simple antireflection coating can be comprised of a quarter-wave-thick transparent material, of index of refraction intermediate between air and resin, such as magnesium fluoride (n&#x2dc;1.38).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Finally, the LED cup surface <b>738</b> should be as reflective as possible, and could be composed of a specularly reflective or diffuse reflective coating (metallic, such as silver or aluminum, or non-metallic, such as Teflon or Barium Sulfate, etc.), the LED die <b>704</b> being fixed onto a good heat-sinking material in all cases. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also shows a transmitted primary light ray <b>740</b> being transmitted through the phosphor layer <b>702</b> into the external medium <b>718</b>. The interface <b>714</b> may also reflect primary rays <b>730</b> emitted by the LED <b>704</b> which have been back scattered towards the LED <b>704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an embodiment of the present invention. The LED die <b>1000</b> is placed in a highly reflective LED cup <b>1002</b>, encapsulated by a first transparent material <b>1004</b> (e.g. resin). The first transparent material <b>1004</b> is itself capped by a hemispherical transparent optic <b>1006</b>, wherein the optic <b>1006</b> has optimized interfaces comprising surfaces <b>1006</b><i>a</i>, <b>1006</b><i>b </i>and a similar index of refraction as the first transparent material <b>1004</b> to limit reflection at the interface comprising surface <b>1006</b><i>a</i>. This interface may be comprised of a dichroic mirror or dichroic reflector coating <b>1008</b><i>a </i>on surface <b>1006</b><i>a</i>, transmitting all primary light rays and reflecting the secondary light rays emitted by the phosphors <b>1010</b>. The phosphors layer <b>1010</b> surrounds the surface <b>1006</b><i>b </i>of the optic <b>1006</b> and one or more intermediate layers <b>1012</b> of low-index material(s) lie in between the two media <b>1006</b> and <b>1010</b> (wherein the layer <b>1012</b> may have a lower refractive index than media <b>1006</b> and <b>1010</b>). The surface <b>1006</b><i>b </i>of the optic <b>1006</b> facing the phosphors <b>1010</b> can be coated with an antireflection coating <b>1008</b><i>b </i>so that the primary light can go through the interface (i.e. across surface <b>1006</b><i>b</i>) without being reflected. The upper surface <b>1014</b> of the phosphors layer <b>1010</b> can be textured, roughened or patterned to increase light extraction by limiting total internal reflection. The LED cup <b>1002</b> may have a highly reflective surface <b>1016</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a WLED <b>1100</b>, for example, the phosphors layer <b>1102</b> is not uniform in thickness <b>1104</b><i>a</i>, <b>1104</b><i>b</i>, but can be made with a thicker thickness <b>1104</b><i>a </i>on top <b>1106</b><i>a </i>and a thinner thickness <b>1104</b><i>b </i>at the sides <b>1106</b><i>b </i>of the optic <b>1108</b>, wherein the outer surface <b>1110</b> of the optic <b>1108</b> is shaped as a hemispherical dome. This thickness modification can be used to finely tune the angular response of the apparent white-light obtained by mixing primary and secondary lights. The WLED <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> further comprises one or more intermediate layers <b>1112</b> between the phosphor layer <b>1102</b> and the optic <b>1108</b> and coating the outer surface <b>1110</b> of the optic <b>1108</b> (wherein the optic <b>1108</b> comprises optimized interfaces), an LED die <b>1114</b> in an LED cup <b>1116</b>, and resin <b>1118</b> encapsulating the LED die <b>1114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In other embodiments <b>1200</b>, <b>1300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the LED cup <b>1202</b>, <b>1302</b> is made more shallow (i.e. smaller depth <b>1204</b>) or less shallow (i.e. larger depth <b>1304</b>) to provide a wider (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) or narrower (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) angle of view and to decrease the amount of resin <b>1206</b>, <b>1306</b> that lies just above the LED die <b>1208</b>, <b>1308</b>. Since resin <b>1206</b>, <b>1306</b> yellowing can occur during the lifetime of the device <b>1200</b>, <b>1300</b>, it may be advantageous to reduce the thickness <b>1210</b>, <b>1310</b> of the resin <b>1206</b>, <b>1306</b> between LED die <b>1208</b>, <b>1308</b> and optic <b>1212</b>, <b>1312</b> to a minimum. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> also illustrates how the total amount of resin <b>1206</b> can also be reduced (as compared to the amount of resin <b>1306</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) by a shallower LED cup <b>1202</b> (as compared to the LED cup <b>1302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> are the intermediate layer(s) <b>1214</b>, <b>1314</b> and the phosphor layer <b>1216</b>, <b>1316</b> with optimized interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another embodiment <b>1400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the LED die <b>1402</b> is surrounded by a conical-shaped transparent material <b>1404</b> (comprising resin, for example) to take advantage of the total internal reflection effect, instead of using a metallic reflector which absorbs parts of light. The resin <b>1404</b> may sit in an LED cup <b>1406</b> and be capped by an optic <b>1408</b> with optimized interfaces. The optic <b>1408</b> may be capped by one or more intermediate layers <b>1410</b> and phosphors <b>1412</b> with optimized interfaces, wherein the intermediate layers <b>1410</b> are between the phosphors <b>1412</b> and the optic <b>1408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In another embodiment <b>1500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the resin/optic <b>1502</b> is shaped as an inverted-truncated cone. The LED die <b>1504</b> sits on an LED cup <b>1506</b> and is covered by the optic <b>1502</b>. The optic's top surface <b>1508</b> is capped by one or more intermediate layers <b>1510</b> and phosphors <b>1512</b>, wherein the intermediate layers <b>1510</b> are between the top surface <b>1508</b> and the phosphors <b>1512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In another embodiment <b>1600</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, multiple packaged LEDs <b>1602</b> are mounted in a highly reflective frame <b>1604</b> and the phosphors layer <b>1606</b> with functionalized interfaces is mounted such as to surround all the LEDs <b>1602</b> (or intersect or interact with substantially all the light rays emitted by the LED <b>1602</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The LED die can include optical elements to provide increased light extraction, such as photonic crystals, roughened surfaces, patterned interfaces and layers, together with optical confining layers and/or highly reflective ones. The LED chip can also be formed into shapes different from cubic or parallelepiped shapes, such as pyramidal or diamond-like shapes. The LED chip can also be capped with a light extraction &#x201c;megacone,&#x201d; for example, made out of ZnO. The LED chip may also cap a pedestal, wherein the pedestal is shaped so as to optimize light extraction and wherein the pedestal is made out of a nearly index-matching material.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Fabrication Process</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">At least two possible processes of fabrication are possible for the optimized phosphors layer geometry and configuration. One possible process is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In this process, the LED die (such as a Flip Chip (FC) LED chip <b>1700</b> is surrounded by an optic <b>1702</b> shaped by molding directly around the LED die <b>1700</b> and header <b>1704</b>. The LED die <b>1700</b>+header <b>1704</b>+optic assembly <b>1702</b> is then attached onto a mounting fixture <b>1706</b>. The phosphors layer <b>1708</b> with functionalized interfaces is then subsequently attached onto the same mounting fixture <b>1706</b> via a phosphors support <b>1710</b>. Highly reflective material <b>1712</b> may be placed between the phosphor support <b>1710</b> and the end <b>1714</b> of the phosphor layer <b>1708</b> to prevent light which is totally internally reflected inside the phosphors layer <b>1708</b> from escaping without having maximally interacted with the phosphors <b>1708</b>. Highly reflective material <b>1716</b> may be placed between the header <b>1704</b> and the optic <b>1702</b> to reflect light (which is totally internally reflected inside the optic <b>1702</b>) towards the phosphors <b>1708</b>. One or more intermediate layers <b>1718</b> may be positioned between the optic <b>1702</b> (which may be a transparent dome with optimized interfaces) and the phosphors <b>1708</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Another process of fabrication, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, attaches an LED cup <b>1800</b> to the optic <b>1802</b>, for example, by curing an epoxy or silicone. The phosphors layer <b>1804</b> with functionalized interfaces is then subsequently attached onto a lip <b>1806</b> or a flange of the optic <b>1802</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">(1) Using a Commercially Available Blue LED Chip</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a schematic of a device <b>1900</b>. A blue LED lamp was formed by attaching a commercially-available CREE EZR450 LED die or chip <b>1902</b> onto a silver header <b>1904</b> by using silver epoxy. Silver epoxy allows for vertical electrical conduction throughout the LED die <b>1902</b>; more specifically, it allows the injection of holes traveling from the silicon submount to the p-doped GaN layers and active layers including InGaN quantum wells. The top contact (n-contact) of this die <b>1902</b> was connected by a gold wire <b>1906</b> to the first (header) post <b>1908</b> of the silver header <b>1904</b> via wire-bonding. The other (second) post <b>1910</b> of the silver header <b>1904</b> was connected by another gold wire <b>1912</b> to the header <b>1904</b> itself via wire-bonding. At this stage, the total radiant flux &#x3a6;<sub>B </sub>of the bare LED die <b>1902</b> on silver header <b>1904</b> was measured using a calibrated integrating sphere to be 21.0 mW at 20 mA and 3.20 V (DC measurement). The wavelength of light at the emission peak was 447 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A transparent resin (commercially available from General Electric (GE)) was used to form a hemispherical-shaped dome <b>1914</b> encapsulating the LED die <b>1902</b> on silver header <b>1904</b> via a molding technique. The LED die <b>1902</b> was placed slightly below (at a &#x2dc;2 mm distance <b>1916</b>) the center <b>1918</b> of the dome <b>1914</b>. The diameter <b>1920</b> of the dome <b>1914</b> was 7.5 mm. The total radiant flux &#x3a6;<sub>B </sub>of the encapsulated blue LED die <b>1902</b> on silver header <b>1904</b> was then measured using a calibrated integrating sphere to be 26.6 mW at 20 mA and 3.20 V (DC measurement). This shows that the transparent silicone dome <b>1914</b> allowed a 25% increase in total radiant flux.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A yellow-emitting phosphor, provided by Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. (MCC), was then mixed with a transparent resin to form pastes with phosphors concentrations of 6%, 5%, or 3% by weight.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The LED die <b>1902</b> may be any blue LED, for example a University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) grown blue LED chip. The different blue LED lamp was formed by attaching an LED die <b>1902</b>, grown by MOCVD and processed at UCSB, onto a silver header <b>1904</b> by using a non-conductive resin (commercially available from GE. The LED die <b>1902</b> was top-emitting, therefore both n and p contacts of the LED <b>1902</b> were connected by gold wires <b>1906</b>, <b>1912</b> to the posts <b>1908</b>, <b>1910</b> of the silver header <b>1904</b> via wire-bonding. At this stage, the total radiant flux &#x3a6;<sub>B </sub>of the bare LED die <b>1902</b> on the silver header <b>1904</b> was measured, using a calibrated integrating sphere, to be 25.3 mW at 20 mA and 4.08 V (DC measurement). The wavelength of light at the emission peak was 444 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A transparent silicone from GE was used to form a hemispherical-shaped dome <b>1914</b> encapsulating the LED die <b>1902</b> on silver header <b>1904</b> via a molding technique. The LED die <b>1902</b> was placed slightly below (at a &#x2dc;2 mm distance <b>1916</b> from) the center <b>1918</b> of the dome <b>1914</b>. The diameter <b>1920</b> of the dome was 7.5 mm. The total radiant flux &#x3a6;<sub>B </sub>of the encapsulated blue LED die <b>1902</b> on silver header <b>1904</b> was then measured, using a calibrated integrating sphere, to be 30.0 mW at 20 mA and 4.08 V (DC measurement). This shows that the transparent silicone dome <b>1914</b> enabled a 20% increase in total radiant flux as compared to without the dome <b>1914</b>. The difference between &#x3a6;<sub>B </sub>obtained with the encapsulated UCSB blue LED chip and &#x3a6;<sub>B </sub>obtained using the commercially available blue LED chip discussed above in (1), is 25% and is mainly caused by the difference in LED die <b>1902</b> structure.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Again, high overall &#x3b7;<sub>lum </sub>were obtained with these WLEDs <b>1900</b>:</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">105.5 lm/W&#x3c;&#x3b7;<sub>lum</sub>&#x3c;113.3 lm/W at 5 mA, and 90.9 lm/W&#x3c;&#x3b7;<sub>lum</sub>&#x3c;97.7 lm/W at 20 mA, for 4000 K&#x3c;CCT&#x3c;5000 K (a CCT range which is appropriate for warm-white lighting applications). High &#x3b7;<sub>pack </sub>were also obtained with these WLEDs <b>1900</b>:</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">245.6 lm/W&#x3c;&#x3b7;<sub>pack</sub>&#x3c;265.8 lm/W for 4000 K&#x3c;CCT&#x3c;5000 K.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">These high &#x3b7;<sub>pack </sub>are mainly caused by the fact that the phosphors <b>1922</b> are in a remote geometry with an air gap <b>1924</b> between the phosphor cap <b>1922</b> and the transparent dome <b>1914</b> encapsulating the LED chip <b>1902</b> on header <b>1904</b>. This air gap <b>1924</b> is useful to induce total internal reflection inside the phosphor cap <b>1922</b> for light emitted by the phosphors <b>1922</b>. The results could be further improved by using a smoother inner cap surface <b>1930</b> and a roughened outer cap surface <b>1932</b>. The different optical coatings, such as antireflection or dichroic coatings, were also not integrated with these WLEDs. Furthermore, using highly-reflective headers <b>1904</b> (which are not necessarily metallic) instead of silver headers <b>1904</b> (which tend to oxidize over time), could also be beneficial.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The performance of these WLEDs <b>1900</b> were compared to the performance of WLEDs packaged with the phosphors-on-chip configuration <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, using CREE EZR460 chips <b>104</b>, the obtained &#x3b7;<sub>pack </sub>were 183.0 lm/W and 206.8 lm/W, for CCTs of 4600 K and 4980 K, respectively. In this configuration <b>100</b>, unlike in the remote phosphor caps configuration <b>1900</b>, &#x3b7;<sub>pack </sub>decreases as the phosphor concentration increases. These &#x3b7;<sub>pack </sub>values, for the phosphors-on-chip configuration <b>100</b>, are about 25% lower as compared to the WLEDs <b>1900</b> packaged with remote phosphor caps <b>1922</b>, for CCTs comparable to the CCT's presented above.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The difference in &#x3b7;<sub>pack </sub>was not caused by the type of LED die <b>1902</b>, <b>104</b> used. A CREE EZR460 chip was used as the chip <b>1902</b> and was packaged in the remote phosphor cap configuration <b>1900</b> (with the same 6% phosphor concentration cap <b>1922</b> used for the WLEDs <b>1900</b> described above). The result was % &#x3b7;<sub>pack</sub>=275.7 lm/W for the device <b>1900</b>, using a CREE EZR460 chip, for a CCT of 4100 K, which is very similar to the &#x3b7;<sub>pack </sub>obtained with the CREE EZR450 chip and reported above.</p>
