<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Various embodiments described herein provide devices and associated methods for treating spinal disease by implanting one or more interspinous process spacing devices. In one embodiment, an interspinous process spacing device includes a first attachment side and a second attachment side, whereby each attachment side includes one or more slots formed in the outer surface and oriented proximate one end for receiving fasteners extending inwardly from a second interspinous process spacing device. The device further includes a spacer tray positioned between the first attachment side and the second attachment side, the spacer tray extending from the first attachment side and slideably insertable through a tray slot formed in the second attachment side, wherein the spacer tray is adapted to retain adjacent spinous processes in a spaced apart orientation. The device further includes securing means for securing the second attachment side relative to the first attachment side, wherein, upon securing the second attachment side relative to the first attachment side, the interspinous process spacing device is engaged with the adjacent spinous processes.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/313,169 filed on Mar. 12, 2010, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to devices for use during spinal surgery, and methods pertaining thereto, and more particularly to devices and methods for providing spacing between adjacent spinous processes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Spinal discs and/or other vertebral changes can cause spinal disease that often leads to patient discomfort or even paralysis. For example, intervertebral spinal discs, which lie between adjacent vertebrae, can break down or degenerate, resulting in disc fluid loss and consequently resulting in a loss of disc flexibility. In addition, discs can become thinner, allowing the vertebrae to move closer together, may tear or crack in the outer layer and/or the annulus of the disc, and/or bulge outwardly. Facet joint degeneration may also lead to spinal disease. Physical trauma (e.g., accidents, injuries, strains, etc.) may cause spinal column changes, and spinal stenosis can cause the spinal canal to narrow due to excessive bone growth and/or thickening of tissue. In all of these conditions, the spinal canal through which the spinal cord and the spinal nerve roots, pass may become narrowed, creating pressure on nerve tissue. Such pressure can cause pain, numbness, weakness, or even paralysis in various parts of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some methods for treating spinal diseases, such as those described above, limit the movement of adjacent vertebrae relative to one another to limit the additional pressure on the local nerve tissue by maintaining a minimum disc space and/or space surrounding the adjacent vertebrae. Various methods have been performed to maintain this minimum space, including disc implants and spinal fusions. One method includes implanting a spacer between two adjacent posteriorly extending spinous processes, which in effect maintains a maximum space between the corresponding vertebrae. Some existing spacer implant devices are implanted by affixing the device to adjacent spinous processes. Existing spacer implants, however, do not provide complete access to insert bone growth promoting substances into the spacer after implant. In addition, existing spacer implants do not provide structural integrity between two adjacently implanted spacers. Moreover, the procedures required to implant existing spacer implant devices are overly complicated, requiring the use of multiple tools to position, tighten, and secure the implants to the spinous processes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there remains a need for improved interspinous process spacer implants.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various embodiments described herein provide devices and associated methods for treating spinal disease. According to one embodiment, an interspinous process spacing device is provided. The device includes a first attachment side and a second attachment side, whereby each attachment side includes one or more slots formed in the outer surface and oriented proximate one end for receiving fasteners extending inwardly from a second interspinous process spacing device.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As required, detailed embodiments of the invention are disclosed herein. However, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the invention in virtually any appropriately detailed structure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embodiments of the invention provide interspinous process spacing devices and methods for their use and manufacture. As described above, an interspinous process spacing device provides a spacer inserted between posteriorly extending spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae to maintain minimum spacing between the spinous processes. Accordingly, a single interspinous process spacing device is designed to limit movement of only two adjacent vertebrae. According to certain embodiments described herein, an interspinous process spacing system is provided with at least two individual interspinous process spacing devices implantable in an integrated, overlapping configuration. This integrated and overlapping configuration improves the stability of the adjacent vertebrae since the two attachment sides are engaged with each other, thus increasing the surface area of each individual attachment side that can engage the surface of the respective spinous process, since the two attachment sides do not have to attach adjacent to each other, but overlapping such that one is attached to the top of the other. The invention provides that a single interspinous process spacing device of two attachment sides, also referred to as a pair of base plates, can be implanted alone having an integration mechanism, such as apertures therein, for future implantation of an overlapping second interspinous process spacing device of two attachment sides, also referred to as a pair of link plates.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to one embodiment, a first interspinous process spacing device is implantable on two adjacent vertebrae by affixing to the spinous process of each vertebrae. A second interspinous process spacing device is implantable on the next adjacent vertebrae (e.g., in the superior or inferior direction) by affixing to the spinous process of the adjacent vertebrae and affixing to the adjacent end of the first interspinous process spacing device already implanted. According to one embodiment, to achieve this integrated configuration, the second (and succeeding) interspinous process spacing device has attachment sides in a bent configuration to overlap the attachment sides of the first interspinous process spacing device. The interspinous process spacing devices can include an integration mechanism, such as, but not limited to, a ball and socket arrangement or a pin and hole (aperture or slot) arrangement, or a pin and overlapping holes arrangement, or a hinge arrangement, or a bone engaging spike and hole arrangement for securely overlapping attachment sides of a first and second interspinous process spacing device and, in the case of a spiked integration mechanism, further engaging the spinous process. In various embodiments, the integration mechanism may allow for overlapping attachment sides of first and second interspinous process spacing devices without requiring a bent configuration of the attachment sides, as further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each of the interspinous process spacing devices includes a first attachment side and a second attachment side in an approximately parallel orientation relative to each other. Each of the attachment sides aligns and selectively engages a respective side of two adjacent spinous processes to retain the implant in position. Thus, the attachment sides are adjustable in a substantially perpendicular direction relative to their orientation (e.g., along the axis of the spacer tray extending between them) to permit closing and tightening them on the spinous process sandwiched therebetween. In one embodiment, the inner surfaces of each of the attachment sides include multiple fasteners (e.g., teeth, barbs, hooks, spikes, or any other gripping surface or other suitable attachment means) protruding therefrom, which interface with the surfaces of the spinous processes to facilitate attaching the attachment sides thereto. In one example, the fasteners can be positioned at or near the edges and/or corners of each attachment side to align with the spinous processes during implantation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment in which multiple interspinous process spacing devices are intended to be used to fasten to more than two adjacent vertebrae, the attachment sides of the first interspinous process spacing device have a substantially flat configuration, whereas the attachment sides of the second (and any subsequent) interspinous process spacing device are formed in a bent configuration, such that a portion of each attachment side is offset from the remaining portion of the attachment side to permit overlapping the first interspinous process spacing device during implantation. As such, the offset portion is set out a distance approximately equal to, or slightly larger or smaller than, the thickness of the attachment side. To improve securing the second interspinous process spacing device to the first, the outer surfaces of the attachment sides of the first interspinous process spacing device may include apertures (e.g., holes, slots, etc.) oriented to receive fasteners extending from the inner surfaces of the offset portion of the attachment sides of the second interspinous process spacing device where the two overlap. Inserting some of the fasteners of the second interspinous process spacing device into the first device increases the purchase and stability of the two devices together, improving the effectiveness of the implant. In other embodiments, however, other means for allowing an overlapping arrangement of multiple interspinous process spacing devices can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, according to various embodiments described herein, the interspinous process spacing devices include an improved spacer tray configured to permit increased access and provide an increased area for bone growth above the spacer tray and between the spinous processes after implant. Access to the tray space and maximized open space between the spinous processes after implant is beneficial when providing a bone growth promoting substance to fuse the spinous processes above the spacer tray. The amount and orientation of the bone material can have direct consequences on its ability to promote bone and other tissue in-growth, further strengthening the implant and its fixation to the vertebrae. By orienting the spacer tray such that it will be positioned proximate the vertebrae when implanted, bone and other tissue in-growth is improved by increasing the surface area, and the amount and proximity of the bone growth promoting substance to the vertebrae and other tissue. The spacer tray can vary in length, width and in rotatable position about an axis defined by its length.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As described, at least one attachment side of each interspinous process spacing device is configured to slide along the spacer tray to allow closing the attachment sides on the adjacent spinous processes. Each interspinous process spacing device further includes securing means to secure the attachment sides in position upon engaging the spinous processes. The securing means may vary according to different embodiments, which include, but are not limited to, worm drive mechanisms, gear and pinion mechanisms, ratchet and gear mechanisms (like a lock tie or cable tie), cam mechanisms, one or two spaced apart screws connecting the two attachment sides, any variation of the aforementioned mechanisms with only a single or multiple screw/gear/ratchet mechanisms, etc., one or more set screws, a separate clamping means combined with a set screw, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Embodiments that have at least two spaced apart securing mechanisms allow tightening each side of the interspinous process spacing device independently. As such, the attachment sides can be tightened using a &#x201c;walking&#x201d; approach by alternating between incremental actuations of each mechanism. Tightening each side of the interspinous process spacing device independently allows the attachment sides to close on the adjacent spinous processes in a more tight and secure configuration irrespective of varied thicknesses or shapes of the spinous processes. Otherwise, without providing independent variability when tightening each end of the attachment sides, the interspinous process spacing device may not as securely engage adjacent spinous processes having varied thicknesses. Moreover, the two spaced apart securing mechanisms may optionally avoid having to use a separate clamping and/or insertion instrument to secure the interspinous process spacing device to the spinous processes, which is required by prior devices to achieve tight fixation. However, in some embodiments described below, one may opt to use an additional insertion instrument, which may be used to provide the initial orientation and attachment or clamping of an interspinous process spacing device to the spinous processes, while the interspinous process spacing device and its integrated securing means may be used to achieve final fixation and secure engagement to the spinous processes. However, other securing mechanisms described herein that do not include two spaced apart mechanisms provide the additional advantages of a single device for securing and the unique application of mechanical securing components that tighten the two attachment sides, which simplifies the implantation procedure.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Example embodiments of interspinous process spacing devices are further described with reference to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref>. Extending posteriorly from each vertebra are spinous processes. Laminae connect the spinous processes to respective transverse processes. Facet joints between the processes of adjacent vertebrae guide articulation of the vertebrae. Interspinous process spacing devices as described herein may be implanted between adjacent spinous processes of any of the cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are three engaged interspinous process spacing devices&#x2014;a first base plate type interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b>, a second link plate type interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b> overlapping the superior end of the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b>, and a third link plate type interspinous process spacing device <b>134</b> overlapping the inferior end of the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b>. The first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b> includes a first attachment side <b>140</b> and a second attachment side <b>142</b>, engaging either side of the adjacent spinous processes. Similarly, the second and third interspinous process spacing devices <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> include a first attachment side <b>144</b> and a second attachment side <b>146</b>. According to this embodiment, the attachment sides <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> of the second interspinous process spacing device have an offset configuration to permit overlap with the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b>. Thus, each of the first and second attachment sides <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> of the second and third interspinous process spacing devices <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> has a substantially flat end <b>148</b> and an offset end <b>149</b>, with the offset being approximately the anticipated thickness of the first or second attachment side <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> of the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b> (or a slight variation thereof), which is described and illustrated in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to various embodiments, the size and dimension of the first and the second attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> may vary according to the intended use of the interspinous process spacing devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> which may vary based at least in part on the intended implant location on the spine, the patient size, the treatment, and the like. For example, attachment sides may vary in length and/or height to accommodate the varying sizes of spinous processes. Moreover, as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>E, attachment side geometry may be adapted for implanting at specific locations of a spine that require different configurations, such as at the L<b>5</b>-S<b>1</b> vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Similarly, spacer tray dimensions, as described below, may also vary in size, such as to accommodate varying patient and/or implant location anatomy. In one example, the spacer tray may have a substantially smaller width than is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which may facilitate insertion through the ligaments existing between the spinous processes. Kits including interspinous process spacing devices with a range of spacer tray widths to select from are provided, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A-6B</figref>. In certain embodiments, the spacer tray widths can be provided in increments ranging from less than or 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, 14 mm, 16 mm, to 18 mm, or more, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>. Example spacer tray lengths can be 10 mm to 30 mm, or 23.4 mm. In another example, an interspinous process spacing device may not include a spacer tray. A spacer tray selection instrument is also provided and is described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In certain example embodiments, the width of the wings on a base and link plate, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> can be 3 mm, the width of the central portion of the first attachment side can be 6 mm, and the width of the central portion of the second attachment side can be 8.5 mm. An exemplary height for the base plate and link plate attachment sides is 18 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In certain example embodiments, the length of the wings on either side of the spacer tray can be 10.5 mm for a first interspinous process device base plate and 12.5 mm for a second interspinous process device link plate. Therefore, for an example device with a 8 mm spacer tray width, the total plate length for a base plate would be 29 mm, and for a link plate would be 31 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Each of the interspinous process spacing devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> may include a spacer tray <b>150</b> extending between attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, respectively. The spacer tray <b>150</b> is configured with surfaces to abut the spinous processes to maintain the spaced apart relationship of the spinous processes. According to various embodiments, as illustrated in FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>12</b>, the spacer tray <b>150</b> may have a substantially open configuration that is accessible from the posterior direction, which serves to maximize the surface area for bone growth promoting substances. Access from the posterior direction allows the surgeon to insert the bone growth promoting substance (or any other material to facilitate bone in-growth, structural support, and/or healing) after implanting the interspinous process spacing devices. Otherwise, without posterior access, the bone growth promoting substance must be inserted prior to implantation, which likely will not result in the most effective placement and/or quantity of bone growth promoting substance. In contrast to conventional interspinous spacers, which typically have a circular cross-section and occupy a substantial area between adjacent spinous processes, the spacer tray <b>150</b> described herein has a reduced cross-sectional profile and a tapered width on the leading front edge, which eases insertion between the ligaments occupying the space between adjacent spinous processes. The conventional devices often require significant retraction and/or cutting of the ligaments to implant a device because the larger, circular cross-section of the components existing between the sides cannot easily be inserted between the ligaments, increasing the difficulty, risk, and healing time of the implant procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Accordingly, the spacer tray <b>150</b> described herein can be inserted between the ligaments without cutting due to its reduced, tapered, or flattened profile compared to the larger, circular cross-sections of other devices. However, in other embodiments, the spacer tray <b>150</b> may be configured in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate anatomical variation among patients and intended treatment and space correction, and to accommodate the positioning of a securing mechanism, as further described below. The spacer tray <b>150</b> may further optionally include apertures through the spacer tray <b>150</b>, which act to facilitate bone and tissue in-growth by maximizing the available surface area from the adjacent spinous processes and cause further fusion thereof. These and other features and variations thereof are discussed in more detail with reference to the following <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Moreover, according to another embodiment, the spacer tray <b>150</b> may have a minimized width to increase the ease of insertion and to occupy less space between adjacent spinous processes. In fact, in one embodiment a spacer tray may not be included at all, and alignment, connection, and stability between the two attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> may be accomplished by way of the securing means, such as those described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> and <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the securing means may further serve to absorb impact from, and to limit movement of, one or more of the adjacent spinous processes, which otherwise would be achieved by a spacer tray.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> show details of interspinous process spacing devices according to one embodiment, such as the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> show example spacer tray <b>150</b> configurations, according to various example embodiments. The first attachment side <b>140</b> includes a spacer tray <b>150</b> extending in a substantially perpendicular direction from the first attachment side <b>140</b>. The spacer tray <b>150</b> shown is configured to have a substantially arcuate cross-sectional shape, permitting access to the tray after implanting the interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b>. However, the spacer tray may have any cross-sectional shape, such as, but not limited to, flat, angled, a partial square, a partial hexagon, a partial octagon, a T-shape, a cross shape, and the like, such as, but not limited to, those illustrated by example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref>. The dimensions of the spacer tray <b>150</b> can depend upon the desired level of movement and/or size of the desired space to be retained between the two adjacent spinous processes. The spacer tray <b>150</b> may further optionally include chambers formed through the tray, which may be oriented to provide additional clearance of the spacer tray <b>150</b> from posteriorly facing bone surfaces (e.g., spinous processes, facet joints, etc.). Accordingly, a spacer tray <b>150</b> acts to maintain a minimum distance between adjacent spinous processes to move the vertebrae apart and relieve pressure on nerve tissue and/or facet joints.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The cross-sectional shape of the spacer tray <b>150</b> can facilitate insertion into the tray slot <b>210</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>, the T-shaped cross-section, with the bottom of the T extending medially or downward into the spine provides a supporting lift for the tip of the spacer tray off of the vertebrae and into the tray slot. Similarly, the tapering cross-section of the tip of the spacer tray into a rounded point facilitates insertion into the slot, as well as facilitating insertion through the ligaments existing between the spinous processes. Finally, the arcuate longitudinal cross-section facilitates insertion when both sides are engaged with an insertion tool and being drawn together in an arc, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Moreover, the spacer tray <b>150</b> is shaped to permit access from the posterior direction, which increases the ease with which bone growth promoting substance is placed above the spacer tray <b>150</b> and proximate the vertebrae, while also increasing the available spinous process surface area. In some embodiments, bone growth promoting substance can be inserted in or near other areas of the interspinous process spacing device. Also as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B-9D</figref>, the spacer tray <b>150</b> can optionally include tray apertures <b>320</b> or other openings extending through the spacer tray <b>150</b> to further facilitate tissue and/or bone in-growth. Any number of tray apertures <b>320</b> may be included in any size, shape, or configuration. As used herein, bone growth promoting substance may include, but is not limited to, bone paste, bone chips, bone strips, structural bone grafts, platelet-derived growth factors, bone marrow aspirate, stem cells, bone growth proteins, bone growth peptides, bone attachment proteins, bone attachment peptides, hydroxylapatite, calcium phosphate, and/or other suitable bone growth promoting substances.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The second attachment side <b>142</b> includes a tray slot <b>210</b> having a similar shape as the spacer tray <b>150</b> to permit the spacer tray <b>150</b> to slide therethrough. Accordingly, the second attachment side <b>142</b> is slideably adjustable along the axis of the spacer tray <b>150</b> so the second attachment side <b>142</b> can move toward the first attachment side <b>140</b> when tightening to allow the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to be positioned along either side of, and secured to, the spinous processes. It is appreciated that in other embodiments, the spacer tray may extend from the second attachment side and slideably pass through the first attachment side, and that the orientation relative to the patient's spine may vary from that described and illustrated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to one embodiment, as is shown in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (a simplified perspective view of an interspinous process spacing device), the tray slot <b>210</b> is sized slightly larger than the cross-section area of the spacer tray <b>150</b> to provide loose fitting of the second attachment side <b>142</b> over the spacer tray <b>150</b>, permitting at least slight angular movement of the second attachment side <b>142</b> relative to the first attachment side <b>140</b>, but providing enough constraint so as to retain the approximate orientation of the second attachment side <b>142</b> relative to the spacer tray <b>150</b>. As a result of this slight angular variation allowed, opposite ends of the attachment sides can be tightened independently and can adapt to adjacent spinous processes having varied thicknesses (e.g., permitting the attachment sides to close tighter or narrower on one end relative to the other, such as if one spinous process is smaller or narrower than the other). The size of the tray slot <b>210</b> relative to the spacer tray <b>150</b> may vary according to the desired level of angular variation of the second attachment side <b>142</b> relative to the first attachment side <b>140</b>. In other embodiments, however, the tray slot <b>210</b> may form a tight fit around the spacer tray <b>150</b> to prevent significant angular variation or other movement of the second attachment side <b>142</b> relative to the spacer tray <b>150</b>. The fit between the tray slot <b>210</b> and the spacer tray <b>150</b> further serves to absorb torque or any other force applied by the spacer tray <b>150</b> against the second attachment side <b>142</b>, providing increased stability of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> relative to each other and against the patient's spinous processes when implanted.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In certain embodiments of the interspinous process spacing device, the tray slot engages the spacer tray with freedom of movement to permit at least 20 degrees of lateral rotation of the second attachment side relative to the first attachment side prior to engaging the securing means. However, in other embodiments, the tray slot <b>210</b> may form a more secure fit with the spacer tray <b>150</b>, preventing significant angular movement therein. For example, in embodiments in which the securing mechanism utilizes a gearing mechanism, a tighter fit may serve to prevent cross-threading or poor meshing of the gearing mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> are fasteners <b>220</b> extending from the inner surfaces of each of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>. The fasteners <b>220</b> improve the ability of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to engage the spinous processes and/or serve as an integration means to engage the exterior surface of the adjacent interspinous process spacing device, such as is illustrated in and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref>. In certain embodiments of the interspinous process spacing device, the integration means comprise fasteners extending inwardly from the second interspinous process spacing device which pivotally engage the one or more slots formed in each attachment side of the first interspinous process spacing device, such that the second interspinous process spacing device can pivot through a 155 degree angle with respect to the first interspinous process spacing device. In certain embodiments of the interspinous process spacing device, the second interspinous process spacing device can pivot through a 60 degree angle with respect to the first interspinous process spacing device. In certain embodiments of the interspinous process spacing device, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref>, where multiple apertures are provided for the fastener, and where multiple apertures partially overlap as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the second interspinous process spacing device can pivot through a range of angles with respect to the first interspinous process spacing device. It is understood that the device can be configured for pivotal rotation of the first interspinous process spacing device relative to the second interspinous process spacing device through any range of degrees desired including for example 180, 170, 160, 155, 150, 140, 130, 120, 110, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5 and 0 degrees. In certain embodiments of the interspinous process spacing device, the second interspinous process spacing device can pivot posteriorly and anteriorly through substantially equal or unequal degrees in each direction with respect to the first interspinous process spacing device.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The fasteners <b>220</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> are shown as teeth or barbs, but any other fastening or other securing mechanism may be used, including, but not limited to, pins, hooks, wires, spikes, straps, clamps, sutures, adhesives, or any other suitable fastening mechanism.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Example securing means <b>230</b> are particularly illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with set screw extending through the central portion of the second attachment side <b>142</b> onto the spacer tray <b>150</b> in the tray slot <b>210</b>. Various additional example embodiments illustrated and described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The securing means <b>230</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> includes two spaced apart screws <b>310</b> extending between the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and oriented substantially along the same axis as the spacer tray <b>150</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the screws <b>310</b> extend through the second attachment side <b>142</b> through apertures <b>312</b> and are received by the complementary threaded collars <b>314</b> extending from the inner surface of the first attachment side <b>140</b>. However, it is appreciated that the screws <b>310</b> may instead pass through the first attachment side <b>140</b> and be received by collars on the second attachment side <b>142</b> in other embodiments. According to one embodiment, the threaded collars <b>314</b> extend a given distance from the inner surface of the first attachment side <b>140</b> so as to permit receiving the respective screws <b>310</b> while the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> are still sufficiently separated, and to reduce the length of the screws <b>310</b>. The distance the threaded collars <b>314</b> extend may vary, but can be determined to extend the maximum distance without interfering with the vertebrae, other components of the interspinous process spacing device, and/or access to spacer tray <b>150</b> to provide bone growth promoting substance therein. Similarly, the orientation of the securing means <b>230</b> is chosen to avoid interfering with the vertebrae (e.g., the spinous process) during implantation, while also providing maximum securing and purchase strength of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to the spinous process. In another example, one or more screws <b>310</b> can be positioned between the space of a spacer tray <b>150</b> formed from multiple members and creating a space therein.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Spaced apart screws (or other securing means, as described in more detail below) permit independently adjusting opposite ends of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and thus independently securing opposite ends of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to the respective spinous process. For example, during tightening, the superior screw can be incrementally tightened, then the inferior screw can be incrementally tightened, and so forth until each end of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> is secured to the respective spinous process. This method allows tightening the interspinous process spacing device by &#x201c;walking&#x201d; opposite ends, and thus accounting for varied thicknesses of adjacent spinous processes. Additional embodiments including spaced apart screws or similar spaced apart securing means are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Moreover, some example securing means described herein may generally avoid having to use a separate clamping and/or insertion instrument. By tightening the screws <b>310</b>, the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> close on the spinous processes without any additional clamping or tightening force. However, other securing means described herein can be implanted using an insertion instrument to facilitate retaining desired positioning of the interspinous process spacing device and/or to tighten the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> against the spinous processes. In certain embodiments, the insertion instrument can also aid in aligning and engaging the two attachment sides of the device without requiring removal of the spinous process ligament. For example, the device embodiments described may be used to initially insert and position an interspinous process spacing device, while the securing means of the interspinous process spacing device may be used to achieve final fixation to the spinous processes. Though, in other embodiments, a clamping and/or insertion instrument may have an integrated tightening means (e.g., geared, ratchet, lever, etc.) that facilitates securing an interspinous process spacing device to the spine by tightening the clamping instrument, while the securing means of the interspinous process spacing device serve to secure and retain the device in tightened configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Additional securing means embodiments are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates the securing means as described, incorporating two spaced apart screws <b>310</b> passing through apertures <b>312</b> in the second attachment side <b>142</b> and threadably received by collars <b>314</b> in the first attachment side <b>140</b>. In this embodiment, the screws <b>310</b> are positioned posterior from the spacer tray <b>150</b> and substantially within the diameter of the spacer tray <b>150</b>, to avoid interference with the vertebrae upon implant. However, any other locations may be used as desired. In addition, according to other embodiments, more than two screws can be used, or only one screw can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a securing means used to tighten the opposing attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> on adjacent spinous processes. In this embodiment, two spaced apart worm drive mechanisms include two screws <b>410</b> (i.e., the worms) passing through two apertures <b>412</b> in the second attachment side <b>142</b> and operably engaging worm gearing <b>414</b>. The worm drive mechanisms are adapted to provide movement along the axis of the spacer tray <b>150</b> as a result of the rotational forces applied to screws <b>410</b> that are transferred to the adapted worm gearing <b>414</b>. In this embodiment, instead of a traditional worm gear, a portion of the inner surfaces are toothed complementary to the screws <b>410</b>. Thus, when the screws <b>410</b> operably engage the teeth of the worm gearing <b>414</b> on the surface of the spacer tray <b>150</b>, the screws' <b>410</b> threading passes along the worm gearing and causes the second attachment side <b>142</b> to move along the spacer tray <b>150</b>. It is appreciated that, in other embodiments, the worm gearing <b>414</b> may be on any other surface of the spacer tray <b>150</b>, or worm gearing separate from the spacer tray <b>150</b> may be provided. For example, in one embodiment, one or more screws (e.g., the worms) may rotatably extend through the inner surface of the first attachment side <b>140</b> and extend through apertures in the second attachment side <b>142</b>. In this configuration, which is essentially reversed from the above-described worm drive mechanism, the worm screw extending along the axis of the spacer tray <b>150</b> is turned against a worm gear rotatably affixed to one of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, causing the second attachment side <b>142</b> to move along the screws. Again, in any of these embodiments, two spaced apart worm drive mechanisms permit the independent tightening, and thus the &#x201c;walking&#x201d; effect when closing the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> on the spinous processes.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref> illustrates a side view of another embodiment of a securing means used to tighten opposing attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> onto adjacent spinous processes. According to this embodiment, two spur gear mechanisms include gearing teeth <b>420</b> formed on the inner or outer surfaces of the spacer tray <b>150</b>, much like that described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, and a shaft and gear <b>422</b> rotatably affixed to the outer surface of the second attachment side <b>142</b> that meshes with the gearing teeth <b>420</b> of the spacer tray. This embodiment behaves similar to a rack and pinion, whereby the gearing teeth <b>420</b> serve as a rack and the shaft and gear <b>422</b> serve as the pinion. Accordingly, turning each of the shaft and gears <b>422</b> causes the gears to operably mesh with the gearing teeth <b>420</b> and close the second attachment side <b>142</b> toward the first attachment side <b>140</b>. It is appreciated that, in one embodiment of a spur gear mechanism (or any other securing means embodiments described herein), the shaft and gears can include a one-way or reverse lock-out mechanism to only permit rotation or movement in one direction&#x2014;that which results in tightening the attachment sides together, but restricts movement in the opposite direction. In some embodiments, the one-way or reverse lock-out mechanisms may be selectively actuated, such that an operator may release them (e.g., to reposition the device, to remove the device, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">According to another embodiment, a mechanism configured in a manner similar to a rack and pinion is used. Instead of the gearing being integrated with a spacer tray, this embodiment includes a separate geared rack extending from the first attachment side <b>140</b> and slideably positioned within an aperture formed in the second attachment side <b>142</b>. The aperture can be sized to permit the geared rack to slide within the aperture. Also integrated or adapted with the second attachment side <b>142</b> is a shaft and gear that meshes with the geared rack. This embodiment behaves similar to a rack and pinion, whereby the shaft and gear serve as the pinion for the geared rack, advancing the second attachment side <b>142</b> along the geared rack when the shaft and gear is turned, rotated, or otherwise actuated. Any one-way or reverse lock-out mechanism to permit rotation or movement in only one direction optionally can be incorporated in the securing means embodiment. In one embodiment, the gearing on both the geared rack <b>440</b> and the shaft and gear are complementarily angled with respect to each other, which serves to hold the position of the shaft end gear against the geared rack when tightened and resists backing out or otherwise loosening by the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> when secured in place.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In one embodiment the fit of the geared rack within the aperture is a relatively tight fit to reduce angular movement of the second attachment side <b>142</b> relative to the geared rack, which may serve to reduce the potential of cross-threading or otherwise preventing meshing of the shaft end gear with the geared rack. In other embodiments, however, the fit may be looser, allowing at least partial angular movement of the second attachment side <b>142</b> relative to the geared rack. A looser fit may be used to allow the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to be positioned at an angle (i.e., not exactly parallel to each other) to account for differences in the width of adjacent spinous processes.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a securing means used to tighten the opposing attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> on adjacent spinous processes. In this embodiment, a worm drive mechanism is used, similar to that described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>. The worm drive mechanism according to this embodiment includes a threaded shaft <b>446</b> extending from the first attachment side <b>140</b> and passing through an aperture <b>448</b> in a second attachment side <b>142</b>. According to one embodiment, the threaded shaft <b>446</b> can be configured like a threaded bolt integrated with, and extending from, the interior surface of the first attachment side <b>140</b>. The threaded shaft <b>446</b> can be fixed to the first attachment side <b>140</b> (either integrated or bolted thereto). A worm gear nut <b>450</b> is threadably received by the threaded shaft <b>446</b> from the outside of the attachment side <b>142</b>, holding the second attachment side <b>142</b> on the threaded shaft <b>446</b>. The worm gear nut <b>450</b> includes teeth or gearing on its exterior surface which operably meshes with a screw <b>452</b> (or other threaded shaft operable for turning by an operator). The screw <b>452</b> acts as a worm, causing the worm gear nut <b>450</b> to rotate around the threaded shaft <b>446</b>, which in turn causes the worm gear nut <b>450</b> to tighten or loosen on the threaded shaft <b>446</b>. Accordingly, by rotating the screw <b>452</b>, such as by using a screwdriver or other instrument received by a head of the screw <b>452</b>, the worm gear nut <b>450</b> can be tightened over the threaded shaft <b>446</b>, causing the second attachment side <b>142</b> to tighten toward the first attachment side <b>140</b> over the threaded shaft <b>446</b> and a spacer tray (not shown to simplify this illustration).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In one embodiment, the fit of the threaded shaft <b>446</b> within the aperture <b>448</b> is a relatively tight fit to reduce angular movement of the second attachment side <b>142</b> relative to the threaded shaft <b>446</b>, which may serve to reduce the potential of cross-threading or otherwise interfering with the meshing of the screw <b>452</b> with the worm gear nut <b>450</b>. In other embodiments, however, the fit may be looser, allowing at least partial angular movement of the second attachment side <b>142</b> relative to the geared member, such as may be used to allow the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to be positioned at an angle (i.e., not exactly parallel to each other) to account for differences in the width of adjacent spinous processes. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a particular orientation and placement of the threaded shaft <b>446</b> and the screw <b>452</b>, any other orientation and/or configuration may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In yet another embodiment of a securing means used to tighten the opposing attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> on adjacent spinous processes. In this embodiment, a worm drive mechanism is also used, similar to that described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. However, according to this embodiment, the threaded member extending between the first attachment side <b>140</b> and the second attachment side <b>142</b> is configured differently. In this embodiment, the threaded member includes a fixed worm gear head positioned on the end of the threaded member extending through the aperture in the second attachment side <b>142</b>. The fixed worm gear head is in a fixed relationship relative to the threaded member, and which does not thread or otherwise turn independent of the threaded member. The threaded member of this embodiment is further configured to be received by and threaded into a threaded receiver, as is shown in the top view cross-sectional illustration. A screw operably meshes with the fixed worm gear head, and is configured in the same or similar manner as is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Accordingly, when turning the screw, the fixed worm gear head causes the threaded member to thread into or out of the threaded receiver of the first attachment side <b>140</b>, which in turn causes the first attachment side <b>140</b> to tighten toward the second attachment side <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to one embodiment, the threaded member has an at least partially tapered end (e.g., configured as a screw), which threads into and out of the threaded receiver. In one embodiment, a threaded member with a tapered end can self tap the threaded receiver; though, in other embodiments, the threaded receiver has complementary threads already formed therein. In other embodiments, the threaded member has a substantially straight shaft with a substantially constant diameter at or near its tip (e.g., configured as a bolt). As described above, the fit of the threaded member within the aperture may be a tight or loose fit.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11D</figref> illustrate yet another embodiment of a securing means used to tighten the opposing attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> on adjacent spinous processes. This embodiment includes a worm gear configuration, similar to those described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. According to this embodiment, however, the threaded member <b>451</b> extending between the first attachment side <b>140</b> and the second attachment side <b>142</b> is configured differently. In this embodiment, the threaded member <b>451</b> also includes a fixed worm gear head <b>457</b> (which may also be referred to as a &#x201c;gear&#x201d; or &#x201c;worm gear&#x201d; fixed on the end of the threaded member <b>451</b> extending through an aperture in the second attachment side <b>142</b> and operably meshing with the screw <b>452</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">However, the threaded member <b>451</b> of this embodiment is further configured to be received by and threaded into a floating receiving member <b>459</b> retained on the exterior surface of the first attachment side <b>140</b>, as is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. The floating receiving member <b>459</b> includes a threaded orifice having threads complementary to the threads on the surface of the threaded member <b>451</b>. The floating receiving member <b>459</b> is retained on the exterior surface of the first attachment side <b>140</b> by one or more pivotable retention means <b>461</b>, such as, but not limited to, retaining tabs, flanges, hooks, or other members adapted to retain the floating receiving member <b>459</b> while still allowing pivoting, rocking, translational, and/or angular movement relative to the attachment side <b>140</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, the pivotable retention means <b>461</b> according to this embodiment includes flanges or tabs <b>461</b><i>a </i>extending from the floating receiving member <b>459</b> and cooperating flanges or tabs <b>461</b><i>b </i>extending from the first attachment side <b>140</b>, overlapping the floating receiving member <b>459</b>, and loosely fitting between the flanges or tabs <b>461</b><i>a</i>, thus retaining the floating receiving member <b>459</b> in place. According to this embodiment, the flanges or tabs <b>461</b><i>a</i>, <b>461</b><i>b </i>prevent rotation of the floating receiving member <b>459</b> while threading it over the threaded member <b>451</b>, but still allow at least limited pivoting, rocking, and the like due to the loose fitment of, and play existing between, corresponding flanges or tabs <b>461</b><i>a</i>, <b>461</b><i>b</i>. The floating receiving member <b>459</b> thus allows the first attachment side <b>140</b> to be angled relative to the threaded member <b>451</b> (or an axis existing between the two attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>) so the attachment sides are not required to be implanted in parallel orientation relative to each other. Moreover, according to one embodiment, the floating receiving member <b>459</b> can include one or more slits formed at least partially along the length of the threaded portion, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, for example, which allows spreading the threaded portion for quick insertion of the threaded member <b>451</b> therein and subsequently pressing the threaded portion thereby engaging the threads. In one embodiment having one or more slits, a quick release mechanism may be included that spreads the spacing between the slits and disengages the floating receiving member <b>459</b> from the threaded member <b>451</b>. In yet another embodiment, a floating receiving member <b>459</b> can include a threaded portion that is split and further includes a locking screw or other similar feature that will allow fast insertion and quick release of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The securing means includes a screw <b>452</b> that operably meshes with the fixed worm gear head <b>457</b>, such that, when turning the screw <b>452</b>, the fixed worm gear head <b>457</b> causes the threaded member <b>451</b> to thread into or out of the floating receiving member <b>459</b>, which in turn causes the first attachment side <b>140</b> to tighten toward the second attachment side <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the securing means according to this embodiment optionally includes a casing <b>453</b> that at least partially (or entirely, as illustrated) encases the end of the threaded member <b>451</b> and the fixed worm gear head <b>457</b> extending from the surface of the second attachment side <b>142</b> and providing access to the screw <b>452</b>. The casing <b>453</b> can protect the surrounding tissue from irritation or injury that may be caused by the components protruding from the interspinous process spacing device. It is further appreciated that a casing similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> may be included with any of the other embodiments described herein, such as in a similar manner to at least partially cover components protruding therefrom (e.g., extending from the first and/or the second attachment sides). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> also shows at least one set screw <b>455</b> threadably extending through the casing <b>453</b> for engaging the threaded member <b>451</b> upon implantation (not shown for simplicity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>). In other embodiments, a set screw may not be included, but other securing mechanisms may be used to prevent rotation or movement of the threaded member <b>451</b> and the second attachment side <b>142</b> relative to each other after implant.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> illustrates two interspinous process spacing devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> implanted with adjacent spinous processes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. Although there is no overlap shown between the attachment sides of the two interspinous process spacing devices, it is appreciated that, in various embodiments, the attachment sides may overlap as further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12B</figref> illustrate a different configuration of a nut, which may be used to threadably receive a threaded member, like the threaded member <b>451</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11D</figref>, according to one embodiment. The hemispherical nut <b>463</b> may be formed to have a hemispherical shape (or other shape having an at least partially spherical or domed shape at its apex) for rotatably and pivotally fitting within a concave portion <b>465</b> of a first attachment side <b>140</b> of an interspinous process spacing device. Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12B</figref>, in one embodiment, the first attachment side <b>140</b> may further include means for retaining the hemispherical nut with the first attachment side, particularly during implantation, which may include, but is not limited to, one or more clips, flanges, tabs, cages, straps, bands, springs, screws, and the like. For example, according to one embodiment, the first attachment side <b>140</b> may further include one or more flanges or tabs similar to the flanges or tabs <b>461</b><i>b </i>described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, which extend from the first attachment side to at least partially overlap the hemispherical nut <b>463</b>, without unduly constraining its motion. Similarly, the hemispherical nut <b>463</b> may also contain one or more tabs or one or more detents adapted to cooperate with the retaining means extending from the first attachment side <b>140</b>, which will prevent the hemispherical nut <b>463</b> from rotating when threading a threaded member therethrough, but still allow pivoting and rotation of the hemispherical nut <b>463</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, in one embodiment, the hemispherical nut <b>463</b> may have one or more slits <b>467</b> formed at least partially through its body. The one or more slits <b>467</b> permit the hemispherical nut <b>463</b> to expand for rapid insertion of a threaded member and subsequent collapsing on the threaded member to engage and secure with complementary threads <b>469</b> formed through the hemispherical nut <b>463</b>. In one embodiment, the one or more slits <b>467</b> may be formed so as to extend only partially through the body of the hemispherical nut <b>463</b>, and may stop before reaching the exterior facing surface of the hemispherical nut <b>463</b>. Additional inward biasing or tightening members, such as, but not limited to, one or more bands, springs, screws, and the like, may optionally be included to bias or force the slits <b>467</b> together and around the threaded member. In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the hemispherical nut <b>463</b> may be formed from at least two portions <b>463</b><i>a</i>, <b>463</b><i>b </i>(e.g., two equal halves), which are connected at or near the exterior facing end of the hemispherical nut <b>463</b>. Any means may be used to connect the two (or more) portions <b>463</b><i>a</i>, <b>463</b><i>b </i>of the hemispherical nut <b>463</b>, such as, but not limited to, one or more screws, bolts, welding, tacking, clamps, bands, pins, flanges, tabs, springs, and the like. In one embodiment, one or more spring members may be contained between the two portions <b>463</b><i>a</i>, <b>463</b><i>b </i>such that the spring member biases the portions in a more separated or open position and will be compressed to a more closed position to engage the threads <b>469</b> with a threaded member when the hemispherical nut <b>463</b> is pushed into the concave portion <b>465</b> of the attachment side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates the first attachment side <b>140</b> from the interior side, showing the fitment of the hemispherical nut <b>463</b> within the concave portion <b>465</b>. In one embodiment, such as is shown by example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4M and 4R</figref>, the receiving side of the hemispherical nut <b>463</b> at or near the apex is at least partially concave to guide and direct the threaded member into the receiving threads of the hemispherical nut. In another embodiment, a quick release mechanism may further optionally be included, which will act to separate the hemispherical nut <b>463</b> to allow for unimpeded or minimally impeded removal of the threaded member from the hemispherical nut <b>463</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12J</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a securing means used to tighten the opposing attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> on adjacent spinous processes. This embodiment is configured similar to the embodiment illustrated in and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>; although, instead of an integrated shaft and gear to drive the nut, a removable instrument <b>460</b> is used to engage and rotate a geared nut <b>462</b> threaded over an end of the threaded shaft <b>446</b>. Because the instrument <b>460</b> is removable and not integrated with the interspinous process spacing device, an additional positioning track <b>464</b> is integrated with the second attachment side. The positioning track <b>464</b> guides the instrument <b>460</b> to align its geared tip <b>466</b> with the teeth extending from the surface of the geared nut <b>462</b>. Although the positioning track <b>464</b> is illustrated as being configured in an L shape, any other track configuration may be used. For example, in another embodiment, the positioning track <b>464</b> may be configured as a hole aligned to cause the geared tip <b>466</b> to mesh with the geared nut. Moreover, in one embodiment, the positioning track <b>464</b> may be formed with thick side walls to facilitate maintaining alignment of the instrument <b>460</b> within the positioning track and in a vertical (or other desirable) orientation by providing increased surface area to guide the instrument <b>460</b>. Accordingly, operably meshing the geared tip <b>466</b> of the instrument <b>460</b> with the geared nut <b>462</b> and turning the instrument causes the geared nut <b>462</b> to thread on and off of the threaded shaft <b>446</b>, moving the second attachment side <b>142</b> toward the first attachment side.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As described above, the fit of the threaded shaft <b>446</b> within the aperture of the second attachment side <b>142</b> may be a tight or loose fit. In addition, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12J</figref> shows a particular orientation of the threaded shaft <b>446</b> and the positioning track <b>464</b>, any other orientation and/or configuration may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12K</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a securing means used to tighten the opposing attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> on adjacent spinous processes. According to this embodiment, a geared rack <b>470</b> and a ratchet member <b>472</b> operate in a manner similar to known cable tie mechanisms. In this embodiment, the geared rack <b>470</b> extends from the first attachment side <b>140</b> through an aperture <b>474</b> formed through the second attachment side <b>142</b>. The second attachment side <b>142</b> includes a ratchet member <b>472</b> formed on at least one of its surfaces (shown on the outward-facing surface, but may be on the inward surface in other embodiments). The ratchet member <b>472</b> operably engages with the teeth on the geared rack <b>470</b> and permits movement in one direction&#x2014;the direction toward the opposing attachment side <b>140</b>. The operation of the ratchet member <b>472</b>, however, restricts movement in the opposite direction (e.g., loosening of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>). In one embodiment, a release mechanism may be included to selectively allow movement in the opposite direction. Accordingly, by tightening the second attachment side <b>142</b> toward the first attachment side <b>140</b>, the ratchet member <b>472</b> secures the position of the two sides relative to each other. In one embodiment, a separate insertion instrument (e.g., pliers-type device) is used to achieve enough mechanical advantage to tighten the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> on the spinous processes. An example of such a clamping device is illustrated in and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-20</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">According to one embodiment, the geared rack <b>470</b> may be slideably positioned through both an aperture <b>478</b> formed in the first attachment side <b>140</b> and the aperture <b>474</b> of the second attachment side <b>142</b>, having a head <b>476</b> on one end which will abut the outer surface of the first attachment side <b>140</b>. In one embodiment, the head <b>476</b> is domed on the side that will abut the attachment side (i.e., adjacent to the shaft), which permits the geared rack <b>470</b> to rotate at least partially within the aperture <b>478</b> and allow the two attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to vary in their angular orientation relative to each other and relative to the geared rack <b>470</b>. In one embodiment, the aperture <b>478</b> of the first attachment side <b>140</b> is also beveled or bored to accommodate the domed shape of the geared rack <b>470</b>. Moreover, in one embodiment, the aperture <b>474</b> formed in the second attachment side <b>142</b> can form a relatively tight fit with the geared rack <b>470</b> to provide secure engagement of the ratchet member <b>472</b> against the geared rack <b>470</b>. An aperture <b>474</b> creating a tight fit causes the second attachment side <b>142</b> to have a substantially constant angular relationship with the geared rack <b>470</b> (e.g., perpendicular); however, a looser fit between the head <b>476</b> and the aperture <b>478</b> in the first attachment side <b>140</b> still allows relative angular variation between the two attachment sides (e.g., to accommodate different thicknesses of adjacent spinous processes).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In addition, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12K</figref> shows a particular orientation of the geared rack <b>470</b> and the ratchet member <b>472</b>, any other orientation and/or configuration may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12L</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a securing means used to tighten the opposing attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> on adjacent spinous processes. According to this embodiment, a geared cam <b>480</b> is actuated by a shaft and gear <b>482</b> operably meshed with the geared cam <b>480</b> to cause the lobe of the cam to exert a force against a second attachment side <b>142</b>, in turn causing it to move toward the first attachment side <b>140</b>. According to this embodiment, a track <b>484</b> (which may be a spacer tray or a separate track) extends from the first attachment side <b>140</b> and through an aperture <b>486</b> in the second attachment side <b>142</b>. The geared cam <b>480</b> is pivotally fixed to the track <b>484</b> via an axle running through the cam <b>480</b>. Thus, when the shaft and gear <b>482</b> is turned, the cam <b>480</b> rotates about the axle and the lobe of the cam <b>480</b> moves toward or away from the outer surface of the second attachment side <b>142</b>, causing the second attachment side <b>142</b> to move along the track <b>484</b> toward or away from the first attachment side <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As described above, the fit of the track <b>484</b> (and/or spacer tray) within the aperture of the second attachment side <b>142</b> may be a tight or loose fit. In addition, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12L</figref> shows a particular orientation of the geared cam <b>480</b>, the threaded member track <b>484</b>, and the shaft and gear <b>482</b>, any other orientation and/or configuration may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Although not illustrated in every figure, any of those securing means illustrated may further include one or more set screws, securing the second attachment side <b>142</b> (or whichever attachment side slides over the spacer tray <b>150</b>) to the spacer tray <b>150</b> or the geared rack, threaded member, threaded bolt, track, etc. when tightened to fix the relative location of the two attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>. A set screw assembly can extend from the outer surface of the second attachment side <b>142</b> and through which a set screw is threaded to exert pressure on, and thus to secure the attachment side <b>142</b> to, the spacer tray <b>150</b>. In other embodiments, more than one set screw assembly can be employed. Moreover, the orientation of the set screw assembly can vary.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In addition, although the embodiments illustrated show the securing means oriented as generally extending from the first attachment side <b>140</b> and through the second attachment side <b>142</b>, it is appreciated that in other embodiments the opposite configuration can be provided, in which the securing means extends from the second attachment side <b>142</b> and through an aperture formed through the first attachment side <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-20</figref> illustrate embodiments of a separate insertion instrument (implant inserter) <b>1110</b> that is optionally used to exert a clamping pressure on each of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> when securing the interspinous process spacing device in place against the spinous processes. In one embodiment, the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> may include apertures or indentations shaped and positioned to receive the working ends of the insertion instrument <b>1110</b>, such that the insertion instrument <b>1110</b> may grasp the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, and operable to facilitate aligning and maintaining the insertion instrument <b>1110</b> in position. Accordingly, once the two attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> are clamped in a closed configuration, the securing means <b>1120</b> (e.g., any of those illustrated in and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref> and, optionally or alternatively, a set screw) is operated to secure the second attachment side <b>142</b> in place relative to the spacer tray <b>150</b> and the first attachment side <b>140</b>. It is appreciated that any insertion instrument <b>1110</b> suitable for applying a clamping force on opposite attachment sides may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-16</figref> illustrate another embodiment of an insertion instrument <b>1130</b> having a different configuration. According to this embodiment, a second arm <b>1134</b> is removably attached to a first arm <b>1132</b> of the insertion instrument <b>1130</b>. Thus, during implantation, the first arm, which retains one of the first or the second attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, is used to place the one side of the device against the spinous processes via an approximate lateral insertion angle, after which the second arm <b>1134</b>, which retains the other attachment side, is attached to the first arm and pivots to place the other attachment side against the opposite side of the respective spinous processes, also laterally from the opposite side. Thus, an insertion instrument <b>1130</b> according to this embodiment reduces the size of the incision by allowing positioning one attachment side first using a separated first arm <b>1132</b>. Otherwise, if the two arms <b>1132</b>, <b>1134</b> are attached prior to implant, the insertion instrument <b>1130</b> has to open almost twice as wide to permit inserting both attachment sides laterally while the spinous ligament is still intact.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-20</figref>, the present invention further provides an embodiment of a surgical instrument system for implanting an interspinous process spacing device, comprising a first arm <b>1232</b> having a proximal end, an elongated central portion and distal end, wherein the distal end has an interspinous process spacing device engagement element <b>1262</b> for posteriorly engaging a spacer plate or first attachment side <b>140</b> of the interspinous process spacing device having a spacer tray <b>150</b> extending inwardly therefrom. Such an embodiment also has a second arm <b>1234</b> having a proximal end, an elongated central portion and distal end, wherein the distal end has an interspinous process spacing device engagement element <b>1264</b> for posteriorly engaging a locking plate or second attachment side <b>142</b> of the interspinous process spacing device having a spacer tray slot <b>210</b> therein for receiving the spacer tray <b>150</b>. This embodiment further includes a compressor tool <b>1200</b> for positioning the first arm <b>1232</b> and the second arm <b>1234</b> in alignment for securing the interspinous process spacing device onto spinal processes.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As illustrated, the compressor tool <b>1200</b> has a proximal handle end a central portion and a distal pair of opposing tangs <b>1222</b>, <b>1224</b> moveable throughout a range between an open position and a compression position. In certain embodiments, the distal end of each arm <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b> comprises compressor tool guide channels <b>1242</b>, <b>1244</b> and compression point indentations <b>1246</b>, <b>1248</b> therein for receiving the compressor tool tangs <b>1222</b>, <b>1224</b>. In certain embodiments, the tangs <b>1222</b>, <b>1224</b> have distal compressor tips <b>1252</b>, <b>1254</b> extending inwardly for engagement within the corresponding guide channels <b>1242</b>, <b>1244</b> and compression point indentations <b>1246</b>, <b>1248</b> on the arms <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b>, wherein the compression tool <b>1200</b> can rotate about an axis defined by the compressor tips <b>1252</b>, <b>1254</b> so as to provide a user with a range of approach angles for compressing the arms <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b> to secure the aligned interspinous process spacing device onto spinal processes.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In the illustrated embodiment of the surgical instrument system for implanting an interspinous process spacing device, the proximal end of the second arm <b>1234</b> further comprises a retaining latch <b>1280</b> disposable on the distal end of the first arm <b>1232</b> to retain the arms in position relative to each other and in alignment for securing the interspinous process spacing device onto spinal processes. The latch <b>1280</b> can have a series of corresponding indentations for engagement on the first arm <b>1232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In certain embodiments, the surgical instrument system for implanting an interspinous process spacing device has a means for mechanically actuating the insertion instrument to close and open the first arm <b>1232</b> and the second arm <b>1234</b> for tightening the second attachment side <b>142</b> relative to the first attachment side <b>140</b>. As shown, the means for mechanically actuating is a ratchet bar <b>1290</b> pivotally mounted to the proximal end of the second arm <b>1234</b> and selectively engageable to the proximal end of the first arm <b>1232</b>, wherein the ratchet bar <b>1290</b> has a plurality of teeth <b>1295</b> on the proximal surface thereof which engage a corresponding flange <b>1296</b> on the proximal end of the first arm <b>1232</b>. The ratchet bar <b>1290</b> has a threaded track and a nut <b>1292</b> riding thereon outside the proximal end of the first arm <b>1232</b> for mechanically forcing the proximal ends of the arms <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The insertion instrument can further include a flattened surface at or near the pivot point of the instrument. The flattened surface is adapted for striking with a mallet or tamp during insertion of the device to seat each attachment side. It is appreciated that, while the flattened surface can be integrated with the first arm of the insertion instrument, in other embodiments, a flattened surface may be integrated with another portion of the insertion instrument; however, it may be desirable to orient the flattened surface substantially above the device when implanted.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Moreover, according to alternative embodiments, the insertion instrument can further include one or more channels or partial channels (e.g., C- or U-shaped channels, etc.) formed in at least one of the arms through or alongside of which a tightening instrument (e.g., a screwdriver) can be inserted to operate the securing means. For example, according to one embodiment, the first arm includes a channel running at least partially along the length of the first arm. The orientation of the channel directs the tightening instrument through the channel to align with the securing means. For example, if the securing means includes a screw or other rotating mechanism, the insertion instrument can be configured such that when aligned with and attached to the interspinous process spacing device, the first channel aligns with the head of the screw or other rotating mechanism. In other embodiments, one or more additional channels may be formed in an arm of the insertion instrument, such that the additional channel or channels align with a set screw used to fix the position of the second attachment side relative to the first attachment side. In yet another embodiment, a rotating channel, which may be formed as a sleeve that rotates around the axis of the first arm, and indexed to stop at the desired orientations, is used to align with both the securing means and the set screw. In other embodiments, a single channel may be used to align a tightening instrument by re-positioning the arm of the insertion instrument to achieve the desired alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-16</figref>, the distal portion of each of the arms <b>1132</b>, <b>1134</b> of the insertion instrument <b>1130</b> further includes a retaining means <b>1162</b>, <b>1164</b>, respectively, for grasping or otherwise retaining the respective attachment side during implantation. In one embodiment, the retaining means on the first arm <b>1132</b> includes a first peg having a non-circular cross-sectional shape, such that it is insertable into a correspondingly shaped orifice formed in the respective attachment side (e.g., the second attachment side <b>142</b>) and provides a friction fit for retaining the attachment side to the first arm <b>1132</b>. The non-circular shape prevents the attachment side from rotating on the first arm <b>1132</b> during implantation. In this embodiment, the retaining means on the second arm <b>1134</b> may include a second peg or pin having a circular cross-sectional shape, which is also insertable into a correspondingly shaped orifice formed in the respective attachment side (e.g., the first attachment side <b>140</b>). Thus, during implantation, while the second attachment side <b>142</b> is in a fixed orientation when retained by the insertion instrument <b>1130</b>, the first attachment side <b>140</b> can rotate, which allows for easier alignment of the spacer tray extending from the first attachment side <b>140</b> into the slot of the second attachment side <b>142</b> and alignment of the securing means (e.g., threaded member) extending from the second attachment side into the receiving means (e.g., floating nut or hemispherical nut) of the first attachment side. In some embodiments, the floating, rotating, and/or pivoting behavior of the receiving means (e.g., floating nut or hemispherical nut) and the advantageously shaped interior surfaces (e.g., a concave shape, etc.) improve the ability to align the spacer tray and/or securing means while bringing the two sides together. It is appreciated that any other means for retaining attachment sides by the insertion instrument <b>1130</b> may be included, such as, but not limited to, one or more clips, brackets, clamps, releasable straps, and the like. For example, in another embodiment, the distal ends of each arm <b>1132</b>, <b>1134</b> may be formed in a C-shaped or bracket-shaped clamp, within which a respective attachment side is retained.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">It is appreciated that the insertion instrument configurations described herein are provided for illustrative purposes, and that any other configuration and any other orientation relative to the interspinous process spacing device may be used. For example, according to one embodiment, tightening or clamping means similar to any of the securing means described, or any variation thereof, may be integrated with an insertion instrument and between the two arms. In this embodiment, after positioning an interspinous process spacing device to a patient's spinous processes, the tightening or clamping means may be used to tighten the device and secure it to the spinous processes, while other securing means on the device (e.g., those described, or simpler means, such as a set screw, ratchet, pin, screw, etc.) can be used to retain the device in its secured position. It is appreciated that, in some embodiments, clamping or tightening means integrated with a clamping instrument may differ from those described, and may include one or more screws, one or more ratchets, one or more levers, one or more geared mechanisms, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In addition, it may be advantageous to provide two different insertion instruments, one configured for an interspinous process spacing device being implanted in one orientation and the other configured for an interspinous process spacing device being implanted in the opposite orientation. According to some embodiments, as described herein, at least one arm of an insertion instrument may include features specifically designed to interface with a particular attachment side (e.g., the first retaining means <b>1162</b> configured specifically for retaining the second attachment side <b>142</b> and the second retaining means <b>1164</b> configured for retaining the first attachment side <b>140</b>, or the channel <b>1140</b> oriented to align with the worm gear screw of the securing means, etc.). Thus, without reconfiguring the orientation of these features and without changing the orientation of the handles, a physician would have to change sides of the patient when implanting devices having opposite orientations, which is very impractical and highly undesirable. For example, the screw driving the worm gear in the first and second interspinous process spacing devices are on one side, while the screw of the third interspinous process spacing device is on the opposite side. Accordingly, to prevent the physician from having to switch patient sides during implantation, a second insertion instrument can be formed as essentially the mirror image of the insertion instrument illustrated and described, such that the handles would be operated from approximately the same angle, but the features of the insertion instrument operably align with the device as designed.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">However, in another embodiment, a universal insertion instrument may be provided, such that the retaining means extending from the distal ends of each arm of the instrument is configured to have substantially the same shape and orientation. Thus, the retaining means will integrate with either attachment side of an interspinous process spacing device, regardless of the device's orientation. For example, one way to achieve this universal fitment of the insertion instrument is with two pins extending from the distal ends of each attachment arm, the pins being configured the same on each arm. The first attachment side (e.g., the side that does not include the securing means, such as with a floating nut or other receiving member) can be configured with a complementary orifice for receiving one of the two pins while the other pin does not engage or interfere with the first attachment side. The second attachment side, however, can be configured with two complementary orifices such that the two pins are insertable into the two orifices. When installing the second attachment side, both pins are inserted therein, and when installing the first attachment side, only one pin is inserted while the other pin hangs free of the first attachment side. Thus, the operator need not switch between insertion instruments depending upon the orientation of the interspinous process spacing device being implanted.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The present invention also provides a surgical instrument for selecting an interspinous process spacing device, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-21B</figref>. The selection instrument <b>800</b> comprises a first arm <b>810</b> having a proximal end, an elongated central portion and distal end, wherein the distal end has a first interspinous process spacing measurement wing <b>814</b> extending therefrom comprising a first spinous process stop element <b>812</b> and a perpendicularly extending wing template <b>816</b>, a second arm <b>820</b> having a proximal end, an elongated central portion and distal end, wherein the distal end has a second interspinous process spacing measurement wing <b>824</b> extending therefrom comprising a second spinous process stop element <b>822</b> and a perpendicular wing template <b>826</b>. The first and second arms <b>810</b>, <b>820</b> are pivotally attached about an axis <b>830</b> for positioning the first and second interspinous process spacing measurement wings <b>814</b>, <b>824</b> to measure space between adjacent spinal processes.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The measurement device <b>800</b> can further comprise first and second wing templates <b>816</b>, <b>826</b> adapted to overlap respective first and second adjacent spinal processes to determine space available on each spinous process for engaging an interspinous process implant. The instrument shown is adapted such that the proximal end of the second arm <b>820</b> has a measuring element <b>840</b> attached thereto with indicia to register length to the proximal end of the first arm <b>810</b>, wherein said length corresponds to space between adjacent spinal processes as measured by the first and second spinous process stop elements <b>812</b>, <b>822</b>. Therefore, drawing the proximal ends of the arms <b>810</b>, <b>820</b> together separates the wings <b>814</b>, <b>824</b> to measure space between adjacent spinal processes. In one embodiment, the first or second wing template, or both, comprises a fastener template extending therefrom adapted to engage with a slot on an attachment side of an interspinous process spacing device previously implanted to determine space and orientation available for overlapping engagement of a link plate onto a base plate.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates further detail of a top perspective view of embodiments of interspinous process spacing devices implanted in an overlapping fashion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b> having substantially flat attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as being the one inferiorly located device, such as any of the interspinous process spacing devices illustrated in and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-12</figref>. In addition, according to some embodiments of the invention, a second (and subsequent) interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b> is implanted on adjacent spinous processes, which includes attachment sides <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> having a bent configuration. According to one embodiment, the bent configuration is created by having a substantially flat end <b>148</b>, which, when implanted, will lie along approximately the same plane as the entire attachment side of the adjacent inferior interspinous process spacing device (e.g., the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> of the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b> per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and an offset end <b>149</b>, which will overlap the adjacent end of the inferior (or superior, though not illustrated in this manner) interspinous process spacing device. The offset of the offset end <b>149</b> can be approximately equal to, or slightly larger or smaller than, the thickness of the anticipated adjacent attachment side (e.g., the thickness of an attachment side <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> of the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Accordingly, at least one end of each attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> of the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b> and the offset end <b>149</b> of the second interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b> includes an integration means for integrating an offset end <b>149</b> of the second interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b> with a respective attachment side of the first interspinous process spacing device. The embodiment includes an integration means having one or more apertures <b>240</b> formed in the outer surface to receive at least a portion of fasteners <b>220</b> extending from the inner surfaces of the offset ends <b>149</b> of the respective attachment sides <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. The fasteners <b>220</b> of the offset ends extending through the apertures <b>240</b> can be interlocking posts or be extended sharpened bone fasteners, such as spikes, for engaging a spinous process through the aperture. The apertures <b>240</b> permit the attachment sides <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> of the second interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b> to integrate and interlock with the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> of the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">According to one embodiment, the number of apertures <b>240</b> in the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b> equals the number of fasteners <b>220</b> extending from the second interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b>. However, in other embodiments, there may be more apertures <b>240</b> than fasteners <b>220</b> to allow for selective adjustment of the relative orientation of the two interspinous process spacing devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> by selecting from multiple positions created by the various aperture locations <b>240</b>. Apertures may be provided in an overlapping or inch worm pattern for finer adjustments of spacing and angles between each pair of spacing plates. Moreover, in one embodiment, the apertures <b>240</b> and corresponding fasteners <b>220</b> may have a turning/locking configuration, such that the fasteners <b>220</b> can selectively lock (e.g., by turning, snapping, etc.) within the apertures <b>240</b> when in position. In addition, the apertures <b>240</b> may be sized and shaped larger than the diameter of the corresponding fasteners <b>220</b>, to permit adjusting the position and orientation of the second interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b> relative to the already secured first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b>. In other embodiments, however, the apertures <b>240</b> may be any configuration. Moreover, in one embodiment, slots may not be provided, and the offset ends <b>149</b> of the attachment sides <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> may not include fasteners, but instead may include a rough surface, or other suitable means to secure the two attachment sides. Although only a first and a second interspinous process spacing devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, in other embodiments additional interspinous process spacing devices may be added to the second interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b> in a similar manner to connect additional spinous processes. Each subsequent interspinous process spacing device would be configured similar to the second interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b>, including offset ends <b>149</b> to overlap with the flat ends <b>148</b> of the adjacent interspinous process spacing device. To permit adding another interspinous process spacing device to the second interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b>, the outer surfaces of the flat ends <b>148</b> of the attachment sides <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> also include apertures <b>240</b> to receive fasteners, like those shown on the first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b>, or any other integration means. Any number of interspinous process spacing devices can be integrated together, permitting fusing a number of spinous processes and providing increased structural integrity over individually and un-integrated known spinous process spacing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">For example, in one embodiment in which three interspinous process spacing devices are attached. In this embodiment, the first interspinous process spacing device has substantially flat attachment sides, and the second and third interspinous process spacing devices have bent attachment sides with offset ends for overlapping adjacent devices. In this embodiment, the first interspinous process spacing device is implanted, after which the second and third interspinous process spacing devices are implanted such that each overlaps with a different end of the first interspinous process spacing device (e.g., one implanted superior to and the other implanted inferior to the first interspinous process spacing device). As shown, the second and third interspinous process spacing devices are oriented 180 degrees relative to each other to allow the offset ends of the bent attachment sides to overlap the attachment sides of the first interspinous process spacing device, depending upon whether being attached superior to or inferior to the first interspinous process spacing device. Thus, rotating the subsequent interspinous process spacing devices, if necessary, avoids having to manufacture two different interspinous process spacing device configurations&#x2014;one for attaching superior to a flat device and one for attaching inferior to a flat device. Because the location of the securing means may differ when an interspinous process spacing device is rotated, different insertion instruments may be provided to accommodate the differing orientations of the device components.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In another embodiment, in which a stub implant is provided, instead of a first interspinous process spacing device. The stub implant simply consists of two stub sides proportioned to engage a single spinous process, and not intended to span two adjacent spinous processes. Accordingly, instead of attaching a second interspinous process spacing device to a first device, it is attached to a stub implant. In operation, the second interspinous process spacing device and the stub implant are likely implanted together, as the two stub sides are secured by the pressure exerted by the second interspinous process spacing device. Like the other interspinous process spacing devices, the stub sides can also include fasteners extending from their inner surfaces for securing to the spinous process, and apertures formed in their outer surfaces for receiving fasteners of the overlapping interspinous process spacing device, or any other integration means. This embodiment may serve to reduce the manufacturing costs, requiring only a single design for the interspinous process spacing device, and smaller, much simpler design for the stub implant.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7E</figref> illustrate other example embodiments of an interspinous process spacing device that is configured for implanting at the L<b>5</b>-S<b>1</b> vertebrae. As shown, an L<b>5</b>-S<b>1</b> interspinous process spacing device <b>530</b> includes first and second attachment sides <b>540</b>, <b>542</b>, each having an angled end <b>545</b> and an opposite flat end <b>547</b> with various spiked bone fasteners <b>525</b> extending inwardly. The angled ends <b>545</b> allow better fit with the anatomy of a patient's sacrum. In certain embodiments not shown, the angled ends may be further adjustable with respect to the central portion of the device to match the angle on the patient's sacrum. The L<b>5</b>-S<b>1</b> interspinous process spacing device <b>530</b> may include any securing means, such as are illustrated in and described herein, and any integration means. Moreover, in a base plate embodiment such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> with apertures <b>550</b> in the flat end <b>547</b>, an additional interspinous process spacing link device can be implanted superior to the L<b>5</b>-S<b>1</b> interspinous process spacing device <b>530</b> in an overlapping configuration by overlapping bent attachment sides of the superior interspinous process spacing device with the flat ends <b>547</b> of the L<b>5</b>-S<b>1</b> interspinous process spacing device <b>530</b>. However, in a link plate embodiment such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7D-7E</figref>, with fasteners <b>520</b> on an offset flat end <b>547</b>, the L<b>5</b>-S<b>1</b> interspinous process spacing device <b>530</b> has bent attachment sides such that the ends opposite the angled ends <b>545</b> are offset and overlap flat ends of a superior interspinous process spacing device. In certain embodiments, the bone fasteners <b>525</b> extend from opposing plates toward the bone at different opposing points to reduce the risk of bone fracture.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates a view of a second attachment side <b>542</b> of an L<b>5</b>-S<b>1</b> interspinous process spacing device <b>530</b>. As shown, the angled end <b>545</b> of the second attachment side <b>542</b> may optionally include one or more apertures <b>550</b> for receiving one or more fastening means therethrough. Because the sacrum is typically more dense than spinous processes, one means to secure an L<b>5</b>-S<b>1</b> interspinous process spacing device <b>530</b> to the sacrum includes fastening directly thereto through the one or more apertures <b>550</b>, such as via screws, set screws, and the like. In particular, an angled fastener <b>555</b> can be provided at an angle different from the angle at which other fasteners <b>525</b> extend. In some embodiments such as shown, the angled fastener <b>555</b> is a bone screw and the other bone fasteners <b>525</b> are bone spikes, although any combination of movable, immovable, or expandable bone fasteners can be used.</p>

In this embodiment, one or more fasteners <b>525</b>, similar to the fasteners <b>225</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, extend from the interior of the angled end <b>545</b> of the L<b>5</b>-S<b>1</b> interspinous process spacing device <b>530</b>. However, because of the orientation of the angled end <b>545</b> relative to the patient's sacrum, the fasteners <b>525</b> may extend at an angle other than 90 degrees (either acute or obtuse), such that they correctly engage the sacrum when tightening the two attachment sides together. It is appreciated that the second attachment side <b>542</b> is described and illustrated in detail by example, but that the first attachment side <b>540</b> may also include one or more apertures and one or more fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The integration means of certain embodiments includes a textured inner surface formed on the inner surface of the offset end and a textured outer surface formed on the outer surface of an adjacent flat end (on the same interspinous process spacing device or understood that the offset end of one interspinous process spacing device will overlap a portion of the flat end of an adjacent interspinous process spacing device). According to one embodiment, the textured inner surface has radially extending ridges arranged in a starburst or spoked pattern. Similarly, the textured outer surface can have one or more detents or nubs (or other surface patterns) approximately matching the radially extending pattern of the textured inner surface. The textured outer surface has multiple complementary detents to permit selective arrangement of the offset end in more than one position. It is appreciated that, while a radially extending pattern is described, any other textured surface may be applied to the inner and outer textured surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Moreover, according to one embodiment, the inner surface of the offset end may further include a pin extending inwardly, which can be at least partially inserted into one or more apertures formed in the outer surface of the flat end of the adjacent interspinous process spacing device. The pin can be positioned approximately in the center of the radially extending ridges and three apertures are formed in the flat end approximately in the center of the corresponding radial detents. It is appreciated that any number of pins and any number of apertures may be provided. Moreover, any other orientation of the pins and/or the apertures may be used. For example, according to another embodiment, the apertures may be formed in two dimensions to allow for both anterior/posterior and superior/inferior adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The interspinous process spacing devices and any associated components may be made of any suitable biocompatible material, including, but not limited to, metals, resorbable ceramics, non-resorbable ceramics, resorbable polymers, non-resorbable polymers, and/or any combination and/or alloys thereof. Some specific examples include stainless steel, titanium and its alloys including nickel-titanium alloys, tantalum, hydroxylapatite, calcium phosphate, bone, zirconia, alumina, carbon, bioglass, polyesters, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polyolefins, polyamides, polyimides, polyacrylates, polyketones, fluropolymers, and/or other suitable biocompatible materials and/or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In use, an example method of implanting at least two interspinous process spacing devices can be understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-21</figref>. In one embodiment, after gaining access to the surgical implantation site, and removing all necessary tissue, the second attachment side <b>142</b> of a first interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b> is attached to a securing means <b>1162</b> of the first arm <b>1132</b> of an insertion instrument <b>1130</b> prior to attaching the second arm <b>1134</b> to the insertion instrument <b>1130</b>. The first arm <b>1132</b> is used to position the second attachment side <b>142</b> against one side of two adjacent spinous processes. Because of the reduced profile of the securing means, such as the threaded member <b>451</b> used in a worm gear securing means, the second attachment side <b>142</b> may be more easily inserted from a lateral direction through ligaments existing between the two spinous processes (although, the device may also be inserted by removing all or a substantial portion of the ligaments and inserted directly from the posterior direction). The second attachment side <b>142</b> may further be seated by striking a flattened surface of the insertion instrument <b>1130</b> with a mallet or tamp. The first attachment side is then attached to the securing means <b>1164</b> of the second arm <b>1134</b> of the insertion instrument <b>1130</b>, and the second arm <b>1134</b> is pivotally attached to the first arm <b>1132</b>. The physician then squeezes the handles of the insertion instrument <b>1130</b> to pivot the first attachment side <b>140</b> in place against the opposite side of the same two spinous processes, inserting the spacer tray <b>150</b> through the ligaments and aligning with its tray slot <b>210</b> on the second attachment side <b>142</b>, while also operably aligning the securing means extending from the second attachment side <b>142</b> with the corresponding receiving member on the first attachment side <b>140</b>. In one embodiment, a punch instrument may first be used prior to inserting either or both of the first and second attachment sides, <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to remove a portion of the ligaments to facilitate insertion and alignment of the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>. The punch instrument may operate in a manner similar to the insertion instrument <b>1130</b>, but include a punch (or may simply dilate) that laterally passes through and removes the ligaments when the handles are squeezed together. The two attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> are pushed together enough to engage the securing means (e.g., worm screws meshing with the worm gearing, screws through a threaded collar, or shaft and gear meshing with the gearing/rack, etc.). Then, to tighten the attachment sides <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> relative to each other, the operator can operate the securing means (e.g., turn the screw to operate the worm drive mechanism). Because of the ability of each attachment side <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to pivot relative to the other, the interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b> can be tightened against the spinous processes, irrespective of the possible varied thicknesses of each spinous process. Once in a tightened configuration, a set screw assembly may optionally be set to secure the second attachment end <b>142</b> to the spacer tray <b>150</b>. It is appreciated that other insertion instrument embodiments may be used to position and implant an interspinous process spacing device, such as one in which a securing means (e.g., gearing, worm gear, screw, ratchet, etc.) is integrated as part of the insertion instrument, instead of, or in addition to, being integrated with the interspinous process spacing device. Thus, in this embodiment, the tightening can at least partially be achieved by operating securing means of the insertion instrument instead of on the device to both tighten and loosen the insertion instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">To implant a second (or subsequent) interspinous process spacing device <b>132</b>, the same steps are repeated with the exception of aligning the integration means (e.g., fasteners, apertures, domes, pins, etc.) on the inner surfaces of the offset ends <b>149</b> (or a straight member) with the outer surfaces of the respective attachment ends of the adjacent interspinous process spacing device <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Modifications and variations of the devices and methods described herein will be obvious to those skilled in the art from the foregoing detailed description. Such modifications and variations are intended to come within the scope of the appended claims and the example inventions described herein.</p>
