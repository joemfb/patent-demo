<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods for controlling a control station, methods for controlling a terminal station, a control station, a terminal station, and a computer readable storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, products that employ wireless-communication schemes, such as IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (Local Area Networks) and wireless USB (Universal Serial Bus), are emerging.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a control method for wireless-communication systems, there is a method in which the control station of each network controls communication with the terminal stations belonging to their own respective networks. Under such wireless-communication systems, the control station periodically sends a control signal such as a beacon, and each terminal station performs various controls for wireless communication based on the received control signal. Examples include the case where a terminal station communicates with another terminal station that is located on the same network using wireless-communication parameters included in the received control signal (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-344458), and the case where data communication is performed using a bandwidth assigned by the control signal (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-045330).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, terminal stations are not always in a location in which they can communicate with only a control station with which they desire to communicate. For example, there is a case where a terminal station D<b>1</b>, which communicates with a control station H<b>1</b> of a first network, is in a location in which it can also receive signals from a control station H<b>2</b> of a second network. The control station H<b>1</b> and the control station H<b>2</b> periodically send a beacon (control signal) for controlling communication with the terminal station belonging to the first and second network.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, if the control station H<b>1</b> is in a location in which it cannot communicate with the control station H<b>2</b>, the control station H<b>1</b> cannot recognize the presence of the second network. Consequently, the signals sent/received over the second network may act as interference signals during data transmission from the control signal H<b>1</b> to the terminal station D<b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention allows a control station to recognize, at an appropriate time, the existence of a communication environment beyond the communication range of the control station.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect of the present invention, a method for controlling a control station, at the control station, comprises the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">determining a wireless communication status with a terminal station; and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">sending, based on the wireless communication status, a capture request signal to cause the terminal station to capture a control signal sent by another station and to return information regarding the captured signal.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for controlling a terminal station, at the terminal station, comprises the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">determining a wireless communication status of the terminal station; and</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">based on the wireless communication status, sending, to a control station, a signal for causing the control station to send a capture request signal, wherein the capture request signal is transmitted for causing the terminal station to capture a control signal sent by another station and to return information regarding the captured control signal to the control station.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to still another aspect of the present invention, a control station comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">a determining unit adapted to determine a wireless communication status with a terminal station; and</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">a sending unit adapted to send, based on the wireless communication status, a capture request signal to cause the terminal station to capture a control signal sent by another station and to return information regarding the captured signal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a terminal station comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">a determining unit adapted to determine a wireless communication status of the terminal station; and</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">&#x3c;Embodiment 1&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiment 1 of the present invention shall be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating an arrangement of wireless stations according to Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> denote wireless-communication control stations, and D<b>1</b> denotes a terminal station.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The terminal station D<b>1</b> communicates with the control station H<b>1</b> based on various information included in a beacon (control signal) that is sent periodically from the control station H<b>1</b>. The beacon includes information such as a bandwidth assigned for data transmission from the control station H<b>1</b> to the terminal station D<b>1</b>, a bandwidth assigned for data transmission from the terminal station D<b>1</b> to the control station H<b>1</b>, and the like, and the terminal station D<b>1</b> performs data communication using the assigned bandwidths. The control station H<b>2</b>, on the other hand, is a control station that does not communicate with the terminal station D<b>1</b>, and periodically sends a beacon to a terminal station (not shown) located on its own communication range. This beacon includes information such as a bandwidth assigned for data transmission from the control station H<b>2</b> to a terminal station that is located on the communication range of the control station H<b>2</b>, and a bandwidth assigned for data transmission from the terminal station located on the communication range of the control station H<b>2</b> to the control station H<b>2</b>. Note that the term &#x201c;bandwidth&#x201d; used in the present embodiment and the following embodiments refers to a time interval (time slot) used for communication.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">CA <b>1</b> and CA <b>2</b> indicate communication ranges of the control stations H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b>, respectively. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the control station H<b>1</b> cannot receive beacons sent by the control station H<b>2</b>, and the control station H<b>2</b> cannot receive beacons sent by the control station H<b>1</b>. The terminal station D<b>1</b> is in a location in which it can receive beacons from both control stations H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a sequence according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The control station H<b>1</b> periodically sends a connection authorization signal for allowing the terminal station to wirelessly connect to the control station H<b>1</b> (<b>201</b>). The control station H<b>2</b> periodically sends a beacon (<b>202</b>). The terminal station D<b>1</b> is in a location in which the terminal station D<b>1</b> can also receive beacons from the control station H<b>2</b>. Upon receiving the connection authorization signal (<b>201</b>) sent by the control station H<b>1</b>, the terminal station D<b>1</b> returns a response (<b>203</b>) to the connection authorization signal (<b>201</b>) in order to commence communication with the control station H<b>1</b>. Upon receiving the response, the control station H<b>1</b> commences connection processing for connecting to the terminal station D<b>1</b> (<b>204</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the present embodiment, a wireless connection is established after the terminal station has returned a response to the connection authorization signal from the control station. However, in the present invention, the connection processing method is not limited to any particular method. It is also possible to establish a wireless connection, for example, after the control station has returned a response to a connection request having been sent by the terminal station, as in an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN. It is also possible to perform an authentication process before the connection processing.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After the connection processing for connecting to the terminal station D<b>1</b> is completed (<b>204</b>), the control station H<b>1</b> sends, to the terminal station D<b>1</b>, a signal (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;capture request signal&#x201d;) for causing the terminal station D<b>1</b> to capture a beacon sent by another station and return information regarding the captured beacon (<b>205</b>). The information returned includes the content of the beacon received by the terminal station D<b>1</b> within the period specified by the capture request signal, the timing at which the beacon was received, and the quality of the reception.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Upon receiving the capture request signal, the terminal station D<b>1</b> captures a beacon sent by another station, and monitors the communication environment (<b>206</b>). In the present embodiment, the terminal station D<b>1</b> receives a beacon (<b>202</b>) sent by the control station H<b>2</b>, and returns information regarding the received beacon to the control station H<b>1</b> (<b>207</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The control station H<b>1</b> arranges a bandwidth in which the control station H<b>1</b> sends beacons and data to the terminal station D<b>1</b> based on the information returned from the terminal station D<b>1</b> such that the bandwidth does not overlap with the bandwidth in which the control station H<b>2</b> sends beacons. The control station H<b>1</b> then sends a beacon containing information regarding the arranged bandwidth to the terminal station D<b>1</b> (<b>208</b>), and commences wireless communication with the terminal station D<b>1</b> that has received the beacon (<b>209</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this manner, the control station H<b>1</b> causes the terminal station D<b>1</b> to monitor the surrounding communication environment before commencing wireless communication, whereby the control station H<b>1</b> can recognize the presence of another station that is not located on its own communication range, but in the communication range of its communication partner, the terminal station D<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the control station can assign a communication bandwidth such that the signals sent from the another station do not act as interference signals in the data communication between the control station H<b>1</b> and the terminal station D<b>1</b>. In other words, it is possible to prevent the beacons and data sent from the control station H<b>1</b> to the terminal station D<b>1</b> from colliding with the beacons sent from the control station H<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the control station H<b>1</b> recognizes, from the information returned from the terminal station D<b>1</b>, that the control station H<b>2</b> is located on a range in which the control station H<b>2</b> can communicate with the terminal station D<b>1</b>, the control station H<b>1</b> may cause the terminal station D<b>1</b> to send a notification signal that enables the control station H<b>2</b> to recognize the bandwidth used by the control station H<b>1</b> and the terminal station D<b>1</b>. The control station H<b>2</b> can recognize the bandwidth used for the communication between the control station H<b>1</b> and the terminal station D<b>1</b> by receiving the notification signal sent from the terminal station D<b>1</b>, and thus the control station H<b>2</b> can assign an appropriate bandwidth as well.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of a wireless-communication apparatus <b>101</b> provided in each wireless station. If the control station H<b>1</b> is a printer, for example, the control station H<b>1</b> can have a wireless-communication function in addition to a printing function by incorporating the wireless-communication apparatus <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A controller <b>102</b> of the wireless-communication apparatus <b>101</b> performs various controls as shall be described below.</p>

It is thereby possible to prevent unnecessary capture request signals from being sent when the transmission/reception of an ACK is unsuccessful due not to a data collision in the terminal station D<b>1</b>, but due, rather, to an error in the control station H<b>1</b> or the like.</p>

The control station H<b>1</b> sends a beacon H<b>1</b>-<b>2</b> that includes information regarding the arranged bandwidth to the terminal station D<b>1</b> (<b>1010</b>), and resumes wireless communication with the terminal station D<b>1</b> that has received the beacon H<b>1</b>-<b>2</b> (<b>1012</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In this manner, upon detecting a beacon sent from the control station H<b>2</b>, the terminal station D<b>1</b> sends a command <b>1</b> to the control station H<b>1</b>, and the control station H<b>1</b> sends a capture request signal in response to the command <b>1</b>. Consequently, it is possible to prevent the signals sent from the control station H<b>1</b> to the terminal station D<b>1</b> from colliding with the beacons sent from the control station H<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As described above, according to the present embodiment, the control station H<b>1</b> sends a capture request signal in response to the command <b>1</b> sent from the terminal station D<b>1</b>. Even when the control station H<b>1</b> does not have a function for controlling the timing of sending a capture request signal as described in Embodiments 1 and 2, by adding the function described in the present embodiment to the terminal station and configuring the control station to be able to interpret the command <b>1</b> sent from the terminal station, it is possible to attain effects similar to those of Embodiments 1 and 2.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A wireless LAN access point and a station, or a wireless USB host and device, can be given as examples of the control station and the terminal station described in the above embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Embodiments 1 and 3 discuss operations performed when the terminal station makes a new wireless connection to the control station, but these embodiments are also applicable to the case where the terminal station or the control station wakes up from a standby mode (i.e., when the mode is changed from a power-saving mode to a normal mode) and the case where the terminal station reconnects to the control station.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">It should be noted that the object of the present invention can also be achieved by supplying a system or an apparatus with a recording medium in which a software computer program that realizes the function of the above-mentioned embodiments is recorded, and a computer (CPU or MPU) of the system or apparatus loading and executing the computer program stored in the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In this case, the computer program itself loaded from the recording medium realizes the function of the above-mentioned embodiments, and the present invention is configured of the recording medium in which the computer program is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Examples of recording media that can be used for supplying the computer program include Floppy&#xae; disks, hard disks, optical disks, magneto-optical disks, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, magnetic tape, non-volatile type memory cards and ROMs.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The function of the above-mentioned embodiments can be realized not only by executing a computer program loaded by a computer. That is, the case where an operating system (OS) running in a computer performs part or all of the actual processing based on the instructions of the computer program, and the function of the above-mentioned embodiments is realized by that processing, is included in the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Further, the present invention can also be applied in the case where the computer program loaded from the recording medium is written into a memory provided in a function expansion board installed in the computer or a function expansion unit connected to the computer. In such a case, a CPU or the like provided in the function expansion board or the function expansion unit performs part or all of the actual processing based on the instructions of the computer program, and the function of the above-mentioned embodiment is realized by that processing.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As described above, according to the embodiments given above, the control station causes the terminal station to capture a beacon sent by another station, and controls data communication with the terminal station based on the captured information. Accordingly, even when another station is present in a range in which the control station cannot communicate, the control station can recognize the presence of that station. By performing control on the assignment of a communication bandwidth based on the captured information, the degradation of data communication quality due to an interference signal originating from the station can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">According to the foregoing descriptions, the control station performs wireless connection processing for connecting to the terminal station, and when the wireless connection is established, the control station sends a capture request signal for causing the terminal station wirelessly connected to the control station to capture a control signal sent by another station and return information regarding the captured control signal. Thereby, the control station can be aware of the presence of another station that is located on a range in which the control station cannot communicate, before commencing wireless communication.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Further, the control station sends a control signal that includes information regarding a bandwidth assigned for data communication with the wirelessly-connected terminal station, and transmits data to the terminal station in the assigned bandwidth. If the control station cannot receive an acknowledgement signal in response to the data transmitted, the control station sends, to the terminal station, a capture request signal for causing the terminal station to capture a control signal sent by another station and return information regarding the captured control signal. Thereby, even if the control station cannot receive an acknowledgment signal, the control station can be aware of the communication environment out of range of the control station.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, the control station sends a control signal including information regarding a bandwidth assigned for data communication with the wirelessly-connected terminal station, and returns an acknowledgment signal if receiving data from the terminal station in the assigned bandwidth. If the control station receives retransmission data from the terminal station after having returned the acknowledgment signal, the control station sends, to the terminal station, a capture request signal for causing the terminal station to capture a control signal sent by another station and return information regarding the captured control signal. Accordingly, even if data is retransmitted despite the fact that the terminal station has sent an acknowledgment signal, the control station can be aware of the communication environment out of range of the control station.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Further, the control station determines a bandwidth to be assigned for data communication with the terminal station based on the information returned in response to the capture request signal, and sends a control signal including information regarding the determined bandwidth. Thereby, the control station can determine a communication bandwidth that will not interfere with the data communication of another station located on a range in which the control station cannot communicate.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The information that the terminal station having received the capture request signal monitors includes at least one of the content of a control signal received by the terminal station from another station, the timing at which the signal was received, and the quality of the reception.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The terminal station performs wireless connection processing with the control station having a function for sending a capture request signal for causing the terminal station to capture a control signal sent by another station and return information regarding the captured control signal. Upon establishing the wireless connection, the terminal station sends, to the control station, a signal for causing the control station to send a capture request signal. Thereby, the control station can send the capture request signal based on the instruction from the terminal station before commencing wireless communication.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The terminal station receives a control signal including information regarding a bandwidth assigned for data communication with the control station from the control station having a function for sending a capture request signal for causing the terminal station to capture a control signal sent by another station and return information regarding the captured control signal. If the terminal station cannot receive data from the control station in the assigned bandwidth, the terminal station sends a signal for causing the control station to send a capture request signal. Thereby, even when the communication environment of the terminal station is poor, the terminal station can issue an instruction to send a capture request signal to the control station.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The terminal station also receives a control signal including information regarding a bandwidth assigned for data communication with the control station from the control station having a function for sending a capture request signal for causing the terminal station to capture a control signal sent by another station and return information regarding the captured control signal. If the terminal station detects a control signal from a control station other than the above-mentioned control station, the terminal station sends a signal for causing the control station to send a capture request signal. Thereby, when the terminal station has detected the presence of a control station with which the terminal station does not wish to communicate, the terminal station can issue an instruction to send a capture request signal to the control station.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As described above, according to the present invention, the control station sends a capture request signal to the terminal station at an appropriate time, whereby the control station can recognize a communication environment out of the range of the control station.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-152708, filed on Jun. 8, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
