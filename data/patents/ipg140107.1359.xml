</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0008">International Publication WO 2010/039176 and the corresponding copending US national phase application disclose that when contacting surfaces of (i) an engaging portion on an eyeglass lens and (ii) an eyeglass frame member are to be maintained in contact, improved results can be obtained by (A) providing (i) a passage which passes away from the contacting surface of the frame member, preferably to an exterior surface of the frame member, and/or (ii) a passage which passes away from the contacting surface of the engaging portion, preferably to an exterior surface of the engaging portion, (B) coating at least part of the contacting surfaces of one or both of the engaging portion of the lens and the frame member with a composition which is relatively soft when the contacting surfaces of the lens and the frame member are brought into contact, (C) bringing the contacting surfaces into contact in such a way that the composition is forced into the passage, (D) treating the composition so that it hardens (the treatment being for example exposure to ultraviolet or other radiation, or simply leaving the composition to harden at ambient temperature and pressure), thus providing a physical lock which helps to secure the lens and the frame member together.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0009">U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,895,438, 4,896,955, 6,523,952 and 6,843,561 disclose improved eyeglass frames, some of which make use of a member composed of a shape-memory alloy (often hereinafter abbreviated to SMA) and/or a lens including a shaped engaging portion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0010">The entire disclosure of each of the U.S. Patents, the international publications and the corresponding US national phase applications referred to above is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0011">In the known eyeglass frames (also referred to a spectacle frames) which comprise a temple arm having a side arm and an attachment portion which is secured to an engaging portion on the periphery of a lens (for example as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,775 and International Application Nos. WO 2007/044221 and WO 2010/039176), the side arm is connected directly to the attachment portion so that loads and distorting forces exerted on the side arm are transmitted directly to the junction between the attachment portion and the engaging portion. I have discovered that improved performance can be obtained by connecting the side arm and the attachment portion through an auxiliary member which extends away from the lens. The improved performance can for example be improved vision for the wearer of the eyeglasses (often referred to herein as a pair of spectacles) and/or improved stability of the junction between the attachment portion of the frame member and the engaging portion of the lens. In addition to serving these functional purposes, the auxiliary member can provide valuable design features.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0012">Where reference is made in this specification to the front, back, side, top or bottom of a component, or to a view from the front, back, side, top or bottom, the reference is to a component of a pair of spectacles, or to a pair of spectacles, when the spectacles are placed on a horizontal surface, with the lenses generally vertical and the temple pieces generally horizontal</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0013">In a first aspect, this invention provides a temple arm for an eyeglass frame, the temple arm comprising.</p>
