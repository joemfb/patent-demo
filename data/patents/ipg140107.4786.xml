<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">An embodiment of a mounting apparatus according to the present invention will be described below in detail by referring to the accompanying diagrams. However, the present invention is not restricted to the embodiment described below.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a schematic structure of a mounting apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">The mounting apparatus includes a manipulator <b>10</b>, a camera <b>80</b>, a first light source <b>60</b> and a second light source <b>70</b>, a stage <b>20</b>, and a control section <b>90</b> having calculating sections <b>91</b> and <b>92</b>. The manipulator <b>10</b> is capable of holding and handling a component <b>40</b>. Moreover, the manipulator <b>10</b> mounts by placing the component <b>40</b> on a substrate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">The camera <b>80</b> (an image pickup section) picks up an image of the component <b>40</b> and the substrate <b>30</b>. The calculating sections <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> compute positions of the component <b>40</b> and the substrate <b>30</b> based on information which has been picked up by the camera <b>80</b>. An order of calculating will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">Irradiated light L<b>1</b> emerged from the first light source <b>60</b> is incident on the substrate <b>30</b> by at least a part of the substrate <b>30</b>, or in other words, by an optical path orthogonal to a contact surface S<b>1</b> of the substrate <b>30</b> and the component <b>40</b>. Moreover, an arrangement is such that, the irradiated light L<b>1</b> is reflected at the substrate <b>30</b>, and is incident on and picked up as an image as reflected light L<b>2</b> at the camera <b>80</b>. Furthermore, an arrangement is such that, light emerged from the second light source <b>70</b> is reflected at least at a part of the component <b>40</b>, or in other words, at a surface S<b>2</b> intersecting at an acute angle with the contact surface S<b>1</b>, and is incident on and picked up as an image at the camera <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">When an amount of light of the first light source <b>60</b> is changed, an amount of light reflected at the substrate <b>30</b> and incident on the camera <b>80</b> changes. Whereas, an arrangement is such that, a change in an amount of light which is reflected at the component <b>40</b>, and incident on the camera <b>80</b> is smaller compared to the change in the amount of light reflected from the substrate <b>30</b>. This will be described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram describing a relationship of the irradiated light L<b>1</b> from the first light source <b>60</b>, the substrate <b>30</b>, and the reflected light L<b>2</b>. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> show an image when the substrate <b>30</b>, the component <b>40</b>, and an alignment mark <b>45</b> are observed by the camera <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">The alignment mark <b>45</b> for aligning has been formed on the substrate <b>30</b> by a method such as a vapor deposition. When a change is made such that the amount of light of the first light source <b>60</b> is increased, an amount of light reflected from the substrate <b>30</b> and the alignment mark <b>45</b> on the substrate <b>30</b> changes.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows an image observed before the amount of light of the first light source <b>60</b> is increased. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows an image observed after the amount of light of the first light source <b>60</b> is increased. When the amount of light is increased, the substrate <b>30</b> and the alignment mark <b>45</b> on the substrate <b>30</b> of which the images are picked up by the camera <b>80</b>, becomes bright images as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">However, even when the amount of light of the first light source <b>60</b> is increased, the change in the amount of light reflected from the component <b>40</b> is small. Therefore, a change in lightness and darkness of the image of the component <b>40</b> which is picked up by the camera <b>80</b> is small.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">The calculating section <b>91</b> computes a position of the substrate <b>30</b> by image processing based on light (substrate alignment image) which is incident on the camera <b>80</b> upon being reflected at the substrate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">Next, an image observed by irradiation from the second light source <b>70</b> will be described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram describing a relationship of irradiated light L<b>11</b> from the second light source <b>70</b>, the component <b>40</b>, and reflected light L<b>12</b>. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> show images when the substrate <b>30</b>, the component <b>40</b>, and the alignment mark <b>45</b> are observed by the camera <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">An arrangement is such that light emerged from the second light source <b>70</b> is reflected by at least apart of the component <b>40</b>, and is incident on and picked up as an image at the camera <b>80</b>. Concretely, the irradiated light L<b>11</b> from the second light source <b>70</b>, after being reflected at a surface S<b>2</b> intersecting at an acute angle with the contact surface S<b>1</b> of the substrate <b>30</b> and the component <b>40</b>, or in other words, an inclined surface of a prism which is the component <b>40</b>, becomes light L<b>12</b> which is reflected toward the camera <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows an image observed before increasing an amount of light of the second light source <b>70</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows an image observed after the amount of light of the second light source <b>70</b> has been increased. When the amount of light of the second light source <b>70</b> has been increased, the amount of light which is reflected at the inclined surface S<b>2</b> of the component <b>40</b> and incident on the camera <b>80</b> changes to become bright. Whereas, the change in the amount of light which is reflected at the substrate <b>30</b> and incident on the camera <b>80</b> is small.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">In this manner, when the amount of light of the second light source <b>70</b> is increased, the amount of light reflected from the component <b>40</b> becomes substantial, and the component <b>40</b> of which, the image is picked up by the camera <b>80</b> becomes a bright image. At this time, the change in the amount of light reflected from the substrate <b>30</b> and the alignment mark <b>45</b> on the substrate <b>30</b> is small. Therefore, a change in lightness and darkness of the image of the substrate <b>30</b> and the alignment mark <b>45</b> on the substrate <b>30</b> picked up by the camera <b>80</b> is small.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">The calculating section <b>92</b> computes a position of the component <b>40</b> by image processing based on light (component image) which is incident on the camera <b>80</b> upon being reflected at the component <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">When the amount of light of the second light source <b>70</b> is increased, a contrast ratio of the substrate <b>30</b> and the component <b>40</b> becomes high, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Therefore, an image identification of the component <b>40</b> is carried out accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">Here, an arrangement is made such that a luminance difference of a boundary area between an image of the surface S<b>2</b> which intersects at an acute angle with the contact surface S<b>1</b> which is picked up by the camera <b>80</b>, and an image of the substrate <b>30</b> which is picked up by the camera <b>80</b> can be identified as an image.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">In the embodiment, as it has been described above, as the component <b>40</b>, a case of an arrangement having an inclined surface as of a prism, and an image pickup surface is an inclined surface S<b>2</b> is shown. Conventionally, a control of irradiation of an appropriate amount of light on an inclined surface had been complicated, and a desired contrast could not be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">According to the embodiment, by providing the second light source <b>70</b> exclusively for the component <b>40</b>, an amount of light appropriate for identifying an image can be irradiated to each of the substrate <b>30</b> and the component <b>40</b>. As a result, an accurate identification of image and detection of position information have become possible.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">Moreover, the control section <b>90</b> controls the manipulator <b>10</b> and the stage <b>20</b> based on calculation result from the calculating sections <b>91</b> and <b>92</b>. Furthermore, the alignment of the substrate <b>30</b> and the component <b>40</b> is carried out in a direction within a plane parallel to the substrate <b>30</b>. Finally, the component <b>40</b> is mounted on the substrate <b>30</b> and an adhesive is cured by UV light. As a result, the component <b>40</b> can be mounted on the substrate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">Next, coming back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a flow of a mounting method will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">At step S<b>1</b>&#x2032;, the component <b>40</b> held by the manipulator <b>10</b> is disposed at an upper side of a target position of mounting on the substrate <b>30</b>, which has been stored in advance, by XY&#x3b8; axis movement of the stage <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">At step S<b>2</b>&#x2032;, the first light source <b>60</b> irradiates light on the substrate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">At step S<b>3</b>, an image of the alignment mark <b>45</b> on the substrate <b>30</b> is subjected to image identification, and the target position of mounting is calculated by the calculating section <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">At step S<b>4</b>, the second light source <b>70</b> irradiates light on the component <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">At step S<b>5</b>, an outer shape of the inclined surface S<b>2</b> of the component is subjected to image identification, and a position of the component <b>40</b>, such as a position of a center of gravity is computed by the calculating section <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">Moreover, regarding the image of the inclined surface S<b>2</b> which is picked up by the camera <b>80</b>, an inclination of the component <b>40</b> can be detected by a size of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">At step S<b>6</b>, a judgment of whether or not a difference in the position of the substrate <b>30</b> and the position of the component <b>40</b> which have been computed at step S<b>3</b> and step S<b>5</b>, is within a defined value, is made.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">When a judgment result is affirmative (Yes), in other words, when the difference is within the defined value, the process advances to step S<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">Whereas, when the judgment result is negative (No), or in other words, when the difference is not within the defined value, the process advances to step S<b>7</b>, the substrate <b>30</b> is moved within a plane parallel to the contact surface S<b>1</b> by XY&#x3b8; axis movement of the stage <b>20</b>, and thereafter, upon returning to step S<b>2</b>&#x2032;, steps from step S<b>2</b>&#x2032; to step S<b>6</b> are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">At step S<b>8</b>, the alignment of the substrate <b>30</b> and the component <b>40</b> is completed, and the manipulator <b>10</b> which holds the component <b>40</b> descends, and mounts the component <b>40</b> on the substrate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">At step S<b>9</b>, adhesive is cured by UV irradiation, and the process is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">Steps <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> of computing the target position of mounting and steps <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> of computing the position of the component <b>40</b> can be carried out upon interchanging an order.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">In this manner, according to the embodiment, a difference in contrast of the substrate <b>30</b> and contrast of the component <b>40</b> becomes clear. Therefore, the identification of image becomes easy, and even with the component <b>40</b> with a shape having an inclined surface, such as a prism, the accurate alignment of the substrate <b>30</b> and the component <b>40</b> becomes possible. Moreover, since the complicated control is unnecessary, a simple and low-cost mounting with a high degree of accuracy of mounting becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054">As it has been described above, the mounting apparatus and the mounting method according to the present invention are useful for a mounting apparatus with a high degree of accuracy of mounting, and particularly, are suitable when the component has a shape having an inclined surface, such as a prism.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">In the mounting apparatus and the mounting method according to the present invention, a light source which irradiates light on an inclined surface of a prism for example, has been disposed at a position such that, light reflected from the inclined surface is incident on a camera which picks up an image of a component and a substrate. Accordingly, even when the component has a shape having an inclined surface, such as a prism, it is possible to irradiate an amount of light appropriate for the shape of the component. As a result, there is shown an effect that an accurate detection of position is carried out easily, and the accuracy of mounting is high.</p>
