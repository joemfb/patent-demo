<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diode and method for forming the same are disclosed. The carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon may be used as a steering element in a memory array. Each memory cell in the memory array may include a reversible resistivity-switching element and a carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diode as the steering element. The tunneling-barrier may include a semiconductor or an insulator. Thus, the diode may be a carbon/semiconductor/carbon diode. The semiconductor in the diode may be intrinsic or doped. The semiconductor may be depleted when the diode is under equilibrium conditions. For example, the semiconductor may be lightly doped such that the depletion region extends from one end of the semiconductor region to the other end. The diode may be a carbon/insulator/carbon diode.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to technology for diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variety of materials show reversible resistivity-switching behavior, and as such may be suitable for use as memory elements. One type of material having reversible resistivity-switching behavior is referred to as resistance change memory (ReRAM). Transition metal oxides have been proposed for ReRAM. A second type of material having reversible resistivity-switching behavior is referred to as phase change memory (PCRAM). Chalcogenides, which may change between a crystalline state (low resistance) and an amorphous state (high resistance), have been proposed for PCRAM. Other materials such as carbon polymers, perovskites, and nitrides have also been proposed as memory elements having reversible resistivity-switching behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Upon application of sufficient voltage, current, or other stimulus, the reversible resistivity-switching material switches to a stable low-resistance state. This resistivity-switching is reversible such that subsequent application of an appropriate voltage, current, or other stimulus can serve to return the reversible resistivity-switching material to a stable high-resistance state. This conversion can be repeated many times. For some switching materials, the initial state is low-resistance rather than high-resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These switching materials are of interest for use in non-volatile memory arrays. One type of memory array is referred to as a cross-point array, which is a matrix of memory elements typically arranged along x-axes (e.g., word lines) and along y-axes (e.g., bit lines). A digital value may be stored as a memory resistance (high or low). The memory state of a memory cell can read by supplying a voltage to the word line connected to the selected memory element. The resistance or memory state can be read as an output voltage or current of the bit line connected to the selected memory cell. One resistance state may correspond to a data &#x201c;0,&#x201d; for example, while the other resistance state corresponds to a data &#x201c;1.&#x201d; Some switching materials may have more than two stable resistance states.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Non-volatile memories formed from reversible resistivity-switching elements are known. For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006/0250836, filed May 9, 2005 and titled &#x201c;REWRITEABLE MEMORY CELL COMPRISING A DIODE AND A RESISTIVITY-SWITCHING MATERIAL,&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes a rewriteable non-volatile memory cell that includes a diode coupled in series with a reversible resistivity-switching material such as a metal oxide or metal nitride. Such memory cells can be programmed by applying one or more programming signals to cause the reversible resistivity-switching to change from a low resistance state to a high resistance state, which may be referred to as RESETTING the memory cell. Similarly, the memory cells can be programmed by applying one or more programming signals to cause the reversible resistivity-switching to change from the high resistance state to the low resistance state, which may be referred to as SETTING the memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Both unipolar and bipolar modes of operation of the cross-point memory arrays have been proposed. In bipolar operation, the high resistance state is established by applying a voltage having one polarity and the low resistance state is established by applying a voltage having the opposite polarity. In unipolar operation, the high resistance state and low resistance state are established by applying voltages of the same polarity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some memory arrays use a steering device in series with the reversible resistivity-switching element to control the current flow for SET and RESET operations. That is, with a cross-point memory array some memory cells are selected for programming or reading, whereas many others are unselected and therefore should not be programmed or read during the present operation. The steering element helps to control which memory cells get programmed or read during a given operation. An example of a steering element is a p-i-n diode placed in series with each reversible resistivity-switching element. With appropriate voltages applied to the bit lines and word lines, each memory element can be separately programmed and read. However, with a p-i-n diode unipolar switching may be preferable as reverse operation may damage the p-i-n diode. Also, unipolar operation may suffer from problems such as requirement a high RESET current.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, the switching yields for unipolar operation may be lower than the switching yields for bipolar operations. The switching yield refers to the percentage of memory cells that exhibit proper switching behavior. Since it is desirable to have high switching yields, it may be desirable to have memory cells that are compatible with bipolar switching.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One proposal for bipolar operation of cross-point memory arrays is to place a metal/insulator/metal (MIM) diode in series with the resistive memory cell. However, it can be difficult to fabricate MIM diodes having desirable properties such as a sufficiently high forward bias current.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diode and method for forming the same are disclosed. In one embodiment, the carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diode is used as a steering element in a memory array. Each memory cell in the memory array may include a reversible resistivity-switching element and a carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diode as the steering element. In one embodiment, the state of the memory cells is switched using bipolar switching. However, unipolar switching may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tunneling-barrier may include a semiconductor or an insulator. Thus, in one embodiment, the diode is a carbon/semiconductor/carbon diode. The semiconductor in the diode may be intrinsic or doped. In one embodiment, the semiconductor is depleted when the diode is under equilibrium conditions. For example, the semiconductor may be lightly doped such that the depletion region extends from one end of the semiconductor region to the other end under equilibrium conditions. In another embodiment, the semiconductor is not fully depleted in equilibrium. For example, with no bias or in unselected condition, the semiconductor is not fully depleted. However, the semiconductor becomes depleted under full bias in selected condition. In one embodiment, the diode is a carbon/insulator/carbon diode.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It may be desirable for the carbon in the diode to have low resistivity. In one embodiment, the carbon is primarily sp2 bonded carbon, which may lead to low resistivity. By primarily sp2 bonded carbon it is meant that at least 50% of the carbon forms an sp2 hybridized bond with one or more other carbon atoms. In one embodiment, the carbon is graphitic carbon, which may also lead to low resistivity. In one embodiment, the carbon is doped. Doping the carbon may also be used to lower the carbon's resistivity.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a diagram of a carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diode <b>204</b> with electrodes. The diode <b>204</b> includes tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> between a first carbon region <b>242</b> and a second carbon region <b>246</b>. Also depicted are a bottom electrode <b>213</b> below the diode <b>204</b> and a top electrode <b>234</b> above the diode <b>204</b>. In one embodiment, the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> includes at least one semiconductor. In one embodiment, the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> includes at least one insulator.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The carbon in the first carbon region <b>242</b> and in the second carbon region <b>244</b> includes elemental carbon. In one embodiment, the first and second regions <b>242</b>, <b>246</b> include primarily elemental carbon. By primarily elemental carbon it is meant that at least 50% of the atoms in the first carbon region <b>242</b> and the second carbon region <b>246</b> are elemental carbon. Note that some impurities such as, but not limited to, dopants may be present in the carbon regions <b>242</b>, <b>246</b>. One example of elemental carbon is graphite; however, the carbon regions <b>242</b>, <b>246</b> are not limited to graphitic carbon. In one embodiment, the carbon regions <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> include elemental carbon that is primarily sp2 bonded carbon. As used herein, the term &#x201c;sp2 bonded carbon&#x201d; refers to carbon forming sp2 bonds with other carbon atoms. For example, one s-orbital and two p-orbitals may undergo an sp2 hybridization to form sp2 bonded carbon. By &#x201c;primarily sp2 bonded carbon&#x201d; it is meant that at least 50% of the carbon is sp2 bonded carbon. Note that some of the carbon could be sp3 bonded carbon.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It may be desirable for the carbon in the diode to have low resistivity. As mentioned, in some embodiments the carbon is primarily sp2 bonded carbon, which may lead to low resistivity. In one embodiment, the carbon is doped. Doping the carbon may lower the carbon's resistivity. Example dopants include, but are not limited to, boron and nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The top electrode <b>234</b> and bottom electrode <b>213</b> provide physical and electrical contact between the diode <b>204</b> and other elements. For example, the diode <b>204</b> could be placed in series with a memory element in which case one of the electrodes <b>213</b>, <b>234</b> resides between the diode <b>204</b> and the memory element. Example materials for the bottom and top electrodes <b>213</b>, <b>234</b> include, but are not limited to, titanium, titanium nitride, tantalum, tantalum nitride, tungsten, tungsten nitride, copper, and aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As one example, the thicknesses of the diode regions may be as follows: carbon region <b>242</b>: 10 nanometers (nm), tunneling-barrier <b>244</b>: 50 nm carbon region <b>246</b>: 10 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> depicts an example current-voltage relationship for one embodiment of a carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diode <b>204</b>. Note that the current-voltage relationship is highly non-linear in this example. For some applications, high non-linearity is desirable. One parameter of interest is the &#x201c;k factor,&#x201d; which is defined as the ratio of the current at a nominal voltage to the current at one half the nominal voltage. A high k-factor (which corresponds to high non-linearity) is desirable for some applications. As one example, high non-linearity (or high k-factor) may be desirable when using the diode as a steering element in a cross-point memory array. The thickness of the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> is a parameter that can be adjusted to influence the shape of the current-voltage relationship of the diode. Adjusting the thickness to influence the shape of the current-voltage relationship of the diode will be discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C</figref>, <b>1</b>D, and <b>1</b>E are different embodiments of carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diodes. Specifically, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> depicts a general tunneling-barrier <b>244</b>, different types of materials for tunneling-barriers <b>244</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C</figref>, <b>1</b>D, and <b>1</b>E. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a diagram of one embodiment of a carbon/semiconductor/carbon diode. In this embodiment, the semiconductor <b>244</b><i>a </i>may serve as a tunneling-barrier <b>244</b>. Example semiconductors include but are not limited to, silicon and germanium. The semiconductor <b>244</b><i>a </i>could include more than one type of semiconductor. For example, semiconductor <b>244</b><i>a </i>may be formed from a polycrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon-germanium alloy, polygermanium or any other suitable combination of semiconductors.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the semiconductor <b>244</b><i>a </i>is not intentionally doped (e.g., the semiconductor is intrinsic). In one embodiment, the semiconductor <b>244</b><i>a </i>is doped. The doping may be relatively light. An example doping concentration is about 7.0&#xd7;10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. In one embodiment, the doping concentration is such that, under equilibrium conditions, the semiconductor <b>244</b><i>a </i>is depleted from one end to the other. That is, the semiconductor <b>244</b><i>a </i>is depleted from one carbon/semiconductor junction to the other carbon/semiconductor junction.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note that the doping semiconductor <b>244</b><i>a </i>does not need to be uniform. In some embodiments, the doping concentration is graded. By graded it is meant that the concentration of the dopant is different in different locations in semiconductor region <b>244</b>. Typically, the concentration is different at different distances from the carbon regions <b>242</b>, <b>246</b>. Note that the concentration might be heavier near one carbon region (e.g., carbon region <b>246</b>) and lighter near the other (e.g., carbon <b>242</b>). In one embodiment, the semiconductor <b>244</b><i>a </i>is doped with both n- and p-type donors. For example, an n-type dopant might be used near carbon region <b>242</b>, whereas a p-type dopant might be used near carbon region <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> is divided into regions that include different types of semiconductors. For example, one region includes silicon and another includes germanium. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> includes a first germanium region <b>244</b><i>a</i>(<b>1</b>), a silicon region <b>244</b><i>a</i>(<b>2</b>), and a second germanium region <b>244</b><i>a</i>(<b>3</b>). Note that other combinations of semiconductors could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> is a diagram of one embodiment of a carbon/insulator/carbon diode. In one embodiment, the insulator <b>244</b><i>b </i>may serve as a tunneling-barrier <b>244</b>. Example insulators include, but are not limited to, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, aluminum silicon oxide, hafnium oxide, hafnium silicon oxide, and titanium oxide. Note that some materials could be considered to be either a semiconductor or an insulator. For example, silicon carbide might be considered to be either a semiconductor or an insulator.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As mentioned, the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> may include silicon or one or more other semiconductors. Thus, in some embodiments, the diode <b>204</b> has a carbon/silicon interface. Some of the properties of carbon/silicon interface will now be discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>. The silicon is lightly n-doped in the examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A-2C</figref>. Note that doping is not a requirement and that p-doping may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> depicts an example energy band diagram a carbon/silicon interface at thermal equilibrium. Depicted are the vacuum levels of the silicon (E<sub>OS</sub>) and the carbon (E<sub>OC</sub>), the conduction level (E<sub>C</sub>) of the silicon, the valence level (E<sub>V</sub>) of the silicon and Fermi levels of the carbon (E<sub>FC</sub>) and silicon (E<sub>FS</sub>). At thermal equilibrium, the Fermi levels of the silicon (E<sub>FS</sub>) and carbon (E<sub>FC</sub>) and are equal. Because carbon has a higher work function than silicon, there is a certain amount of band banding at thermal equilibrium, as depicted by the depletion region in the silicon. Also note that at equilibrium there is a built-in potential &#x3a6;<sub>bi</sub>. In this example, the built in potential refers to how far the conduction band of the silicon (E<sub>C</sub>) has been bent down. As will be discussed below, the built-in potential impacts charge carrier flow, and hence the diode current.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the depletion region is depicted as extending part way across the silicon region. Note that for a diode <b>204</b> such as the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, both sides of the semiconductor region <b>244</b> will have an interface with a carbon region <b>242</b>, <b>246</b>. Therefore a depletion region may arise at each interface. In one embodiment, the depletion region extends entirely across the semiconductor region when the diode <b>204</b> is under thermal equilibrium. In other words, the depletion regions due to each carbon/silicon interface reach each other. In some embodiments, the semiconductor is lightly doped such that the depletion region extends from one end of the semiconductor region to the other end. As previously mentioned, an example doping concentration is about 7.0&#xd7;10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> depicts example energy band diagrams for one embodiment of a carbon/silicon interface under forward bias of a voltage (Vf). Under forward bias, electrons may flow from the lightly n-doped silicon to the carbon. In general, current flow may be due to majority carrier injection from the silicon. The barrier (q(&#x3a6;<sub>b</sub>&#x2212;Vf)) that is created by the unequal work functions of the carbon and silicon impacts current flow. In some embodiments, forward current flow is governed by thermionic emission over the barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> depicts example energy band diagrams for one embodiment of a carbon/silicon interface under reverse bias of a voltage (Vr). Note that the barrier height for the reverse bias case (q(&#x3a6;<sub>b</sub>&#x2212;Vr)) is greater than the barrier height for the forward bias case. Under reverse bias, electrons may flow from the carbon to the lightly n-doped silicon. In general, reverse current flow may be due to leakage charge generation and tunneling by those charge carriers that are able to overcome the barrier. Note that the length of the depletion region may grow for the junction under reverse bias, but may shrink for the junction under forward bias.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As previously mentioned, the depletion regions from each carbon/silicon junction may overlap. In some embodiments, the depleted silicon region causes the carbon/silicon/carbon diode <b>204</b> to resemble a tunnel junction with the silicon being a tunneling-barrier and the carbon contacts on both sides acting as a metallic contact. A tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> formed from silicon may be present a relatively low barrier to current flow. For example, the barrier may be about 0.5 eV for a carbon/silicon interface. However, the barrier may be higher or lower depending on material choice. For example, a wide variety of semiconductors or insulators can be used in the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b>. Thus, note that while an example of a silicon/carbon interface was used for purposes of discussion, the diode <b>204</b> is not limited to silicon for the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b>. Also note that embodiments of the diode <b>204</b> in which the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> is a semiconductor other than silicon or an insulator may also resemble a tunnel junction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Considering that, in some embodiments, the diode <b>204</b> may act as a tunnel junction, the diode <b>204</b> current may include a first current component that is due to direct tunneling through the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> and second current component that is due to Fowler-Nordheim emission through the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b>. The direct tunneling current may be fairly sensitive to the thickness of the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b>. For example, a thicker tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> may result in a lower direct tunneling current. On the other hand, changes to the thickness of the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> may have less impact on the magnitude of the current due to Fowler-Nordheim emission. However, the voltage applied across the diode <b>204</b> may impact Fowler-Nordheim emission. For example, the current due to Fowler-Nordheim emission may increase as the applied voltage increases. Thus, at lower voltages, the diode current may be influenced primarily by the direct tunneling current. On the other hand, at higher voltages, the diode current may be influenced primarily by Fowler-Nordheim emission.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> depict example energy band diagrams for one embodiment of a carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diode. Note that the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> may be a semiconductor or an insulator in this case. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> are used to provide one possible explanation for the current flow in the diode <b>204</b>. However, note that the energy band diagrams in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are for purposes of illustration and it is not required that the diode <b>204</b> have such energy bands. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> depicts an example in which there is no applied voltage. The barrier height above the Fermi level (E<sub>F</sub>) is represented by q&#x3a6;bi. The barrier height impact current flow.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> depicts the case in which the applied voltage is greater than the work function &#x3a6;bi. Note how the effective thickness (d&#x2032;) of the barrier region is reduced by the application of the voltage (V). For one embodiment, when the applied voltage is less than the work function &#x3a6;bi, the diode current is primarily due to direct tunneling and when the applied voltage is greater than the work function &#x3a6;bi, the diode current is primarily due to Fowler-Nordheim emission.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As previously mentioned, by adjusting the thickness of the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b>, the relative contribution of the direct tunneling current and Fowler-Nordheim emission can be adjusted. Therefore, the amount of non-linearity (or the k-factor) may be adjusted. For example, making the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b> thicker may decrease current due to direct tunneling. Therefore, the shape of the current-voltage relationship may be controlled by adjusting the thickness of the tunneling-barrier <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Example Memory Cell and System</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As previously mentioned, one use of some embodiments of a carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diode <b>204</b> is as a steering element in a memory array. Typically, to act as a steering element, one diode <b>204</b> is connected electrically in series with one memory element. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a simplified perspective view of one embodiment of a memory cell <b>200</b> which includes a reversible resistivity-switching element <b>202</b> coupled in series with a steering element <b>204</b> between a first conductor <b>206</b> and a second conductor <b>208</b>. The memory element <b>202</b> includes a reversible resistivity switching material <b>230</b>, a memory element upper electrode <b>232</b>, and a memory element lower electrode <b>234</b>. Note that the memory element lower electrode <b>234</b> may serve as the upper electrode for the diode <b>204</b>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Any of the example carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon diodes <b>204</b> described herein may be used for the steering element <b>204</b>. It will be understood that the carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon <b>204</b> described herein are for purposes of illustration. Therefore, the steering element <b>204</b> is not limited to the example carbon/tunneling-barrier/carbon <b>204</b> described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Reversible resistivity-switching element <b>202</b> includes reversible resistivity-switching material <b>230</b> having a resistance that may be reversibly switched between two or more states. In one embodiment, the reversible resistivity-switching material <b>230</b> is resistance change memory (ReRAM). In one embodiment, the reversible resistivity-switching material <b>230</b> is phase change memory (PCRAM). However, the reversible resistivity-switching material <b>230</b> is not limited to ReRAM or to PCRAM.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The reversible resistivity-switching material <b>230</b> may be in an initial high-resistance state upon fabrication that is switchable to a low-resistance state upon application of a first physical signal. For example, the device may switch states in response to application of a first amount of energy, charge, heat, voltage, current or other phenomena. Application of a second amount of energy, charge, heat, voltage, current or other phenomena may return the reversible resistivity-switching material <b>230</b> to the high-resistance state. Alternatively, the reversible resistivity-switching material <b>230</b> may be in an initial low-resistance state upon fabrication that is reversibly switchable to a high-resistance state upon application of the appropriate energy, charge, heat, voltage, current or other phenomena. When used in a memory cell, one resistance state may represent a binary &#x201c;0&#x201d; while another resistance state may represent a binary &#x201c;1.&#x201d; However, more than two data/resistance states may be used. Numerous reversible resistivity-switching materials and operation of memory cells employing reversible resistivity-switching materials are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006/0250836, previously incorporated.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> is a block diagram that depicts one example of a memory system <b>300</b> that can implement the technology described herein. Memory system <b>300</b> includes a memory array <b>302</b> that can be a two or three dimensional array of memory cells as described above. In one embodiment, memory array <b>302</b> is a monolithic three dimensional memory array. The array terminal lines of memory array <b>302</b> include the various layer(s) of word lines organized as rows, and the various layer(s) of bit lines organized as columns. However, other orientations can also be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Memory system <b>300</b> includes row control circuitry <b>320</b>, whose outputs <b>308</b> are connected to respective word lines of the memory array <b>302</b>. Row control circuitry <b>320</b> receives a group of M row address signals and one or more various control signals from System Control Logic circuit <b>330</b>, and typically may include such circuits as row decoders <b>322</b>, array terminal drivers <b>324</b>, and block select circuitry <b>326</b> for both read and programming (e.g., SET and RESET) operations. Memory system <b>300</b> also includes column control circuitry <b>310</b> whose input/outputs <b>306</b> are connected to respective bit lines of the memory array <b>302</b>. Column control circuitry <b>306</b> receives a group of N column address signals and one or more various control signals from System Control Logic <b>330</b>, and typically may include such circuits as column decoders <b>312</b>, array terminal receivers or drivers <b>314</b>, block select circuitry <b>316</b>, as well as read/write circuitry, and I/O multiplexers. System control logic <b>330</b> receives data and commands from a host and provides output data to the host. In other embodiments, system control logic <b>330</b> receives data and commands from a separate controller circuit and provides output data to that controller circuit, with the controller circuit communicating with the host. System control logic <b>330</b> may include one or more state machines, registers and other control logic for controlling the operation of memory system <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment, all of the components depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> are arranged on a single integrated circuit. For example, system control logic <b>330</b>, column control circuitry <b>310</b> and row control circuitry <b>320</b> are formed on the surface of a substrate and memory array <b>302</b> is a monolithic three dimensional memory array formed above the substrate (and, therefore, above system control logic <b>330</b>, column control circuitry <b>310</b> and row control circuitry <b>320</b>). In some cases, a portion of the control circuitry can be formed on the same layers as some of the memory array.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Integrated circuits incorporating a memory array usually subdivide the array into a number of sub-arrays or blocks. Blocks can be further grouped together into bays that contain, for example, 16, 32, or a different number of blocks. As frequently used, a sub-array is a contiguous group of memory cells having contiguous word and bit lines generally unbroken by decoders, drivers, sense amplifiers, and input/output circuits. This is done for any of a variety of reasons. For example, the signal delays traversing down word lines and bit lines which arise from the resistance and the capacitance of such lines (i.e., the RC delays) may be very significant in a large array. These RC delays may be reduced by subdividing a larger array into a group of smaller sub-arrays so that the length of each word line and/or each bit line is reduced. As another example, the power associated with accessing a group of memory cells may dictate an upper limit to the number of memory cells which may be accessed simultaneously during a given memory cycle. Consequently, a large memory array is frequently subdivided into smaller sub-arrays to decrease the number of memory cells which are simultaneously accessed. Nonetheless, for ease of description, an array may also be used synonymously with sub-array to refer to a contiguous group of memory cells having contiguous word and bit lines generally unbroken by decoders, drivers, sense amplifiers, and input/output circuits. An integrated circuit may include one or more than one memory array.</p>

Process <b>500</b> may be used to form a diode <b>204</b> such as depicted in any of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D, or <b>1</b>E, but is not limited to such embodiments. In step <b>502</b>, a first region of carbon <b>242</b> is formed. In one embodiment, the first region includes primarily elemental carbon. By primarily elemental carbon it is meant that at least 50% of the atoms in the first region are elemental carbon. In one embodiment, the elemental carbon in the first region includes primarily sp2 bonded carbon. By primarily sp2 bonded carbon it is meant that at least 50% of the carbon in the first region is sp2 bonded carbon. In one embodiment, the carbon in the first region is doped with an impurity such as boron or nitrogen. Doping of the carbon may be in situ or by implant.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one embodiment, forming the first carbon region <b>242</b> includes depositing amorphous carbon and later performing a thermal anneal to cause the amorphous carbon to include primarily sp2 bonded carbon. Example parameters for the thermal anneal is a rapid thermal anneal (RTA) at 700 C for 60 seconds. In one embodiment, amorphous carbon is deposited in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) chamber using C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>gas at 550 C and at 5 Torr pressure. As deposited, the amorphous carbon may exhibit relatively high resistivity. The resistivity of the carbon may be lowered by increasing the amount of sp2 bonded carbon. Note that the resistivity may depend on the thickness of the carbon. In one embodiment, the thickness of the carbon is about 100 Angstoms, which may provide for acceptable resistivity and a reproducible film thickness. Note that the carbon film may be thicker or thinner than 100 Angstoms. For example, the carbon film could be made thinner than 100 Angstoms to lower the resistivity. Note that the thermal anneal may take place after other steps of process <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step <b>504</b>, a second region that includes carbon is formed. Step <b>504</b> is similar to step <b>502</b>.

In one embodiment, forming the second carbon region <b>242</b> includes depositing amorphous carbon and then performing a thermal anneal to cause the amorphous carbon to form sp2 bonded carbon. In one embodiment, the carbon in the second region is doped with an impurity such as boron or nitrogen. Note that step <b>504</b> does not necessarily directly follow step <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step <b>506</b>, a third region that includes at least one material that provides a tunneling-barrier between the first region and the second region is formed.

The third region might include a silicon-germanium alloy or separate silicon and germanium regions. The semiconductor may be undoped or lightly doped. In one embodiment, at equilibrium the at least one semiconductor is depleted. In one embodiment, the at least one semiconductor has a first portion near the first region that includes a p-type dopant and a second portion near the second region that includes an n-type dopant. In one embodiment, the at least one material that provides a tunneling-barrier includes an insulator. For example, at least one material that provides a tunneling-barrier may include one or more of silicon carbide, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, hafnium silicon oxide, aluminum silicon oxide, or titanium oxide</p>

Process <b>600</b> may be used to form a memory array such as memory array <b>214</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Formation of the memory array <b>214</b> begins with providing a substrate in step <b>602</b>. The substrate can be any semiconducting substrate known in the art, such as monocrystalline silicon, IV-IV compounds like silicon-germanium or silicon-germanium-carbon, III-V compounds, II-VII compounds, epitaxial layers over such substrates, or any other semiconducting material. The substrate may include integrated circuits fabricated therein. For example, the substrate may include circuits that are electrically connected to the conductors <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> in order to read and program the memory array. In step <b>604</b>, an insulating layer is formed over substrate. The insulating layer can be silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or any other suitable insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In step <b>606</b>, first (or lower) conductors <b>206</b> are formed over the insulator. Step <b>606</b> may includes depositing a material for first conductors <b>206</b> over the insulator. An adhesion layer may be included between the insulating layer and the conducting layer to help the conducting layer adhere to the insulating layer. If the overlying conducting layer is tungsten, titanium nitride may be used as an adhesion layer. The conducting layer may comprise any conducting material known in the art, such as tungsten, or other materials, including tantalum, titanium, copper, cobalt, or alloys thereof. Once all the layers that will form the first conductors <b>206</b> have been deposited, the layers are patterned and etched using any suitable masking and etching process to form substantially parallel, substantially coplanar conductors <b>206</b>. In one embodiment, photoresist is deposited, patterned by photolithography and the layers etched, and then the photoresist removed using standard process techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, in step <b>608</b>, a dielectric material is deposited over and between first conductors <b>206</b>. The dielectric material can be any known electrically insulating material, such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or silicon oxynitride.

Excess dielectric material on top of first conductors <b>206</b> may be removed, exposing the tops of first conductors <b>206</b> separated by dielectric material, and leaving a substantially planar surface. This removal of dielectric overfill to form the planar surface can be performed by any process known in the art, such as chemical mechanical polish (CMP) or planarization etchback. In an alternative embodiment, first conductors <b>206</b> could be formed by a Damascene method. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> depict results after step <b>608</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows first (lower) conductors <b>206</b> residing over a substrate <b>702</b> and bottom insulator <b>704</b> with dielectric <b>706</b> between the first conductors <b>206</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows a cross section taken along line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>.</p>
