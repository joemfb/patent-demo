<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The following description of certain exemplary embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the underside of a vehicle transmission and exhaust system. A transmission <b>10</b> has a fluid pan assembly <b>12</b> bolted on the underside thereof for storing a volume of transmission fluid ready for circulation through the transmission <b>10</b>. A vehicle exhaust system <b>14</b> includes a left bank exhaust pipe <b>18</b> and a right bank exhaust pipe <b>20</b>. The left bank exhaust pipe <b>18</b> crosses over beneath the transmission <b>10</b> and joins with the right bank exhaust pipe <b>20</b> at an exhaust pipe juncture <b>22</b>. A tailpipe assembly <b>26</b> is connected to the exhaust pipe juncture <b>22</b> for carrying the engine exhaust gases through an aftertreatment device <b>28</b> and then out the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, it is seen that the fluid pan assembly <b>12</b> includes an inner housing <b>36</b> and an outer housing <b>38</b>. The inner housing <b>36</b> defines an inner chamber <b>40</b> which stores a supply of transmission fluid <b>42</b>. A transmission fluid pump, not shown, will pump transmission fluid <b>42</b> from the inner chamber <b>40</b> and circulate transmission fluid <b>42</b> through the transmission <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The inner housing <b>36</b> and the outer housing <b>38</b> are each a metal stamping. In particular, the inner housing <b>36</b> has a bottom wall <b>46</b>, sidewalls <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>, a front end wall <b>52</b>, and a rear end wall <b>54</b>. The sidewalls <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>, as well as the front end wall <b>52</b> and rear end wall <b>54</b>, merge into a peripheral flange <b>58</b>. The outer housing <b>38</b> has a bottom wall <b>64</b>, sidewalls <b>66</b> and <b>68</b>, a front end wall <b>70</b>, and a rear end wall <b>72</b>. The sidewalls <b>66</b> and <b>68</b>, the front end wall <b>70</b> and the rear end wall <b>72</b>, merge into a peripheral flange <b>76</b>. The peripheral flange <b>58</b> of the inner housing <b>36</b> is attached to the peripheral flange <b>76</b> of the outer housing <b>38</b> by a folded edge <b>80</b> of the peripheral flange <b>58</b> of the inner housing <b>36</b>. A plurality of bolt holes <b>84</b> are provided in the peripheral flanges <b>58</b> and <b>76</b> to enable bolting of the fluid pan assembly <b>12</b> to the underside of the transmission <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, the sidewalls <b>48</b> and <b>66</b>, the sidewalls <b>50</b> and <b>68</b>, and front end walls <b>52</b> and <b>70</b> are spaced away from one another to define therebetween an outer chamber <b>86</b> for receiving exhaust gas from the vehicle engine. In particular, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an inlet opening <b>88</b> is provided in the sidewall <b>66</b> of the outer housing <b>38</b>. On the opposite side of the fluid pan assembly <b>12</b>, an outlet opening <b>90</b> is provided in the sidewall <b>68</b> of the outer housing <b>38</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an exhaust pipe inlet fitting <b>94</b> is welded to the sidewall <b>66</b> of outer housing <b>38</b> and registers with the inlet opening <b>88</b>. The exhaust pipe inlet fitting <b>94</b> has bolt holes <b>96</b> therein for bolting to the exhaust pipe <b>18</b>. An exhaust pipe outlet fitting <b>98</b> is welded to the sidewall <b>68</b> of the outer housing <b>38</b> and registers with the outlet opening <b>90</b>. The outlet fitting <b>98</b> has bolt holes <b>102</b> for bolting to the right bank exhaust pipe <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, a plurality of heat transfer fins <b>106</b> are provided for enhancing the transfer of heat from exhaust gas contained within the outer chamber <b>86</b> to the transmission fluid <b>42</b> stored within the inner chamber <b>40</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the fins are provided by a plurality of U-shaped channels <b>110</b>. Each U-shaped channel <b>110</b> includes a base wall <b>112</b> welded to a sidewall or end wall of the inner housing <b>36</b>, and a pair of laterally spaced fin walls <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> that project from the base wall <b>112</b> into the outer chamber <b>86</b>. One or more of these U-shaped channels <b>110</b> is provided on the sidewalls <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> of the inner housing <b>36</b>, and on the front end wall <b>52</b> of the inner housing <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an inlet valve <b>118</b> communicates hot exhaust gas into the outer chamber <b>86</b>. In particular, the left bank exhaust pipe <b>18</b> has a branch pipe <b>120</b> that is fitted with a flange <b>122</b> that bolts to the inlet fitting <b>94</b> of the outer housing <b>36</b>. A flapper valve <b>124</b> pivots at pivot <b>125</b> for rotary motion between a solid line position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and a phantom line position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A motor <b>126</b> is connected to the flapper valve <b>124</b> by a rod <b>128</b> and arm <b>130</b> so that the motor <b>126</b> can pivot the flapper valve <b>124</b> between the solid line position and the phantom line position.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the solid line position, the flapper valve <b>124</b> has opened the flow of exhaust gas into the branch pipe <b>120</b> and outer chamber <b>86</b>, while at the same time closing all or part of the flow of exhaust gas to the tailpipe <b>26</b>. Accordingly, the hot exhaust gas is being ducted into the outer chamber <b>86</b> where the exhaust gas will be exposed to the fins <b>106</b>, the sidewalls <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>, and front end wall <b>52</b> of the inner housing <b>36</b>. Heat transfers into the transmission fluid <b>42</b>. After flowing through the outer chamber <b>86</b>, the exhaust gas will be exhausted through the outlet opening <b>90</b> into an outlet branch pipe <b>136</b> that connects back into the right bank exhaust pipe <b>20</b> and thence through the exhaust pipe juncture <b>22</b> to the tailpipe <b>26</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the phantom line position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flapper valve <b>124</b> is closing the flow of exhaust gas to the inlet opening <b>88</b> so that the exhaust gas will not reach the outer chamber <b>86</b> and the heating of the transmission fluid <b>42</b> by the exhaust gas is terminated. The motor <b>126</b> for operating the flapper valve <b>124</b> can be hydraulic, pneumatic, or electrical, and is operated through a control system in response to the temperature of the transmission fluid <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although the drawings herein show the example of a fluid pan assembly <b>12</b> that is constructed by two metal stampings that are joined together, it will be understood that the fluid pan assembly can be manufactured in a casting process in which case the housings can be a one-piece casting or a separate inner casting and outer casting. In the case of a cast housing, the fins can be cast integrally with the inner housing rather than being separately manufactured and welded thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the bottom walls <b>46</b> and <b>64</b> are shown as touching one another with no space therebetween. This construction is advantageous as it maintains the maximum clearance from the ground. However, space can be provided between the bottom walls <b>46</b> and <b>64</b> if it is desired to provide for the circulation of exhaust gas through that space. In addition, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, the rear end walls <b>54</b> and <b>72</b> are touching one another with no space therebetween. This construction is advantageous as it causes the exhaust gas to achieve a U-shaped flow through the outer chamber <b>86</b>. In particular, the exhaust gas will enter the fluid pan <b>12</b> on one side at the inlet opening <b>88</b> and then travel around the one side down along the front and then along the other side before exiting through the outlet opening <b>90</b>. However, if desired, a space can be provided between the rear end walls <b>54</b> and <b>72</b> so that the rear end wall <b>54</b> can also be exposed to the exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although the drawings herein show the invention applied to an engine having a left bank exhaust and right bank exhaust, the invention can also be applied to an engine having an exhaust pipe extending from a single side of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, a compact and economically manufactured transmission fluid heater is provided for enhancing the operation of the vehicle by heating the transmission fluid to minimize transmission spin loss and improve the fuel economy of the vehicle.</p>
