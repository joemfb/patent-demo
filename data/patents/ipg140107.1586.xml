<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a terminal fitting with one or more stabilizers for preventing inverted insertion and to a fluid- or waterproof connector provided with such a terminal fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 5,743,771 discloses a terminal fitting shaped so that two stabilizers extend vertically from opposite left and right lateral edges of the bottom surface of a rectangular tubular main portion. The terminal fitting is crimped and connected to an end of a wire, and a rubber plug is mounted on the rear of the terminal fitting when the terminal fitting is accommodated in an individual waterproof connector.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, a housing is formed with cavities into which the terminal fittings are inserted. Each cavity is shaped to include a rectangular terminal accommodating hole for closely receiving the main portion of the terminal fitting. A circular sealing hole is continuous with and behind the terminal accommodating hole and is cross-sectionally larger than the terminal accommodating hole to allow the rubber plug to be closely fit. Left and right insertion paths are formed in the bottom wall of the terminal accommodating hole for permitting passage of the stabilizers of the terminal fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the terminal fitting is inserted in a proper posture into the corresponding cavity of the housing, the main portion of the terminal fitting is inserted to a proper position into the terminal accommodating hole, the stabilizers are inserted into the insertion paths, and the rubber plug is fit closely in the sealing hole.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, if the terminal fitting is inserted in a vertically inverted posture, the stabilizers contact an edge at a side of the terminal accommodating hole vertically opposite to the side where the insertion paths are provided to prevent further insertion of the inverted terminal fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A demand exists for smaller individual waterproof connectors that accommodate such terminal fittings. Accordingly, consideration has been given to reducing the diameters of the rubber plug and the sealing hole into which the rubber plug is fit. For example, the diameter of the sealing hole could be close to the diameter of a circumscribed circle of the main portion of the terminal fitting. In this case, it is necessary to prevent projecting ends of the stabilizers from interfering with and scratching the inner peripheral surface of the sealing hole when inserting the terminal fitting into the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a terminal fitting that is intended to prevent scratching the sealing hole. More particularly, the terminal fitting of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> has a main portion <b>1</b> and left and right stabilizers <b>2</b>A aligned to approach one another at farther distances from the main portion <b>1</b> so that ends of the stabilizers <b>2</b>A are located within a circumscribed circle x of the main portion <b>1</b>. According to this design, the stabilizers <b>2</b>A must be long and inclined a large amount if the main portion <b>1</b> is wide. These long inclined stabilizers <b>2</b>A are likely to be deformed when contacting the edge of the terminal accommodating hole and an inverted insertion preventing function may not be fulfilled.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows another miniaturized terminal fitting that is intended to prevent inverted insertion. The terminal fitting of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> has a main portion <b>1</b> and left and right stabilizers <b>2</b>B that extend vertically down from positions spaced in from the opposite left and right lateral edges of the bottom surface of the main portion <b>1</b>. Again, the stabilizers <b>2</b>B are within a circumscribed circle x of the main portion <b>1</b>. The stabilizers <b>2</b>B are difficult to deform and can fulfill the inverted insertion preventing function sufficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Outer corners at projecting ends of the stabilizers <b>2</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> are hammered to form C-surfaces <b>3</b> to prevent the stabilizers <b>2</b>B from biting into the inner peripheral surface of the sealing hole. Nevertheless, edges <b>4</b> are formed on the lateral projecting edges of the chamfers <b>3</b>. A receiving die of a press machine prevents further hammering of the chamfers <b>3</b>, and hence the edges <b>4</b> must be left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Therefore, scratching on the inner peripheral surface of the sealing hole cannot be avoided with certainty and a waterproof function may be impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention was completed in view of the above situation and an object thereof is to provide a terminal fitting capable of reliably fulfilling an inverted insertion preventing function and ensuring a waterproof function.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention relates to a terminal fitting for a fluid- or waterproof connector in which the terminal fitting and a resilient plug are mounted on an end of a wire. The terminal fitting is inserted into and accommodated in a cavity of a connector housing and the resilient plug is fit into an entrance of the cavity to provide sealing. The terminal fitting has a main portion in the form of a substantially rectangular tube. At least one stabilizer extends from one surface of the main portion for preventing inverted insertion. The stabilizer is formed at a specified distance in from a lateral edge of one surface of the main portion toward a widthwise center and has such an oblique posture toward the widthwise center that the extending end of the stabilizer is within a circumscribed circle of the main portion. At least one C-surface is formed on corners of the outer lateral edges of an extending end surface of the stabilizer and at least one R-surface is formed on a lateral edge of the C-surface on a base end side of the stabilizer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The at least one stabilizer preferably comprises two stabilizers formed at positions at a specified distance in from opposite left and right lateral edges of the one surface of the main portion toward the widthwise center and assume such oblique postures that both extending ends gradually come closer to each other. The extending ends of the stabilizers are located within a circumscribed circle of the main portion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">C-surfaces are formed on corner portions of the outer lateral edges of extending end surfaces of the both stabilizers and R-surfaces are formed on lateral edges of the C-surfaces on base end sides of the stabilizers. Here, C-surfaces are straight chamfers and the R-surfaces are curved chamfers.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Several significant functions and effects can be obtained if the entrance of the cavity is as small as possible in conformity with the circumscribed circle of the main portion including the stabilizers. For example, left and right stabilizers are formed at positions inward of the left and right edges of one surface of the main portion and assume oblique postures so that the extending ends gradually approach each other and lie within the circumscribed circle of the main portion. Thus, to attain necessary engaging margins, an angle of inclination of the stabilizers can be suppressed maximally and the stabilizers can be short. As a result, the stabilizers difficult to incline and deform, and reliably fulfill an inverted insertion preventing function.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, the C-surfaces are formed on the corners of the outer lateral edges of the extending end surfaces of the respective stabilizers. Thus, the extending ends of the stabilizers will not interfere with the inner peripheral surface of the entrance of the cavity. Edges are still present on the opposite lateral edges of the C-surfaces. However, the stabilizers are inclined obliquely in and the lateral edges on the tip sides of the C-surfaces are located inside the circumscribed circle of the main portion. The lateral edges on the base sides of the C-surface are located on the circumscribed circle, but are hammered to form the R-surfaces. Thus, the edges of the stabilizers that will interface with the inner peripheral surface of the entrance of the cavity are eliminated and the stabilizers will not scratch the inner peripheral surface of the entrance of the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, the stabilizers reliably fulfill the inverted insertion preventing function and ensure a waterproof function by preventing the stabilizers from scratching the inner peripheral surface of the entrance of the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The C-surfaces preferably are on outer corner portions of front end surfaces of the stabilizers in an inserting direction of the terminal fitting and the R-surfaces are on the rear edges of the C-surfaces. Thus, the stabilizers are guided smoothly into the cavity by the C-surfaces and the R-surfaces on the front ends of the stabilizers even if the stabilizers contact entrance edges of the cavity while inserting the terminal fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A lance hole may be formed in the one surface of the main portion for engaging a locking lance in the cavity. The stabilizers may be formed by bending cut pieces at substantially opposite lateral edges of the lance hole. Furthermore, reinforcing beads may be formed over the stabilizers. This construction can prevent the stabilizers from being inclined and deformed more than necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The stabilizer may have a narrower than the length of the lance hole in forward and backward directions and a short extending dimension of the stabilizer may be less than about half of the width thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention also relates a water- or fluidproof connector comprising a housing and at least one of the above-described terminal fittings mounted on an end of a wire together with a resilient plug. The terminal fitting is inserted into a cavity of the housing so that the resilient plug is fit into an entrance of the cavity to provide sealing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cavity preferably has a terminal accommodating hole for closely receiving the main portion of the terminal fitting. The main portion of the terminal fitting has a wide rectangular cross section. A sealing hole with a circular cross section is formed rearward of and communicates with the terminal accommodating hole. The sealing hole receives the resilient plug mounted on a rear end of the terminal fitting and preferably has the same diameter as the circumscribed circle of the main portion of the female terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At least one restriction preferably is formed at an edge of the terminal accommodating hole and preferably includes a ceiling wall of a tapered hole for preventing any further insertion of the terminal fitting by the contact with the stabilizers when the terminal fitting is inserted in an improper posture.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, it is possible to reliably fulfill an inverted insertion preventing function and ensure a waterproof function by preventing scratching on the inner peripheral surface of the entrance of the cavity.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A connector in accordance with the invention of this embodiment includes two female terminals <b>20</b> fixed to respective ends of wires <b>10</b> and a female housing <b>40</b> for accommodating the female terminals <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The female terminal <b>20</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref>, is formed by press-working a conductive metal plate with excellent electrical conductivity and includes a main portion <b>21</b> for receiving a tab of a mating male terminal (not shown). A wire connection portion is behind the main portion <b>21</b> and includes at least one wire barrel <b>22</b> and at least one insulation barrel <b>23</b> to be crimped, bent or folded and connected to the end of the wire <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The main portion <b>21</b> is a rectangular tube that is long in forward and backward directions and has a wide cross section. Four corners of the main portion <b>21</b> are rounded. A resilient contact piece <b>26</b> is provided in the main portion <b>21</b> and is formed by folding a tongue extending from the front edge of a bottom plate <b>25</b> to have a mountain or pointed shape. Two elongated projections <b>28</b> are formed on the inner surface of a ceiling plate <b>27</b> by hammering. The projections <b>28</b> are long in forward and backward directions and are spaced part in a width direction</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The tab of the mating male terminal is inserted into the main portion <b>21</b> through a front opening and is sandwiched resiliently between the resilient contact piece <b>26</b> and the elongated projections <b>28</b> and electrical connection is established between the female terminal <b>20</b> and the male terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The bottom plate <b>25</b> of the main portion <b>21</b> is formed with a lance hole <b>29</b> to be engaged with a locking lance <b>57</b> in a cavity <b>50</b> of the female housing <b>40</b>. Stabilizers <b>30</b> prevent the female terminal <b>20</b> from being inserted erroneously into the cavity <b>50</b> in a vertically inverted posture. The stabilizers <b>30</b> are described later.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The female terminal <b>20</b> is fixed to the end of the wire <b>10</b> together with the rubber plug <b>15</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The rubber plug <b>15</b> is long in forward and backward directions and has a plug body <b>16</b> and a mounting portion <b>17</b> on the front surface of the plug body <b>16</b>. The plug body <b>16</b> has a diameter somewhat larger than that of a circumscribing circle X (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the main portion <b>21</b> of the female terminal <b>20</b>. The rubber plug <b>15</b> also has a center hole for closely receiving the wire <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The wire barrel <b>22</b> is to be crimped, bent or folded and connected to an end of a core <b>11</b> exposed by stripping the wire <b>10</b>. The insulation barrel <b>23</b> is to be crimped, bent or folded and connected to an end of an insulation coating <b>12</b> and the mounting portion <b>17</b> of the rubber plug <b>15</b>. Thus, the female terminal <b>20</b> and the rubber plug <b>15</b> are mounted on the end of the wire <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the lance hole <b>29</b> is open in the bottom surface of the main portion <b>21</b> of the female terminal <b>20</b>. More specifically, the lance hole <b>29</b> has a wide rectangular shape with a width substantially equal to a distance between the inner surfaces of left and right side plates <b>24</b> of the main portion <b>21</b> at a position slightly behind a lengthwise central part of the bottom surface of the main portion <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Left and right stabilizers <b>30</b> are formed by bending cut pieces out from the left and right lateral edges of the lance hole <b>29</b>. The stabilizers <b>30</b> extend at positions at a specified distance D more than about 1.5 times the thickness of the side plate <b>24</b>, e.g. about twice the thickness of the side plate <b>24</b> including a bending margin from and inwardly of the opposite left and right lateral edges <b>25</b>E of the bottom surface <b>25</b> of the main portion <b>21</b> toward a widthwise center WC, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Thus, the base end of the stabilizer <b>30</b> is spaced in from the lateral edge <b>25</b>E by a distance D to form a step <b>25</b>ST and the stabilizer <b>30</b> extends outwardly from the main portion <b>21</b> adjacent to the step <b>25</b>ST. Furthermore, the stabilizer <b>30</b> extends obliquely with respect to the bottom surface <b>25</b> of the main portion <b>21</b> toward the widthwise center WC (defined an imaginary plane arranged in longitudinal direction of the main portion <b>21</b> and dividing the main portion <b>21</b> into two parts, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The stabilizers <b>30</b> have a width slightly shorter than the length of the lance hole <b>29</b> in forward and backward directions and a short extending dimension which is less than about half (e.g. about &#xbc;) of the width thereof. Front and/or rear corners of the extending ends of the stabilizers <b>30</b> are rounded or beveled.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">C-surfaces <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B are formed in substantially half thickness areas of the stabilizers <b>30</b> on outer corners of extending ends <b>30</b>E and extend over extending end surfaces <b>31</b> and front and rear end surfaces <b>32</b>F, <b>32</b>R of the stabilizers <b>30</b>. The C-surfaces <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B are substantially straight chamfers that are substantially straight along the forward and backward directions, see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and are chamfered or beveled when seen in a direction orthogonal thereto, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the stabilizers <b>30</b> assume oblique postures so that their extending ends gradually come closer to each other. The extending ends <b>30</b>E of both stabilizers <b>30</b> are located within the circumscribed (imaginary) circle X of the main portion <b>21</b>. In other words, the stabilizers <b>30</b> are formed to be inside the imaginary circle X circumscribed around the main portion <b>21</b> of the terminal fitting <b>20</b> and tangentially contacting the corner portions of the circle X, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">R-surfaces <b>37</b>A are formed on lateral edges <b>36</b> at base end sides of the C-surfaces <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B formed on the outer corners. The R-surfaces <b>37</b>A extend over the extending end surfaces <b>31</b> and the front and rear end surfaces <b>32</b>F, <b>32</b>R of the stabilizers <b>30</b>, i.e. on the C-surfaces <b>35</b>A. Further, R-surfaces <b>37</b>B are formed on the rear edges of the C-surfaces <b>35</b>B of the front end surfaces <b>32</b>F and on the front edges of the C-surfaces <b>35</b>B of the rear end surfaces <b>32</b>R. The R-surfaces <b>37</b>A, <b>37</b>B are curved chamfers.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, forming the C-surfaces <b>35</b>A on the corners of the outer lateral edges of the extending end surfaces <b>31</b> of the stabilizers <b>30</b> avoids interference of the corners with the circumscribed circle X (i.e. the stabilizers <b>30</b> are arranged inside the circle X) even if the stabilizers <b>30</b> have the extending dimension sufficient to ensure engaging margins.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Edges are still present on the opposite lateral edges of the C-surfaces <b>35</b>A. However, the stabilizers <b>30</b> incline obliquely in and lateral edges <b>38</b> on the tip sides of the C-surfaces <b>35</b>A are located inside the circumscribed circle X of the main portion <b>21</b> and the lateral edges <b>36</b> on the base end sides are located on the circumscribed circle X. The lateral edges <b>36</b> on the base end sides can be hammered. Thus, interference of the edges with the circumscribed circle X is avoided by forming the R-surfaces <b>37</b>A on the lateral edges <b>36</b> on the base end sides of the C-surfaces <b>35</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described above, the left and right stabilizers <b>30</b> are formed by bending the cut pieces at the left and right lateral edges of the lance hole <b>29</b>. Reinforcing beads <b>39</b> are formed over at least part of the stabilizers <b>30</b>. Lateral edges of the lance hole <b>29</b> and the side plates <b>24</b> of the main portion <b>21</b> project outward particularly by hammering.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The female housing <b>40</b> is made e.g. of synthetic resin and has a terminal accommodating portion <b>41</b> for receiving one or more female terminals <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 14</figref>. A front portion <b>42</b> of the terminal accommodating portion <b>41</b> is a separate piece integrally assembled with a rear end portion <b>43</b> via at least one lock mechanism <b>44</b>. A tubular portion <b>45</b> is provided around the terminal accommodating portion <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The female housing <b>40</b> is connected with an unillustrated mating male housing in which male terminals are mounted. Thus, a receptacle of the male housing is inserted between the terminal accommodating portion <b>41</b> and the tubular portion <b>45</b> of the female housing <b>40</b> to provide sealing between the female housing <b>40</b> and the male housing via a seal ring <b>47</b> mounted on the base end side of the terminal accommodating portion <b>41</b>. A lock arm <b>48</b> on the tubular portion <b>45</b> engages a lock of the male housing to lock the female housing <b>40</b> and the male housing in a connected state.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Two cavities <b>50</b> are formed side by side in the terminal accommodating portion <b>41</b> of the female housing <b>40</b> for receiving the above-described female terminals <b>20</b>. A terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> is formed in slightly more than the front half of each cavity <b>50</b> and has a wide rectangular cross section for closely receiving the main portion <b>21</b> of the female terminal <b>20</b>. A sealing hole <b>52</b> is formed at the rear of the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> and has a circular cross section for closely receiving the rubber plug <b>15</b> mounted on the rear side of the female terminal <b>20</b>. The sealing hole <b>52</b> has substantially the same diameter as the circumscribed circle X of the main portion <b>21</b> of the female terminal <b>20</b> described above. The rear end of the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> and the front end of the sealing hole <b>52</b> are connected by a tapered hole <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A terminal insertion opening <b>55</b> is formed in the front wall of the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> for receiving the tab of the male terminal. Further, a locking lance <b>57</b> is cantilevered forward from a bottom wall of the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b>. The main portion <b>21</b> of the female terminal <b>20</b> in a proper posture is inserted into the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> and resiliently deforms the locking lance <b>57</b>. The lance hole <b>29</b> in the bottom surface of the main portion <b>21</b> of the female terminal <b>20</b> reaches the position of a projection <b>58</b> of the locking lance <b>57</b>. Thus, the locking lance <b>57</b> restores resiliently so that the projection <b>58</b> fits into the lance hole <b>29</b> to lock and retain the female terminal <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the female terminal <b>20</b> is inserted to the proper position, the main portion <b>21</b> and the wire barrel <b>22</b> of the female terminal <b>20</b> are accommodated in the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b>, the insulation barrel <b>23</b> of the female terminal <b>20</b> and the mounting portion <b>17</b> of the rubber plug <b>15</b> are accommodated in the tapered hole <b>53</b> and the front end of the sealing hole <b>52</b> and a front part of the plug body <b>16</b> of the rubber plug <b>15</b> is accommodated in the rear of the sealing hole <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Substantially parallel insertion paths <b>60</b> are formed in the bottom wall of the cavity <b>50</b> and extend in forward and backward directions at opposite left and right sides of the locking lance <b>57</b>. The insertion paths <b>60</b> extend from the tapered hole <b>53</b> to the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> and can receive the left and right stabilizers <b>30</b> projecting from the bottom surface of the main portion <b>21</b> of the female terminal <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A restriction <b>63</b> is formed at an upper edge of the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> including the ceiling wall of the tapered hole <b>53</b> for contacting the stabilizers <b>30</b> when the female terminal <b>20</b> is inserted in an improper posture for preventing any further insertion of the female terminal <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The restriction <b>63</b> is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. Restricting surfaces <b>64</b> are formed at an upper edge of the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> at positions slightly behind a connecting part of the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> with the tapered hole <b>53</b> and are at an angle, preferably substantially perpendicular to an axial direction. Posture displacing portions <b>65</b> in the form of left and right rectangular bars are formed substantially parallel to each other to project back (toward the sealing hole <b>52</b>) from the restricting surfaces <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Taper surfaces <b>66</b> are formed at outer corners of the end surfaces of the respective posture displacing portions <b>65</b>. The respective taper surfaces <b>66</b> are formed at positions where the left and right stabilizers <b>30</b> contact the taper surfaces <b>66</b> when the female terminal <b>20</b> is in the vertically inverted posture. Guide grooves <b>67</b> for receiving the stabilizers <b>30</b> are formed at the outer sides of the respective posture displacing portions <b>65</b> to face substantially straight in a vertical direction, and the back ends of the respective guide grooves <b>67</b> reach the restricting surfaces <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The female terminal <b>20</b> is inserted into the corresponding cavity <b>50</b> of the female housing <b>40</b> with the stabilizers <b>30</b> located at the lower side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The stabilizers <b>30</b> also pass through the sealing hole <b>52</b>. There is a concern that extending ends of the stabilizers <b>30</b> may catch the lower hole edge of the sealing hole <b>52</b>, for example, due to upward inclination of the main portion <b>21</b>. However, the C-surfaces <b>35</b>B and the R-surfaces <b>37</b>B formed on the outer corner portions of the front end surfaces <b>32</b>F of the stabilizers <b>30</b> smoothly guide the stabilizers <b>30</b> into the sealing hole <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The main portion <b>21</b> of the female terminal <b>20</b> including the stabilizers <b>30</b> then is pushed while sliding substantially in contact with the inner peripheral surface of the sealing hole <b>52</b>. At that time, there is a concern that the lateral edges <b>36</b> on the base end sides of the C-surfaces <b>35</b>A formed on the extending end surfaces <b>31</b> of the stabilizers <b>30</b> will contact the inner peripheral surface of the sealing hole <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. However, the R-surfaces <b>37</b>A are formed on the lateral edges <b>36</b> will not scratch the inner peripheral surface of the sealing hole <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the female terminal <b>20</b> is pushed further, such as by pushing the rear end of the rubber plug <b>15</b>, the front end of the main portion <b>21</b> is inserted into the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> while being guided by the tapered hole <b>53</b>. Additionally, the main portion <b>21</b> is pushed into the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b> in the intermediate position or middle of insertion while the stabilizers <b>30</b> are inserted into the corresponding insertion paths <b>60</b>, as shown on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The main portion <b>21</b> is pushed to the proper position and contacts the front wall of the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Thus, the locking lance <b>57</b> resiliently returns and fits into the lance hole <b>29</b> to retain the female terminal <b>20</b> in the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b>. Simultaneously, the front part of the plug body <b>16</b> of the rubber plug <b>15</b> is fit closely into the rear end portion of the sealing hole <b>52</b> to seal the cavity <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">On the other hand, if the female terminal <b>20</b> is inserted in an improper posture, such as a vertically inverted posture where the stabilizers <b>30</b> are located at the upper side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the extending ends of the both stabilizers <b>30</b> contact taper surfaces <b>66</b> of the corresponding posture displacing portions <b>65</b>, as shown on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, at a timing at which the main portion <b>21</b> is guided by the tapered hole <b>53</b> and enters the terminal accommodating hole <b>51</b>. If the female terminal <b>20</b> is pushed farther, the stabilizers <b>30</b> are displaced to vertical postures by being guided by the taper surfaces <b>66</b>, as shown by chain line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, pass in the guide grooves <b>67</b> at the outer sides of the posture displacing portions <b>65</b> while being kept in the vertical postures and then come into contact with the restricting surfaces <b>64</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further pushing of the female terminal <b>20</b> is prevented in the above manner and insertion of the female terminal <b>20</b> in a wrong posture is detected. Large engaging margins with the restricting surfaces <b>64</b> are ensured by displacing the stabilizers <b>30</b> to the vertical postures, and inward inclination of the stabilizers <b>30</b> is prevented by the posture displacing portions <b>65</b> at the inner sides of the stabilizers <b>30</b>. Thus, the pushing of the female terminal <b>20</b> is prevented reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Since the rubber plug <b>15</b> is not fitted in the sealing hole <b>52</b> when the pushing is prevented in the above manner, the female terminal <b>20</b> can be pulled back easily, such as by holding the rubber plug <b>15</b> and pulling the wire <b>10</b> backward. Thereafter, the female terminal <b>20</b> may be corrected to the proper posture and inserted again into the cavity <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As described above, left and right stabilizers <b>30</b> are formed at the positions inwardly of the left and right edges of the bottom surface of the main portion <b>21</b> to assume such oblique postures that the extending ends are more inward than the base ends thereof so that distal ends of the stabilizers <b>30</b> gradually come closer to each other in forming or arranging the stabilizers <b>30</b> within the circumscribed circle X of the main portion <b>21</b>. Thus, to attain necessary engaging margins, an angle of inclination of the stabilizers <b>30</b> can be maximally suppressed and the stabilizers <b>30</b> can be short. Accordingly, the stabilizers <b>30</b> are difficult to incline and deform and reliably fulfill an inverted insertion preventing function.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, the C-surfaces <b>35</b>A on the corners of the outer lateral edges of the extending end surfaces <b>31</b> of the respective stabilizers <b>30</b> avoid interference of the extending ends of the stabilizers <b>30</b> with the inner peripheral surface of the sealing hole <b>52</b> at the entrance side of the cavity <b>50</b>. Here, edges are still present on the opposite lateral edges of the C-surfaces <b>35</b>A. However, the stabilizers <b>30</b> are inclined obliquely in so that the lateral edges <b>38</b> on the tip sides of the stabilizers <b>30</b> are located inside the circumscribed circle X of the main portion <b>21</b>. On the other hand, the lateral edges <b>36</b> on the base end sides are located on the circumscribed circle X. However, the lateral edges <b>36</b> on the base end sides can be hammered and the R-surfaces <b>37</b>A are formed on the lateral edges on the base end sides of the C-surfaces <b>35</b>A. Thus, the edges that could interfere with the inner peripheral surface of the sealing hole <b>52</b> are eliminated from the extending ends of the stabilizers <b>30</b> and the stabilizers <b>30</b> will not scratch the inner peripheral surface of the sealing hole <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Thus, it is possible to reliably fulfill the inverted insertion preventing function by the stabilizers <b>30</b> and ensure a waterproof function by preventing the stabilizers from scratching the inner peripheral surface of the sealing hole <b>52</b> of the cavity <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The C-surfaces <b>35</b>B are formed on the outer corners of the front end surfaces <b>32</b>F of the stabilizers <b>30</b> and the R-surfaces <b>37</b>B are formed on the rear edges of the C-surfaces <b>35</b>B. Even if the extending ends of the stabilizers <b>30</b> are caught by the lower edge of the sealing hole <b>52</b>, for example, due to upward inclination of the main portion <b>21</b> when the female terminal <b>20</b> is being inserted into the sealing hole <b>53</b> of the cavity <b>50</b>, the extending ends can be guided smoothly into the sealing hole <b>52</b> by the C-surfaces <b>35</b>B and the R-surfaces <b>37</b>B formed on the outer corners of the front end surfaces <b>32</b>F of the stabilizers <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The left and right stabilizers <b>30</b> are formed by bending the cut pieces at the opposite left and right edges of the lance hole <b>29</b>, and the reinforcing beads <b>39</b> are formed over the stabilizers <b>30</b>. The lateral edges of the lance hole <b>29</b> and the side plates <b>24</b> of the main portions <b>21</b> project out by hammering. This prevents the stabilizers <b>30</b> from being inclined and deformed inward more than necessary. For example, if the female terminal <b>20</b> is inserted in an inverted posture, the front end surfaces <b>32</b>F of the stabilizers <b>30</b> can be brought reliably into contact with the taper surfaces <b>66</b> of the posture displacing portions <b>65</b> to displace the stabilizers <b>30</b> to the vertical postures so that the inverted insertion preventing function can be reliably fulfilled.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The invention is not limited to the above described and illustrated embodiment. For example, the following embodiments are also included in the technical scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The stabilizer structure in the female terminal of the present invention is effective as a scratch preventing means for the sealing hole of the cavity of the female housing which has at minimum a diameter equivalent to the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the main portion of the female terminal, but the stabilizer structure of the invention also may be applied in the case of accommodating the female terminal into a cavity of a female housing including a sealing hole having a larger diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The posture displaying portions of the female housing for displaying the postures of the stabilizers when the female terminal is inserted in an inverted posture may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The left and right stabilizers may be displaced in forward and backward directions.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The invention also is applicable to male terminals.</p>
