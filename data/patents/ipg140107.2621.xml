<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of prior U.S. application Ser. No. 13/345,201, filed Jan. 6, 2012. The entire disclosure of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/345,201 is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to the field of semiconductor devices, and more particularly relates to silicon-on-insulator (SOI) transistors with self-aligned borderless source/drain contacts.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As semiconductor devices move to ever smaller dimensions, the space for source/drain contacts is reduced even more than the reduction in scale of the transistor. For example, in the 20 nm generation, the lithographic contact dimension is about 65 nm, and this must be reduced to about 20 nm in the etch. With such drastic reductions, the source/drain contact cannot be guarantee to land on the silicided area of the source/drain. The source/drain contact will frequently impinge on the area between the side of the gate stack and the edge of the silicided area of the source/drain. This critical area must be protected in order to prevent modification of the critical dopant concentration required for advanced junction designs. Further, if a portion of the source/drain contact lands on the gate, the transistor will be shorted. Such source/drain contacts that land on the gate must be prevented from shorting the device or punching through the silicon beneath the gate spacer.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for fabricating a transistor. According to the method, a replacement gate stack is formed on a semiconductor layer, a gate spacer is formed on sidewalls of the replacement gate stack, and a dielectric layer is formed on the semiconductor layer and abutting the gate spacer. After forming the gate spacer and the dielectric layer, the dummy gate stack is removed to form a cavity. A gate dielectric is formed in the cavity, and a work function metal layer is formed in the cavity. After forming the gate dielectric and the work function metal layer, a remaining portion of the cavity is filled with a gate conductor. One and only one of the gate conductor and the work function metal layer are selectively recessed to form a recess. An oxide film is formed in the recess such that its upper surface is co-planar with the upper surface of the dielectric layer. The oxide film is used to selectively grow an oxide cap directly on the upper surface of the gate dielectric, the upper surface of the oxide film, and a portion of the upper surface of the dielectric layer. An interlayer dielectric is formed, and the interlayer dielectric and the dielectric layer are etched to form at least one contact cavity for a source/drain contact. A source/drain contact is formed in the contact cavity, with a portion of the source/drain contact being located directly on the oxide cap.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating various embodiments of the present invention, are given by way of illustration only and various modifications may naturally be performed without deviating from the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Borderless source/drain contacts are now being used to prevent source/drain contacts that land on the gate from shorting the transistor. A borderless source/drain contact requires no border between the gate and the contact. The gate stack is encapsulated in dielectric so that the borderless source/drain contact can land on the gate without shorting the device. In gate-first transistor fabrication processes, the gate stack can just be encapsulated during gate formation. In particular, after depositing the gate layers, a dielectric layer is deposited over the structure. Then when the gate stack is etched to pattern the gate, this overlying dielectric layer is also etched at the same time to protect the top of the gate stack. Dielectric spacers are then formed on the sides of the gate stack to produce a gate stack that is encapsulated and thus protected from being shorted by source/drain contacts that land on the gate.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, in gate-last transistor fabrication processes, such an encapsulation method cannot be used to encapsulate the gate stack. A dummy gate is formed in gate-last transistor fabrication processes. This dummy gate is later removed to open a cavity from the top, and then the actual gate is formed in this cavity. Because the dummy gate and everything above it is removed when opening the cavity, the gate-first encapsulation method cannot be used to encapsulate the gate stack in gate-last transistor fabrication processes. One method for encapsulating the gate in gate-last transistor fabrication processes is to recess both the work function metal and the gate conductor, and then fill this recess with a dielectric material. However, this requires a precise deep etch of both the work function metal and the gate conductor. Such a precise deep etch of both materials is difficult to obtain and can significantly lower the gate conductance.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present invention provide a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) transistor with self-aligned borderless source/drain contacts. After formation of the gate stack, a shallow recess is made in one of the metal layers of the gate stack (e.g., the work function metal or the gate conductor). A dielectric film is formed in the recess and then used as a seed to selectively grow a dielectric cap over the gate stack. The dielectric cap protects the gate stack during the etching of the source/drain contacts. This borderless contact integration scheme can be used in gate-last fabrication processes that utilize a replacement metal gate structure and in gate-first fabrication processes that utilize a full metal gate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref> illustrate a process for forming an SOI transistor having self-aligned borderless source/drain contacts according to a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is provided an SOI wafer having a silicon substrate <b>102</b>, a buried insulator layer (BOX) <b>104</b>, and a semiconductor layer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The substrate <b>102</b> of this embodiment is a semiconductor substrate comprising a single crystalline semiconductor material such as single crystalline silicon, a polycrystalline semiconductor material, an amorphous semiconductor material, or a stack thereof. The thickness of the substrate <b>102</b> is from 50 microns to 1,000 microns, although lesser and greater thicknesses are employed in further embodiments. The BOX layer <b>104</b> includes a dielectric material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or a combination thereof. The thickness of the BOX layer <b>104</b> is from 50 nm to 500 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses are employed in further embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is any semiconducting material such as Si (silicon), strained Si, SiC (silicon carbide), SiGe (silicon germanium), SiGeC (silicon-germanium-carbon), Si alloys, Ge, Ge alloys, GaAs (gallium arsenide), InAs (indium arsenide), InP (indium phosphide), or any combination thereof. The thickness of the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is from 3 nm to 60 nm, and typically from 5 nm to 10 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses are employed in further embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The semiconductor layer <b>106</b> can be undoped or doped with either p-type or n-type dopants through ion implantation, plasma doping, or gas phase doping. P-type transistors are produced by doping the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> with elements from group III of the periodic table (e.g., boron, aluminum, gallium, or indium). As an example, the dopant can be boron in a concentration ranging from 1&#xd7;10E18 atoms/cm3 to 2&#xd7;10E21 atoms/cm3. N-type transistors are produced by doping the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> with elements from group V of the periodic table (e.g., phosphorus, antimony, or arsenic). In this example, the BOX layer <b>104</b> is composed of silicon oxide and the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is composed of silicon and doped with a first conductivity type dopant.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Next, an active area for the transistor is isolated by shallow trench isolation (STI). In this embodiment, shallow trench isolation (STI) structures <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> are formed by making trenches extending from the top surface of the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> to the BOX layer <b>104</b>, filling the trenches with a dielectric material, and removing excess dielectric material from above the top surface of the semiconductor layer <b>106</b>. This forms an STI region <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> above the BOX layer <b>104</b> that is continuous around the active area.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a replacement (or dummy) gate stack structure is formed to act as a place holder for the actual gate stack that is formed later. The replacement gate stack structure of this embodiment includes a replacement gate dielectric <b>414</b> and a replacement gate material <b>416</b> that are formed on the active area of the silicon layer <b>106</b>. The replacement gate dielectric <b>414</b> is a dielectric material that can function as an etch stop layer during subsequent removal of the replacement gate material <b>416</b>. In this embodiment, the replacement gate dielectric <b>414</b> is silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The replacement gate material <b>416</b> is a dielectric or conducting material that can be removed selectively with respect to the replacement gate dielectric <b>414</b> and a gate spacer <b>418</b>. In this embodiment, the replacement gate material <b>416</b> is a dielectric material (e.g., silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or a combination thereof). The thickness of the replacement gate stack structure <b>414</b> and <b>416</b> is from 10 nm to 500 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses are employed in further embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The gate spacer <b>418</b> is a dielectric material (such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or a combination of these) formed on the sidewalls of the replacement gate stack <b>414</b> and <b>416</b>. In this embodiment, the gate spacer <b>418</b> is formed by deposition of a conformal dielectric material layer and then etching to remove the dielectric material except from the sidewalls of the dummy gate stack <b>414</b> and <b>416</b>. The thickness of the gate spacer <b>418</b> at the base that contacts the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> is from 10 nm to 120 nm, and typically from 20 nm to 60 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses are employed in further embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated embodiment, source and drain extension regions <b>424</b> and <b>426</b> are formed by introducing dopants into exposed portions of the semiconductor layer <b>106</b>, employing the replacement gate stack structure <b>414</b> and <b>416</b> as a mask. The source and drain extension regions <b>424</b> and <b>426</b> have doping of a second conductivity type, which is the opposite of the first conductivity type. In this embodiment, source and drain regions <b>420</b> and <b>422</b> are formed by deep implanting dopants into exposed portions of the semiconductor layer <b>106</b>, employing the combination of the replacement gate stack structure <b>414</b> and <b>416</b> and the gate spacer <b>418</b> as a mask. The source and drain regions <b>420</b> and <b>422</b> have the same type of doping as the source and drain extension regions <b>424</b> and <b>426</b>. A thermal anneal can be performed to activate and diffuse the implanted ions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this embodiment, for an NFET, the source/drain regions <b>420</b> and <b>422</b> are heavily doped with an n-type dopant and the source/drain extension regions <b>424</b> and <b>426</b> are lightly doped with the same or a different n-type dopant. Conversely, for a PFET, the source/drain regions <b>420</b> and <b>422</b> are heavily doped with a p-type dopant and the source/drain extension regions <b>424</b> and <b>426</b> are lightly doped with the same or a different p-type dopant. Silicided areas for contacts are then formed on the source and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">After the source/drain regions <b>420</b> and <b>422</b> have been formed, a dielectric layer <b>528</b> is formed over the entire structure. In this embodiment, the dielectric layer <b>528</b> is a dielectric material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or a combination thereof that is formed through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). This dielectric layer <b>528</b> is etched down to the level of the top surface of the replacement gate stack <b>414</b> and <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the replacement gate stack <b>414</b> and <b>416</b> is then selectively removed with respect to the gate spacer <b>418</b> (e.g., via selective etching). This forms a gate cavity <b>630</b> that is laterally surrounded by the gate spacer <b>418</b>. The inner sidewalls of the gate spacer <b>418</b> and a portion of the top surface of the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> are exposed by formation of the gate cavity <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Optionally, an interfacial layer is formed on the exposed surface of the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> by conversion of a surface portion of the semiconductor material into a dielectric material. For example, the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> can be single crystalline silicon, and the interfacial layer can be silicon oxide which is formed by thermal oxidation, chemical oxidation, or plasma oxidation of the surface portion. The thickness of the interfacial layer is from 0.1 nm to 1.5 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses are employed in further embodiments. The thickness, however, may be different after processing at higher temperatures, which are usually required during device fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A high-k dielectric layer is then blanket deposited to form a high-k gate dielectric layer <b>836</b> on the bottom and vertical sidewalls of the gate cavity, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The high-k dielectric layer <b>836</b> is a dielectric metal oxide having a dielectric constant greater than 8.0. The dielectric metal oxide is deposited by a process such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), molecular beam deposition (MBD), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), liquid source misted chemical deposition (LSMCD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), etc. In this embodiment, the high-k gate dielectric layer <b>836</b> comprises HfO<sub>2 </sub>or ZrO<sub>2</sub>. However, other materials such as La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, LaAlO<sub>3</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, HfO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, ZrO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, SrTiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, LaAlO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, Y2O<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, a silicate thereof, and an alloy thereof are applicable as well (each value of x is independently from 0.5 to 3 and each value of y is independently from 0 to 2). The thickness of the high-k gate dielectric layer <b>836</b> is from 0.5 nm to 6 nm, and typically from 1.0 nm to 3 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses are employed in further embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After the high-k gate dielectric <b>836</b> has been formed, a work function metal layer <b>850</b> is deposited on the gate dielectric layer <b>836</b>. This work function metal layer <b>850</b> is formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), liquid source misted chemical deposition (LSMCD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), or a combination thereof. The work function metal layer <b>850</b> optimizes the performance of the transistor by tuning the work function of the gate electrode. In this embodiment, this work function metal layer <b>850</b> is a p-type work function material, such as TiN. Other metallic materials such as Pt, Rh, Ir, Ru, Cu, Os, Be, Co, Pd, Te, Cr, Ni, Hf, Ti, Zr, Cd, La, Tl, Yb, Al, Ce, Eu, Li, Pb, Tb, Bi, In, Lu, Nb, Sm, V, Zr, Ga, Mg, Gd, Y, TiAl, alloys thereof, conductive oxides thereof, conductive nitrides thereof, and any combinations of the foregoing can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Next, a gate conductor material <b>56</b> is deposited in the gate cavity. The gate conductor material <b>852</b> comprises a conductive material, which can be a doped semiconductor material, a metallic material, or a combination thereof. The doped semiconductor material can be doped polysilicon, doped polycrystalline germanium, a doped silicon-germanium alloy, any other doped elemental, a compound semiconductor material, or a combination thereof. The metallic material can be any metallic material that can be deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), or a combination thereof, such as aluminum, tungsten, ruthenium, or a conductive refractory metal nitride, such as TaN (tantalum nitride), TiN (titanium nitride), WN (tungsten nitride), TiAl (titanium aluminum), TiAlN (titanium aluminum nitride), TaCN (triazacyclononane), or an alloy thereof. In the illustrated embodiment, the gate conductor material <b>852</b> can be aluminum, tungsten, ruthenium, or any conductive metal or metal alloy (such as aluminum-cobalt). The thickness of the gate conductor material <b>852</b> is selected to completely fill the gate cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The portions of the high-k gate dielectric layer, work function metal layer, and gate conductor material above the top surface of the dielectric layer <b>528</b> are removed by planarization, which can be performed by chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), recess etch, or a combination thereof. The remaining portion of the high-k gate dielectric layer constitutes a U-shaped gate dielectric <b>836</b>, the remaining portion of the work function metal layer constitutes a U-shaped work function metal layer <b>850</b>, and the remaining portion of the gate conductive material layer <b>56</b> constitutes a gate conductor <b>852</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The top surface of the U-shaped gate dielectric <b>836</b>, the top surface of the U-shaped work function metal layer <b>850</b>, and the top surface of the gate conductor <b>852</b> are coplanar with the top surface of the dielectric layer <b>528</b> after planarization, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The U-shaped gate dielectric <b>836</b>, the U-shaped work function metal layer <b>850</b>, and the gate conductor <b>852</b> collectively constitute the gate stack of the transistor. The gate spacer <b>418</b> laterally surrounds the gate stack and has a top surface that is coplanar with the top surface of the dielectric layer <b>528</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">After completing the gate stack, the gate conductor <b>852</b> is selectively recessed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this embodiment, this selective recess is preformed through a dry etch (for example, using Cl<sub>2</sub>-based, BCl<sub>3</sub>-based, or CH<sub>3</sub>F-based chemistry). The depth of this recess does not have to be well controlled and the recess can be very shallow (e.g., 2-8 nm). The recess just has to be deep enough that at least part of the subsequently deposited layer survives the planarization step following its formation. While a deeper recess can also be used, it should not be so deep as to affect the gate conductance. A shallow recess performs the necessary function while maintaining a high gate conductance. Further, the recesses do not have to be uniform in the gates of all transistors of an integrated circuit. In the illustrated embodiment, the recess has an exemplary depth of 5-10 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, a silicon dioxide film <b>846</b> is formed in the recess that was made in the gate conductor <b>852</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this embodiment, a damascene process is used to inlay the silicon dioxide film <b>846</b> in the recess. More specifically, silicon dioxide is deposited over the entire device so as to overfill the recess, and then CMP is performed to remove the silicon dioxide down to the level of the top of the dielectric layer <b>528</b>. The silicon dioxide film <b>846</b> that is within the recess is not removed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A silicon dioxide cap <b>848</b> is then selectively grown on top of the damascened silicon dioxide film <b>846</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The silicon dioxide cap <b>848</b> is wider than the gate stack, and preferably its width extends beyond the outer edges of the gate spacer <b>418</b> (i.e., the lateral extent of the cap is greater than the lateral extent of the gate spacer). Thus, the combination of the silicon dioxide cap and the gate spacer encapsulates the gate stack. In this embodiment, the silicon dioxide cap <b>848</b> is grown by molecular layer dielectric chemical vapor deposition (MLD CVD). Thus, the silicon oxide film <b>846</b> in the recess in the gate conductor <b>852</b> acts as a seed to grow the silicon dioxide cap <b>848</b> above the gate stack. The silicon dioxide cap <b>848</b> is self-aligned, with no patterning or other processing required. Further, the silicon dioxide cap <b>848</b> grows only above the gate stack where it is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, an interlayer dielectric <b>910</b> is deposited over the structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In this embodiment, the interlayer dielectric <b>910</b> is a nitride layer. A photolithography mask for the source/drain contacts is then deposited and patterned. An etch is then performed to form cavities for the source/drain contacts. This etch forms contact cavities through the interlayer dielectric <b>910</b> and dielectric layer <b>528</b>, stopping on the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> (at least partially on the silicided area of the source/drain region). In this embodiment, a reactive ion etch (RIE) is used to form the contact cavities.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Due to the selectivity between silicon dioxide and nitride, the silicon dioxide cap <b>848</b> is not removed during etching of the nitride interlayer dielectric <b>910</b>. The silicon dioxide cap <b>848</b> on top of the gate stack serves as an etch stop layer during the etching for the contacts, guiding the source/drain contact away from the gate stack. Thus, the source/drain contact is borderless with respect to the gate stack. The contact cavities are then filled with a conducting material to form the source/drain contacts <b>920</b>. In this embodiment, the source/drain contacts are formed by a metal such as copper, tungsten, aluminum, ruthenium, or TiN. Conventional fabrication steps are then performed to form the remainder of the integrated circuit that includes this transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 12</figref> illustrate a process for forming an SOI transistor having self-aligned borderless source/drain contacts according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the work function metal layer is selectively recessed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The gate stack is first formed in the manner described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. After completing the gate stack, the work function metal layer <b>850</b> is selectively recessed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this embodiment, this selective recess is preformed through a dry etch (for example, using Cl<sub>2</sub>-based, BCl<sub>3</sub>-based, or CH<sub>2</sub>F-based chemistry). The depth of this recess does not have to be well controlled and the recess can be very shallow (e.g., 2-4 nm). In the illustrated embodiment, the recess has an exemplary depth of 5-10 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, a silicon dioxide film <b>930</b> is formed in the recess that was made in the work function metal layer <b>850</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this embodiment, a damascene process is used to inlay the silicon dioxide film <b>930</b> in the recess. A silicon dioxide cap <b>940</b> is then selectively grown on top of the damascened silicon dioxide film <b>930</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The silicon dioxide cap <b>940</b> is grown so as to cover the entire gate stack and be wider than the gate stack, preferably extending beyond the outer edges of the gate spacer <b>418</b>. This growth is seeded at the edges of the gate and the growing cap joins in the center of the gate stack, as shown in the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In this embodiment, the silicon dioxide cap <b>940</b> is grown by MLD CVD Thus, the silicon oxide film <b>930</b> in the recess in the work function metal layer <b>850</b> acts as a seed to grow the silicon dioxide cap <b>940</b> above the gate stack. The silicon dioxide cap is self-aligned and grows only where it is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, an interlayer dielectric <b>910</b> is deposited over the structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In this embodiment, the interlayer dielectric <b>910</b> is a nitride layer. A photolithography mask for the source/drain contacts is then deposited and patterned. An etch is then performed to form cavities for the source/drain contacts. This etch forms contact cavities through the interlayer dielectric <b>910</b> and dielectric layer <b>528</b>, stopping on the semiconductor layer <b>106</b> (at least partially on the silicided area of the source/drain region). In this embodiment, a reactive ion etch (RIE) is used to form the contact cavities.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The silicon dioxide cap <b>940</b> on top of the gate stack serves as an etch stop layer during the etching for the contacts, guiding the source/drain contact away from the gate stack. Thus, the source/drain contact is borderless with respect to the gate stack. The contact cavities are then filled with a conducting material to form the source/drain contacts <b>920</b>. In this embodiment, the source/drain contacts are formed by a metal, such as W, Cu, Al, or TiN. Conventional fabrication steps are then performed to form the remainder of the integrated circuit that includes this transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention is also applicable to gate-first fabrication with a full metal gate. In one embodiment, the final metal gate is capped with a nitride layer. By judiciously choosing materials, this nitride film can be selectively recessed with respect to the surrounding nitride interlayer dielectric. For example, the nitride cap material can be hydrogenated nitride film that has high wet etch rates, while the nitride interlayer dielectric can be IRAD nitride or PECVD nitride with a very low wet etch rate. The recess then can be formed through a wet etch in dilute HF. After the recess is formed, processing continues in the manner described above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, the present invention provides an SOI transistor with self-aligned borderless source/drain contacts. After formation of the gate stack, a shallow recess is made in one of the metal layers of the gate stack (e.g., the work function metal or the gate conductor). The recess is formed in less than all of the top-exposed layers of the gate stack, and preferably is formed in only one of the top-exposed layers of the gate stack. A dielectric film is formed in the recess and then used as a seed to selectively grow a dielectric cap over the gate stack. The dielectric cap protects the gate stack during the etching of the source/drain contacts. This borderless contact integration scheme can be used in gate-last fabrication processes that utilize a replacement metal gate structure and in gate-first fabrication processes that utilize a full metal gate.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The circuit as described above is part of the design for an integrated circuit chip. The chip design is created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network). If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer transmits the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer. The photolithographic masks are utilized to define areas of the wafer (and/or the layers thereon) to be etched or otherwise processed.</p>
