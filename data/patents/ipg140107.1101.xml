<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The embodiments described herein relate generally to a single blank for forming a reinforced container and, more particularly, to a single blank for forming a reinforced container having corner posts.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">At least some known containers that are used to transport and/or store products may be stacked one on the other when the products are being transported or stored. This layering of containers may sometime cause the containers on the lower layers may be deformed by compression forces applied thereto by the upper layers of containers. When a container deforms or crushes, products within the container may then be required to support the weight of the upper layers. As such, the products within the containers may be damaged during transport and/or storage. At least the containers on the lower layers can be reinforced to facilitate supporting the weight of the upper layers without the products in the lower layers of containers being damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">At least one known reinforced container is formed from multiple blanks of sheet material. More specifically, an un-reinforced container is formed from one blank, and additional end inserts are formed from the other blanks. The end inserts are then positioned within the un-reinforced container to reinforce at least the end panels of the un-reinforced container. Such reinforced containers are more costly than un-reinforced containers because of the additional blanks needed to form the inserts. Further, the multiple blanks require additional time to form the reinforced container. Moreover, keeping track of the different blanks can cause additional problems when trying to assemble a reinforced container and all of the needed blanks cannot be located. Accordingly, there is a need for a simpler blank for forming a reinforced container.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, a blank of sheet material for forming a container is provided. The blank includes a first reinforcing end panel extending from a first end panel, a first corner post panel extending from a first edge of the first reinforcing end panel, and a first top end panel defined within the first reinforcing end panel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another aspect, a container formed from a blank of sheet material is provided. The container includes a first end wall formed from a first end panel and an interconnected first reinforcing end panel positioned in face-to-face relationship with the first end panel, a first top end panel extending from the first end panel, and a bottom wall oriented substantially perpendicularly to the first end wall. The bottom wall includes a plurality of bottom panels interlocked together using a bottom locking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet another aspect, a method for forming a container from a blank of sheet material is provided. The method includes rotating a plurality of panels about a plurality of fold lines to form at least a portion of a first side wall, an opposing second side wall, a first end wall, and an opposing second end wall. At least one end reinforcing panel is rotated with respect to the first end wall and/or the second end wall and a top end panel extending from the first end wall and/or the second wall to form a portion of the first end wall and/or the second end wall. The method further includes rotating at least one corner post panel with respect to the at least one reinforcing end panel to form at least one corner post within the container.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In still another aspect, a locking mechanism for use with a container formed from a blank of sheet material is provided. The blank includes a first top panel, a second top panel, a third top panel, and a fourth top panel. The locking mechanism includes at least one locking cutout defined in the first top panel, at least one locking flap defined by the second top panel, a minor cutout defined through the second top panel adjacent the at least one locking flap, and at least one locking tab defined by at least one of the third top panel and the fourth top panel. The at least one locking tab is configured to be inserted through the at least one locking cutout and the minor cutout and secured in position by the at least one locking flap.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The following detailed description illustrates the disclosure by way of example and not by way of limitation. The description clearly enables one skilled in the art to make and use the disclosure, describes several embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternative, and use of the disclosure, including what is presently believed to be the best mode of carrying out the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention provides a container that includes integral corner posts, and a method for constructing the container. The container is constructed from a blank of sheet material using a machine and/or by hand. For example, the blank can be wrapped about a mandrel to form a knocked-down flat container, and the final construction of the container can be performed by hand and/or by another machine. Alternatively, a folder/glue machine can be used to convey the blank through folder arms and adhesive applicator to form the knocked-down flat container. In one embodiment, the container is fabricated from a paperboard material. The container, however, may be fabricated using any suitable material, and therefore is not limited to a specific type of material. In alternative embodiments, the container is fabricated using cardboard, plastic, fiberboard, paperboard, foamboard, corrugated paper, and/or any suitable material known to those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provided.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the example embodiment, the container includes integrated corner posts. As such, the container can be formed from a single blank of sheet material. Accordingly, the containers described herein do not require separate inserts to form the corner posts. Further, the embodiments described herein include reinforced end walls that enable the container to be stacked. More specifically, the reinforced end walls and corner posts enable the containers described herein to be stronger than similar containers without reinforced end walls and/or corner posts, especially when subjected to vertical compression.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an example embodiment, the container and/or a blank includes at least one marking thereon including, without limitation, indicia that communicates the product, a manufacturer of the product and/or a seller of the product. For example, the marking may include printed text that indicates a product's name and briefly describes the product, logos and/or trademarks that indicate a manufacturer and/or seller of the product, and/or designs and/or ornamentation that attract attention. In another embodiment, the container is void of markings, such as, without limitation, indicia that communicates the product, a manufacturer of the product and/or a seller of the product. Furthermore, the container may have any suitable size, shape and/or configuration, i.e., any suitable number of sides having any suitable size, shape and/or configuration as described and/or illustrated herein. In one embodiment, the container includes a shape that provides functionality, such as a shape that facilitates packaging a food item, a shape that facilitates transporting the container, and/or a shape that facilitates stacking and/or arrangement of a plurality of containers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, different embodiments described here can vary in size and/or dimensions although similar labels are used for each embodiment. For example, although a depth is labeled similarly throughout the description, each embodiment can have varying depths.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to the drawings, and more specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, although as described above a container may have any suitable size, shape, and/or configuration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> illustrate the construction or formation of one embodiment of a container.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The above-described embodiments provide reinforced containers for shipping and/or storing products in a stacked configuration. More specifically, because the end walls are reinforced and the containers described herein include corner posts, the above-described containers can be stacked without the containers substantially deforming from compression forces applied by upper containers. Further, the embodiments described herein provide a single blank of sheet material for forming a reinforced container. As such, no additionally inserts are needed to provide the reinforcement to the container. Rather, the corner posts are integrally formed with a reinforcing end panel. Additionally, the above-described alignment panel facilitates automated construction of containers from the blanks by enabling a machine to properly align the blanks. Moreover, the embodiments including the alignment panel can be used with known taping machines because the top side panels do not overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Exemplary embodiments of blanks and methods for forming reinforced containers are described above in detail. The apparatus and methods are not limited to the specific embodiments described herein, but rather, components of apparatus and/or steps of the methods may be utilized independently and separately from other components and/or steps described herein. For example, the methods may also be used in combination with other reinforced containers and methods, and are not limited to practice with only the reinforced containers and methods as described herein. Rather, the exemplary embodiment can be implemented and utilized in connection with many other container applications.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Although specific features of various embodiments of the invention may be shown in some drawings and not in others, this is for convenience only. In accordance with the principles of the invention, any feature of a drawing may be referenced and/or claimed in combination with any feature of any other drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">This written description uses examples to disclose the invention, including the best mode, and also to enable any person skilled in the art to practice the invention, including making and using any devices or systems and performing any incorporated methods. The patentable scope of the invention is defined by the claims, and may include other examples that occur to those skilled in the art.
