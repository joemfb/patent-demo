<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a structural scheme view of a first preferred embodiment of a chip-on-film panel structure in accordance with the present invention, and the chip-on-film panel structure comprises a panel body <b>200</b> a plurality of fan-out leads <b>210</b> mounted on the panel body <b>200</b>, a plurality of first metal sheets <b>220</b> mounted on the panel body <b>200</b> and used to be connected to the fan-out leads <b>210</b>, a plurality of array leads <b>230</b> mounted on the panel body <b>200</b> and a plurality of second metal sheets <b>240</b> mounted on the panel body <b>200</b> and used to be connected to the array leads <b>230</b>. The array leads <b>230</b> are positioned at two sides of the fan-out leads <b>210</b>, and the second metal sheets <b>240</b> are disposed at two sides of the first metal sheets <b>220</b>, wherein the length of each of the second metal sheets <b>240</b> is less than the length of each of the first metal sheets <b>220</b> to form a lead-out area <b>250</b> such that the array leads <b>230</b> are led out from the second metal sheets <b>240</b> via the lead-out area <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first metal sheets <b>220</b> and the second metal sheets <b>240</b> are mounted parallel to each other. Each of the metal sheets has a first end and a second end. The first ends of the first metal sheets <b>220</b> are connected to the fan-out leads <b>210</b>. The first ends of the second metal sheets <b>240</b> are aligned with the first ends of the first metal sheets <b>220</b>. The lead-out area <b>250</b> is disposed at a position beside the second ends of the second metal sheets <b>240</b>, and the array leads <b>230</b> are led out from the second ends of the second metal sheets <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Because the fan-out leads <b>210</b> are to be led out from the first ends of the first metal sheets <b>220</b>, if the array leads <b>230</b> are led out from the first ends of the second metal sheets <b>240</b>, some available room for the fan-out leads <b>210</b> will be occupied and the length of the area of the fan-out leads <b>210</b> will be increased. The chip-on-film panel structure having the lead-out area <b>250</b> can enormously reduce the affection to the available room for the fan-out leads <b>210</b> that the leading-out of the array leads <b>230</b> may cause. Meanwhile, in this embodiment, the array leads <b>230</b> are led out from the second ends of the second metal sheets <b>240</b>, the led-out direction thereof is opposite to the led-out direction of the fan-out leads <b>210</b>, which sufficiently uses spare room of the panel body <b>200</b> to reduce the affection of the array leads <b>230</b> causing on the available room for the fan-out leads <b>210</b> by the greatest extent.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the first preferred embodiment of the chip-on-film panel structure of the present invention, the length of each of the second metal sheets <b>240</b> is &#x2153; up to &#x2154; of the length of each of the first metal sheets <b>220</b>, and the length of the second metal sheet <b>240</b> is ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The decrement of the lengths of the second metal sheets <b>240</b> determines the size of the lead-out area <b>250</b>. If the lengths of the second metal sheets <b>240</b> are excessive, the size of the lead-out area <b>250</b> will be too small and not sufficient for all the array leads <b>230</b> to be led out. If the lengths of the second metal sheets <b>240</b> are inadequate, the panel body <b>200</b> may have too much room that affects the appearance of the panel (each of the metal sheets requires sufficient pressing area and electric conductive particles while executing the chip-on-film bonding process; as the length of the metal sheet is reduced, the width of the metal sheet must be increased correspondingly to ensure the size of the area of the metal sheet (pressing area)). The length of each of the second metal sheets <b>240</b> being &#x2153; up to &#x2154; of the length of each of the first metal sheets <b>220</b> (approximately 0.4 to 0.6 mm) ensures the size of the lead-out area <b>250</b> and the appearance of the panel body <b>200</b>.</p>

No matter which ends of the second metal sheets <b>440</b> the array leads <b>430</b> are led from, the design of the lead-out area <b>450</b> will reduce the affection that leading out the array leads <b>430</b> may cause on the available room for the fan-out leads <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As the second preferred embodiment of the chip-on-film panel structure of the present invention, the length of each of the second metal sheets <b>440</b> is &#x2153; up to &#x2154; of the length of each of the first metal sheets <b>420</b>, and the length of the second metal sheet <b>440</b> is ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The decrement of the lengths of the second metal sheets <b>440</b> determines the size of the lead-out area <b>450</b>. If the lengths of the second metal sheets <b>440</b> are excessive, the size of the lead-out area <b>450</b> will be too small and not sufficient for all the array leads <b>430</b> to be led out. If the lengths of the second metal sheets <b>440</b> are inadequate, the panel body <b>400</b> may have too much room left that affects the appearance of the panel (each of the metal sheets requires sufficient pressing area and electric conductive particles while executing the chip-on-film bonding process; as the length of the metal sheet is decreased, the width of the metal sheet must be increased correspondingly to ensure the size of the area of the metal sheet (pressing area)). The length of each of the second metal sheets <b>440</b> being &#x2153; up to &#x2154; of the length of each of the first metal sheets <b>420</b> (approximately 0.4 to 0.6 mm) ensures the size of the lead-out area <b>450</b> and the appearance of the panel body <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As the preferred embodiment of the chip-on-film panel structure of the present invention, the width of each of the second metal sheets is greater than the width of each of the first metal sheets, and the area of each of the second metal sheets is determined by the area of each of the first metal sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The chip-on-film panel structure of the present invention increases the width of each of the second metal sheets while forming the lead-out area by reducing the lengths of the second metal sheets, and thereby ensures that each second metal sheet has sufficient area and electric conductive particles for bonding operation. When the area of each of the second metal sheets is substantially equal to the area of each of the first metal sheets, it will achieve the same bonding effect as conventional second metal sheets may achieve in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">By means of the arrangement of the lead-out area, the chip-on-film panel structure of the present invention does not need to reserve in advance or reduce the room for arranging the array leads, such that the length of the fan-out area can be shortened and the frame of the panel can be further narrowed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In conclusion, although a few embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed, the above preferred embodiments are not used for limiting this invention, and it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The invention is intended to be limited only by the appended claims.</p>
