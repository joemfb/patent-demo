<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a curable resin composition, and a molded article, a prepreg and a laminate using the same, and more specifically, relates to a sheet shaped molded article and prepreg which provide a laminate having significantly low dielectric loss at high frequency bands and production methods thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, Owing to the emergence of the advanced information age, information transmission has been in trends of high speed and high frequency, and microwave communication and millimeter-wave communication have been in reality. For circuit boards in such high frequency age, materials with low dielectric tangents are required in order for transmission losses at high frequency to be minimally reduced, and cycloolefin polymer attracts attention as such material.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a technique for obtaining a multilayer board through: applying polymerizable composition which contains norbornene based monomer, metathesis ring-opening polymerization catalyst and peroxide such as di-t-butylperoxide onto a rough surface of an electrolytic copper foil; covering the surface with a glass-fiber reinforced PTFE resin film; making the copper foil side adhere to an aluminum plate heated to 145&#xb0; C. for one minute and polymerizing the above composition; thereafter peeling away the glass-fiber reinforced PTFE resin film thereby obtaining a copper foil with resin; then clipping a both-sided copper-clad laminate board of CZ-treated glass epoxy with the copper foils with resin such that the resin sides are located inside thereof; and heat pressing them during 15 minutes at 200&#xb0; C. under the press pressure of 5.2 MPa.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, Patent Document 2 discloses that a laminated board was obtained through: coating mixture liquid obtained by mixing 2-norbornene, metathesis polymerization catalyst, 1,3-di(2-t-butylperoxyisopropyl) benzene (one-minute half-life temperature being 175&#xb0; C.), etc. onto a supporting film of continuous polyethylene naphthalate film, heating them in a heating furnace at 150&#xb0; C. during 30 seconds thereby polymerizing, rewinding the obtained film on the support film by using a film rewinding section with the support film; thereafter clipping a both-sided copper-clad laminate board of CZ-treated glass epoxy with the above film; and heat pressing them during 15 minutes at 200&#xb0; C. under the press pressure of 5.2 MPa.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 3 discloses that a laminated board was obtained through: impregnating polymerizable composition which contains norbornene based monomer, metathesis ring-opening polymerization catalyst and peroxide such as di-t-butylperoxide into glass cloths and then polymerizing thereby produsing prepregs; next laminating three layers of obtained prepregs and clipping them from both sides with copper foils; and heat pressing them thereby hardening. However, it is desired to further reduce dielectric tangents at high frequency bands in such laminates disclosed in these documents.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the present invention is to provide a molded article and a prepreg which provide a laminate superior in laminatability and low in dielectric loss at high frequency bands and production method thereof, and a laminate configured by using the molded article and the prepreg.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a result of intensive studies to solve the above problems, the present inventors have found out that a molded article and a prepreg obtained by using a curable resin composition containing cycloolefin polymer and cyclic peroxide which has a cyclic structure and a peroxy structure [R&#x2014;O&#x2014;O&#x2014;R&#x2032; (in formula, each of R and R&#x2032; being hydrocarbon group)] in the cyclic structure provide sufficiently small dielectric tangent at high frequency bands and are superior in laminatability with other material such as circuit board. In addition, the present inventors have also found out that the laminatability and the decreasing of the dielectric loss are significantly highly balanced in the obtained laminate by using cyclic peroxide having one-minute half-life temperature within a certain range. Based on such findings, the present inventors completed the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, according to the present invention, there are provided the following [1] to [9].</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">[1] A curable resin composition comprising a cycloolefin polymer and a cyclic peroxide which has a cyclic structure and a peroxy structure in the cyclic structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the present invention, it is easy to provide a molded article and a prepreg which provide a laminate superior in laminatability and low in dielectric loss at high frequency bands. Moreover, because the laminate of the present invention shows low dielectric loss at high frequency bands, it may be preferably used for a high frequency circuit board for usage of telecommunication equipment or the like at high frequencies of microwave and millimeter-wave etc.</p>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The curable resin composition of the present invention is configured to contain cycloolefin polymer and cyclic peroxide which has a cyclic structure and a peroxy structure in the cyclic structure.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(Cycloolefin Polymer)</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Cycloolefin polymer used in the present invention is a polymer containing at least cycloolefin monomer unit and usually is a thermoplastic resin obtained by polymerizing cycloolefin monomer. As the polymer, a polymer of cycloolefin monomer known in the art is available without specific limitation. In the case that cycloolefin polymer has a cyclic structure in cycloolefin monomer unit, as such cyclic structure, saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) structure, and unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkene) structure etc. may be mentioned. Although the number of carbon atoms forming the cyclic structure is not particularly limited, it is usually in a range of 4 to 30, preferably 5 to 20, and more preferably 5 to 15. While the ratio of cycloolefin monomer units in the cycloolefin polymer may be suitably selected, it is preferably 50 wt % or more, more preferably 70 wt % or more, and furthermore preferably 90 wt % or more. It is preferred that the ratio of cycloolefin monomer units is within such ranges because the mechanical strength of the laminate to be obtained will be improved. Specifically as cycloolefin polymer, ring-opening polymer of cycloolefin monomer, addition polymer of cycloolefin monomer, addition copolymer of cycloolefin monomer and linear olefin monomer, and hydrogenation product thereof may be mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The cycloolefin monomer is a compound having a cyclic structure formed with carbon atoms and carbon-carbon double bond in the cyclic structure. As examples thereof, norbornene based monomer, and monocyclic cycloolefin monomer etc. may be mentioned, and normornene based monomer is preferable. The norbornene based monomer is a monomer including norbornene ring. While not particularly limited as the norbornene monomer, for example, 2-norbornene, norbornadiene and other bicyclic compounds; dicyclopentadiene, dihydrodicyclopentadiene and other tricyclic compounds; tetracyclododecene, ethylidenetetracyclododecene, phenyltetracyclododecene and other tetracyclic compounds; tricyclopentadiene and other pentacyclic compounds; tetracyclopentadiene and other heptacyclic compounds; alkyl substitution compounds (methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl substitution compounds etc.), alkylidene substitution compounds (for example, ethylidene substitution compound) and aryl substitution compounds (for example, phenyl and tolyl substitution compounds) thereof; and derivatives thereof having epoxy group, methacryl group, hydroxyl group, amino group, carboxyl group, cyano group, halogen atom, ether bond (&#x2014;O&#x2014;) containing group, ester bond [&#x2014;C(&#x2550;O) O&#x2014;] containing group and other polar groups; etc. may be mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As the monocyclic cycloolefin monomer, for example, cyclobutene, cyclopentene, cyclooctene, cyclododecene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene and other monocyclic cycloolefins, and substitution compounds and derivatives having polar groups like those mentioned as examples for the norbornene based monomer may be mentioned. Such cycloolefin monomers may be used alone or in combinations of two or more types.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">While the above linear olefin monomer is not particularly limited insofar as being addition-copolymerizable with the above cycloolefin monomer, for example, ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-butene, 2-pentene, and 1,4-hexadiene etc. may be mentioned. Amount of the linear olefin monomer to be used is usually 50 wt % or less, preferably 20 wt % or less, and more preferably 10 wt % or less to the total amount of the cycloolefin monomer and the linear olefin monomer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While the molecular weight of the cycloolefin polymer may be suitably selected in accordance with the purpose of use, it is usually in a range of 1,000 to 1,000,000, preferably 5,000 to 500,000, and more preferably 10,000 to 100,000 as weight-average molecular weight corresponding to polystyrene to be measured by gel permeation chromatography (eluant; tetrahydrofuran).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">(Curing Agent)</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The curable resin composition and the polymerizable composition of the present invention contains, as a curing agent, cyclic peroxide which has a cyclic structure and a peroxy structure in the cyclic structure. The curing agent is a compound capable of inducing a curing (cross-linking) reaction in the molded article to be obtained etc. By using such cyclic peroxide, the molded article and the prepreg to be obtained can be superior in laminatability and the laminate to be obtained can be small in dielectric loss at high frequency bands.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As such cyclic peroxide, for example, 3,3,5,7,7-pentamethyl-1,2,4-trioxepane (one-minute half-life temperature being 205&#xb0; C.), 3,6,9-triethyl-3,6,9-trimethyl-1,4,7-triperoxonan (one-minute half-life temperature being 190&#xb0; C.), and 3,6-diethyl-3,6-dimethyl-1,2,4,5-tetroxane (one-minute half-life temperature being 167&#xb0; C.) etc. may be mentioned to be preferable examples.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the one-minute half-life temperature of cyclic peroxide to be used in the present invention may be suitably selected in accordance with the type of cyclic peroxide and the use condition, it is usually in a range of 50&#xb0; C. to 350&#xb0; C., preferably 150&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C., and more preferably 180&#xb0; C. to 230&#xb0; C. One-minute half-life temperature herein is the temperature where the half of cyclic peroxide decomposes during one minute. It is preferred that one-minute half-life temperature is within such ranges because the laminatability and the decreasing of the dielectric loss are significantly highly balanced in the laminate to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Such cyclic peroxide may be used alone or in combinations of two or more types, and the amount to be used is usually in a range of 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.5 to 5 parts by weight with respect to the cycloolefin polymer as 100 parts by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">(Curable Resin Composition)</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The curable resin composition of the present invention contains the above cycloolefin polymer and cyclic peroxide as essential components, and in accordance with need, filler, anti-aging agent, curing aid and other compounding agents etc. may be added thereto.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">(Prepreg)</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The prepreg of the present invention is obtained by impregnating the curable resin composition of the present invention into a reinforcing fiber. Although the production method of the prepreg is not particularly limited and any known methods in the art may be adopted, for example, a method through dissolving or dispersing the curable resin composition into a solvent and impregnating it into the reinforcing fiber thereafter drying the solvent may be mentioned. As the solvent, similar one as for producing the above molded article may be used herein. The amount of the solvent to be used may be suitably selected in accordance with the amount of cycloolefin polymer and the type of the reinforcing fiber etc.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">While the type of the reinforcing fiber to be used in the present invention is not particularly limited, for example, PET (polyethylene terephthalate) fiber, aramid fiber, super-macro-molecule polyethylene fiber, polyamide (nylon) fiber, liquid crystalline polyester fiber, and other organic fibers; glass fiber, carbon fiber, alumina fiber, tungsten fiber, molybdenum fiber, bdenum fiber, titanium fiber, steel fiber, boron fiber, silicon carbide fiber, silica fiber, and other inorganic fibers; etc. may be mentioned. Among them, organic fiber and glass fiber are preferable, aramid fiber, liquid crystalline polyester fiber and glass fiber are particularly preferable. As the glass fiber, fiber of E-glass, NE-glass, S-glass, D-glass and H-glass etc. may be used preferably.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As the glass fiber, it is preferred to use a glass cloth. Preferred glass cloth is obtained through bundling glass filaments with diameters of 1 to 10 &#x3bc;m to form strands, twisting the strands to form glass threads (referred to as &#x201c;glass yarns&#x201d;), and weaving up them. In addition, the thickness of the glass cloth is usually in a range of 5 to 200 &#x3bc;m, preferably 10 to 150 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m, and particularly preferably 20 to 80 &#x3bc;m. If the thickness is thinner than such ranges, the strength of the laminate to be obtained tends to become lower, and if the thickness is thicker than such ranges, it tends to difficult to control the thickness at the time of laminating.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Such reinforcing fibers may be used alone or in combinations of two or more types, and the amount thereof to be used is suitably selected in accordance with the purpose of use such that the containing amount of the reinforcing fiber in the prepreg to be obtained becomes to be usually in a range of 10 to 90 wt %, preferably 20 to 80 wt %, and more preferably 30 to 70 wt %. It is preferred that the containing amount of the reinforcing fiber is within such ranges because the improvement of mechanical strength and the reduction of dielectric loss are highly balanced in the laminate to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">More preferably as the production method of the prepreg of the present invention, there may be mentioned a production method through impregnating the polymerizable composition which contains cycloolefin monomer, polymerization catalyst and cyclic peroxide into the reinforcing fiber and thereafter polymerizing. The type, the amount and the like of each component to be used for the polymerizable composition is similar to those for the polymerizable composition to be used in producing the above mentioned molded article of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Impregnating of the polymerizable composition into the reinforcing fiber may be performed through, for example, applying a certain amount of the polymerizable composition onto the reinforcing fiber by spray coat method, dip coat method, roll coat method, curtain coat method, dye coat method, slit coat method, or other known methods in the art, if required overlapping a protecting film thereon, and pressing them from the upper side by a roller or the like. By heating the impregnated material to a certain temperature after impregnating the polymerizable composition into the reinforcing fiber, it is possible to bulk polymerize the polymerizable composition thereby obtaining a sheet shaped or film shaped prepreg.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The impregnating may be also performed in a mold. In this case, the impregnating is performed through placing the reinforcing fiber in the mold and pouring the polymerizable compound into the mold. According to this method, it is possible to obtain a prepreg in arbitrary shape. As the shape thereof, sheet shape, film shape, columnar shape, cylindrical shape and polygonal columnar shape etc. may be mentioned. As the mold to be used herein, a molding tool known in the art, for example, the split mold structure i.e. a molding tool having a core mold and a cavity mold may be used, and the polymerizable composition is poured into the space area (cavity) therebetween, and bulk polymerizing. The core mold and the cavity mold are prepared so as to form the space area matching the form of the prepreg intended to be produced. In addition, the shape, material and size etc. of the molding tool are not particularly restricted. Alternatively, sheet shaped or film shaped prepreg may be obtained through preparing plate shaped molding tools such as glass plates, metal plates and the like and a spacer which has a certain thickness, pouring the polymerizable composition into a space formed by such two plate shaped molding tools between which the spacer intervenes, and curing the polymerizable composition in the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The polymerizable composition is of lower viscosity than polymer varnish obtained by dissolving epoxy resin and the like into a solvent, which is used in the art, thereby being superior in impregnation property to a reinforcing fiber. Therefore, it is possible to homogeneously impregnating the resin to be obtained through polymerization into the reinforcing fiber. Therefore, the laminate to be obtained by using the prepreg of the present invention is capable of providing uniform electrical properties. That is, by using the polymerizable composition for producing a prepreg, it is enabled to homogeneously impregnating the composition into the reinforcing fibers and there remains scarcely solvent in the prepreg to be obtained, and therefore, by using the prepreg of the present invention, it is possible to obtain the laminate having uniformity in electrical properties, especially in dielectric loss without varying by location.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In either one of the above methods, temperature, time and other conditions for polymerizing the polymerizable composition are similar to those for producing the above mentioned molded article of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">While the thickness of the prepreg of the present invention is suitably selected in accordance with the purpose of use, it is usually in a range of 0.001 to 10 mm, preferably 0.01 to 1 mm, and more preferably 0.02 to 0.5 mm. It is preferred that the thickness is within such ranges because the dilution performance at the time of laminating, and the mechanical strength, and the toughness of the laminate to be obtained by curing are to be sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">(Laminate)</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The laminate of the first embodiment of the present invention is obtained by laminating the above mentioned molded article of the present invention with other material A other than the molded article and thereafter curing. In addition, the laminate of the second embodiment of the present invention is obtained by laminating two or more of the above mentioned prepregs of the present invention with one another or laminating the prepreg of the present invention with other material B other than the prepreg and thereafter curing.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The above other material A and other material B may be the same with or different from each other. While the other material A or B to be laminated is suitably selected in accordance with the purpose of use, for example, thermoplastic resin material, metal material, and circuit board etc. may be mentioned. Among them, as the other material A in the first embodiment, it is preferred to use a circuit board especially. Also, as the other material B in the second embodiment, it is preferred to use a metal material especially. In addition, from the viewpoint of improving the adhesive property between the resin layer and the metal material layer, it is preferred that the surface of the metal material is treated with silane coupling agent, thiol based coupling agent, titanate based coupling agent, or various types of adhesives etc. Among them, the metal material treated with silane coupling agent is more preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Although the roughness degree (Rz) of layer surface of the metal material at the adhesive interface between the prepreg of the present invention and the metal material is not particularly limited, it is usually 10 &#x3bc;m or less, preferably 5 &#x3bc;m or less, more preferably 3 &#x3bc;m or less, and furthermore preferably 2 &#x3bc;m or less. On the other hand, while the lower limit of the roughness degree is not particularly limited, it is usually 10 nm or more, preferably 5 nm or more, and more preferably 1 nm or more. It is preferred that the roughness degree of layer surface of the metal material is within such ranges because noises, occurring of delays and transmission losses etc. in high frequency transmission are suppressed. The adjustment for the roughness degree of layer surface of the metal material is easily achieved through selecting a metal material to be laminated of which the roughness degree is within a required range and using the selected material. Metal material having such roughness degree is available as marketed products. Note that the roughness degree (Rz) is measurable by an AFM (atomic force microscope).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As the metal material, materials to be generally used for circuit boards may be used without any restriction, and metal foil is usually used and copper foil is preferably used. While the thickness of the metal material is suitably selected in accordance with the purpose of use, it is usually in a range of 1 to 50 &#x3bc;m, preferably 3 to 30 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 5 to 20 &#x3bc;m, and most preferably 5 to 15 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In each of the above embodiments, the methods for laminating and curing are enough to be in line with ordinary methods, and method of performing heat presses by using roll laminator, pressing machine known in the art having press frame mold for flat plate molding, or press molding machines for sheet mold compound (SMC) or bulk mold compound (BMC) etc. may be mentioned, for example. The heating temperature is a temperature where the cross-linking by the above cyclic peroxide occurs, and is usually a temperature of the one-minute half-life temperature of the above cyclic peroxide or more, preferably 5&#xb0; C. or more higher than the one-minute half-life temperature thereof, and more preferably 10&#xb0; C. or more higher than the one-minute half-life temperature thereof. Such temperature is usually in a range of 100&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C., and preferably 150&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C. The heating time is in a range of 0.1 to 180 minutes, preferably 1 to 120 minutes, and more preferably 2 to 20 minutes. The pressing pressure is usually in a range of 0.1 to 20 MPa, preferably 0.1 to 10 MPa, and more preferably 1 to 5 MPa. Alternatively, the heat pressing may be performed in vacuum or reduced pressure atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Thus obtained laminate of the present invention is with less transmission loss at high frequency bands thereby to be used widely and preferably as a high frequency board material.</p>
