<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, various aluminate phosphors have been put into practical use as PDP phosphors. For example, as a blue phosphor, BaMgAl<sub>10</sub>O<sub>17</sub>:Eu is used, and as a green phosphor, (Y, Gd)Al<sub>3</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Tb is used as a mixture with Zn<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>:Mn.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, when a mixture of (Y, Gd)Al<sub>3</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Tb and Zn<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>:Mn or Zn<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>:Mn is used as a green phosphor, the decay time becomes long. Therefore, in the case where a rapidly moving video is displayed, so-called &#x201c;tailing&#x201d; occurs, which degrades the moving image display characteristics in a PDP. Further, particularly in a 3D-PDP capable of expressing a stereoscopic video, when the decay time of a phosphor to be used becomes long, there arises a problem in that a satisfactory stereoscopic image cannot be displayed due to moving image crosstalk in which a left eye image and a right eye image switched to be displayed in a short period of time overlap each other. Therefore, in a PDP application, there is a strong demand for a green phosphor whose decay time is short.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In contrast, as a green phosphor, a technology using Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce whose decay time is remarkably short has been proposed (see Patent Document 1).</p>

<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, according to the above-mentioned conventional technology, the luminance decreases although the decay time of a green phosphor can be shortened. Further, a Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce phosphor has poor color purity, compared with a Zn<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>:Mn phosphor or a (Y, Gd)Al<sub>3</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Tb phosphor, and hence, it is necessary to improve color purity in order to display a satisfactory image through use of a PDP.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Hereinafter, as one embodiment of a PDP disclosed in the present application, a configuration of an exemplary alternating current surface discharge type PDP is described.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective cross-sectional view showing a main structure of an alternating current surface discharge type PDP according to the present embodiment. Regarding the PDP described as the present embodiment, a specific configuration, size, etc. of each portion are shown on the basis of a 42-inch display screen of 1,024&#xd7;768 pixels. Needless to say, a PDP of the present embodiment may have other sizes and specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a PDP <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment includes a front panel <b>20</b> and a back panel <b>26</b>, which are arranged so that the respective principal planes are opposed to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The front panel <b>20</b> includes a front panel glass <b>21</b> as a front substrate, display electrodes (X electrodes <b>23</b>, Y electrodes <b>22</b>) in a band shape provided on one principal plane of the front panel glass <b>21</b>, a front-side dielectric layer <b>24</b> with a thickness of 30 &#x3bc;m covering the display electrodes, and a protective layer <b>25</b> with a thickness of about 1.0 &#x3bc;m provided on the front-side dielectric layer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The display electrode includes a band-shaped transparent electrode <b>220</b> (<b>230</b>) with a thickness of 0.1 &#x3bc;m and a width of 150 &#x3bc;m and a bus line <b>221</b> (<b>231</b>) with a thickness of 7 &#x3bc;m and a width of 95 &#x3bc;m provided so as to overlap the transparent electrode. Further, each pair of display electrodes (X electrode <b>23</b>, Y electrode <b>22</b>) is arranged in a plural number in a y-axis direction, with an x-axis direction being a longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, each pair of display electrodes (X electrode <b>23</b>, Y electrode <b>22</b>) is electrically connected to a panel driving circuit (not shown) in the vicinity of ends in a right-left direction (y-axis direction) of the front panel glass <b>21</b>. The Y electrodes <b>22</b> are connected to the panel driving circuit in a collective manner, and the X electrodes <b>23</b> are respectively independently connected to the panel driving circuit. When the Y electrode <b>22</b> and a given electrode <b>23</b> are supplied with electricity through use of the panel driving circuit, surface discharge (sustain discharge) occurs in a gap (about 80 &#x3bc;m) between the X electrode <b>23</b> and the Y electrode <b>22</b>. The X electrode <b>23</b> also can be operated as a scan electrode, whereby writing discharge (address discharge) is allowed to occur between the X electrode <b>23</b> and address electrodes <b>28</b> (described later).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The back panel <b>26</b> includes a back panel glass <b>27</b> as a back substrate, a plurality of address electrodes <b>28</b>, a back side dielectric layer <b>29</b>, partition walls <b>30</b>, and phosphor layers <b>31</b> to <b>33</b> corresponding to any of red (R), green (G), and blue (B). The phosphor layers <b>31</b> to <b>33</b> are provided in contact with side walls of the two adjacent partition walls <b>30</b> and the back side dielectric layer <b>29</b> between the side walls so that the y-axis direction becomes a longitudinal direction. Further, a plurality of groups of the phosphor layers <b>31</b> to <b>33</b> is arranged repeatedly in the x-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The green phosphor layer (G) is configured so as to contain 30% by weight or more and 60% by weight or less of a phosphor represented by a general formula: dZnO.(2&#x2212;d)MnO.eSiO<sub>2 </sub>(1.80&#x2266;d&#x2266;1.90, 1.00&#x2266;e&#x2266;1.02), and one of a phosphor represented by a general formula: aYO<sub>3/2</sub>.(3&#x2212;a)CeO<sub>3/2</sub>.bAlO<sub>3/2</sub>.cGaO<sub>3/2</sub>.fWO<sub>3 </sub>(2.80&#x2266;a&#x2266;2.99, 3.00&#x2266;b&#x2266;5.00, 0&#x2266;c&#x2266;2.00, 0.003&#x2266;f&#x2266;0.020, where 4.00&#x2266;b+c&#x2266;5.00) and a phosphor represented by a general formula: aYO<sub>3/2</sub>.(3&#x2212;a)CeO<sub>3/2</sub>.bAlO<sub>3/2</sub>.cGaO<sub>3/2</sub>.gK<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4 </sub>(2.80&#x2266;a&#x2266;2.99, 3.00&#x2266;b&#x2266;5.00, 0&#x2266;c&#x2266;2.00, 0.003&#x2266;g&#x2266;0.015, where 4.00&#x2266;b+c&#x2266;5.00). Further, the red phosphor layer (R) and the blue phosphor layer (B) are respectively formed of general phosphors. For example, as a red phosphor, Y(P, V)O<sub>4</sub>:Eu and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Eu or (Y, Gd)BO<sub>3</sub>:Eu can be used, and as a blue phosphor, BaMgAl<sub>10</sub>O<sub>17</sub>:Eu can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each phosphor layer can be formed by coating the partition walls <b>30</b> and the back side dielectric layer <b>29</b> with phosphor ink in which phosphor particles are dissolved, for example, by a known coating method such as a meniscus method or a line-jet method, followed by drying and firing (for example, 10 minutes at 500&#xb0; C.).

The following description is made merely for the purpose of illustrating a method for producing a green phosphor, and the method for producing a green phosphor disclosed in the present application is not limited to the method described below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As materials, compounds that become oxides by sintering, such as a hydroxide, a carbonate, and a nitrate of high purity (purity: 99% or more) containing elements constituting a green phosphor to be used, or oxides of high purity (purity: 99% or more) can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, in order to accelerate a reaction, it is preferred that a small amount of a fluoride (aluminum fluoride, etc.) or a chloride (zinc chloride, etc.) be added.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A phosphor is produced by mixing the above-mentioned materials, followed by sintering, and as a method for mixing the materials, wet mixing in a solution or dry mixing of dry powder may be used. Well-known agitation and mixing means, generally used industrially, such as a ball mill, a medium agitation mill, a planetary mill, a vibrating mill, a jet mill, a V-type mixer, and an agitator can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A method for sintering mixed powder varies depending upon a composition system of a phosphor. Of the first phosphors constituting the green phosphor layer in the present embodiment, a phosphor represented by the general formula: aYO<sub>3/2</sub>.(3&#x2212;a)CeO<sub>3/2</sub>.bAlO<sub>3/2</sub>.cGaO<sub>3/2</sub>.fWO<sub>3 </sub>is sintered in a temperature range of 1,200&#xb0; C. to 1,400&#xb0; C. for about 1 to 50 hours in an atmosphere of a given oxygen partial pressure formed by nitrogen gas or carbon dioxide gas containing 0 to 50% by volume of nitrogen. The second phosphor constituting the green phosphor layer in the present embodiment is sintered in a temperature range of 1,100&#xb0; C. to 1,300&#xb0; C. for 1 to 10 hours in carbon dioxide containing 0 to 50% by volume of nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the case of the phosphor represented by the general formula: aYO<sub>3/2</sub>.(3&#x2212;a)CeO<sub>3/2</sub>.bAlO<sub>3/2</sub>.cGaO<sub>3/2</sub>.gK<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4 </sub>used as the first phosphor, first, the phosphor is sintered in a temperature range of 1,100&#xb0; C. to 1,300&#xb0; C. for about 1 to 50 hours in the atmosphere, and further is sintered in a temperature range of 1,200&#xb0; C. to 1,400&#xb0; C. for about 1 to 50 hours in an atmosphere of a given oxygen partial pressure formed by nitrogen gas or carbon dioxide containing 0 to 50% by volume of nitrogen.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As described above, the green phosphor layer used in the PDP disclosed in the present application uses, as the first phosphor, the phosphor represented by the general formula: aYO<sub>3/2</sub>.(3&#x2212;a)CeO<sub>3/2</sub>.bAlO<sub>3/2</sub>.cGaO<sub>3/2</sub>.fWO<sub>3 </sub>or the phosphor represented by the general formula: aYO<sub>3/2</sub>.(3&#x2212;a)CeO<sub>3/2</sub>.bAlO<sub>3/2</sub>.cGaO<sub>3/2</sub>.gK<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>, and contains, as the second phosphor, 30% by weight or more and 60% by weight or less of the phosphor represented by the general formula: dZnO.(2&#x2212;d)MnO.eSiO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, compared with a PDP including, as a green phosphor layer, a phosphor layer using a conventional green phosphor such as Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce, the PDP disclosed in the present application can include a green phosphor layer having a short decay time, which also can be applied to a 3D-PDP having high luminance, high color purity, and high efficiency, and being capable of expressing a stereoscopic video.</p>

Above all, in the phosphors (Sample Nos. 20 to 23) whose composition ratios are within the range of the composition of 2.97&#x2266;a&#x2266;2.99, luminance is particularly high.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The phosphor samples that are examples of Sample Nos. 19 to 23 were pulse-irradiated with vacuum ultraviolet rays having a wavelength of 146 nm in vacuum, and the time during which emission intensity in a visible area is attenuated to 1/10 ( 1/10 decay time) was measured. As a result, it was confirmed that afterglow characteristics were excellent (0.5 milliseconds or less) in any of the phosphor samples.</p>
